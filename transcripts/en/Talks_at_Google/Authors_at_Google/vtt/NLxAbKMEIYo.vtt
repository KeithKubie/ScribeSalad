00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:02.069
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.050
Alright, what a crowd, this is awesome.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.940
Iím Winnie Lam and itís my pleasure to host
our guest, Premal Shah who is the president

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.050
of Kiva, to Google today.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.370
And Gary Briggs is from Google and heís gonna
be hosting the fireside chat but I guess weíre

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.630
kind of missing the fire.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.450
I mean, the fireís in them.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.021
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Anyway, let me tell you about

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.021
Premal.

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:25.550
So, Premal is the president of Kiva.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.080
He first dreamed of internet microfinance
back in 2004 when he was working at PayPal.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.550
And so, at that time, he took a three month
leave and developed the internet microfinance

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.629
concept in India.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:44.420
Well, he came back, didnít go back to PayPal
and he came back, quit his job at PayPal and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.640
launched Kiva thereafter.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.469
And today Kiva raises over a million dollars
every single week to help the working poor

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.380
in 60 countries, very impressive.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.960
For Premalís accomplishments as a social
entrepreneur, he was named a young global

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.640
leader by World Economic Forum and selected
to Fortune Magazineís top 40 under 40 in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
2009.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.159
Now let me tell you interesting things about
Premal.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.729
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So, Premal has been known to

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.360
do the worm dance in weddings.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.380
So, maybe, if weíre lucky we can, okay, during
the Q and A one of you have gotta ask him

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.380
to do a demo.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.990
Okay, I didnít tell you about this beforehand,
sorry.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.229
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Anyway, so Gary is doing the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.660
chat with Premal today and most recently Gary
is the, Googleís Vice President of Consumer

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.479
Marketing.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.200
And one of Garyís roles prior to coming to
Google was at PayPal where he headed up the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.350
global marketing team.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.240
And, in fact, it was in the hallways where
Premal and Gary first talked about Kiva.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.630
So, without further ado, please help me give
a really warm welcome to Premal Shah and Gary

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.930
Briggs.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.230
[Applause]

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.430
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Hi everybody.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.020
Iíll just go through, what weíll do is Iíll
ask Premal a series of questions over the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.160
next kind of 40 minutes or so and then weíll
take questions at the end.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.430
So, hopefully weíll licit some discussion
at the end.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.300
I also know Premal a little bit, as Winnie
was saying, and heís a pretty humble guy

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.040
so it was exactly the reaction I expected
from you when she started talking about your

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.890
background, youíre like looking down, right?

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Shucks!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.050
So, Winnie told a little bit about the story
of how you got started but I do remember there

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.080
was a lot of discussion about the beginnings
of microfinance in the hallways and then you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.090
just, you just had this fire about getting
started.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.660
So talk about the early bid of getting started.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.700
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Sure, sure.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.940
Well, thanks everyone for making the time
in the middle of your day to come here.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.190
And, you know, one thing I wanted to talk
about is something Iím sure everyone in the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.910
room and everyone who is kind of watching
feels which is, at one point in your life

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.350
you may have had an experience with poverty.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.200
And, for me, I was raised in a middle class
family in Minnesota, in the suburbs of Minnesota.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.570
And when I was 5 years old my parents brought
me back to India for the first time.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.400
And, you know, there is a, there is a memory,
for me, that really affected me which was

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.730
I was walking through a village, thereís
this town Dabhoi which is in Gujarat, the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.730
state of Gujarat.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.620
And itís where my father was raised and it
was rainy season and the streets were pretty

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.900
muddy and we were in a market.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.560
And I was holding on to my momís hand and
my mom gave me a one paise coin to hold onto

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.430
and we were walking through and it was a little
muddy and I dropped the one paise coin in

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.940
the mud and my mom pulled me away saying,
ìOh, itís dirty.î And within seconds, a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.770
woman who was older than my mom, in a ragged
sari,uh, walked over, leaned over very slowly,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.430
picked up the coin from that mud and then
pointed, you know, looked up at the sky and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.410
thanked God for finding this one paise coin.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.580
And, you know, as a 5 year old, youíve witnessed
this experience of what is such little money

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.900
for my mom and what answers the prayers for
someone else.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.340
Itís this very confusing thing about the
world today, the inequality, the indignity

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.510
of poverty.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.450
And I know all of us have probably had an
experience very personal with it.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.880
And for me, I think, from that time, kind
of fast forward 15 years later I was in college

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.990
and I wanted to do something in India, I didnít
know what it was and I was an economics major

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.400
at Stanford and I put together this slide
and I just wanna show it to you guys cause

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.290
I feel like a lot of us are in different places
of our journey.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.160
One of the most common questions I get is,
ìHow did you end up at Kiva?î and, so, I

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.550
wanted to show this thing because this really,
I think, shows the kind of up and down path.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.080
So, on a graph here, I charted my kind of
level of aliveness over time starting at the

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.250
age of 20 to basically today.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.640
So, it started with sophomore slump and I
discovered microfinance in a class.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.800
And what I loved about microfinance was it
was a business approach to poverty alleviation

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.850
and Iím a huge believer in the markets.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.370
I just donít think the markets always work
for the poor.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.270
So, when I heard about what Muhammad Yunus
had done and this, kind of, incredible invention

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.590
called microfinance, I tried to direct all
my studies towards that.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.060
And I was lucky enough to get a research grant
from the university to go and study at the

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.010
Self Employed Womenís Association which is
a large microfinance institution in Ahmedabad,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.210
India and its seven hundred thousand members
and they do incredible work.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.520
And then, like a lot of people are graduating
in '98, I became a management consultant in

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520
New York.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.030
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I donít know anyone who would
put management consultant at the top.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.030
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.030
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Exactly.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.030
It was completely

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.030
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I was, like, on the same chart
at one point.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.450
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: The only validating thing about
being a management consultant is you can create

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.020
killer charts like this, I feel like.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: But, you know, I donít wanna

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.430
bag on it too much but it wasnít for me.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.820
And luckily, and Iím sure a lot of you guys
are here for the same reason, I was lucky

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.010
enough to join a company that was doing incredible
things with technology.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.370
So I was an early employee over at PayPal.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.430
And you know how fun it is to build things
that millions and millions of people use and

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.930
really value.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.680
And you guys feel this every day and itís
the most incredible company out there here

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680
at Google.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.650
And, so, it was so fun and so enjoyable and
I learned so much about the revolutionary

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.080
power of technology, to connect people, to
create opportunity.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.310
And we were acquired by eBay but at some point
I experienced burn out and I really wanna

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.820
put this out there cause I donít know where
everyone is at with their journey but, certainly,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.820
I hit it.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.270
And for me it was that 3 month sabbatical
that Winnie was talking about that absolutely

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.300
changed my life when I went back to India.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.669
And thatís where I was testing the idea of,
hey could you make a microloan to someone

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:18.680
over the internet?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.522
And it was when I came back, thatís when
I ran into you, Gary, in the hallway and we

00:07:22.522 --> 00:07:25.520
were trying to brainstorm names.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.960
Gary and I didnít actually work together
in the same group but I knew he was like a

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.020
consumer marketing genius and we had like
a list of a hundred names that weíre trying

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.080
to figure out what we should call this website
that allows you to make microloans to each

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080
other.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.830
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: You were telling me one of
the ones earlier when we were talking about

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.950
one of the ones you didnít go with which
I thought was pretty funny.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.300
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, the leading name that
we had was grassroots capital dot org

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.389
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And I loved it cause it describes

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:52.260
what Kiva does.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.710
But then a friend of mine said, ìOh yea,
grassroots capital?

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.889
Yeah, legalize it.î
[Laughter]

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:02.540
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And so then I could never get
that image of smoking grassroots capital out

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.680
of my head.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680
So it killed that name.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680
[Laughter]

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: You would have had the logo
like that.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yes.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.680
Exactly, exactly.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
[Laughter]

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.620
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So, on this chart which is
quite good by the way

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.620
[Laughter]

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.620
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Thanks.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.660
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Very well done.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.660
Yeah.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.350
Oh my God itís working, so the early days
if you kind of go through it, itís not all

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.270
up and to the right, I mean, people write
about those stories, itís never up and to

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.620
the right, right away but also when you started
to see it was working, what started happening

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
in the early, early days?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.890
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, so I remember I left
PayPal and Matt Flannery, the co-founder of

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.979
Kiva, left his job at TiVo, he was in computer
programming and he jokes about heís pausing

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:45.290
live TV and getting really good at that and
he had an experience in Uganda that transformed

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.290
his life.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.210
And, so, weíre, we both quit our jobs, weíre
both volunteering trying to kind of nurture

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:56.620
Kiva and I remember when he typed in Kiva
into Google, the top result was a spa in Santa

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620
Cruz.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.940
Like, it was completely, we used Google Analytics
really early on and maybe only a hundred people

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.730
would be coming to the website, probably looking
for the spa.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.550
Only 2 or 3 would actually make a loan on
the website.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:15.180
So, it wasnít looking very good, in fact,
I looked in the database early on to see if

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.700
my parents had used the website.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And even they hadnít used

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.460
it.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.820
They were so pissed that I left like a good
career job at PayPal

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: for like a non-profit and they

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.790
were pissed I wasnít a doctor, actually.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.480
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Hopefully they hadnít told
you that they had used it.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: And then you checked the data

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
and they hadnít.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.830
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.510
So when you get something started itís really
hard to get the traction.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:40.790
And the moment that kind of changed everything
was about a year into our existence.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.070
We were volunteers for about 7 months and
then we knew we had to start putting people

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.500
on to healthcare and at least paying some
kind of living wage.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.660
So about a year into our existence we had
about a month left of kind of cash in the

00:09:52.660 --> 00:10:02.110
bank, it was about 5 people and, uh, and in
October 2006 absolutely changed the course

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:08.279
of Kiva which was, in that month, Muhammad
Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:13.240
work in microfinance, heís the founder of
the Grameen Bank, they reach over 6 million

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.870
families in Bangladesh with loans and savings
and insurance and a variety of services.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.490
Just an incredible, heís a saint and heís
walking on the planet today.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.580
And then two weeks later we were on PBS Frontline
World which is this 15 minute documentary

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:33.290
that they created about Kiva and it was on
Halloween night, weíre sitting there, I remember

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.810
weíre looking at Google Analytics, weíre
gonna watch the traffic, you know, try to

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.680
go up, and weíre sitting there in our Halloween
costumes

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And it hits on the East Coast

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.260
and all the sudden the traffic goes down to
0 and what happens is our site crashed

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.521
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Cause we were on this 22 dollar

00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:51.330
a month server plan, you know?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And it was so painful for the

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.950
next 4 days our site couldnít get back up.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.530
But, of course, on the internet when your
site crashes it actually builds the meme.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.530
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.710
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So that, right there, more
than anything and, in fact, one of our engineers,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.510
he basically put up a little PayPal button
that said, ìYouíve melted our servers, help

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.790
us buy new ones.î
[Laughter]

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.790
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Wow.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.580
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, we raised 130,000 dollars
from the internet community

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.100
[Gasps]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And thatís what allowed us

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.060
to get everyone on healthcare, actually do
real due diligence on these organizations

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.500
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: around the planet and get off

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.881
the 22 dollar a month server plan
[Laughter]

00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:28.480
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So that was that moment in
time that then, from that point, you know,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.060
um, things really started taking off

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.060
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.060
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: and people, the word started
spreading.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.060
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.630
I have to admit I was imaging you four days
in your Halloween costume, running around

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.630
trying to make the server work.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.630
[Laughter]

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.630
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: I was in a penguin costume
and

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.630
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: A penguin costume?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.630
Thatís pretty good.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.630
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And it was pretty ridiculous.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.630
[Laughter]

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.920
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So we should, I donít know
how many, if everyone knows exactly how Kiva

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.100
works and you mentioned about Grameen and
a little bit of microfinance.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.150
How does it work, how do you even get started?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.480
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Sure, just by show of hands
how many of you folks have made a loan on

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480
Kiva?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
Awesome!

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Wow.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.930
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: How many of you actually have
money sitting in your Kiva accounts that you

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.560
have to respend or relend to someone?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.580
Okay, thereís about 25 million dollars sitting
in peopleís Kiva accounts that could be in

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.680
the hands of the working poor.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.590
So, just keep coming back and relending that
money.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.250
And weíve just built an auto loan feature
that allows you to automatically deploy it.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.100
But I wanna walk through the user experience
of the website for those of you who havenít

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.240
used it.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:29.260
So, essentially, you come to the website and
you can go to our lend tab and, essentially,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.089
we feature some loans across the top, like,
group loans, um, that typically go to poorer

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.399
microfinance clients.

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:43.459
Right now weíre featuring Arab youth loans,
they tend to be slower to fund sometimes on

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:44.459
our website.

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:47.360
We find that women fund faster than men.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:57.300
Anyway, you can sift through, and, the site
and, I donít know, letís pick TÈlÈ in

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.610
Togo who wants a thousand dollars to purchase
beverages.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:10.890
And, so basically what you can do is read
a little bit about TÈlÈ.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:17.220
Sheís posted by a Kiva field partner, and
this is what we do, Kiva is a non-profit organization

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.779
based in San Francisco.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:23.899
We have about 90 staff members around the
world and a big part of what we do is we go

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:33.160
and find organizations like WAGES, here, and
we basically look at their social performance,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.950
their work in the community and we give them
some kind of public badging and then we assign

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.660
them a risk rating.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:46.580
So 1 to 5 star risk rating, if youíre a 5
star organization you can raise over a million

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.400
dollars from the internet community on the
platform, if youíre one star we start you

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.470
off at 25,000 dollars.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.080
So itís a way of basically allowing these
organizations, weíre giving them visibility

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.710
and voice to basically raise money so they
can reach more entrepreneurs in their community.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.370
So theyíre the real heroes at Kiva.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.440
Theyíre the ones who are doing the hard work
every single day on the ground in over 60

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440
countries.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.340
So theyíve been on the Kiva platform for
50 months and theyíve posted up nearly four

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.820
thousand entrepreneurs onto the website.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.459
Anyways, oh, and we use Google Maps right
here and you can kind of see where people

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:28.800
from around the world have lent to this borrower.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:37.860
So, anyways, the way it works is, itís pretty
simple, you can lend 25 dollars or more and

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:44.030
if you hit lend 25 one of the big questions
that we often get is, ìHow does Kiva pay

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:49.420
for the rent and for salaries?î About 60
percent of how we make our money is through

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.420
tips.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.040
So, like, when you go to a restaurant you
tip a waiter an extra 15 percent, we ask you

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.710
to kind of throw in an extra 15 percent on
top of your 25 dollar loan.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:09.450
And, on average, you know, we get about 7
percent, so about half the people stiff us.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:17.160
But, you know, itís those tips as well as
kind of donations from foundations, corporations

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.900
and individuals that allow us to kind of expand
into some of the hardest to reach places on

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.140
the planet.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.149
And then a cool thing about Kiva is that itís
a loan not a donation.

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:31.990
And usually every month, so the average loan
term on Kiva is about 10 months and you get

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.890
paid back in monthly installments.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.670
So, if you lend 25 dollars youíll get 2 dollars
and 50 cents emailed back to you every month

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.800
and that lands in your account as Kiva credit
and then once you get 25 dollars back you

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.540
can turn around and withdraw that money or
you can relend it.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.310
Most people choose to relend their money to
another entrepreneur.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.050
So thatís the basics of the Kiva user experience
and then, you know, often times youíll get

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.360
an update on how the entrepreneurís business
is doing.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.450
And itís not always good news, sometimes
businesses fail.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.700
But itís, what we wanna do is try to just
make, give a window into the world and make

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.870
it as accessible and easy as possible.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:16.430
People participate as a business partners
not necessarily as a, you know, Iím your

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.181
benefactor and youíre my beneficiary but
really a partnership relationship.

00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:24.310
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Talk a little bit about, Winnie
had mentioned at the beginning throughput

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.790
for the week but just give a sense of scale
and how many folks are you reaching now?

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:36.300
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Sure, so Kiva today has reached
800,000 small businesses, entrepreneurs, students

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.680
in 62 countries, um, the total amount that
has flowed through the website is about 320

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.800
million dollars in 25 dollar increments from
about 800,000 people on the internet.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.300
So thereís incredible symmetry between the
number of people who are lending on the website

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.630
and the number of people who are borrowing.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.820
Thatís a really cool thing.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.839
80 percent of the loans go to women

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:55.890
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.640
Thatís what you said before.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.779
Itís more women than men.

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:03.840
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, itís more women than
men and thereís a 98.9 repayment rate on

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840
the website.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.189
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Wow, much better than mortgages
in California.

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:08.189
[Laughter]

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:12.309
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, yeah itís, we did a
graph between, I think, the S and P 500 over

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:17.549
the last 5 years and kind of did a Kiva portfolio
and the working poor are outperforming.

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:19.149
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Some other folks.

00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:21.039
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Some other classes, yeah.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:26.329
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So you mentioned when you asked
the group about how many folks had accounts

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.379
with balances and that you had the auto donate
feature, talk a little about some of the features,

00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:32.309
cause you and I were talking about this the
other day that there are some new features

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:33.539
you have on the site.

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:38.980
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, so just to, just to show
a few features on the website.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:45.159
One that Iím really excited about is the
community tab, right, so this, what we realize

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:51.200
is that people doing social good can be a
social experiment or social experience.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.580
One of the things that we kind of built without
really thinking too much about is the ability

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.330
to create your own lending team, for example,
the Atheists and the Christians are the top

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.890
2 lending teams at Kiva
[Laughter]

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.159
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And they compete with each
other, itís incredible.

00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:10.679
The third team is the Milepoints team.

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:13.379
These are people that wanna get credit card
points

00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:16.239
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: by lending on Kiva and getting

00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:17.549
the money back.

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:19.649
And then thereís team Europe
[Laughter]

00:18:19.649 --> 00:18:24.100
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And then the Friends Bob Harris,
this guy, heís beating the Australians.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.919
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So itís really amazing.

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:32.490
Thereís 22,000 teams, thereís over a thousand
schools, 1,300 universities, thereís, I think,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.490
a Google team.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.490
Letís see.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.749
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Itís the moment of truth here.

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:39.299
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Apparently weíre not beating
Bob Harris.

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:43.530
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah we only have 58 members
of the Google team here.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.840
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: But you guys are, yeah, I mean,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.150
itís 40,000 dollars lent.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.809
A lot of Googlers using the website arenít
even aware of the Google team.

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:54.950
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.759
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Consider joining it cause itís
a, kind of, track your progress together as

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:01.409
a community.

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:06.169
The other thing that Gary, you know, that
you pointed out is the auto lending feature.

00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:12.600
Which is basically, I wonít demo it, but
in your ìmy portfolioî page you can kind

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.720
of set a few perimeters, women, women in Uganda,
um, who are in agriculture and then anytime

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.470
a woman from Uganda in agriculture comes on
the website it will automatically deploy that

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.470
money.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.470
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Great.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.100
Any, any, um, you kind of think about some
of the, well one of the things thatís amazing

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:35.269
is the stories that come out from the users
but thereís some incredible even somewhat

00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:36.590
bizarre in some cases, I guess.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.419
But interesting stories of folks and who youíre
reaching.

00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:44.460
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, you know, thereís so
many amazing stories throughout the year and,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.960
I mean, I just love reading through the site
every day.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.809
And I think, when you make a loan to someone
you get to participate in their journey as

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:54.809
a business owner.

00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:59.330
And thereís so many creative ways that people
create a living for themselves.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:05.710
So, one of the things Iím really excited
about is kind of some of the new ways that

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:11.409
our field partners are really trying to help
the under-served.

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:20.859
If this room right now were the country of
Kenya, everyone from right here to here would

00:20:20.859 --> 00:20:26.080
be rural subsistence farmers.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.029
One of the challenges is reaching you with
microfinance.

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:34.609
Itís so far, I mean, if, just imagine the
most rural place youíve been to.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.889
Itís very, very hard and costly to get to
you.

00:20:37.889 --> 00:20:43.559
But then, you know, one of the organizations
that I think is just amazing, weíre working

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:50.070
with this organization called Juhudi Kilimo
and, in fact, a Google employee helped develop

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:55.729
a management information system for this organization,
itís a really progressive org.

00:20:55.729 --> 00:21:00.710
But what they do is they provide a hybrid
cow to farmers.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.239
And a hybrid cow, whatís a hybrid cow?

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:07.299
Well, typically cows in that area deliver
milk once a day; these cows deliver milk twice

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.299
a day.

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:10.070
And often times, itís called asset-based
financing.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.370
So when you lend to a Juhudi Kilimo borrower
on Kiva, instead of the borrower getting money

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.710
theyíll get a cow and usually itís a two
for one where the cow is pregnant.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.399
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So, itís amazing and youíre

00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:23.619
literally right there doubling the farmerís
dairy income, right?

00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:27.790
And itís an incredible intervention and they
offer an insurance service and, I mean, these

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.210
are things that are happening all around the
planet right now.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.210
I mean, another thing

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.869
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: You can't go on next, how does
that work with a hybrid cow?

00:21:34.869 --> 00:21:35.869
[Laughter]

00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:36.869
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: More fuel efficient
[Laughter]

00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:41.279
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So basically itís mixed with
a European strain that is just a higher producing

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:42.279
cow in terms of milk.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.279
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Wow.

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:47.139
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: But since it also has, I guess,
a local strain itís more, I guess

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.320
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Resilient.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.909
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, resilient.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:54.970
So thereís these interventions all around
the planet that make so much sense.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:22:00.299
I mean, we see things with solar power cookers
that can save you, the avoided cost from having

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:03.720
to go and gather wood, to heat and light your
home,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.289
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: The fumes

00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:06.330
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: The fumes

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.330
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: are terrible, yeah.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.169
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: The fumes from kerosene kill
more people every year in the developing world

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:11.169
than malaria.

00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:12.169
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:13.739
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Respiratory illnesses.

00:22:13.739 --> 00:22:16.739
And one in three people live in energy poverty
are completely off the grid.

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:20.769
So thereís real cost, you actually, itís
a poverty penalty when youíre poor.

00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:25.090
You pay more for the basic services that the
middle class and rich have access to.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.789
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: The time it takes to go get
water or the time it takes to or the danger

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:33.140
you run into trying to go get wood, it is
pretty extraordinary.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.429
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Exactly.

00:22:34.429 --> 00:22:40.369
So if you can get patient capital to finance
basically a technology like a solar power

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:45.340
cooker or being able to create a main line
to the direct water source, your avoided cost

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.960
over time would be, youíd be able to make
those monthly payments back.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.840
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Itís, I think the clearest
example here in the U.S. is if the government

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.479
said any vehicle that has over 50 miles per
gallon gets zero percent interest financing

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:05.419
for 30 years, itís like mortgages are 30
years long, so your monthly payments are so

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:10.549
low that itís a no brainer from your fuels
cost savings to actually go and switch over.

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:13.220
More American households would buy Priuses,
etcetera.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.899
And so I think thatís the idea here.

00:23:15.899 --> 00:23:19.029
Beyond just starting small businesses thereís
a lot of costs that people pay that if they

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:25.100
could, in exchange for small monthly payments,
a large lump sum they could buy technology

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.100
that could change their life.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.450
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah, and get back to, yeah,
thatís totally, and the time it benefits

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.450
too.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.499
I mean, so we were talking a little about
it at the beginning and the idea of up and

00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:38.379
to the right, you guys are still a small business,
still out trying to do what you can.

00:23:38.379 --> 00:23:41.620
What are some of the challenges youíre currently
facing in running the company?

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:47.399
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Well, I think, um, the two
biggest challenges, one is, you know, for

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:52.919
anyone thatís read about microfinance in
the last couple years, itís not perfect.

00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:54.879
Itís not a silver bullet.

00:23:54.879 --> 00:24:01.159
Thereís a lot of issues and itís a very
young, itís a promising developing intervention

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:03.210
but it has its limitations.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.379
And one of the things that affects me the
most is, we were just talking about Kenya,

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:11.879
if you live in a rural area the cost of getting
you these loans especially if itís a hundred

00:24:11.879 --> 00:24:16.929
dollars, for this organization to be able
to basically go out on its moped, you know,

00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:21.359
two hours into the village and make a hundred
dollar loan disbursement and then every week

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:26.269
come back in a group meeting and collect a
little bit each time over the next 50 weeks,

00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:28.799
itís very costly if you look at the interest
rates.

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:34.779
And, so, one of the things, you know, I really
struggle with is how do you continue to make

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:37.989
the costs go down for the worldís working
poor?

00:24:37.989 --> 00:24:42.039
Itís not risk based pricing because most
of, we have 98 percent rate

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.039
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Higher repayment rates

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.509
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah we have great repayment
rates.

00:24:44.509 --> 00:24:50.470
Itís, I think, itís, itís around how do
we use technologies to make the credit appraisal

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.529
as well as the disbursement and collection
of cash, how do we address that?

00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:57.190
So thatís one big challenge.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.619
The second big challenge is, you know, while
microfinance today has reached about a 150

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:08.120
million people, so itís pretty successful
in a scale, thereís about 2.5 billion people

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.909
who are left out of the system today.

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:16.070
And if we go on the Kiva website, when I was
showing that kind of lend tab, you see business

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.070
that were expiring.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.840
These are people who in this hour need a few
hundred bucks and theyíll go unfunded on

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840
the website.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.330
And thatís just a reflection of high impact
but underfunded things that are happening

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.330
all over the planet.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.070
This is just a window into that.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.409
And so what I wanna do, now Kiva in the beginning
we kept running out of loans.

00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:38.080
Like every Christmas, youíd log into Kiva
and weíd be out of loans on the website cause

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.759
itís very challenging in low bandwidth environments
to actually get these loans posted.

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:42.950
Now we have too many loans.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:43.950
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.099
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And not enough people coming.

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:48.450
So if youíre ever thinking about trying Kiva,
this is a big reason why Iím here at Google

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.820
today, Iíve never done a talk in 6 years,
I think nowís the time to really get out

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.409
the word and really spread it.

00:25:55.409 --> 00:25:59.769
Then what we do is we send a signal to the
NGOs all around the planet that, you know

00:25:59.769 --> 00:26:04.559
what, the internet community itís, thereís,
itís a real source of patient capital.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:05.559
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:07.749
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And, so, those are kind of
the two big challenges right now.

00:26:07.749 --> 00:26:11.029
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Just cause, we talk a little
bit about this too, but digging into that,

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:15.580
and you mentioned about 80 percent of the
loans were to women, 20 percent were to men.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.710
Are there particular loan types that are more
likely to close than others?

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.019
Do you see patterns?

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:26.999
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: What we see if women fund two
times faster than men on the website.

00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:32.869
The agriculture sector, if youíre, thatís
the fastest to funds sector, transportation

00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:36.109
is the slowest.

00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:41.190
You know, we see, for example, surprisingly,
for example, loans in Iraq were originally

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.479
very popular and now weíve seen those expire
more and more.

00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:48.480
I wonder if itís because itís out of our
consciousness.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.139
So weíre starting to see these patterns and
what we wanna do is just continue to layer

00:26:52.139 --> 00:26:58.110
on more and more pieces of information so
people can make decisions not only with their

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.210
heart but also with their head and then just
get the word out.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.960
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So you mentioned at the very
beginning of things like Frontline, you canít

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.940
have a Frontline documentary every day, but
in terms of getting the word out, it is really

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.940
hard.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:15.940
I mean are there certain tactics that youíve
found that have been more helpful than others?

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.139
Is it, you know, PR?

00:27:17.139 --> 00:27:18.139
Is it AdWords?

00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:21.299
Is it, you know, other people telling other
people?

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:25.799
What works best for you in terms of growing
demand cause, as you mentioned, youíve got

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:26.799
a good supply now?

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:32.629
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, you know, one thing weíve
done that was pretty interesting is Reid Hoffman,

00:27:32.629 --> 00:27:39.740
who is the founder of LinkedIn and heís made
a lot of money recently and

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.249
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And we both worked with him

00:27:41.249 --> 00:27:42.249
at PayPal and

00:27:42.249 --> 00:27:46.129
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I see him on TV all the time
now

00:27:46.129 --> 00:27:47.129
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Heís got a book.

00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:48.870
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, heís on Bloomberg, heís
got his own thing, yeah.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.870
Heís awesome.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.870
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: He's awesome.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.929
So what heís done is heís like, ìLook,
Iím not gonna go and lend 25 dollars to people.î

00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:59.909
He put out a million dollars to the internet
community and we converted that into 40 thousand

00:27:59.909 --> 00:28:02.609
free 25 dollar trials.

00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:06.461
And then we put that out on twitter and said,
ìUse Kiva for free.î And itís even on the

00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:09.840
header of our website right now.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.700
Usually every month, ten thousand people will
try Kiva with their own money, well, in the

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.789
month of March 40 thousand new people tried
Kiva for free.

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:21.950
And hereís the genius of this program, when
someone tries that 25 dollar loan of Reidís

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:27.289
money, theyíll lend it to somebody in Cambodia
and as that woman in Cambodia repays her loan

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:29.109
the money goes back to Reid.

00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:32.039
So Reidís real cost is the default rate on
Kiva.

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:37.139
So, although heís gen, you know, mobilized
a million dollars and 40 thousand new people,

00:28:37.139 --> 00:28:40.159
his real cost will only be able 10 thousand
or 11 thousand dollars.

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:44.359
Already 12 percent have put in their own money
and will probably recycle it over and over

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:45.359
and over.

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:50.299
So, those are some things, but I think itís
just an all out effort at building awareness

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:51.340
about any cause.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.960
What weíre trying to do is actually create
a single brand and then behind whatís happening

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.879
is thereís many NGOs and theyíre working
in many different communities.

00:28:59.879 --> 00:29:03.330
And instead of having them spend money building
their own brand, building their own technologies

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.869
to fund-raise, letís make it as efficient
as possible for them and create a simple consumer

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:12.720
experience for people to connect with the
work that theyíre doing around the planet.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.169
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Well, you mentioned as you
were telling stories about Kenya and M-Pesa

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:19.779
is a mobile technology, thereís a lot of
technologies that are now helping on distribution,

00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:24.289
can you talk a little bit about what youíre
seeing, whether it be outbound or inbound?

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:32.190
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, I think the coolest thing
in terms of financial services for the poor;

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.349
the big game changer is mobile finance.

00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:38.559
Iím sure many of you here have heard of M-Pesa.

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:44.769
M-Pesa is a mobile payments technology in
Kenya and what it allows you to do, Gary,

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:49.460
if I, I can kind of send you money stored
value to your phone, then you can go tell

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:55.429
local gas station and send the gas station
owner money and he will pull money out of

00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:57.979
his till, Kenyan shillings and give it to
you.

00:29:57.979 --> 00:30:01.419
So everyone almost kind of turns into an ATM
machine, if you will.

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:02.419
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:05.190
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And itís about 4 years old.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:11.580
78 percent of the adult population in Kenya
uses it, 25 percent of the GDP now flows through

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.840
this M-Pesa mobile payment system.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.929
Itís incredibly promising, in fact, thereís
this quote by William Gibson, he talks about

00:30:20.929 --> 00:30:23.799
the futureís here, itís just not evenly
distributed yet.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And everyone talks about the

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.539
Silicon Valley and whatís happening out here
but I wonder why Kenya is so far ahead in

00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:31.690
terms of mobile payments.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.730
Itís incredible because what it does is people
who live in rural areas, the cost of actually

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.989
getting them a loan has completely collapsed.

00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:43.570
And weíre doing a pilot now with Kiva where
instead of having a microfinance institution

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:49.029
in the middle, weíre actually doing something
where if youíve gotten a loan on Kiva before,

00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:52.379
or a church group can vouch for you, you can
get listed up in Kenya.

00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:55.830
We have 80 borrowers in Kenya, itís a pilot
called Kiva Zip.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.769
And then when you lend money to that person,
within minutes the money goes to them at zero

00:30:59.769 --> 00:31:01.460
percent interest.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.159
And there incentive to repay is a future loan
that will be cheap.

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:07.899
Just like, this is why we pay back our credit
cards, cause we donít wanna ruin our credit

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:10.109
score so that we can actually get future access
to opportunities.

00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:15.909
So, the M-Pesa system, you know, we think
combined with crowd funding, can really collapse

00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:17.350
the cost.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.919
The cost, for example, accepting savings,
savings is really expensive for banks to offer

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:26.200
to the poor because you canít charge an interest
rate, you actually have to pay out a little

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.480
bit on the deposits, but now people are saving
money on their cell phones.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.039
And thereís this great quote from this woman
that I heard on Kiva in Kenya that said, ìMy

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:39.649
husband may try to break into my phone but
heíll never be able to get the money off

00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:40.649
my sim.î
[Laughter]

00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:44.350
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So what it does in terms of
womenís agency, people's agency

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.289
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Probably why men should get
loans

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:48.359
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Well, you know, itís a game
changer.

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:53.220
Itís allowing people to have the security,
the privacy, the convenience of mobile finance.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.220
I think thatís something weíre really excited
about.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.999
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: And the distribution, I mean,
obviously the distribution power is extraordinary.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:02.399
I had a chance in Kenya, I was with the tribesmen,
this was about 3 years back, and I was trying

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:07.289
to take a photo of him and he had a robe and
he kept covering, he had a Kipling case holder,

00:32:07.289 --> 00:32:08.870
I remember, and his cell phone.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.539
This was in the middle of nowhere and Iím
trying to take a picture of him and heís

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:15.049
trying to cover it up cause he didnít want
any photo of him with a cell phone.

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:19.789
But the distribution of these and ability
to move money on them is could be very transformative

00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:22.120
for what you guys are trying to do.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.101
So we have a lot of, itís great we have a
really great turn out but folks, in a couple

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:27.989
more minutes weíll ask you guys for questions.

00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:31.090
But, what can Googlers do to help you guys?

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.320
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Sure.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.759
Well, just your existence is awesome and I
wanna honor that, honestly.

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:36.759
[Laughter]

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:38.130
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I think we mostly agree with
that.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.130
[Laughter]

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.369
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: No, I mean I say this from
a place of, we were counting up, the other

00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:52.710
day, the number of services we use from Google
and, you know, uh, you know, from Google Apps

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:57.679
to using the maps on every single borrower
page to, weíre really trying to drive more

00:32:57.679 --> 00:33:01.440
video on the website cause that seems to resonate
with the internet community.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.139
So weíre working with Hunter Walk and his
team at YouTube.

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:09.799
To, I mean, itís just, itís ridiculous and
you hear this, Iím sure, from all sorts of

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:13.879
website owners but I just wanna thank you
guys for, and you guys do it at a price and

00:33:13.879 --> 00:33:19.119
a quality that really enables NGOs around
the planet to be more effective.

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:22.289
So thatís really, I just wanna honor that.

00:33:22.289 --> 00:33:26.450
Couple things, you know, obviously thereís
making a loan .You can get involved by volunteering

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.450
at Kiva.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.179
We have a program called the Kiva Fellows
Program where you can go, weíll train you

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:36.239
in San Francisco in our office for a week,
and then weíll ship you out to 1 of 60 countries

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:43.349
where you can get an experience helping building
that local field partner and their work with

00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:44.349
Kiva.

00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:50.600
Weíve had over 450 Kiva Fellows now, in the
last few years, and a lot of Googlers have

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.419
done it.

00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:58.049
I know you guys have peer bonuses and spot
bonuses here and you give out cash, well,

00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:03.500
we have Kiva gift cards and itís kind of
like cash because you can give someone 250

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.050
dollars, they will then just, the only condition
is they have to lend it out to someone and

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.980
then over the course of the year theyíll
get paid back and withdraw that cash.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.990
So itís simple things like that, just weaving
it into our day, that, and I think the person

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:20.640
might appreciate it just as much as cash.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.480
Those are some of the ideas that we have and
if people are interested in doing something

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.409
like what Reid did, or just kind of doing
a bulk loan on a platform so that the internet

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:36.630
community, particularly I think classrooms
around the world, if we can let them try it

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.429
for free, I think thatís a really exciting
thing.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.630
And I wanna make this as, itís just, we know
when somethingís, itís the one penny problem,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:48.590
if you can make it free more people will use
it and then over time people may put in their

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.590
own money.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.590
So those are some ideas.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.590
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Okay.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.210
Thatís a good idea with a spot bonus you
get a Kiva

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.210
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Kiva gift card.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.210
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Kiva Care or something like
that.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.210
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.210
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Thatís a really great idea.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.074
So, if there are questions what weíll do
is you can just stand up or raise your hand

00:35:03.074 --> 00:35:07.650
if you have a question and then hopefully
if we can hear it weíll repeat it for folks

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:08.650
on VC.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.650
Yes?

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:10.650
[Skips question]

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.360
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: The profiles of the people
that you see here, typically, what happens

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.100
is the non-profit partner that we work with
or the NGO, will predispurse the money cause

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.460
we donít want these people to wait for a
loan.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.830
And then they backfill the loan, so while
theyíre fundraising, the average loan profile

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.490
on Kiva gets funded in about 3 days.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:32.940
But if it goes to day 30 and itís not a hundred
percent funded, it expires off our website.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:39.180
Now, when you make a loan to Luciana here
in the Philippines, if she defaults, so if

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.860
her business is not successful, then you and
the 20 other people who have chipped in to

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.550
fund her loan will lose your money.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.590
So your repayment is tied to her success.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:57.966
&gt;&gt;female #1: But in terms of, what happens
if she got the money but it didnít get funded

00:35:57.966 --> 00:35:58.966
by Kiva?

00:35:58.966 --> 00:35:59.966
So whoís covering it?

00:35:59.966 --> 00:36:01.200
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Thatís where the local field
partner eats the loss and thatís the risk.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.770
And then the more that happens, the less people
in their community that they reach.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.210
And then you get your money back and hopefully
youíll recycle it.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.790
&gt;&gt;female #1: But suppose, okay, what about
the business, like I put in 25 dollars but

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.370
she hasnít reached her 350 dollars and itís
still counted towards what goes to her, I

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.800
mean, does that go immediately

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.230
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I think the question is, is
it up to date?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.360
&gt;&gt;female #1: Do you see what Iím saying?

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.820
So what we do is we have an all or nothing
model which is once it hits its fundraising

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:33.620
target, then we wire on a monthly basis to
our field partners and so if it doesnít hit

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.270
that 300 dollar threshold then that, none
of that money goes to that field partner.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:42.100
It actually goes back to the internet lender
and it goes back to your Kiva account to put

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100
it somewhere else.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.620
&gt;&gt;Gary Brigg: Itís like a Groupon tip; the
loan has to tip over

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:52.524
&gt;&gt;female #1: If I put in 25 dollars and itíll
sit there for 30 days and then Iíll get it

00:36:52.524 --> 00:36:53.524
back?

00:36:53.524 --> 00:36:54.524
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Thatís

00:36:54.524 --> 00:36:55.524
&gt;&gt;female #1: Does that make sense?

00:36:55.524 --> 00:36:56.524
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Exactly.

00:36:56.524 --> 00:36:58.870
And today that happens probably, itís the
minority case but itís happening at an increasing

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:59.870
rate.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.160
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Just cause youíre getting
more requests for loans.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Okay, yes?

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160
[Skips question]

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.690
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Itís important to keep in
mind, one of the best books Iíve read on

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:12.630
microfinance and financial services for the
poor is called Portfolios of the Poor and

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:20.810
the situation is much more complex than village
money-lender bad, Kiva good.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:26.290
Itís actually, if youíre a poor household,
chances are youíll have loans from multiple

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:31.770
sources; friends and family, your neighbors,
microfinance institution, some from a village

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.910
money-lender and what we love to do at Kiva
is make the internet community part of that

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:37.910
mix.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.190
Cause we think the internet community will
be more patient and do it at a lower cost

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.030
than the village money-lender and even some
other formal sector things.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:51.840
Um, so, my sense is that right now maybe some
of our, some microfinance institutions or

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:58.310
money-lenders would be upset about the internet
community doing it but I donít know, I mean,

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.650
you guys deal with this all the time, thereís
existing ways of things and then technology

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:06.220
can create a new way and it can create more
value for people.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.970
And, you know, we try not to get too bogged
down by that.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.120
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Itís not like being in Brooklyn,
they have to travel a long way to get to you

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.300
so you feel personally connected.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.310
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Thatís right.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:18.310
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yes?

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.310
[skips question]

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.070
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: I wanna show you guys something
that I think is one of the coolest things.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.370
It just happened in the last few months.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.670
We launched the ability for you, whatís your
name?

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.830
&gt;&gt;male #1: Alex.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:33.160
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Alex, you can vouch for someone,
weíre gonna roll this out, itís, right now

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.090
itís a password protected limited pilot thing
that weíre running, you can vouch for someone

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.180
who you think is underserved, that is a small
business, say maybe in the Tenderloin in San

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.330
Francisco.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:47.490
Okay, and this person, they might not have
a credit score that allows them to get a loan

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:51.110
from a bank but if you know their character
and are willing to vouch for them, for example,

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:54.960
weíre working with Glide Memorial Church
in San Francisco, if they know someone in

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.290
their congregation that they really wanna
back, they can vouch for them.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:03.740
So I wanna show you what weíre doing now
within the US because people are more online,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.740
right?

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.050
So, here is Victor.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:14.130
Victor runs Cafeto Coffee Shop in San Francisco
California and this is his Kiva Zip experiment

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.470
that weíre running.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:21.290
And he basically, you know, he got paid out
via PayPal, his interest rate is zero percent

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.450
and itís a 12 months repayment term.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.370
The people who vouched for him is the Mission
Economic Development Agency in the Mission

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.200
District in San Francisco.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.250
Victor graduated from one of their business
training courses, wants to set up a coffee

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:40.270
shop and the internet community basically
has helped him raise his 5,000 dollars.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:45.390
And now heís running his coffee shop, he
employs 5 people part time and heís paid

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.390
back 43 percent of the loan.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:52.270
Now, hereís where it gets, I think, really
amazing as people, as the under-served, as

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:57.840
the working poor come more and more online,
Victor vouched for his friend Ernesto.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:04.630
So, Ernesto is a taxi cab driver who wants
to buy a taxi cab medallion in San Francisco.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.690
And you can see that now, Victor, has endorsed
Ernesto.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:16.300
And Ernesto and Victor basically, hereís
the, you know, hereís the experiment we,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:21.750
the hope is that Ernesto will really want
to pay back because Victorís reputation is

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.710
tied to his repayment.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:29.710
And this is a way that I think we can reach
people at a call structure that, you know,

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.060
itís like trust networks, essentially.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.010
So weíre really excited about this Kiva Zip
experiment.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:38.850
I donít know if this is gonna work but this
is, I think, we can test a lot of the edges

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:44.511
of innovation here in the U.S. because people
are more connected and itís easier to reach

00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:47.510
them and do these pilots and PayPal we can
get money to them.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.720
And weíre also running this pilot in Kenya
because of M-Pesa as well.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.910
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Thereís a question just behind
Alex.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.910
Sorry, yeah?

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.910
[Skips question]

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.030
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So I think itís kind of an
incubator question.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.120
Are you helping kind of incubator type activity,
yeah?

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.970
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: You know thatís a really great
idea.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:08.820
You can image that Victor and Ernesto, you
know, as there are more and more of folks

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.490
just here in the San Francisco Bay Area who
are using Kiva to make their case to internet

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:18.100
community to get loan funds, patient capital,
that we could layer in other value-add services.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:24.590
So, for example, Google has a small business
unit and maybe you guys have training and

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:29.480
we could develop a module, itís like a, itís
a Kiva, Google boot camp for entrepreneurs

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.150
who want to now bring their business online.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.730
And these two businesses might not be online
but Iím sure there are ones.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.980
Or, for example, we can use the reputation
systems that you guys have developed.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.310
You know the community feedback score on small
businesses?

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.300
As a way to actually get, get, raise money
on Kiva.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.160
So, thereís so many things that we could
do, weíre really early in kind of thinking

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.890
through how to layer it in.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:55.160
But I think thereís a lot of promise.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.530
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Is there a question over here,
I thought?

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.530
Yep, go ahead.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.530
Thatís great.

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:00.530
[Skips question]

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:04.780
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So Iím familiar with Wokai,
Iím good friends with Casey, there CEO and

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.780
co-founder.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:13.150
And, you know, I think it speaks to the plight
of, itís really hard, itís, itís, itís

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.420
Kiva for China, thatís what Wokai is.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:20.010
And theyíve been at it for a few years and
just in May theyíve had to close down and

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.660
itís really hard to find funding and keep
going.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:28.610
And unless you get that kind of flag wheel
effect or that traction, itís really hard

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:29.810
to make this model work.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.440
And, so, one of the things we wanna learn
from Wokai is actually take a lot of the learningís

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.280
in China and figure out how we can actually
lever this platform, all of this goodwill,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.690
thatís been built to get into China more
efficiently so that for every dollar spent

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.620
running Kiva, we can have even more levered
impact.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.420
And, so, this is the case for actually, non-profits
actually coming together and consolidating

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.950
more and sometimes failure can be good.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:59.830
Thereís that Darwinism cause that way we
can kind of focus our resources and get the

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:00.830
most impact.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.830
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah, thatís great.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:02.830
Was there a question in the front row?

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.150
No, did you have a question?

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.460
&gt;&gt;female #1: Oh, I had one other one

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.460
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: You did?

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.460
Okay, over by the wall.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.460
Yes, please.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:14.280
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: So just to summarize your question,
a few things, one is around interest rates,

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.310
two is just around how this money is spent?

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.310
Loan capital spent?

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:21.100
Is it consumptive or is it for productive
purposes?

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.420
Those, uh, it was in that set

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420
&gt;&gt;female #1: [inaudible]

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.420
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Sure.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.550
Hereís what, I mean, what you guys do at
Google, you guys are gonna be a part of this

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.110
overall solution where the worldís going.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:37.370
Which is as we get more insight into small
businesses, so as you get cash register data,

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:45.040
one of the loan types weíre doing now on
Kiva is, for example, if we, if thereís,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.730
if this guy has, I guess, Google Wallet or
a square device to accept the credit cards,

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.490
that data could then basically show up to
Kiva lenders, right?

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.560
And what we could do is structure a loan so
that a percentage of revenues actually up

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.850
to a zero percent return, or maybe one day
if the SEC allowed it you could even get for

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.570
profit returns, who knows.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:11.260
But that kind of data insight could actually
get us a better sense between people who invest

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.870
and how that money, you know, how that money
is used and, and the income generation.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:22.020
The truth though, is, for the working poor,
these loans often times are subsistence loans

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.560
and the more valuable thing about the loan
is the ability to cope with a crisis whether

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.720
itís a medical emergency, a funeral expense,
kids going to school, yes itís consumptive

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.490
but it comes into a mix in a household in
a bulk sum in exchange for small affordable

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.200
repayments over a longer period of time.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.800
One thing that we screen for at Kiva is over
indebtedness.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.021
It happened here in the U.S. with the subprime
meltdown which is, often times people, you

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:53.880
know credit can be debt and it can really
work against you if you donít know portion

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.990
control or if itís not done in a fair, transparent
way.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:03.770
And I think there are some cases, for example,
in Southern India by some for-profit microfinance

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.840
organizations, which Iím a huge fan of for
profit, I want the poor to be able to take

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:14.370
advantage of profitable services but sometimes
that motive for growth, growth, growth comes

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.870
at the expense of responsibility.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:21.460
And, so, we have to be very mindful about
how to be responsible lenders and thereís

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:27.500
things around price transparency, fair collection
practices and I think the industry, especially

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.920
in Southern India, thereís a pretty stark
reminder of when microfinance can actually

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.530
harm and not help.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:39.350
So we wanna screen out for the right organizations
that have a much more balanced view on growth.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:40.860
Thatís our perspective at Kiva.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.250
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: So thereís probably time for
two more questions so just go over to the

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.250
wall.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.250
[Skips question]

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.250
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, the question was about
fraud.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.130
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And fraud absolutely happens,

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.380
all the time.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.550
And one of the things that

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.510
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: One of the things we used to
say at PayPal is you know youíre successful

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.040
when the fraudsters come after you.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040
Itís the way
[Laughter]

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.040
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Thatís good stuff.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.040
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Itís true.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.040
Itís the nature of money on the web, unfortunately.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.900
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Yeah, early on, too, when we
didnít have very good due diligence practices

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.370
we were defrauded all the time.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: And now weíre still defrauded

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.230
but less so as the percentage of the loan
volume.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:18.770
In fact, I think the first 10 field partners
we signed up, I think 8 of them weíve had

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:25.200
to close down because of malfeasance or they,
we just didnít know what we were doing.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.350
And, you know, I think the thing, we know
fraud and corruption is a fact of life, this

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.200
is the way this state of the world I, what
we wanna do is just put a little sunlight

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.380
on it.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:40.040
So by having internet platforms you can go
through our field partner page and see the

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.860
30 partners that weíve had to close out of
the 200 because of problems and you can read

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.860
why.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.950
And hopefully a future donor or a future funder
wonít come in, theyíll Google the partner

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.990
name in Cambodia or in the U.S. or wherever
and theyíll say, ìOh, looks like they had

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.990
some problems on Kiva.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.830
What happened?î They can read about it and
we even invite the organization to state their

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:05.380
case and we just wanna put more sunlight on
all of this and that way people donít throw

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.690
good money after bad.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.640
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: People who defraud Kiva have
a special place in the afterlife I would think.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640
[Laughter]

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.940
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: You know, it teaches us and
even with the Zip model, we found in intermediary

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.680
theyíll still be, you know, Victor and Ernesto
could collude, right?

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: Yeah.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.471
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: I mean we havenít seen that
yet itís still a really small pilot so itís

00:47:25.471 --> 00:47:27.460
just human nature, thereís always some bad.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.950
The question is can we minimize the bad so
we can allow all this good to flourish?

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.810
&gt;&gt;Gary Briggs: I love the fact that you do
keep it up there and you kind of shine a light

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:34.810
on it thatís actually a great practice.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.810
Last question.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:36.810
[Skips question]

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:41.140
&gt;&gt;Premal Shah: Well, Iím a big believer in
doing the smallest possible thing in the present

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:47.710
moment and try smallify things, I mean, if,
think, what Kiva does so well is we all know

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.160
the worldís problems and I think thereís
compassion collapse.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:57.290
You start hearing these stats, one trillion
this, one billion that and we just wanna make

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:01.610
this human scale and make this something that
people can do very quickly, very simply, with

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:02.770
a low barrier to entry.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:07.270
And then I think itís just, how we move that
practice, that mindfulness, into what weíre

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.270
doing every day.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:13.450
And that, you know, I, hopefully that answers
your question beyond kind of like making a

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.630
loan is, you know, I donít know, take a breath.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.970
Be grateful for the place and time that we
are in right here, I mean, what a joy to,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:28.230
especially to work for a company that, I mean,
you know, I really believe in what you guys

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:33.640
are doing and you guys spend a lot of time
and resources on things that donít seem to

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.290
have an immediate economic return for the
company and I really, I think you guys walk

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.140
your talk.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:45.060
So, oh, around do no evil and, I really believe
that.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.870
I see that for the last 10 years or whatever.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:52.560
So, Iíd just savor the time that you have
here.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.110
And then, you know, more than social entrepreneurs,
people quit the company and go leave and start

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.810
something, social intrepreneurs.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:05.180
The amount of change you can make with the
resources here at Google, banding people together,

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.030
I mean, we wanna create, for example, some
kind of, I was talking to our lead engineer

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.360
last night, I was like, ìWhat would be helpful
for Google engineers to do?î and he was like,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.270
ìWell, we could use helpî if you guys had
a sabbatical program here, weíre right here

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:22.400
in San Francisco creating, itís called an
open source playground because the list of

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.350
ideas is so long but our ability to get them
done is just, you know, itís very slow.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:31.380
And, so, if we could open up the ability for
all developers to come in and develop things

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.060
and through some kind of stage gate path put
it up onto the website that would really unlock

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.060
the potential of this.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.160
And this is only one of the websites, all
these other systems, like the systems that

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:47.000
are, our field partners use around the world,
I mean, they all need a lot of engineering,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.500
love and attention , for example.
