00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.430
In the last video, we saw a
reality where the currency

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.080
between, or the exchange rate
between, the Yuan and the

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.780
dollar started off at 10 to 1.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.740
And at that exchange rate,
China was shipping more

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
goods-- in terms of whether you
measure it in dollars or

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.960
Yuan --was shipping more to
the U.S. than the U.S. was

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.760
shipping to China.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.920
And because of that, we saw an
imbalance in the currencies.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.840
The Yuan became more expensive,
or the dollar

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.509
became cheaper, until eventually
Chinese goods got

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.340
expensive enough that there was
less demand in the U.S.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090
and U.S. goods got cheap enough,
that there was more

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.900
demand in China, that the trade

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.520
actually came into balance.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.810
Now, that's OK if everyone
wanted to have balanced trade,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.380
but what if the Chinese
government didn't want that.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.880
They said, hey, we needed to
develop, the United States is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.800
already developed, we want to
have an industrial base, we

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.110
want to have a market to
sell our goods to.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.070
We want to export more to
the United States than

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.250
we import from them.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.650
We want export-led growth.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.250
So they don't like the dynamic
that they saw, they did not

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.390
like the currency, they
did not like the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.440
Yuan getting expensive.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.730
So let's say the Chinese
government-- let me scroll up

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:29.560
a little bit --so the Chinese
government wants to keep

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:45.700
currency exchange pegged at-- I
ran out of space over there

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.570
--at CNY 10 per dollar.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.120
And they want that because they
want this situation to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.680
keep on going forever, that
China keeps shipping more to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.170
the U.S. than the U.S. ships to
China, or maybe they wanted

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.210
to go even more, that China
keeps shipping more and more

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.310
to the U.S. than the U.S. ships
to China so that China

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.390
could build its industrial
base.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.340
And, I guess the more sinister
view is also so that the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.370
United States' industrial
base gets depleted.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.920
That they keep manufacturing
things cheaper and cheaper and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.530
cheaper, and then United States

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.710
manufacturers can't compete.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.740
And we'll talk about this in
more videos, it's not it's not

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.470
clear that it's 100%
one-sided.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.140
There's actually some benefits
that the United States also

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.830
gets from this, and we'll
discuss that more.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.390
It's a little bit
more involved.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.700
So how could they do this?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.930
Let's just say that the Chinese
government wants this

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.970
reality, and they want
this reality frozen.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.720
They do not want the reality
where the trade balances.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.660
How could they intervene in
currency markets so that this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
doesn't change?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.380
Because, as we said, if more
Chinese goods are being

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.060
bought, there's more demand
for Yuan, the Yuan should

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.470
appreciate, the dollar
should go down.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.560
But how do you get both?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.730
How do you have your cake
and eat it too?

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.360
How do you get more goods being
shipped to the United

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.090
States than back to China
without the Yuan appreciating?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.030
And the way you do that,
there's the Chinese

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.770
government, or maybe in
particular we could talk about

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.850
the Chinese Central Bank.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.520
The Chinese Central Bank, which
is a part of the Chinese

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.690
government can say, hey, to
keep our Yuan devalued, we

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.820
will print money.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.230
So let me draw the Chinese
Central Bank.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.390
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.860
And what they do, they can
actually just print money.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.220
So we had this scenario that I
had outlined in the last two

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.250
videos where we had
this imbalance.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.310
There was demand for
CNY 1,000, but only

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.480
supply of CNY 500.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.540
So what they can do is
just equalize this.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:15.680
They could just print CNY 500
and then try to convert that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.930
into dollars.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.620
So what just happened?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.790
Now all of a sudden, we have
$100 that are trying to be

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.590
converted into roughly CNY 1,000
or if that exchange rate

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.740
were to be constant.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.035
So there's demand
for CNY 1,000.

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.510
Before the Chinese Central Bank
got involved, there was

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.270
only a CNY 500 supply.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.910
But now the Chinese Central
Bank says, OK, there's a

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.450
demand for CNY 1,000, there's
only CNY 500 supply, we're

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.110
going to produce another
CNY 500.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.360
We literally can just print it,
and then they will convert

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.490
what they printed
into dollars.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.300
So just like that, you
now have a balance

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.320
of supply and demand.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.390
You have CNY 1,000, 500 here and
500 here that want to be

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.090
converted into dollars, and then
you have $100 that want

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.180
to be converted into,
I guess, CNY 1,000.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.060
So if they were to do this, the
currency wouldn't change.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.990
The exchange rate
would change.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.900
The supply and demand of the two
currencies would be equal.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.320
Now, and that would work and
frankly that's what they have

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.210
been doing for some time now.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.710
But there's one kind
of catch here.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.130
The whole time that they're
doing this, what is happening?

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.820
Well, they keep shipping more to
the United States then the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.780
United States is shipping
to China.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.200
These guys keep having to print
Yuan and buy dollars

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.580
with those Yuan in
order to keep the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.660
Chinese currency cheap.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.290
So these people are going to
keep accumulating dollars.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.770
They just keep printing Yuan
and then they just keep

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.530
accumulating dollars.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.730
Let me draw that over here, so
the Chinese Central Bank just

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.160
starts accumulating many,
many dollars.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.920
They can they can print Yuan
as much as they want, those

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.120
Yuan, they trade them into
dollars and then these guys

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.170
start accumulating more and
more dollars over here.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.800
And the more that they want this
trade imbalance to occur,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.320
the longer they want it to
occur, the more dollars that

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.160
they will have to accumulate.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.990
So they have to just keep
on doing it, they can't

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.970
even stop doing it.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.610
They have to keep doing it in
order to keep the trade

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.950
balance the way it is.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.720
And in the next video, I'll talk
about what they actually

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.240
have to do with these dollars
because they actually won't

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.850
just keep it in cash, what they
actually have to do with

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.480
these dollars, and then what
effect that actually might

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.400
have on the United
States economy.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.870
Then we could talk about how
this might unwind itself, but

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.850
we'll find out it's actually
very difficult for this

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.280
scenario to unwind once
it gets started.
