00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 align:start position:0%
obviously big city yeah no one's big
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start position:0%
obviously big city yeah no one's big
yeah<00:00:28.849><c> it's</c><00:00:29.849><c> sort</c><00:00:30.060><c> of</c><00:00:30.179><c> like</c><00:00:30.330><c> LA</c><00:00:30.720><c> on</c><00:00:30.869><c> the</c><00:00:30.990><c> beach</c>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
yeah it's sort of like LA on the beach
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 align:start position:0%
yeah it's sort of like LA on the beach
but<00:00:31.610><c> you</c><00:00:32.610><c> know</c><00:00:32.700><c> there's</c><00:00:32.850><c> a</c><00:00:32.910><c> couple</c><00:00:33.120><c> things</c><00:00:33.390><c> I</c>

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
but you know there's a couple things I
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
but you know there's a couple things I
think<00:00:33.719><c> because</c><00:00:34.290><c> it</c><00:00:34.410><c> is</c><00:00:34.530><c> a</c><00:00:34.559><c> primal</c><00:00:35.040><c> environment</c>

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 align:start position:0%
think because it is a primal environment
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.459 align:start position:0%
think because it is a primal environment
like<00:00:35.700><c> we</c><00:00:35.850><c> live</c><00:00:36.000><c> on</c><00:00:36.090><c> kawaii</c><00:00:36.450><c> which</c><00:00:36.750><c> is</c><00:00:36.930><c> pretty</c>

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 align:start position:0%
heavy-duty as far as it's quiet there's
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 align:start position:0%
heavy-duty as far as it's quiet there's
