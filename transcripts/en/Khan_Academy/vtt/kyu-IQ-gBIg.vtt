00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.050
Let's do some integer and
rational number problems.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.340
So this first one here, the tick
marks on the number line

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.140
represent evenly spaced
integers.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.540
And just in case you forgot
what integers mean, that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.920
essentially is the counting
numbers, including 0 and the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.350
negative counting numbers.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.570
So 1, 2, 3, 4, those
are all integers.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
0 is an integer.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.020
Negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.880
so on and so forth.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.070
Those are all integers.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.710
You might imagine the whole
numbers, those are also

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.890
another way of saying
the integers.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.130
So they say find the values
of a, b, c, d and e.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.880
So these are evenly spaced, and
this is 0 right here, and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.070
this is 21.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.570
Let's see how many tick
marks it takes us to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.020
go from 0 to 21.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.080
We have one tick mark, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 tick marks.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.680
So 7 tick marks take us to 21
and they're evenly spaced--

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.750
they tell us that --evenly
spaced tick marks.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.230
So if 7 of these take us
to 21, there must be 3.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.580
Each must be a jump of 3.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.170
This must be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
18, and then bam, 21.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.320
And the way I figured that out,
I said 7 tick marks gets

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.340
us to 21, 21 divided by
7 tick marks is 3.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.330
So each of those increment by 3,
so this goes to 0 and then

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.360
this must be 3 to the
left of that.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.610
So it's negative
3 right there.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.320
So what are a, b, c and
d? a is negative 3.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.190
a is equal to negative 3.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.360
Right there, that's a 3.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.070
b is equal to 3 right there.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.060
c is equal to 9 right there.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.940
d is equal to 12, and
e is equal to 15.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.560
Not too bad.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.430
All right.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.640
Determine what fraction of the
whole each shaded region

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.000
represents.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.020
All right.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.920
Well let's see.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.350
Here we have 3 sections
of this pie.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.875
So in our denominator, which is
the bottom of our fraction

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:17.090
we'll write there's 3 possible
pieces, and only one of the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.500
possible 3 sections is shaded.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.910
So 1/3 is shaded.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.000
So this first one is 1/3.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.420
The second one is how many
sections do we have, and all

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.950
the sections are equal sized,
so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.440
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 sections.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.880
How many are shaded?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.140
So it is 7/12.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740
That's what this shaded
region represents.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.030
And then here, let's see, how
many squares do we have?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.570
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 along this side.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.450
And then we have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.460
10 along that side.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.710
So we have a total of 70
squares, 7 times 10.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.220
And let's count how many
are shaded in.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.430
Well this is going to
be 7 right there.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.300
This is 7 right there, that
is 7 right there,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.360
that is 7 right there.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.190
So let me add this up.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.260
So so far I have 28,
that's 7 times 4.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:43.640
28 plus, let's see, I have
2-- this is 2, 2, 2,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.830
2, 2, 2, 2 and 2.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.760
So how many 2's are there.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.310
That's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 2's.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.510
So that 8 times 2, that's 16.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.850
So 28 plus 16.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.060
28 plus 10 is 38 plus
another 6 is 44.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.470
So we have 44 of the 70
squares filled in.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.750
And we can write this rational
number in simpler form.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.700
We can simplify it.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.440
Let's see, the numerator and
the denominator both are

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.330
divisible by 2.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.980
So this is equal
to 22 over 35.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.320
And that's about as simple
as we can get.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.940
This is divisible by 2 and 11.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.660
This is not divisible
by either 2 or 11.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.220
So there you go.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.320
That's the fraction
in simplest form.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.040
Problem 3.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.540
Place the following sets of
rational numbers in order from

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.560
least to greatest.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.530
So let's do part a.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.490
I might not do all of these
for the sake of time.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.050
1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.695
So if you think about a pie,
going on, if you take a pie

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.790
and you divide it into just
2 pieces, 1/2 is half

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.520
of that whole pie.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.990
That right there is 1/2.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.430
This right here, 1/4, 1/4 is--
you just take the same pie

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.580
--1/4 is just that.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.870
So clearly 1/2 is greater than
1/4 or 1/4 is less than 1/2.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.920
I'll write it like that.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.790
And 1/3 is right in between.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.430
If you did 1/3-- it's maybe
harder to visualize here --but

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.950
if this is 1/2, if we divided
this into thirds, 1/3

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.850
is less than this.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.440
So if we divided this into
thirds, 3 equals sections, 1/3

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.960
would be just like
that right here.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.190
1/3 is more than that.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.780
There's multiple ways we
could visualize this.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.890
So 1/4 is less than 1/3,
which is less than 1/2.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.000
In general, the larger
your denominator

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.520
the smaller the fraction.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.680
I have only one 1 of 4, that's
less than 1 out of 3, and

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.010
that's even less than 1 out of
2, which would be even less

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.540
than 1 out of 1.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.860
So that's our first one.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.680
We put that in order:
1/4, 1/3, 1/2.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.950
Let me just do part to c, just
for the sake of time.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:28.150
So we have 39 over 60, we
have 49 over 80, and we

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.350
have a 59 over 100.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.350
So the easiest way to do this,
if you had a calculator you

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.800
would actually just divide each
of these numbers out and

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.090
you would get a decimal, and
it's very easy to compare

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.900
decimal numbers.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.140
But let's if we can do this a
little bit more artfully.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.230
So we can approximate it.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.570
We could say that this
is a little bit less.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.180
So 39 over 60, it's almost--
I'll make those squiggly equal

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.340
signs for almost --it's
approximately 40 over 60,

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.020
which is equal to 2/3.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.480
So this is almost 2/3.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.870
A little bit less than 2/3.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:10.420
This right here, 49 over 80,
it's almost 50 over 80, so

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.390
it's almost 5/8.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:20.090
And then this right here, 59
over 80-- 59 over 100, sorry.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:27.910
It's almost equal to 60 over
100, which is equal to 3/5.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.480
And just to get a sense of, at
least now we might be able to

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.860
do it in our head, 2/3,
that's approximately

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.290
equal to 0.66 repeating.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.620
You could say 0.667, roughly
equal to that.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.480
That's the 2/3 right there.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.670
Let me do it in that
color so you know

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.820
what I'm talking about.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.890
So this is approximately 0.667,
not exactly, we're

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.330
estimating.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.460
This right here, 5/8-- So the
way I always think of eighths

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.150
is 1/8 is .125.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.692
So 5/8-- Let me just divide
it right here, let

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.220
me just do the work.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.030
So if we take 8 goes into 5, put
some decimals right here,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:15.210
8 goes into 5 zero times,
0 times 8 is 0.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.020
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.710
Bring down this 0.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.710
8 goes into 50 six times.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.690
6 times 8 is 48.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.520
50 minus 48 is 2,
bring down a 0.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.679
8 goes into 20 two times.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.260
2 times 8 is 16.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.289
Subtract, you get a 4.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.580
Bring down this 0.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.740
40.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.630
8 goes into 40 five times.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.250
So this right here is 0.625.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.250
Not exactly, it's a little
bit less than this.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.300
This is a little bit
less than that.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.510
And 3/5 is pretty
straightforward.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.520
3/5 is the same thing
as 6/10, which is

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.130
approximately equal to 0.6.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.590
So this is a little bit less
than 0.6, this is a little bit

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.950
less than .625, this is a little
bit less than .667.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.240
So if you put them in order,
this is the smallest, then

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.960
this one, then that one.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.000
So let me write it down.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.610
So the smallest is 59 over 100,
followed by 49 over 80,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:26.280
followed by the largest,
which is 39 over 60.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.790
Which might be a little
unintuitive because this

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.970
actually has the smallest number
in the numerator, but

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.620
it also has the smallest number
in the denominator.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.080
So you actually had
to work it out.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.560
They're actually reasonably
close to each other.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.150
Let's do problem number 5.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.960
Find the opposite of each
of the following.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.720
And when they say opposite,
I think they mean find the

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.120
negative, or find the reflection
on the number line.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.450
So we essentially just have to
multiply all of these numbers

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.150
by negative 1.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:59.440
So for part a, the opposite of
1.001 would be negative 1.001.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.040
For part b, the negative of 5
minus 11-- well we could write

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.740
it --it's going to be negative
1 times-- Well,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.130
what's 5 minus 11?

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.190
5 minus 11 is negative 6.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.160
This number right here
is negative 6.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.290
So the opposite of negative 6--
negative 1 times negative

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.780
6 --is going to be equal to 6.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.210
Part c.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.250
x plus y.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.127
The opposite's going to be
negative 1 times x plus y, or

00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:33.540
we could have just written
negative times x plus y.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.510
You distribute the negative 1.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.440
This is equal to negative x,
and then negative 1 times

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.000
plus y minus y.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Finally, part d.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.660
Negative 1 times x minus y.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.880
I'm just taking the negative
of everything.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.340
So I'm taking the negative of
this, and so this is going to

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.390
equal to negative 1 times
x, negative x.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.510
Then negative 1 times minus y or
negative y, that's plus y.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.630
Or we could write this
as y minus x.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.570
And that's actually a neat thing
to remember later on

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.590
when you're manipulating
things algebraically.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.950
The negative of x minus
y is y minus x.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.000
We just did that right there.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.750
The negative of a minus
b is b minus a.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.280
You just swap the two when you
take the negative, and we just

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.280
proved it for you right there.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.770
All right.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.550
Let's do a couple of these.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.300
Simplify the following absolute
value expression.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.360
Absolute value is essentially
telling you the

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.330
distance from 0.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:37.010
So for example, if that's 0,
if I have the number 4.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.130
How far is 4 from 0?

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.740
The absolute value of 4?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.790
Well it's 4 from 0.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.880
So you just say it's 4.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.210
So the absolute value
of positive

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.910
numbers is just the number.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.100
Let's say I had negative 3.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.570
How far is negative 3 from 0?

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.250
Well, I don't care whether it's
to the left of the right

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.310
of 0, it's just 3
away from the 0.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.250
It's 3 to the left.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.830
So this is going to be 3.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.240
So one way to think about
absolute value is, whether

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.610
it's positive or negative,
it becomes positive.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.040
It's that far from 0.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.330
So let's do these.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.940
So 11 minus the absolute
value of negative 4.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.960
This is equal to 11 minus-- the
absolute of negative 4 is

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.660
just 4, which is equal to 7.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.030
I'll do every other one of these
problems. The absolute

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.150
value of negative 5 minus 11.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.120
So that'll be equal to the
absolute value of negative 5

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.310
minus 11 is negative 16.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.140
The absolute value
of negative 16.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.910
the absolute value of negative
16 is just 16.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.960
It's 16 to the left of 0.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.040
You could view it that
way, you could just

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.310
get rid of its sign.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.280
And then finally here,
let's do part e.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.740
The negative of the absolute
value of negative 7 is equal

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.650
to the negative of--
What's the absolute

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.450
value of negative 7?

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.780
It's just 7.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.490
So it's equal to negative 7.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.590
This right here is 7.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.380
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
