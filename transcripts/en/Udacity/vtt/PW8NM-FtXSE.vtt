00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.780
So, now that we have our test specifications. Test specification number one that

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.740
says that a plus b must be greater than zero. And test specification

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.990
number two, for which a plus b must be less than zero. I'd

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.580
like to do another small quiz and ask you to write some test

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.440
cases that will implement these specifications. And I want you to write the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.780
test cases in this format. I want you to specify for each one

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.300
of the test cases, what is the value of a that you need

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.160
to use. What is the value of b that you need to use.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.200
And since a test case, I like to remind you, is

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.960
not just a set of inputs. But is the set of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.050
inputs plus expected output? I also want you to specify, what

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.040
is the expected output for these test cases? And in particular,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.540
since we have two characteristics of the output, one is the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630
color of the output and the other one is the actual

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.040
value. I want you to specify for each test case, what

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790
is the expected output color and what is the expected value?
