the way that they respond is obviously
terrible for both parties involved right

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110

serious one and so what what I'm trying
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.200
serious one and so what what I'm trying
to talk about then is is that if we have

to talk about then is is that if we have
this sensitive ego and we're able to be

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
this sensitive ego and we're able to be
