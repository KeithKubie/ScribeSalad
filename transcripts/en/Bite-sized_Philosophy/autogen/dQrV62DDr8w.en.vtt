00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.100
 My daughter committed suicide and she was 24 years old because of depression 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.620
 If someone insists on committing suicide, how can we change their minds? 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.360
 Well .. at first, so I'm very sorry 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780
 It is very terrible 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
 Okay 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.820
 I had this friend 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.220
 Her granddaughter .. 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.360
 Sorry 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.040
 There is a lot of depression 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560
 In our family 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.260
 So it's a question of reality 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.040
 Generally 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.160
 I had this friend 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.700
 A friend of his parents and granddaughter committed suicide 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 She blamed herself for it 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.660
 What could I do? What could I have done differently? 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.700
 This is the problem of suicide; it leaves everyone wondering, my God, what could I do !? 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.340
 I could have treated that person better 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.420
 I could hear them! I could have been next to them! 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.840
 She blamed herself for these 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 She felt that she was not a useful person and that she had failed as a child 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 She is a very good person 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.220
 So I went to walk with her and I said 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.440
 She is married and admires her husband, he is a good person 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 And I said 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660
 You paint yourself 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.880
 Suicide on your granddaughter! 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.400
 Do you blame your husband? 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.220
 Do you sit down and tell him that he was very useless? 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.280
 Because his granddaughter committed suicide and how he failed completely! 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.615
 She said: No, I will not 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.980
 I replied: Well .. 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 Do not do it yourself 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.140
 No 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 People 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 Depression is a terrible thing 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.340
 And many many things are caused by we spend it ... 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.100
 We understand some of them but many of them do not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 People sometimes become depressed because they are severely ill 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.140
 We know that depression may be an inflammatory disease 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.340
 May be associated with autoimmunity 

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:17.195
 There are many reasons why people may be depressed 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.420
 Dejected people go to dark places heavily 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.240
 You can not imagine it 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.000
 It is not necessarily the case that you can always save someone! 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.380
 But dumping yourself into a suicidal incident is not useful 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.240
 So there is room for self-forgiveness 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.240
 Maybe I did some things that deserved the blame I was not supposed to do 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.080
 But you do not want to blame yourself 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.060
 Remember the presumption of innocence 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.920
 Is innocent until proved otherwise 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.840
 You must apply this to yourself 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.080
 I think sometimes people are so depressed that no one can do anything 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.020
 This is the worst part of it, when a depressed person thinks 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.080
 The depressed person thinks saying 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.280
 I see only disasters everywhere 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.700
 I do not see any way out 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.420
 I do not see any way forward at all 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.120
 Perhaps the combination of these two beliefs is what makes people 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.540
 Actually inclined to suicide 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.000
 The hopeless situation! 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.940
 Will not improve 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.000
 where ever you go! There is no escape 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.560
 The agony is unbearable 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.560
 I am absolutely useless for anyone 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.560
 It is better for everyone to disappear from existence 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.020
 If not a great burden will destroy their lives now 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.600
 That burden will become that in the future 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.280
 Try to imagine 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 This is the case for these people, it's horrible 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.400
 There are so many ways to get there 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.160
 So 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.240
 You can listen to people 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.220
 You can encourage them with every hope to ask for the help they need 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.380
 I have seen antidepressants and they do miracles on many many people 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.920
 They do not work with everyone 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.740
 They do not consider a solution to all problems 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.760
 But they have side effects 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.800
 One side effect of untreated depression is suicide 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.020
 And do not recover from it 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.400
 This is relatively high 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.615
 You can go to war with them about antidepressants 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.520
 If a person can not get out of his depression he is a suicide bomber 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.300
 What will he lose? 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.840
 One month on antidepressants 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320
 They will teach 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 They may have to try it longer because they will depend on their response 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.320
 Some people respond better to a class of antidepressants than others 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.840
 It's worth fighting someone for it 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.620
 If they are in a very bad state and will not do everything they can to improve 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.755
 (ASK) Electric shock therapy is useful 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.920
 Working with depression is difficult to see 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.880
 It is a terrible thing to consider 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.680
 But the modern methods of (ASK) are not the same as in films 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.620
 And repeat, there is no return from death! 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.220
 So 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.620
 You can not save everyone 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.940
 People get sick, they die 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.800
 Sometimes the reason is unavoidable 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.340
 He seems depressed 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.100
 Depression is a multifaceted phenomenon 

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:18.825
 You can be by their side, listen to them 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.400
 To see them 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.920
 You can intervene 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.515
 You can try to understand, to hold them accountable 

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:27.705
 You can do all these things 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.440
 But everyone has his destiny 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.100
 And you are not 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.100
 Able to everything 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.740
 So a disaster will happen at some point 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.520
 Such as your daughter's disaster 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.960
 And then 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.075
 Try to come with the least burden of misery with you 

00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:49.285
 On what you can 

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:55.455
 When you recover from your grief 

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:57.475
 Yup
