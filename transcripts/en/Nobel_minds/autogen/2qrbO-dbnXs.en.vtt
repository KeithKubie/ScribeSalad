I think there two aspects I would
separate one is the trustworthiness of

separate one is the trustworthiness of
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720
separate one is the trustworthiness of
direct observation I think this is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
direct observation I think this is
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.299
direct observation I think this is
something scientists often think is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
something scientists often think is
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.510
something scientists often think is
simpler than it is obviously

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
simpler than it is obviously

trustworthy you have to know how to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
trustworthy you have to know how to
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429
trustworthy you have to know how to
interpret it and that can often be quite

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
interpret it and that can often be quite
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.070
interpret it and that can often be quite
a delicate business but it's a business

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
a delicate business but it's a business

that scientific education is good at

then there's the question of testimony

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
then there's the question of testimony
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620
then there's the question of testimony
trust in what people tell you and this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
trust in what people tell you and this
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.340
trust in what people tell you and this
of course in politics in the news in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350
of course in politics in the news in
 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.890
of course in politics in the news in
newspapers media this is the crunch

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
newspapers media this is the crunch
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.240
newspapers media this is the crunch
today because in the old days we thought

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
today because in the old days we thought
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.649
today because in the old days we thought
that only trustworthy news reports were

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659
that only trustworthy news reports were
 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.420
that only trustworthy news reports were
produced now we know that very

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
produced now we know that very
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.130
produced now we know that very
untrustworthy things are produced all

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
untrustworthy things are produced all
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109
untrustworthy things are produced all
over the place and so it's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
over the place and so it's
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.660
over the place and so it's
correspondingly much harder to sift out

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
correspondingly much harder to sift out
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120
correspondingly much harder to sift out
trust that's partly an institutional

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
trust that's partly an institutional
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.380
trust that's partly an institutional
problem there are countries where

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
problem there are countries where
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.719
problem there are countries where
they're trustworthy institutions I think

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
they're trustworthy institutions I think
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.230
they're trustworthy institutions I think
Sweden is one your press is trusted in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
Sweden is one your press is trusted in
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969
Sweden is one your press is trusted in
Britain the BBC is probably the best

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
Britain the BBC is probably the best
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.150
Britain the BBC is probably the best
example because Rupert Murdoch has not

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
example because Rupert Murdoch has not
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.020
example because Rupert Murdoch has not
got his hands on it yet

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
got his hands on it yet
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.090
got his hands on it yet
so so it is not yet Fox News one day it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
so so it is not yet Fox News one day it
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.400
so so it is not yet Fox News one day it
might become so there's no guarantee

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
might become so there's no guarantee
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.920
might become so there's no guarantee
that trustworthiness continues and it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930
that trustworthiness continues and it's
 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.070
that trustworthiness continues and it's
very quick to get lost so I think those

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
very quick to get lost so I think those
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.660
very quick to get lost so I think those
are the two aspects of trust which i

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
are the two aspects of trust which i
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.360
are the two aspects of trust which i
think are very important yeah one is and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
think are very important yeah one is and
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.670
think are very important yeah one is and
one I'm optimistic about our capacity to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680
one I'm optimistic about our capacity to
 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.430
one I'm optimistic about our capacity to
make good observations the world one I'm

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440
make good observations the world one I'm
 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.140
make good observations the world one I'm
more pessimistic about yeah I think we

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
more pessimistic about yeah I think we
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.770
more pessimistic about yeah I think we
have all the difficulties that we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
have all the difficulties that we
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.750
have all the difficulties that we
learned this morning about finding out

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
learned this morning about finding out
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.520
learned this morning about finding out
what is true but there is a baseline for

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
what is true but there is a baseline for
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.370
what is true but there is a baseline for
this and that is that those who are paid

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380
this and that is that those who are paid
 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.820
this and that is that those who are paid
to discover the truth in some way are

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
to discover the truth in some way are

from two sources one is of course that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
from two sources one is of course that
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.710

I'm a social scientist we have more and

I'm a social scientist we have more and
 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.330
I'm a social scientist we have more and
more think-tanks research institutes

more think-tanks research institutes
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.250
more think-tanks research institutes
interest organizations that are sort of

interest organizations that are sort of

paying for a specific type of
interpretation of the facts so if they

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
interpretation of the facts so if they
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.100
interpretation of the facts so if they
at all are interested in any fact it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110
at all are interested in any fact it's
 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.050
at all are interested in any fact it's
only the facts that they know beforehand

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060
only the facts that they know beforehand
 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.680
only the facts that they know beforehand
will confirm their interest the second

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690
will confirm their interest the second
 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.490
will confirm their interest the second
comes from within universities we have a

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
comes from within universities we have a
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.050
comes from within universities we have a
problem with many scholars especially in

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
problem with many scholars especially in
 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.759
problem with many scholars especially in
the humanities and social scientists is

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769
the humanities and social scientists is
 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.160
the humanities and social scientists is
sort of fall in love with a theory so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170
sort of fall in love with a theory so
 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.949
sort of fall in love with a theory so
they are neoclassical economists or

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
they are neoclassical economists or
 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.170
they are neoclassical economists or
institutionalist or behavior list or

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
institutionalist or behavior list or
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.920
institutionalist or behavior list or
post modernist or whatever so what if

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
post modernist or whatever so what if
 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.060
post modernist or whatever so what if
they are looking for any facts they are

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070
they are looking for any facts they are
 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.590
they are looking for any facts they are
really in love with the theory they

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
really in love with the theory they
 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.330
really in love with the theory they
spent years and years in learning this

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340
spent years and years in learning this
 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.430
spent years and years in learning this
theory and the very idea that they would

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
theory and the very idea that they would
 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.220
theory and the very idea that they would
find any empirical evidence that would

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230
find any empirical evidence that would
 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.310
find any empirical evidence that would
refute their theory is alien to them so

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
refute their theory is alien to them so
 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.220
refute their theory is alien to them so
I think that if you are back down from

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230
I think that if you are back down from
 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.110
I think that if you are back down from
finding the truth to this idea of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
finding the truth to this idea of
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.279
finding the truth to this idea of
impartiality we have at least within

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289
impartiality we have at least within
 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.970

universities force

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980
universities force
 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.810
universities force
