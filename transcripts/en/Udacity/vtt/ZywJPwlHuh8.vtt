00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.780
While there might not appear to be a correlation between

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.310
the two variables, let's think about this a little bit

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.145
more. What's on the x-axis? Months. And what's on the

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:13.010
y-axis? Temperature. So, we know that this month variable is

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.890
very discreet. We'll have the months from January to December,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.460
and they'll repeat over and over again. Let's be sure

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.740
we add that detail to our plot. Here's the code

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.010
that we used to create the plot using the ggplot syntax.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.100
What layer and syntax would you add to

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.810
this plot in order to make that change? Type

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.440
in your code here. You'll want to break

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.170
open the x-axis every 12 months, so that way

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.240
it corresponds to a year. I'll let you

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.370
figure out what the lower and upper limits of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.600
the x axis should be. So, what do

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.870
you think? What layer and syntax should we add?
