stupid and and that you deserve to be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
stupid and and that you deserve to be
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.240
stupid and and that you deserve to be
taken advantage of because you're not

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
taken advantage of because you're not
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679
taken advantage of because you're not
even stupid so it's actually a good

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
even stupid so it's actually a good
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.980
even stupid so it's actually a good
thing that he's doing it and he is proof

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
thing that he's doing it and he is proof
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.719
thing that he's doing it and he is proof
for and I'm saying he because there are

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
for and I'm saying he because there are
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.760
for and I'm saying he because there are
more male Psychopaths the the proof that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
more male Psychopaths the the proof that
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.319
more male Psychopaths the the proof that
your stupid naive is that he can take

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
your stupid naive is that he can take
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359
your stupid naive is that he can take
advantage of you and so like if you were

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
advantage of you and so like if you were
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.449
advantage of you and so like if you were
wiser you'd be you know you'd know his

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
wiser you'd be you know you'd know his
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550
wiser you'd be you know you'd know his
tricks and then it wouldn't

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
tricks and then it wouldn't
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710
tricks and then it wouldn't
morally necessary for him to show you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
morally necessary for him to show you
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.990
morally necessary for him to show you
just exactly who knows what about what

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
just exactly who knows what about what
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.410
just exactly who knows what about what
and so the psychopath will use his

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
and so the psychopath will use his
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.110
and so the psychopath will use his
ability to to fool you as proof of his

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
ability to to fool you as proof of his
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.050

omniscience and narcissism and the
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.059
omniscience and narcissism and the
problem with that is that you you can be

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069
