00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.496
- [Voiceover] Each year,
a group of statisticians

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:06.717
polled 1,500 randomly
selected United States adults

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:08.157
with the question,

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:10.142
"Are the Democratic and Republican parties

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.953
"doing an adequate job,

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:15.657
"or is a third major
political party needed?"

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.083
The scatter plot above
shows the percentage

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:22.146
of U. S. adults polled
between the years 2004

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:25.826
and 2014 that think that a third major

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.927
political party is needed.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.085
Based on the line of best fit,

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.398
the line of best fit,

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.861
to the data shown,

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:34.184
which of the following values

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:38.537
is closest to the average yearly change,

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.302
average yearly change,

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:43.398
in the percentage of people that think

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:47.767
a third major political
party is necessary?

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.751
All right, so let's see,

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:51.662
let's look at this chart here.

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.506
It tells us percentage of U. S. adults

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:58.580
that think a third major
political party is necessary.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.145
When you look at the actual
plot right over here,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.422
the scatter plot,

00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:04.664
that in year zero,

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.081
so this would be in 2004,

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.300
it looks like it's around,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.709
I don't know, 42% roughly.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.772
Then we get to about 45% in 2005.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:15.235
This is year one,

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:17.565
or one year since 2004,

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.422
so this would be 2005.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:20.920
It keeps increasing all the way

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.359
until we get to three years since 2004,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.081
or four years since,

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.291
actually no, this is
three years since 2004.

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.056
So this would be 2007.

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.148
Then it drops a little bit.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:33.447
Then it increases, increases,

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:35.594
drops a little bit, then it increases.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.986
Then they have this line of best fit.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:39.832
This line of best fit,

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:40.720
one way to think about it

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.863
is the slope of this line of best fit

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:44.722
is one way to think about

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:46.846
the average yearly
change in the percentage

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.283
of people that think that a third major

00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:51.850
political party is necessary.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.347
Now when you look at this,

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.042
it looks like the slope of this line,

00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:56.980
it looks like it goes up,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.660
it looks like it's going up,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.310
I don't know,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.063
from this point,

00:02:01.063 --> 00:02:02.387
I'm just picking points that I can look

00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:03.860
clearly at the grid,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.960
from that point to this point,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.199
it's gone up 10%.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.136
It's gone up from 45 to 55%.

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:17.308
So this has gone up 10%.

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:19.196
And how many years did it take it

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:20.612
to go up 10%?

00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:21.739
Well let's see.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.709
It took it, let's see this is year one,

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.333
it goes up to year nine,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.353
it looks like it took
approximately eight years

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:35.319
to go up approximately 10%.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.131
This is a positive 10%.

00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.895
The on average, it looks like,

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.892
if we look at the line of best fit,

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:43.933
it looks like an increasing.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.094
Every year that goes by,

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:47.776
on average, more and more U. S. adults

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:50.167
think that a third major
political party is necessary.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.315
This is, of course, the line of best fit.

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:53.511
When we look at the actual scatter plot,

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:54.928
it jumps around a little bit more.

00:02:54.928 --> 00:02:56.715
Sometimes it goes down or up,

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.515
but if we look at the line of best fit,

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.988
it is an increasing trend.

00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:03.750
So what's the slope of
this right over here?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.763
Well we increased 10%

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.966
in eight years.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:15.313
So this is going to be equals,

00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:17.611
see, 10% in eight years

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:21.732
is about 1.25,

00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:23.810
and this an approximation,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.551
so let me put an
approximation right over here,

00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:31.551
so approximately 1.25% per year.

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:35.051
And it's clearly increasing.

00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.363
It's going from the bottom
left to the top right.

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:39.993
Now let's look at our
choices right over here.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.506
So we can immediately rule out

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:45.605
the choices that have a decreasing,

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.671
I mixed up decreasing and declining,

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.705
a declining percentage.

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:52.818
The percentage on the line of best fit,

00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:55.187
it's increasing, we have a positive slope.

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:57.903
And I said it's approximately 1.25%.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.376
That's pretty close to
this one right over here.

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:05.376
The reason why there is some imprecision

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.297
over here is because I just eyeballed it.

00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:10.757
I just eyeballed this
chart right over here.

00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:13.312
I said okay, this looks
like it's about eight years.

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:16.156
It actually might have covered 10%

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.036
and a little bit less than eight years,

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:20.288
so there's a little imprecision over here.

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:21.925
So these are all approximations,

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:24.154
but even with the approximations I got,

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:26.082
I got very close.

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:28.210
I got very close to this answer,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.186
and much closer to this answer

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:31.898
than I'd got to any of the other ones.
