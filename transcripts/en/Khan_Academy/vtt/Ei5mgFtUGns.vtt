00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.596
- Dominique drew a 72 centimeter
line on the playground

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.535
with blue chalk.

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:09.729
So the line that she drew,

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.610
maybe it looks something like that.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.233
And that is 72 centimeters,

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:15.788
72 centimeters long.

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:19.539
So from there to there is 72 centimeters.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.509
And another line with pink chalk that is,

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.252
so let's do this with pink chalk,

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:27.397
another line with pink
chalk that is 14 centimeters

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.672
longer than the blue line.

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:31.113
So let me draw the other line.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:33.794
So the other line, whoops.

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:37.416
The other line is going to
be 14 centimeters longer.

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:40.213
So maybe it looks something like that.

00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:41.735
So it's definitely going to be longer.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.593
And it's 14 centimeters longer,

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:48.457
so if we go from here to here,
that's going to be the same,

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:50.740
should maybe make it the same length,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.472
this is going to be the 72 centimeters.

00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:55.154
That's 72 centimeters.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.615
But it's also another 14 centimeters.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.773
So it's gonna be 14 centimeters longer.

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:04.336
So how long is a pink chalk
line that Dominique drew?

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.516
Well you would just add the 72 plus 14.

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:11.313
So 72 plus 14 is equal to,

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:13.414
two ones plus four ones is six ones,

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:16.538
seven 10s plus one 10 is eight 10s.

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:19.938
So this longer line
here is going to be 86,

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:22.934
86 centimeters.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.047
Let's do another one.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.295
So we're told a cable on
the Golden Gate Bridge

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.756
is 33 meters long.

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:36.389
Another cable is 13 meters
longer than the first cable.

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.712
Let me do this in a different color.

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:41.055
Is 13 meters longer than the first cable.

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:44.516
How long would the cables
be if lined up end to end?

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:46.372
So they're not just saying,
"How long is the longer one?"

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.916
Like they did in the last example.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.087
They want to know how long are the cables

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:52.293
if you line them up end to end?

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:55.009
So this first cable is 33 meters.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.670
Let me draw it this way.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.431
So the first cable is 33 meters long.

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.752
33, and actually why
don't I draw it this way,

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:06.908
because this is what the cables
would actually look like.

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:09.940
So this cable is 33...

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.828
33 meters long.

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:17.728
Another cable is 13 meters
longer than the first cable.

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.272
So this other cable right over here

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.710
is 13 meters longer.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.707
So this cable right here
is 13 meters longer.

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.693
So what's the length of this cable?

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.004
Well it's going to be the
length of the first one,

00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.384
33, plus 13.

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:31.370
It's 13 meters longer.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.412
Plus 13, that gets us...

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:34.713
three plus three is six,

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:36.024
three plus one is four.

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:38.903
This one over here is gonna be 46 meters.

00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:41.782
Now they didn't just ask, "How
long is the second cable,"

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:43.152
which is 46 meters.

00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:46.360
They're asking, "How
long would the cables be

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.004
"if we lined them up end to end?"

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.464
So if we lined the 33 meter one,

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.624
so if we lined up the 33 meter one,

00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:55.342
and then right next to that,

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.544
we, right next to that,
put the 46 meter one.

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:01.448
So if we did something like that.

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.189
Well we know that this one
over here is 33 meters,

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.509
and the next one is 46 meters,

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.608
so we would have to add
33 plus 46 to figure out

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:14.184
how long they would be end to end.

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:15.845
And what is that gonna be?

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:19.888
So if we say 33 plus 46,

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:22.241
plus 46,

00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:24.980
three ones plus six ones is nine ones,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.047
three 10s plus four 10s is 70, sorry...

00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:30.806
three 10s plus four 10s is seven 10s.

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:35.392
So it's going to be 79
meters if we line them up

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:37.642
end to end.

00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:41.062
Let's do one more.

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:45.519
Reynaldo has a 36 centimeter scarf.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.258
So he has a 36 centimeter scarf.

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:50.314
He decides to cut out part of the scarf

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.192
so it is now only 19 centimeters.

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.920
How many centimeters did
Reynaldo cut off of his scarf?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.753
So let's draw his scarf.

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:00.986
So it was a 36 centimeter scarf,

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:03.431
so it might've looked something like this.

00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.218
So this was his scarf before,
if I stretch it all out,

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:08.598
and it is 36 centimeters,

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:12.012
36 centimeters long.

00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:13.741
But he cuts part of his scarf

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.958
so it's only 19 centimeters long.

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.807
So now it is only 19 centimeters.

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:22.737
So after he cut it, it's gonna
look something like this.

00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:24.163
Actually maybe I'll...

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:26.418
actually, I'll draw it in green again.

00:04:26.418 --> 00:04:27.451
So after he cuts it,

00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.109
his scarf is gonna look
something like this.

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:31.978
It's gonna look something like this,

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:34.358
where now it's only 19 centimeters.

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.390
19 centimeters.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.352
So how much did he cut off?

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:39.990
Well what he cut off is
going to be the difference

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.696
between 36 and 19.

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:44.168
He would have had to cut off,

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.347
he would have had to cut off

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:49.531
all of this right over here
in order to get it down to 19.

00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:51.075
So much would he have to cut off?

00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:54.348
Well this right over here
is going to be 36 minus 19.

00:04:54.348 --> 00:04:57.145
It's the difference between 36 and 19.

00:04:57.145 --> 00:04:59.093
So let's figure out what that is.

00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:03.732
It's going to be 36 minus 19.

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:05.643
So let's see, if we...

00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:07.698
we have six ones, we want
to take away nine ones.

00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:08.964
So let's do a little bit of regrouping.

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:10.125
Let's take one of our 10s here,

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:13.364
so instead of three 10s, we have two 10s.

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.303
And then if we add that
10 to the ones place,

00:05:15.303 --> 00:05:18.262
instead of six ones,
we're gonna have 16 ones.

00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:21.617
16 minus nine is seven.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:24.937
Two 10s minus one 10 is one 10.

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:26.958
So he would have had to cut off

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.721
17 centimeters of his scarf.

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:31.695
If he started with 36 centimeters,

00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:34.063
he cuts off 17 centimeters,

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:38.090
he's going to be left with 19 centimeters.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.740
And you could do that
the other way around.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.697
You could start with 36, you could cut 17,

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:44.941
and see what you end up with.

00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:48.259
You're going to see
that you end up with 19.
