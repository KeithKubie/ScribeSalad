00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.680
Eudaimonia is an Ancient Greek word, particularly
emphasised by the philosophers Plato and Aristotle,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.030
that deserves wider currency because it corrects
the shortfalls in one of the most central,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.640
governing but insufficient terms in our contemporary
idiom: happiness. When we nowadays try to

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.130
articulate the purpose of our lives, it is
to the word happiness we commonly have recourse.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.900
We tell ourselves and others that the ultimate
rationale for our jobs, our relationships

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.359
and the conduct of our day to day lives is
the pursuit of happiness. It sounds like an

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:46.010
innocent enough idea, but excessive reliance
on the term means that we are frequently unfairly

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.309
tempted to exit or at least heavily question
a great many testing but worthwhile situations.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.369
The Ancient Greeks resolutely did not believe
that the purpose of life was to be happy;

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:08.710
they proposed that it was to achieve Eudaimonia,
a word which has been best translated as ‘fulfilment’.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.960
What distinguishes happiness from fulfilment
is pain. It is eminently possible to be fulfilled

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.980
and – at the same time – under pressure,
suffering physically or mentally, overburdened

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.240
and, quite frequently, in a tetchy mood. This
is a psychological nuance that the word happiness

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.680
makes it hard to capture; for it is tricky
to speak of being happy yet unhappy or happy

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.660
yet suffering. However, such a combination
is readily accommodated within the dignified

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.710
and noble-sounding letters of Eudaimonia.
The word encourages us to trust that many

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.050
of life’s most worthwhile projects will
at points be quite at odds with contentment

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.170
and yet worth pursuing nevertheless. Properly
exploring our professional talents, managing

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.500
a household, keeping a relationship going,
creating a new business venture or engaging

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.480
in politics… none of these goals are likely
to leave us cheerful and grinning on a daily

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.959
basis. They will, in fact, involve us in all
manner of challenges that will deeply exhaust

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.380
and ennervate us, provoke and wound us. And
yet we will perhaps, at the end of our lives,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.279
still feel that the tasks were worth undertaking.
Through them, we’ll have accessed something

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:38.420
grander and more interesting than happiness:
we’ll have made a difference. With the word

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.159
Eudaimonia in mind, we can stop imagining
that we are aiming for a pain-free existence

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:50.780
– and then berating ourselves unfairly for
being in a bad mood. We’ll know that we

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.499
are trying to do something far more important
than smile: we’re striving to do justice

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:03.719
to our full human potential and to work in
some small but key way towards the improvement

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.800
of our species.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
At The School of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.320
to that end we've also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
