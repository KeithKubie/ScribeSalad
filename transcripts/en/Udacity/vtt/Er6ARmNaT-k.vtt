00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Would it be the total number of Web users?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.160
Well, for an Android game, they're not on the Web.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.100
They might hear about it on the Web,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.180
but that's not really gonna help you understand the served available market.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.600
Is is the total number of mobile phone users?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.870
Well, that might be the total available market,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.430
but you're really interested in just the Android piece

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.800
and so number 3 might make sense,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.760
the total number of active Android users.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.340
But if we get a little more sophisticated,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.950
we'd understand that the real answer is number 4;

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.460
it's not only the total number of active Android users,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.290
but they need the right level of the operating system

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.620
to support the particular game's features,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.020
and so you really want to get the SAM

00:00:36.020 --> 99:59:59.000
as tightly defined as you can.
