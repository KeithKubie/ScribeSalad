00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.450
Next concept is information hiding, developed by David Parnas. And

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.010
it has to do with encapsulating the capabilities that a particular module

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.160
has behind an abstract interface. After all, if the rest of the world

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.430
that's going to make use of that module only knows the abstract interface.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.990
It gives you freedom later to change the implementation details without breaking

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.420
all the client programs. One key example of information hiding is if

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.230
you're dealing with a system that has access to many hardware devices,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.100
hiding that access to the devices behind an abstract interface.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.600
See if you can come up with some other good examples of places in

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.870
the system where you might like to hide information behind abstract interfaces.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.240
Some typical examples include access to a database or some server some place,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.320
the specifics of an algorithm or how you're implementing, a data structure.
