desire to punish bad behavior and so

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489
desire to punish bad behavior and so
 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.009
desire to punish bad behavior and so
we've done studies where we bring people

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019
we've done studies where we bring people
 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.959
we've done studies where we bring people
into the lab and we manipulate their

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969
into the lab and we manipulate their
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.809
into the lab and we manipulate their
serotonin levels drive them down or

serotonin levels drive them down or
 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.649
serotonin levels drive them down or
drive them up temporarily I look to see

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659
drive them up temporarily I look to see
 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.139
drive them up temporarily I look to see
how likely people are to punish unfair

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149
how likely people are to punish unfair
 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.469
how likely people are to punish unfair
behavior and and what are the brain

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479
behavior and and what are the brain
 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.509

correlates of those decisions and one

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519
correlates of those decisions and one
 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.069
correlates of those decisions and one
thing that we found repeatedly is that

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079
thing that we found repeatedly is that
 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.190
thing that we found repeatedly is that
when we temporarily lower serotonin this

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200
when we temporarily lower serotonin this
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
when we temporarily lower serotonin this
makes people more likely to punish

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
makes people more likely to punish
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.080
makes people more likely to punish
unfair behavior and what we see in the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
unfair behavior and what we see in the
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.139
unfair behavior and what we see in the
brain concurrently is that the striatum

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149
brain concurrently is that the striatum
 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.190
brain concurrently is that the striatum
is more active when people are punishing

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
is more active when people are punishing
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.730
is more active when people are punishing
so by changing the levels of this

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740
so by changing the levels of this
 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.859
so by changing the levels of this
neurotransmitter we can actually change

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869
neurotransmitter we can actually change
 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.560
neurotransmitter we can actually change
the motivational value of punishment

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570
the motivational value of punishment
 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.340
the motivational value of punishment
this is interesting because serotonin is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350
this is interesting because serotonin is
 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.889
this is interesting because serotonin is
a neurotransmitter whose raw ingredient

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899
a neurotransmitter whose raw ingredient
 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.919
a neurotransmitter whose raw ingredient
you can only get from your diet so the

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929
you can only get from your diet so the
 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.209
you can only get from your diet so the
building block of serotonin is

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219
building block of serotonin is
 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.550
building block of serotonin is
tryptophan tryptophan is an essential

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
tryptophan tryptophan is an essential
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.300
tryptophan tryptophan is an essential
amino acid which means you can only

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310
amino acid which means you can only
 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.370
amino acid which means you can only
intake tryptophan by eating enough

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380
intake tryptophan by eating enough
 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.800
intake tryptophan by eating enough
proteins so this means that this

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
proteins so this means that this
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.630
proteins so this means that this
neurotransmitter system may be very

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640
neurotransmitter system may be very
 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.760
neurotransmitter system may be very
finely attuned to the relative abundance

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770
finely attuned to the relative abundance
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.709
finely attuned to the relative abundance
or scarcity of resources in the

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719
or scarcity of resources in the
 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.529
or scarcity of resources in the
environment it may be the case that when

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539
environment it may be the case that when
 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.319
environment it may be the case that when
resources are relatively scarce this

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329
resources are relatively scarce this
 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.660
resources are relatively scarce this
could affect serotonin levels which then

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670
could affect serotonin levels which then
 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.200
could affect serotonin levels which then
could sensitize people to unfairness

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210
could sensitize people to unfairness
 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.969
could sensitize people to unfairness
lack of cooperation and make them more

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979
lack of cooperation and make them more
 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.040
lack of cooperation and make them more
likely to punish and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050
likely to punish and
 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.710
likely to punish and
proximate mechanism for that is it makes

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
proximate mechanism for that is it makes
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.710
proximate mechanism for that is it makes
the act of punishment perhaps more

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
the act of punishment perhaps more
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160
the act of punishment perhaps more
valuable or rewarding the ultimatum game

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
valuable or rewarding the ultimatum game
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.080
valuable or rewarding the ultimatum game
is a situation where two people have to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
is a situation where two people have to
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.660
is a situation where two people have to
agree on how to split the sum of money

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
agree on how to split the sum of money
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.420
agree on how to split the sum of money
or some other resource or neither person

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
or some other resource or neither person
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.620
or some other resource or neither person
gets any money so it's a two-step game

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
gets any money so it's a two-step game
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.350
gets any money so it's a two-step game
in the first step the proposer gets the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360
in the first step the proposer gets the
 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.010
in the first step the proposer gets the
resource and makes a proposal to the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020
resource and makes a proposal to the
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.800
resource and makes a proposal to the
responder the second person about how to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
responder the second person about how to
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440
responder the second person about how to
divide that up so it could be let's say

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
divide that up so it could be let's say
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.949
divide that up so it could be let's say
$20 and the proposer makes an offer to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959
$20 and the proposer makes an offer to
 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.250
$20 and the proposer makes an offer to
the responder of say five dollars out of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
the responder of say five dollars out of
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.610
the responder of say five dollars out of
the 20 the responder then has the option

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
the 20 the responder then has the option
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680
the 20 the responder then has the option
of accepting that offer in which case

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690
of accepting that offer in which case
 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.770
of accepting that offer in which case
both players are paid those amounts or

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
both players are paid those amounts or
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.470
both players are paid those amounts or
they can reject the offer in which case

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
they can reject the offer in which case
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.620
they can reject the offer in which case
neither player gets any money so they

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
neither player gets any money so they
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.500
neither player gets any money so they
can essentially destroy the whole pie if

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
can essentially destroy the whole pie if
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.320
can essentially destroy the whole pie if
they're unsatisfied with the offer

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330
they're unsatisfied with the offer
 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.280
they're unsatisfied with the offer
hundreds and hundreds of studies have

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
hundreds and hundreds of studies have
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.620
hundreds and hundreds of studies have
been run with ultimatum games when it

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
been run with ultimatum games when it

was first published in the eighties

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
was first published in the eighties
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.880
was first published in the eighties
economists were very surprised that the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890
economists were very surprised that the
 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.160
economists were very surprised that the
average person was very likely to reject

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
average person was very likely to reject
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.020
average person was very likely to reject
any offer that fell below around 30%

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030
any offer that fell below around 30%
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.420
any offer that fell below around 30%
from a rational choice perspective that

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
from a rational choice perspective that
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.320
from a rational choice perspective that
takes only money outcomes into account

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330
takes only money outcomes into account
 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.670
takes only money outcomes into account
this is irrational in the sense that

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
this is irrational in the sense that
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.380
this is irrational in the sense that
some money is better than no money so

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390
some money is better than no money so
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.199
some money is better than no money so
why would you reject any nonzero offer

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209
why would you reject any nonzero offer
 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.470
why would you reject any nonzero offer
in the game but of course the the beauty

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480
in the game but of course the the beauty
 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940
in the game but of course the the beauty
of this game is that it demonstrates

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950
of this game is that it demonstrates
 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.770
of this game is that it demonstrates
very powerfully that people care about a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780
very powerfully that people care about a
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780
very powerfully that people care about a
whole lot more than just money they care

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
whole lot more than just money they care
 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.830
whole lot more than just money they care
about being respected about fairness and

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840
about being respected about fairness and
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.430
about being respected about fairness and
they really dislike being in a situation

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
they really dislike being in a situation
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.740
they really dislike being in a situation
of disadvantageous inequality so for

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
of disadvantageous inequality so for
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.229
of disadvantageous inequality so for
someone who's offered a very small

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239
someone who's offered a very small
 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.740
someone who's offered a very small
portion of the total pie it's worth it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
portion of the total pie it's worth it
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.080
portion of the total pie it's worth it
to them to forego that small amount in

political events that we've seen over
 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.399
political events that we've seen over
the past few years because economic
