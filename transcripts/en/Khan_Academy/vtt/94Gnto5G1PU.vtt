00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.840
Let P of t denote the number of people P

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.700
at the Copacabana beach in Rio de
Janeiro, t

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.809
hours past midnight on a specific day.
What does the statement P of 5

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
less than P of 9 mean? So before I
read these, let's think about this.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.699
So this is the number of people five
hours past midnight on a specific day. So

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
this is saying that the number of people
five hours past midnight

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is less than the number of people nine
hours past midnight

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.020
at Copacabana beach. So the number of people
five hours past midnight

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.460
is less than the number people nine
hours past midnight. Let's get into these choices.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
The time at which there were five people
at the beach

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
is earlier than the time there were nine
people.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.100
Who know? --  the five and the nine aren't 
the number of people

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.180
This is the time. This is the input into
the function. The

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.620
input into the function is time. This
gives people as a function of time. You

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.590
give a time.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.350
You give a time. This function P, it outputs

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.060
P of t, which is equal to the number of
people

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.500
number of people on the beach

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.979
at time, at time

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.400
t. So this five -- this is the input. This is
the time five hours after

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.610
I shouldn't say time t. I guess you
could say

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.970
a.m. time -- t hours past midnight at

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.820
t hours past midnight, hours past

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020
past midnight. midnight.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.950
So we can definitely rule this out. This
isn't talking about five people or nine

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.860
people. This is talking about

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.610
five hours after midnight is input and
how many people we have five hours after

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.240
midnight

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.619
is how many people we have nine hours
after midnight. 5 a.m.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.740
is an earlier time the 9 a.m. Well,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.590
that is a true statement but that's not
what this statement is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.950
saying. It's not -- this isn't giving us
information which is no from,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.729
I guess, how we think about time or how
we measure time.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.810
the 5 a.m. is earlier than 9 a.m. but
that's not what this statement is trying

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.320
to say.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.890
So rule that out.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.440
There were more people at the beach at
9 a.m.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.690
So to be clear, people at the beach at
9 a.m.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.890
that's that right over here -- than there were

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.870
-- than there were at 5 a.m. -- than there were
at 5 a.m. Well, that's right over there.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.319
And we see -- we see this quantity here
is greater than those magenta quantity

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.140
is indeed greater than this green quantity. 
The green quantity

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.940
is less than the magenta quantity, so we
would definitely pick that one.
