00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.290
(chimes jingle)

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Presenter] This program is presented

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.240
by University of California Television.

(light music)

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
- Good afternoon, I'm Jay
Wallace, Professor of Philosophy

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.710
and Chair of the Howison Lectures
Committee at UC Berkeley.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.250
I'm very pleased on behalf
of both the Howison Committee

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.850
and the Graduate Council

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.890
to welcome you to this year's
Howison Lecture in Philosophy.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.690
Before I begin my introduction
of today's Howison lecturer,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.920
I'd like to say a few
words about the occasion

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.493
that brings him here today.

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:20.690
The Howison Lectures were established

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.750
by friends of George Holmes Howison

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.610
in honor of his many contributions

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.283
to the University of California.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.560
Howison was born in 1834.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.110
Following college in Marietta, Ohio

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.970
shortly after the Civil
War, he moved to St. Louis

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.980
and became a member of that
city's philosophical society,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.530
where he had an opportunity

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.650
to meet with influential
thinkers of the day,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.453
including Ralph Waldo
Emerson and William James.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.930
In 1884, after a six-year professorship

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.380
at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.380
Howison accepted an offer

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.940
to join the University of California

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.863
as founding member of the
Department of Philosophy.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.380
This included an appointment

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.730
as Mills Professor of Intellectual

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.720
and Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.973
which was the university's
first endowed chair.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.920
With a strong, outgoing personality,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.540
Howison made philosophy a factor
not only in the university

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.170
but in the surrounding community as well.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.120
He took great interest in his students

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.170
and was influentially
involved in their lives.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.990
He taught at the university until 1909

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.853
and died six years later at the age of 81.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.220
Howison left all his
property to the university,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.590
creating several endowments
that have supported

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.650
many important academic
endeavors on our campus.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.050
In 1919, friends and formers
students of Professor Howison

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.160
established the Howison
Lectures in Philosophy

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.603
at the University of
California in his honor.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.830
Those of you who have been
at Berkeley for some time

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.980
will know what a remarkable
legacy and memorial

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.410
this lecture series has become.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.060
The list of past Howison lecturers

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.400
that's printed in your program

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.850
includes many of the most
important and influential thinkers

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.310
of the past century.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.160
And the large audience that
these lectures routinely attract

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.890
even on a beautiful
Northern California day

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.130
is a testimony to the continuing
vitality at our university

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.780
of the subject that Howison
helped to introduce here.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.230
We are greatly indebted
to Professor Howison,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.290
to those who established this
lectureship in his honor,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.640
and to the many other friends

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.430
whose generosity has done
so much to make Berkeley

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.970
a leading center for research
and teaching in philosophy.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.340
And I will take this opportunity
to add as I do every year

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.710
that our capacity for gratitude
has not yet been exhausted

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.110
in case some of you might wish
to emulate Professor Howison

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.210
and his friends and former students

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.983
in supporting the study of
philosophy on our campus.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.490
Our Howison lecturer for this
year is Professor Bob Brandom

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.620
who has established a towering reputation

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.630
as one of the most significant
and wide-ranging philosophers

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.603
of the present day.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.060
Professor Brandom was an
undergraduate at Yale University

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.170
where he studied philosophy,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.040
receiving the BA degree in 1977

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.140
with exceptional distinction in the major,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.760
an honor that is bestowed
only occasionally

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.490
according to Yale College

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.970
to Yale students whose work
is, quote, extraordinary

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.960
even when compared to the
work of other students

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.353
who receive distinction.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.570
He continued his philosophical studies

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.690
at Princeton University

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.510
where he held a Whiting
Fellowship from 1974 to 1976

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.510
and a Porter Ogden Jacobus
Fellowship in 1975 to '76.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.870
He received the PhD from Princeton in 1977

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.620
with a dissertation
supervised by Richard Rorty

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.483
on practice and object.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.790
Professor Brandom joined

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.270
the Distinguished Philosophy Department

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.660
at the University of Pittsburgh in 1976,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.630
and expressing a kind
of institutional loyalty

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.500
that is rare in this era
of the academic free agent,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.690
he has remained a member

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.883
of the Pittsburgh Department ever since.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.724
His many contributions to
the excellent department

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:15.680
that has been his academic home

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.233
includes service as its
Chair from 1993 to 1997.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.250
He was Distinguished Service
Professor of Philosophy

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.430
at Pittsburgh from 1998 to 2007,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.730
and he now holds the title

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.780
of Distinguished Professor of Philosophy.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.540
Professor Brandom is a
searching and systematic thinker

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.740
who has made prolific

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.580
and extremely influential contributions

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.770
to contemporary discussions

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.590
on a wide range of important issues.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.390
The animating spirit of his work

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.410
is to understand language
and thought inferentially

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.110
in terms of what Wilfrid Sellars called

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.210
the game of giving and asking for reasons.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.920
To be sapient on this approach

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.540
is essentially to be a participant

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.690
in a certain kind of social practice,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.790
one whose participants keep score

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.303
on each other's commitments
and entitlements.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.530
This vision, which draws
on sources as diverse

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.530
as Frege, Hegel, and the
pragmatist tradition in philosophy,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.780
finds impressive expression
in Professor Brandom's

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.010
first and most influential
book, Making it Explicit,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.690
which was published by Harvard
University Press in 1994

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.760
and which, despite its massive dimensions,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.220
was immediately recognized as
one of the works of philosophy

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.580
that you had to read

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.253
if you were a serious
student of the subject.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.720
The influence of this book
was also truly international

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.090
as I can personally attest

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.980
from my time as a professor and
frequent visitor in Germany,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.070
where Professor Brandom is widely regarded

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.540
as the most significant
American philosopher

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.880
of his generation, if not this most

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.530
significant philosopher
(speaks in foreign language)

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.980
as they would say over there.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.360
Making it Explicit is a truly
magisterial accomplishment,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.010
the product of many years of
deep and systematic reflection.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.370
The author of a work such as this

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.970
could have been forgiven
for resting on his laurels.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.530
In the years since the appearance

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.810
of his first major work, however,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.950
Professor Brandom has
continued to philosophize

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.770
at a remarkable pace,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.220
producing several new
volumes in recent years,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.830
including Articulating Reasons from 2000,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.610
Between Saying and Doing from 2008,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.383
and Reason and Philosophy from 2009.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.420
The systematic contributions
contained in these

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.160
and other works by Professor Brandom

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.720
are nourished by his intensive engagement

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.710
with figures from the
history of philosophy,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.760
and the fruits of this
engagement can be sampled

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.360
in two further volumes that
he's recently published,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.060
Tales of the Mighty Dead from 2002

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.033
and Perspectives on Pragmatism from 2011.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.620
He's been at work for many years

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.910
on a major study of themes
from the philosophy of Hegel,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.160
which the philosophical
world is looking forward to

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.683
with eager anticipation.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.060
Professor Brandom's accomplishments

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.940
have been extensively
and rightly acknowledged

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.040
in the larger world of the academy.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.140
He was elected a Fellow

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.070
of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences in 2000,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.240
and he's held fellowships
at the Stanford Center

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.810
for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.600
and at All Souls College in Oxford.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.610
He gave the prestigious
John Locke Lectures

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.650
in the University of Oxford in 2006

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.980
and the Woodbridge Lectures at
Columbia University in 2007.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.090
He maintains a punishing travel schedule,

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.720
and his work has been featured

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.120
at multi-day conferences and workshops

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.610
in many different
countries around the world,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.950
including, this is just
a small sample of them,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.810
Latvia, Spain, Taiwan, Argentina, Germany,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.023
and the Czech Republic.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.220
He was awarded a Distinguished
Achievement Award

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:55.300
in the Humanities Award

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.523
from the Andrew Mellon Foundation in 2004.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.560
In addition to today's lecture,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.840
Professor Brandom will
be speaking tomorrow

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.440
in the Philosophy Department

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.440
on Modal Expressivism and
Modal Realism Together Again.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.100
That will be at 4:10 p.m. tomorrow

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.880
in the Howison Library in Moses Hall.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.170
His topic today is Reason, Genealogy,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.400
and the Hermeneutics of Magnanimity.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.710
So please join me now in
welcoming Professor Brandom

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.977
to Berkeley as this
year's Howison lecturer.

00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:30.977
(audience applauds)

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.820
- Well, thank you, Jay.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.540
It's a pleasure to be back at Berkeley

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.720
where I have so many friends,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.450
and it's an honor to be doing so

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.483
under the aegis of the Howison Lecture.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.317
Hegel said, "To him who looks
on the world rationally,

00:09:53.317 --> 00:09:55.447
"the world looks rationally back."

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.697
More than half a century
later, Nietzsche said,

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:01.997
"When you stare long into the abyss,

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:04.217
"the abyss stares back into you."

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.990
These paired (speaks in
foreign language) passages

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.540
express in gnomic aphorisms

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.560
sentiments that mark the
endpoint of a critical arc

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.823
of 19th century philosophical thought.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.760
Hegel's sunny homily
epitomizes the optimism

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.280
of his version of the
Enlightenment rationalism

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.040
that flourished in the previous century.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.730
Nietzsche's darker remark
foreshadows the pessimism

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.960
of a distinctive kind of nihilism

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.150
rooted in reductive naturalism,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.980
which the events of the following century

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.163
would make both familiar and fitting.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.710
Each of these successive 19th
century currents of thought,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.700
one looking back to what
had already been understood

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.080
and one pointing ahead to
what had yet to be dealt with,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.910
comes with a rationalizing
narrative of progress,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.300
the first of disenchantment by reason,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.213
the second of disillusionment with reason.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.820
It was always essential

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.730
to the self-understanding of Enlightenment

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.770
that it see itself as
the advent of something

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.390
both genuinely new and
essentially progressive.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.210
It defined itself by the contrast

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.810
between the light of reason

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.560
that it sought, developed, and celebrated,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.100
and the darkness from
which Enlightenment arose,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.800
and by which it was still surrounded

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.840
and would always be threatened,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.320
the shadows of superstition,
prejudice, and dogmatism

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.620
cast by arbitrary despotic power

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.970
sedimented in the merely
traditional institutions

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.230
with which those habits
of thought connived

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.773
and in which they thrived.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.230
The fundamental conceptual
innovation of the time

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.430
was not the focus on reason by itself.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.330
Philosophy, whose avatar is Socrates,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.020
had perennially championed reason.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.810
Nor is it the mere association
of reason with freedom.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.400
Know the truth and the
truth shall set you free,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.420
the Christian tradition
in the person of John

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.320
had already taught.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.840
What is wholly new in the
Enlightenment philosophy,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.070
its characteristic insight
is its identification

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.100
of that transformative emancipatory power

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.293
with reason in its critical function.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.950
The only authority it admits
as legitimate and legitimating

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.410
is the authority of the better reason,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.650
that peculiar normative force

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.570
compelling only to the rational

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.540
that had so fascinated
and puzzled the Greeks.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.050
And the Enlightenment
acknowledges no higher judge

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.210
competent to assess the
merits of competing reasons

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.310
than the natural light
which the capacities

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.590
of each individual
reasoning subject equip it.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.540
That's why Kant says (speaks
in foreign language).

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.120
Dare to understand.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.300
This is the motto of enlightenment

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.460
in his essay identifying enlightenment

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.223
as man's relief from his
self-imposed tutelage.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.230
The advent of an age

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.630
in which individuals accept no authority

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.160
transcending their own capacity
critically to assess reasons

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.420
is for Kant, speaking here
for the whole Enlightenment,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.983
nothing less than humanity's
coming to maturity.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.360
This emancipation is to be effected

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.100
by the wholesale replacement

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.490
of the traditional model of authority,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.720
which understands it exclusively
in terms of the obedience

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.390
owed by a subordinate to a superior,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.250
by a model that understands authority

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.450
exclusively in terms of the
force of impersonal reasons,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.223
assessable by all.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.020
Reasons, for Kant, can
accordingly be identified

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.220
as freedom in the form of autonomy.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.380
The authority of the
superior-in-power is abolished.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.850
Authority resides only in
one's own acknowledgement

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.853
of reasons.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.420
All the great philosophers

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.170
in the period from Descartes to Kant

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.474
were theorists of Enightenment.

00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:44.080
Hegel, though, is the first

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.430
to take the advent of modernity,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.860
for him, simply the single
most important thing

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.000
that's ever happened in human history,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.250
as his explicit topic.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.880
And further, he's the
first to appreciate it

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.220
not just as an intellectual phenomenon,

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.930
namely Enlightenment.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.700
He was the first to
conceptualize the economic,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.100
political, and social transformations

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.500
as all of a piece with
the intellectual ones.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.560
For Hegel, reason shows itself

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.500
as having the form of
a vast metanarrative,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.280
rationally reconstructing
the emergence of modernity

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.430
in all of its multifarious aspects.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.770
That narrative is
progressive and triumphalist.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.790
It's the emergence of reason as sovereign

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.040
both in individual subjective
self-consciousnesses

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.730
and in the social institutions

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.833
that they shape and that shape them.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.670
It's also and essentially, as Hegel says,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.830
the history of the progress of
the consciousness of freedom.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.000
Here two strands of the
Enlightenment come together,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.260
faith in the sovereignty of reason

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.770
and a narrative of the emerging
self-conscious realization

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.130
of that sovereignty,

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.240
which is the emancipatory power of reason.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.220
Freedom takes concrete
form only in the practical,

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.020
including the institutional,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.640
appreciation of the rational
nature of genuine authority,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.630
the idea that reasons alone
are normatively authoritative.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.730
This is reason's disenchantment

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.340
of the subordination model of authority

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.370
in favor of the model of autonomy

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.763
as consisting in acting for reasons.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.060
This intoxicating identification

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.370
of freedom and the
authority of critical reason

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.913
is the beating heart of German Idealism.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.900
In it, ideas that in
retrospect could be seen

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.450
to have been all along implicit
in Enlightenment rationalism

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.673
come to fully explicit
theoretical self-consciousness.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.050
And it's in just such a
context, Hegel thinks,

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.650
that countercurrents of
thought become visible

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.030
as also having been all along implicit

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.423
in that same tradition.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.320
In this case, a crucial
trajectory of 19th century thought

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.870
expresses the revenge of
Enlightenment naturalism

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.713
on Enlightenment rationalism.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.713
The form that revenge takes is genealogy.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.640
Genealogies directly
challenge the very idea

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.170
of the normative force
of the better reason,

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.300
which lies at the core

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.730
of the Enlightenment rationalist successor

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.773
to the traditional subordination
model of authority.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.930
The principal practitioners

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.320
of the genre I'm calling genealogy

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.530
were the great unmaskers
of the 19th century,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.990
above all, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.490
and closer to our own time,
we might add Foucault.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.393
What they unmasked were
the pretensions of reason.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.940
Kant had rigorously
enforced the distinction

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.520
between reasons and causes,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.940
criticizing Locke for
producing what he called

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.500
a mere physiology of understanding

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.830
rather than a proper epistemology

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.653
by running together issues of
justification and causation.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.470
We must separate, he insisted,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.940
the quid juris, the question of right,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.120
from the quid facti, the question of fact.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.910
The first is a matter of the
evidence for our beliefs,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.233
the second of their
matter-of-factual causal origins.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.440
When the great genealogists dug down

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.760
in the areas of discourse they addressed,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.573
they found causes underlying the reasons.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.640
Their enterprise can be rendered

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.070
in relatively moderate terms.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.030
What they diagnosed were
systematic distortions

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.750
in the structure of communication,
as Habermas puts it.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.290
For Marx, the distorting
causes were economic classes.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.280
For Nietzsche, they were
expressions of the will to power.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.610
For Freud, they were such
things as lingering echoes

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.760
of the child's role in the family romance.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.250
On the moderate
understanding of genealogy,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.380
those causal factors shape the reasoning

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.810
of those subject to them,
operating behind their backs,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.570
so that their own thoughts and actions

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.253
cannot be transparent to them.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.830
This way of thinking about things

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.090
at least leaves open the possibility

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.930
of emancipatory critical discourses,

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.290
which would make explicit those
distorting causal factors,

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.050
so breaking the hold
they have on reasoners

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.770
and moving them towards the ideal

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.713
of rational self-transparency.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.520
But I'm gonna be concerned here

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.760
with a more radical challenge
genealogy can be seen to make

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.520
to the Enlightenment's idea of reason.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.270
For one can take it that what
the genealogists dug down to

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.380
is not just causes distorting our reasons,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.820
but causes masquerading as reasons.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.180
When what we fondly believe
to be reasons are unmasked,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.110
all that remains is
blind causal processes.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.330
These processes have taken
on the guise of reasons,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.970
but in fact yield nothing
more than rationalizations.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.360
Genealogy in its most radical form

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.343
seeks to dispel the illusion of reason.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.160
Now as I shall use the term,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.150
genealogical explanations
concern the relation,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.230
genealogical explanations
concern the relations

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.280
between the act or state of
believing, on the one hand,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.093
and the content that's
believed, on the other.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.430
A genealogy explains
the advent of a belief,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.210
in the sense of a believing,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.800
an attitude, in terms of
contingencies of its etiology,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.150
appealing exclusively to
facts that are not evidence,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.110
that do not provide
reasons or justifications

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.993
for the truth of what's believed.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.790
In this sense, when it
occurs to the young person

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.900
that he's a Baptist

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.680
because his parents and
everyone they know are Baptists

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.190
and that had he been born
in a different community,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.740
he would with equal conviction

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.220
have held Muslim or Buddhist beliefs,

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.970
that's a genealogical realization.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.960
And as is evident already
in this mundane example,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.570
the availability of a
genealogical explanation

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.480
for a constellation of beliefs

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.390
can have the effect of
undercutting its credentials

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.143
as something to which one
is rationally entitled.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.760
The genealogy asserts counterfactual

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.800
or subjunctive conditionals

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.290
linking the possession of certain beliefs,

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.520
attitudes of believing,
to contingent events

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.640
whose occurrence does not provide evidence

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.150
for the truth of what's believed.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.730
If the believer had not
had a bourgeois upbringing,

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.730
were not driven by (speaks
in foreign language),

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.840
or had not had that childhood trauma,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.280
she would not have had the beliefs

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.380
about the justice of labor
markets, Christian ethics,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.420
or conspiracy theories that she does.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.930
None of those events, upon
which the genealogist asserts,

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.880
the holding of the beliefs in question

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.500
are counterfactually dependent, however,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.053
provide evidence for what's believed.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.670
For the particular
vocabularies they address,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.910
all of Marx, Nietzsche, and
Freud offer natural histories

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.970
of the advent of beliefs, believings,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.320
couched in those vocabularies,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.220
ones to which the rational
credentials of the beliefs,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.743
what's believed, are simply irrelevant.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.810
Natural, causal processes
of belief formation

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.620
are put in place of rational ones.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.030
To him who looks on the world reductively,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.003
the world looks reductively back.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.720
This movement of thought, too,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.970
comes with its native metanarrative

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.803
of progress and understanding.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.230
The earlier replacement

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.570
of theological necessity
with rational necessity

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.250
as the fundamental explanatory category

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.163
is disenchantment of the world by reason.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.840
The replacement of rational
necessity with natural necessity

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.113
is disillusionment with reason.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.120
From the genealogical point of view,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.470
the Enlightenment apotheosis
of reason just substituted

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.673
one ultimately supernatural
delusion for another.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.400
The Enlightenment was
right to be impressed

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.270
by the rise of the new science,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.010
to see it as requiring a
thoroughgoing transformation

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.150
of our understanding of
our relations to our world.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.240
But from the genealogical point of view,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.700
it was insufficiently radical.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.150
It naturalized and so
disenchanted the world,

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.780
but it didn't disenchant us.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.740
The Enlightenment conception

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.670
of individual knowers and agents

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.880
who brought about and
were in turn transformed

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.060
by the convulsions of modernity
retain a spark of divinity

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.973
in the form of the faculty of reason.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.640
The genealogical movement of
thought teaches by contrast

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.620
that the subjects and their relations

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.000
to the objects they know about and act on,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.320
no less than those objects themselves,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.283
must be thoroughly naturalized.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.980
But then what about the normative force

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.650
of the better reason?

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.560
Is it, too, just an illusion

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.150
arising from the play of natural forces?

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.060
Or can it somehow be
understood in terms of them?

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.120
Can we really understand
the natural science

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.330
that's the source of our
genealogies of our believings

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.483
itself entirely in
naturalistic terms, must we?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.530
In its most radical form,
the genealogical thought

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.958
is that if we can understand
the etiology of our believings

00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.290
and our preferrings, intendings, and so on

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.810
in terms of causes that do
not provide reasons for them,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.750
then talk of reasons is
shown to be out of place,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.773
not only superfluous,
but actively misleading.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.010
This metanarrative of genealogy

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.540
as unmasking illusions of reason

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.870
depends on the disjunction
causes or reasons

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.923
being exclusive, its
forcing a choice on us.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.360
Genealogy, in other words,
turns Kant's distinction

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.170
between causes and reasons back on itself.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.950
It becomes a snake that poisons itself

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.503
by biting its own tail.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.610
Now Marx and Freud
offer local genealogies.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.970
That is, they offer genealogical analyses

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.240
only of a specific range
of discursive practices,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.820
the use of only some vocabularies,

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.410
the vocabulary of political economy

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.630
or the vocabulary one uses to explicate

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.673
and make intelligible one's
psychological motivations.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.770
Though Nietzsche's most detailed stories

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.650
are also of this local
kind, he points the way

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.470
to the possibility of a more
global genealogical lesson,

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.450
that a suitably thoroughgoing
reductive naturalism

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.690
might undercut the rational credentials

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.560
not just of some parochial
region of our belief,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.520
but of the whole realm.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.890
The very idea of reason as
efficacious in our lives

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.110
would be called in question

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.970
by globalizing the genealogical enterprise

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.610
to extend it to all discourse.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.467
In this form, genealogy would
be what Tennyson called,

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:28.347
"the little rift within the lute

00:24:28.347 --> 00:24:30.767
"that by and by shall make the music mute

00:24:30.767 --> 00:24:33.647
"and ever widening slowly silence all."

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.667
This global geneological challenge

00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:39.370
would come to be expressed explicitly

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.120
in various forms in the 20th century,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.900
but the neo-Kantian Windelband

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.740
could already find it
implicit in the aspirations

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.820
of his 19th century historicist opponents.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.703
And it's this broader idea
that I want to consider.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.530
Globalized genealogical
arguments take a common form.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.260
They present causal etiologies

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.220
of states and events of believing,

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.690
thought of as episodes
in the natural world,

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.730
as rendering superfluous and
irrelevant appeal to reasons

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.990
that normatively entitle believers
to the contents believed.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.120
The thought is that all
the explanatory work

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.630
can be done by causes

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.620
with no work left to be done by reasons.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.920
And as a second, subsidiary task,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.230
one then explains the motives for which

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.230
and the structures by which
believers and theorists conceal

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.130
from themselves and from others

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.400
the underlying causal
processes of belief acquisition

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.860
under an obscuring veil
of what then show up

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.773
as mere rationalizations.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.150
All the great genealogists
of the 19th century

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.750
particularly relished
offering such metagenealogies.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.450
That's how they unmask our
conception of ourselves

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.430
as rational animals as
nothing more than an illusion

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.710
that puffs up and comforts animals

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.300
with the sort of natural needs
and interests that we have.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.120
Our need for that swaddling illusion

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.720
reveals us to be in essence
not, as we're pleased to think,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.900
autonomous rational animals,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.723
but merely needy, insecure,
rationalizing animals.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.160
At this level of generality,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.990
the genealogical challenge to reason

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.660
has the form of a
naturalistic reductionism

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.843
about the essentially normative
force of the better reason.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.790
I think it's illuminating to
compare this global challenge

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.850
with the more focused version
that Gilbert Harman addresses

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.793
to specifically moral normativity.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.140
He argues that the best explanation,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.080
indeed, a complete explanation,

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.450
of why people have the moral
normative attitudes they do,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.480
why they treat some acts as morally right

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.320
and others as morally wrong,

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.220
need appeal only to
other normative attitudes

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.000
of their own and others.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.920
It need not appeal to norms
or values in the form of facts

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.370
about what is actually
morally right or wrong.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.920
He contrasts this situation

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.910
with that concerning our
attitude towards electrons,

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.120
the best explanation
of which, he takes it,

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.610
must include reference
to facts about electrons

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.690
and our interactions with them.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.440
He concludes that we do not in the end

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.350
have reason to believe in the existence

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.170
of moral norms, reasons, or values,

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.573
as we do for the existence of electrons.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.890
A global version of this argument

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.510
addressed to the norms of
reason rather than of morality

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.470
would contend that a complete explanation

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.570
for people taking or treating some claims

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.140
as reasons for others need
appeal only to their attitudes

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.620
of taking or treating some
claims as reason for others,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.123
not to any facts about what
really is a reason for what.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.150
Propositional attitudes,
paradigmatically beliefs

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.700
would be treated just as features

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.370
of the natural history
of creatures like us,

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.530
and hence as explicable entirely in terms

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.083
of other such features, in
this case, further attitudes.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.170
Now I think that there's a
structural defect that afflicts

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.930
global reductive genealogical
stories of this kind.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.033
They depend on what I'll
call semantic naivete.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.310
Semantic naivete consists
in taking for granted

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.400
the conceptual contents of the attitudes

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.540
whose rational relations to one another

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.633
one wants to dissolve genealogically.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.110
If the attitudes in question

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.740
are not thought of as
propositionally contentful,

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.670
then the issue of rational
normative relations between them,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.470
of some of them as providing good reasons

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:27.370
entitling or committing one
to others, doesn't even arise,

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:32.070
as it does not for whirlpools,
thunderstorms, supernovae,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.890
and other natural occurrences

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.513
into whose causal
antecedents we might inquire.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.320
The question I see as
posing a counterchallenge

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.800
to genealogical challenges
to the very idea of reason

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.900
is whether and how one is to understand

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.260
the contentfulness of beliefs

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.823
apart from their situation in
a normative space of reasons.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.100
The overall point is that
epistemological claims,

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.760
including skeptical geneological ones,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.730
have semantic presuppositions.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.050
I'm gonna argue that the soft underbelly

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.920
of genealogical skepticism about reason

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.800
is its implicit commitment
to naive semantics.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800
When we look at things more closely,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.510
we'll see that the underlying
issue concerns the relation

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.740
between contingencies governing attitudes,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.270
what applications of concepts are taken

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.460
or treated as correct

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.560
according to the prevailing reasons,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.220
and norms to which those
attitudes are subject.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.640
Observations about the attitudes

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.140
provide the basis for the
genealogical challenge

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.763
to the intelligibility of the norms.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.090
The particular form of semantic
naivete I will identify

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.040
as crucial to this debate

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.460
turns out to be an assumption
about the relations

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.760
between semantic attitudes
and semantic norms

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.670
that's common both to
Enlightenment rationalism

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.043
and to genealogical challenges to it.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.220
The thinker who diagnoses
this shared presupposition,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.890
contests it, and offers a
constructive alternative

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.390
is Hegel, whom I will argue

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.810
both anticipates and responds creatively

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.740
to the genealogical currents
of thought he inspired

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.543
and in many ways made possible.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.720
Now I've described genealogical challenges

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.290
to our understanding of
ourselves as rational

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.510
both as rooted in Kant's distinction

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.540
between reasons and causes

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.640
and as expressing the revenge
of that distinction on itself.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.730
This is, of course, a
very crude formulation.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.040
To refine it, we need to fill in

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.723
some of the Kantian background.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.980
Kant brought about a revolution

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.810
in our understanding of the mind

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.950
by recognizing the essentially
normative character

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.063
of the discursive.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.810
In a decisive break with
the Cartesian tradition,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.320
he distinguishes judgments
and intentional actions

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.490
from the responses of
non-discursive creatures

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.650
not ontologically, by
their supposed involvement

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.770
with an ultimately spooky
kind of mental substance,

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.260
but deontologically, as
things their subjects

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.903
are in a distinctive way responsible for.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.290
What we believe and what we do
express commitments of ours.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.040
They're exercises of a kind of authority

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.300
distinctive of discursive creatures.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.540
Responsibility, commitment, authority,

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.190
these are all normative statuses.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.720
Concepts, which articulate
discursive acts of judging

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.760
and intentionally doing,
Kant says, are rules.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.020
They're rules that determine

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.510
what we've made ourselves responsible for,

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.660
what we've committed ourselves to,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.500
what we've invested our authority in.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.460
Appreciating the rulishness,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.700
the normative character of the mind,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.563
this is Kant's normative turn.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.040
Practically, what we're responsible for

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.100
and committed to doing in
investing our authority

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.690
in how things are or
ought to be, Kant thinks,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.500
is having reasons for those commitments.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.260
What our concepts are rules
for doing is reasoning.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.570
It's the concepts
articulating the contents

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.410
of our judgments and intentions

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.310
that determine what count as reasons

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.110
for and against thinking
or acting that way,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.180
what would entitle us to do so

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.620
or justify us in taking on commitments

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.493
with those conceptual contents.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.970
For Kant, as discursive creatures,

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.080
we live and move and have our being

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.483
in a normative space of reasons.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.240
After Descartes, the
challenge was to find a place

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.553
for mental stuff in a natural
world of physical stuff.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.190
After Kant, the challenge
became finding a place for norms

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.473
in a natural world.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.540
Descartes had been roundly criticized

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.710
for his dualism of minds and bodies.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.270
The danger is that the result

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.060
of Kant's revolutionary insight

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.610
into the normativity of intentionality

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.570
would be to replace that dualism

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.893
with a dualism of norm and fact.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.580
Now I take it that a
distinction becomes a dualism

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.150
when it's drawn in terms
that make the relation

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.163
between the distinguished items
ultimately unintelligible.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.440
I'll argue that the collision

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.919
between the possibility
of global genealogies

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:23.230
and understanding ourselves as rational

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.750
depends on a set of assumptions,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.920
which I'm gonna gather together

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.620
under the rubric of semantic naivete,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.633
that would turn Kant's
distinction into a dualism,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.330
but also that those
assumptions are optional

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.833
and indeed incorrect.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.890
I'll argue further that Hegel,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.870
intense and insightful
reader of Kant that he was,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.680
already understood all this

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.880
and offered a constructive alternative

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.750
that can provide a way forward for us

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.733
in thinking about these issues today.

00:33:54.069 --> 00:33:55.700
Kant's normative turn

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.780
expressed an insight in
discursive pragmatics,

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.620
our understanding of what we're doing

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.593
in judging and acting intentionally.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.700
He also moved beyond the
Cartesian tradition he inherited

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.080
in seeing that its characteristic
epistemological concerns

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.573
raised a more fundamental
semantic question.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.150
His idea here was that
if we properly understood

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.040
what it is for our thoughts
to be representations

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.470
in a sense of so much as
purporting to represent something,

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.460
the epistemological skeptical question

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.710
of what reason we have to think

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.340
that they ever correctly
represent something

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.713
would be revealed on semantic
grounds to be ill-posed.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.890
Hegel saw, however, that as penetrating

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.270
as these archaeological
semantic excavations were,

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.910
Kant failed fully to
appreciate and address

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.810
a crucial semantic question

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.073
raised by his original
normative pragmatic idea.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.520
Kant correctly saw that judging
and acting intentionally

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.550
are exercises of authority

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.430
that come with correlative
responsibilities,

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.490
commitments to having reasons for

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.430
and acknowledging consequences
of those undertakings.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.100
Kant already understood concepts
as functions of judgment

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.870
in the sense of rules that determine

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.580
what would count as a reason

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.880
for applying those concepts in judgment

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.310
and what the further
consequences of doing so are.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.420
In a strict sense, all Kantian
rational creatures can do

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.373
is apply concepts in judging and acting.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.960
So those discursive activities

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.453
presuppose the availability
of the concepts they deploy.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.670
But that presupposition raises in turn

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.080
the question faced by Kant's
rationalist hero Leibniz.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.260
Where do those concepts come from?

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.710
How do we get access to them?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.330
Once the discursive
enterprise is up and running,

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.390
new concepts can be formed downstream

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.520
from applications of old ones,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.610
e.g., by Kant's judgments of reflection.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.700
But what's the origin of
the concepts that make

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.810
empirical and practical
discursive activity possible

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.033
in the first place?

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.280
Hegel reads Kant as
having a two-stage story.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.650
Transcendental activity

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.940
is the source of the conceptual norms

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.240
that then govern empirical
discursive activity.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.300
The empirical self accordingly
always already finds itself

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.473
with a stock of determinate concepts.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.020
The transcendental processes

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.520
by which discursive norms are instituted

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.580
are sharply distinguished
from the empirical processes

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.103
in which those discursive
norms are then applied.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.490
In the 20th century, Rudolf
Carnap provides an index example

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.910
of this Kantian two-stage

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.583
semantic-epistemic explanatory strategy.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.160
In his version, the two stages correspond

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.600
to beginning by fixing meanings

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.520
and only then going on to fix beliefs.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.040
The first semantic stage
is selecting a language.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.680
The second epistemic stage
is selecting a theory,

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.690
a set of sentences
couched in that language

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.063
that are taken to be true.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.980
His student Quine objected to Carnap

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.530
that while this two-stage
procedure makes perfect sense

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.150
for formal or artificial languages,

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.360
it makes no sense for natural languages.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.180
All speakers do is use the language,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.670
Kant would say, to make judgments.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.410
That use must somehow determine

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.450
both what their expressions mean

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.743
and which sentences they take to be true.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.670
In the vocabulary I
use to talk about Kant,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.710
the use of language to express judgments

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.980
must be understood as effecting both

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.933
the institution of conceptual
norms and their application.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.810
Two-stage stories about
the division of labor

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.190
between semantics and epistemology,

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:40.250
that is, about the relation
between conceptual contents

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.290
and their application in judgment,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.653
are committed to semantic purity.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.010
This is the view that the
contents concepts possess

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.630
are not at all affected by
the use of those concepts

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.180
in making judgments, in
believing a particular subset

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.730
of the universe of believables.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.350
That's the point of having
a first semantogenic stage

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.200
at which contents are determined,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.010
conceptual norms are instituted,
before the second stage,

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.380
comprising the application of concepts

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.990
in taking things to be thus
and so, to be as represented

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.483
by some already contentful
representings and not others.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.070
Commitment to semantic purity

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.210
is commitment to the possibility
of pursuing semantics

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.160
independently of commitment
to how things actually are.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.060
The thought is that epistemic commitments

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.920
are not to contaminate semantic ones.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.780
Semantic commitments
are necessary conditions

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.310
only for the expression of epistemic ones.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.440
On this picture, two independent elements

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.960
combine to make epistemic
commitments, true claims,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.710
semantic commitments, picking a language,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.170
settling on contentful
concepts, and how the world is.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.203
And the second element is
simply irrelevant to the first.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:58.370
Now semantic purity is not
an unintelligible idea.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.750
It makes sense in the context

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.770
of stipulating associations
of semantic interpretants

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.850
with linguistic expressions
for artificial languages

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.860
by a theorist working

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.980
in a semantically more
powerful metalanguage.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.530
But semantic naivete results

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.610
when one believes that
semantic purity is intelligible

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.370
for an autonomous intentional stratum,

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.293
for natural languages, or
for thought in general.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.740
Quine objects to the semantic naivete

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.750
of commitment to the
possibility of pure semantics,

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.810
and in this regard makes common cause

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.210
with the later Wittgenstein.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.070
Both thinkers take it that all there is

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.530
to confer content on our expressions

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.540
is the way those expressions are used,

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.210
paradigmatically in making
claims and forming beliefs,

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.370
that is, in committing
ourselves to how things are.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.080
Two-stage theories about the division

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.290
of semantic and epistemological labor

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.280
for natural languages and
the thoughts they express,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.040
Quine and Wittgenstein think,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.330
are bound to invoke semantic
stories about the first stage

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:59.420
that make the notion of conceptual content

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.903
ultimately magical.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.580
They're committed to semantic purity.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.493
So when applied to natural
languages and thought,

00:40:07.493 --> 00:40:09.253
they're semantically naive.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.440
This is exactly Hegel's
complaint about Kant.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.730
He was uncharacteristically
but culpable uncritical

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.190
about the source and nature

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.060
of determinate conceptual contents.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.340
In this regard, at least,
Hegel stands to Kant

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.823
as Quine does to Carnap.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.720
And like Quine and Wittgenstein,

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.570
Hegel offers an ultimately
pragmatist account

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.460
of how using a natural
language can be intelligible

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.073
as both instituting and
applying conceptual norms.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.380
This line of thought bears directly

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.200
on the issue I started off by considering.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.480
For global genealogical reductive

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.910
explaining away of norms
in favor of attitudes

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.610
presumes that it's intelligible

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.200
for the contents of
propositional attitudes

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.710
to stay in place after
normative reason-relations

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.160
among their judgeable
contents are relinquished.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.850
Otherwise, what's being
explained genealogically

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.620
can no longer be understood as believings,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.410
as attitudes of taking
things to be thus and so.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.850
If our attitudes were not
genuinely conceptually contentful,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.560
then we would not be even
purporting to represent things

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.260
as being thus and so.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.020
Things would not even seem
to us to be thus and so.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.870
If disillusionment about the reality

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.510
of norms of reasoning
entails semantic nihilism,

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.030
then it's self-defeating.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.760
The genealogist's claims would entail

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.033
that her own claims are senseless.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.540
The overall point I want to make

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.100
is that taking the contents
of propositional attitudes

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.760
in general to be independent

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.720
of the government of those attitudes

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.060
by norms concerning what
genuinely is a reason for what

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.900
presupposes a semantically
naive two-stage account

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.393
of the division of semantic
and epistemic labor.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.510
For it requires that the contents
of propositional attitudes

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.850
have already somehow been fixed
in advance and independently

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:05.010
of the rough-and-tumble
of assessing evidence,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.390
balancing reasons, and
deciding what to believe.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.450
The semantic challenge

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.990
for the globalized Harmanian genealogist

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.930
is accordingly to say
how we're to understand

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:16.040
the contents of the attitudes

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.133
in favor of which genuine
norms have been eliminated.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.200
The corresponding challenge
for a one-stage account

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.680
is to explain how institution
of genuine conceptual norms

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.610
is compatible with the possibility

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:34.440
of genealogical explanation of
acts of applying such norms.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.410
Hegel understands this challenge

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.570
and offers an intricate
and sophisticated story

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.490
about the relations between
the institution and application

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.320
of conceptual norms,
including the relations

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.630
between discursive normative statuses

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.670
and discursive normative attitudes

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.790
that's aimed precisely at
meeting that challenge.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.270
And in the rest of this talk,

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.750
I want to present the
outlines of his story

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:57.983
as I understand it.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.170
One way into Hegel's
constructive alternative

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.260
to the semantic naivete
of two-stage theories

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.620
of the division of semantic
and epistemic labor

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.050
is through his conception
of the determinateness

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.593
of conceptual norms.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.530
What semantic purity claims
conceptual contents are pure of

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.950
is contamination by the epistemic,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.750
that is, by knowledge claims,

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.920
by judgments as to how
things actually are.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.710
The semantics of concepts,
Hegel's universals,

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.620
is supposed not to depend at all

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.400
upon epistemic commitments,
that is, on judgments,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.930
on the application of those universals

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.993
to particulars in judgment.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.960
Hegel's slogan for the
conceptual sea-change

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.880
he sees as necessary for
appreciating the interdependence

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.290
of semantic and epistemic commitments

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.720
is that we must move from
understanding the conceptual

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.080
in terms of the static
categories of Verstand

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.040
to understanding it in terms
of the dynamic categories

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.043
of Vernunft, adapting Kant's
terminology to his own use.

00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:12.050
Kantian concepts are determinate
in the Verstand sense

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.480
in that the rational relations

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.690
of consequence and
incompatibility between concepts,

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.830
which identify and individuate them,

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:22.230
are taken to be fully settled
in advance of any application

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.893
of those universals to
particulars in judgment.

00:44:26.036 --> 00:44:30.140
Kant envisaged an asymmetric
structure of capacities

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.020
in which a faculty of spontaneity

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.930
is the source of universals,

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.710
which are applied to particulars

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.903
supplied by a faculty of receptivity.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.250
In developing his successor
Vernunft conception,

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.430
Hegel takes over from Kant his insight

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.110
into the normative
character of concept use

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.270
and radicalizes it by
construing the relations

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.190
between universals and particulars itself

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.760
in normative terms of
authority and responsibility.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.880
Hegel says independence and dependence.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.590
Hegel takes his cue from the fact

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.040
that transposed into the normative key,

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.330
the relations of authority
and responsibility

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.530
between universals and particulars

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.472
are reciprocal and symmetric.

00:45:11.472 --> 00:45:14.560
Kant's system masks
that underlying symmetry

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.710
by an artificial, asymmetric division

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.390
of semantic and epistemic labor.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.240
Spontaneous exercises of
the semantic authority

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.970
of the understanding,
Verstand, over universals

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.780
are, for Kant, independent of and prior to

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.320
exercises of the epistemic
authority of particulars,

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.280
which determine the correctness
of application of universals

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.840
to those particulars in judgment.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.430
This overarching asymmetric structure

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.410
is a manifestation of Kant's understanding

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.070
of freedom and reason
in terms of autonomy,

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.373
what Hegel calls pure independence.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.800
According to Hegel's
symmetric normative construal

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.370
of the relations of
authority and responsibility

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.630
between universals and particulars,

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.390
the application of one
concept or universal

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.320
obliges one to apply
others to that particular

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.100
according to rational
relations of consequence

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.650
that articulate the content
of the concept or universal.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.330
And it precludes one from being entitled

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.610
to apply others to that particular

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.550
according to relations of
rational incompatibility

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.200
that also partially articulate

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.010
the content of that concept or universal.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.110
This is the authority of
universals over particulars,

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.133
the responsibility of
particulars to universals.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.320
There's a corresponding relation

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.160
of authority of
particulars over universal.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.560
For it can happen that
one applies a concept,

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.550
a universal to a particular

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.440
and the particular does not cooperate

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.790
in also exhibiting the universals
that are its consequences

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.490
or in also exhibiting universals

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.470
that are incompatible
with the original one.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.530
This, Hegel construes,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.220
as the particular exercising
authority over the universal,

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.360
telling it, as it were,
that it cannot have

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.750
the consequence and the
incompatibility relations

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.740
that it originally came with,

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.150
that is, that a different
universal is required.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.610
For Hegel, none of these
reciprocal relations

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.160
of authority and responsibility

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.240
between universals and particulars

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.490
should be understood as purely semantic

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.510
nor as purely epistemic.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.200
The clean division of
semantic and epistemic labor

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.260
is an artifact of semantically
naive two-stage accounts.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.920
Our judgments shape our concepts

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.423
no less than our concepts
shape our judgments.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.260
Hegel understands determinateness,

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.830
his (speaks in foreign language),

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:30.201
in terms of what he calls individuality,

00:47:30.201 --> 00:47:31.750
(speaks in foreign language).

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.480
Individuality, in turn, is a matter

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.690
of the characterization of
a particular by a universal,

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:37.960
which is something that has the form

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.593
of a fact or a judgment.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.170
As Kant emphasized, concepts
shape and articulate judgments.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.080
Hegel adds the idea that
judgment is a process

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.800
by which concepts are determined.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.480
The essence of Hegel's Vernunft conception

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.660
is an account of the structure
of the dynamic process

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.120
in which the whole constellation
of concepts and judgments

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.390
develops by the exercise
of the reciprocal authority

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.390
of universals over particulars

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.090
and particulars over universals.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.220
Judging, the application of
universals to particulars,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.350
is the development of individuals,

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:16.080
at once the semantic shaping
and determining of universals

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.680
and the epistemic discovery

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.223
of which universals apply
to which particulars.

00:48:21.433 --> 00:48:24.840
Kant's pure independence
model of semantic authority

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.910
as untrammeled by
corresponding responsibility

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.900
leaves it unclear what room there remains

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.200
for epistemic constraint.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.600
Why cannot the boundaries,

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.120
the implications and the
incompatibilities of the universal

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.390
that's been applied simply be redrawn

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.460
to accommodate any looming recalcitrance?

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.570
More deeply, what even counts

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.800
as changing the content of a
concept or universal for Kant?

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.300
What holds fixed in advance

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.870
the commitments one
undertakes by applying it

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.290
if its content is wholly up

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.330
to the spontaneous
activity of the subject?

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:59.170
The Kantian division of
semantic and epistemic labor

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.840
seems unable to exclude the possibility

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.370
that as Wittgenstein puts it,

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.800
whatever seems right to me is right,

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.720
in which case the issue of
right doesn't get a grip.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.400
There's just nothing
in the Kantian picture

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.220
to confer determinate
contents on concepts,

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.333
nor to hold them in place as determinate.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.680
What's needed, Hegel thinks,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.800
is to replace Kant's individualist model,

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.640
driven by his understanding
of freedom as autonomy,

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.783
with a social one.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.010
What Kant tried to accomplish

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.530
within the boundaries of
a single knowing subject

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.280
by the division of semantic
and epistemic labor

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.140
should be done rather

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.130
by a genuinely social division of labor.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.000
Concepts for Hegel are not to be found

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.330
between the ears of individual knowers,

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.603
but in the public
language that they speak.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.123
Language, he said, is the dasein of geist.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:50.910
This transposition of the issue

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.900
into a social, linguistic key
makes it clear how in judging

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.140
whose paradigm now becomes asserting,

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.840
I can bind myself by norms

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.220
provided by the concepts
I apply to particulars.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.030
It is, for instance, wholly up to me

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.560
whether I assert that the
coin is made of copper

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.580
rather than, say, manganese.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.970
But it's then not up to me

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.990
what else I've committed
myself to by claiming that

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.730
and what would entitle
me to that commitment.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.420
The metallurgical experts in my community

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.720
that my community charges

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.390
with the care and feeding
of the concept of copper

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.180
will hold me responsible
for having committed myself

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.230
to the coin's melting at a 1084 degrees C

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.720
and having precluded myself

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.820
from claiming that it's
an electrical insulator.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.620
Whether I know about these implications

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.170
is neither here nor there.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.340
They're features of the move
I've made in the language game.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.270
And it's my participation in that game

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.720
that permits me also to
think quietly to myself

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.580
that the coin is copper,

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.550
a thought that inherits its shared content

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:51.313
from claimables whose
sense the community fixes.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:56.020
On this model, the authority
of the individual speaker

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.090
is balanced by a
reciprocal responsibility.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.670
And the content I freely
committed myself to

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.190
and made myself responsible for

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.480
is held in place as determinate
by my fellow speakers,

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.310
whom I've authorized to
hold me responsible for it.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.800
What I'm responsible
for is what I've said,

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.003
not what I might later
claim to have meant.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.400
What Heidegger called

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.600
the dignity and spiritual
greatness of German Idealism

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.730
is founded on Kant's reconstrual

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:29.960
of self-conscious selfhood
as consisting in freedom

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.780
in a sense of authority,

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.370
specifically the authority to
commit oneself determinately,

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.060
the capacity to bind
oneself by conceptual norms,

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.620
to make oneself responsible to norms

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.020
that are rational in the
sense that they articulate

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.070
what's a reason for a
judgment or an action

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.170
that has that content.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:52.350
Hegel sees that self-consciousness
in this normative sense

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:55.190
is an essentially social achievement.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.110
The authority to make oneself responsible

00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:59.700
makes sense only in a context

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.110
in which one can be held responsible,

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:06.233
and that requires two loci of
authority and responsibility.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.970
Normative statuses, such as
authority and responsibility,

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.770
and the selves that are the
subjects of such statuses,

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.180
Hegel teaches, are instituted
by reciprocal recognition,

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.370
that is, by individuals practically taking

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:24.980
or treating one another as
authoritative and so responsible,

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:29.980
as having the authority to
make themselves responsible.

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.140
Those I recognize in this normative sense

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.080
of authorizing them to hold me responsible

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.963
form a recognitive community.

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.860
In telling language, Hegel says

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:45.110
that self-conscious individual
selves, normative subjects,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:49.040
are instituted only when
particular biological organisms

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.220
come to stand in recognitive
relations to one another,

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.760
a matter of their practical
normative attitudes,

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.010
and so come to be
characterized by the universal

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.400
that is the recognitive community.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.380
That's his model for how universals,

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.333
particulars, and individuals are related.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.640
Now besides developing
Kant's normative insights

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.680
along the social dimension,

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.830
Hegel develops it along
a historical dimension.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.400
What binds them together is Hegel's idea

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.760
that determinateness on
the side of the content

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.270
of conceptual norms,
the topic of semantics,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.180
is intelligible in principle
only in the context

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.950
of a thoroughgoing reciprocity

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.140
of authority and responsibility

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.800
on the side of the practical force

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.950
or significance of those norms,

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.693
the topic of pragmatics in a broad sense.

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.400
His metaconcept, Vernunft,
is a view about the process

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.830
of determining conceptual contents

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.160
and about the kind of
determinateness that results.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.820
This process, he thinks,

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.773
has a normative structure
distinctive of traditions.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.500
Understanding genealogical analyses

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.980
as undercutting the claims of reason,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.720
as undercutting the rational
bindingness of conceptual norms

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.270
depends on assessing the
rationality of discursive practice

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.210
solely on the basis of the extent

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.580
to which applications of concepts,

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.690
whose contents are construed
as already fully determinate,

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:22.273
are responsive exclusively
to evidential concerns.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.650
Responsiveness of concept applications

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.010
to any factors that are contingent

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.320
relative to the conceptual
norms already in force,

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.530
which is the phenomenon

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.080
that genealogical diagnoses highlight,

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.323
is accordingly identified as
an eruption of irrationality.

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.820
But the idea that
assessments of rationality

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.630
are appropriately addressed
only to the application

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.210
of already fully determinate concepts

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:51.830
is the product of a
blinkered semantic naivete.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:55.330
It ignores the fact that the
very same discursive practice

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.640
that is from one point of view

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.110
the application of conceptual norms

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:02.660
is from another point of view
the institution of those norms

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.450
and the determination of their contents.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.090
Only when discursive
practice is viewed whole

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:10.440
does its rationality emerge.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.140
If the semantogenic process
by which conceptual contents

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.490
are determined and developed is ignored,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:18.640
the distinctive way in
which reason informs

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.193
and infuses discursive
practice must remain invisible.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.540
For Hegel, the principal task of reason

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.040
in his preferred sense of
Vernunft rather than Verstand

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.843
is, as he says, to give
contingency the form of necessity.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.840
Following Kant, by necessary, he means

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.363
having the form of a rule.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.720
That is, for him, reason's job is to put

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.580
the sort of material contingencies
the genealogist points to

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.083
into a normative shape.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.670
From Hegel's point of view,
far from undercutting reason,

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.090
the possibility of
genealogical explanations

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.770
just underlines the need

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.270
for this particular function of reason

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.523
and the crucial job that it does.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.410
So how can we understand the process

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:07.210
whereby concepts acquire and develop

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.880
their determinate content

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.410
as putting contingencies
of their application

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:12.833
into a normative shape?

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.480
Hegel's idea is that a distinctive kind

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.610
of retrospective rational reconstruction

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.060
of prior applications of a concept

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.410
is necessary and sufficient
to exhibit those applications

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:28.683
as conferring a determinate
content on the concept.

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.670
One brings order to the motley welter

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:34.400
that is the discursive
practice one inherits

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.110
by discriminating within it

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:40.410
a privileged trajectory that's
expressively progressive

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:43.410
in the sense of making gradually explicit

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:46.300
norms that then show up retrospectively

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.330
as having been all along implicit.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.583
Doing that, he says, is
turning a past into a history.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:58.430
The best model I know of the
kind of rational activity

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:00.750
that determines conceptual contents

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.590
by making or finding the
right kind of history for them

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.690
is the jurisprudential one

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.930
institutionalized and
codified in case law.

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.540
Its purest, paradigmatic form takes place

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.600
in what in the Anglo-American legal world

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.690
is called common law.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.070
For in that realm, by
contrast to statute law,

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:22.590
judges are not guided in
their decisions as to whether

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.720
to apply or withhold the
application of a concept,

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.400
say, the concept of strict liability,

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.870
by explicit statutes propounded
and given the force of law

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.150
by legislatures, statutes
that say explicitly

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:37.500
what is and is not licit

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.350
according to the norm they institute.

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:45.310
In case law, in lieu of norms
explicit as such principles,

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:49.070
judges at common law must
decide cases with novel facts

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:52.530
on the basis only of norms
that they discern as implicit

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:55.333
in the tradition of already decided cases.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:58.330
The governing authority

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:00.740
to which common law judges are responsible

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.250
is provided by precedent.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:06.440
The judge's job is not only
to decide the present case,

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.460
but also to provide a
rationale for the decision

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.860
by providing a distinctive
kind of narrative

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.480
justifying it as correct.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.780
Such a narrative selects

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.469
some prior decisions as precedential

00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:21.400
in the sense of being not
only relevant and correct

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.410
but as having revealed

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.420
some hitherto hidden aspect or contour

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.940
of the norm that's developing

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.270
in the tradition defined
by those precedents.

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:33.360
The legal concepts and
principles explicating them

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.500
that are given expression

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.220
as rationales for deciding novel cases

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.880
are often characterized as judge-made law.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.870
And this description is apt

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:44.980
because there's nothing
more to give content

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.410
to this kind of law and its concepts

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.750
than the decisions that
judges have rendered

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:53.340
and the retrospective rational
reconstructions of traditions

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.040
defined by precedents
that the judges offer

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.893
to justify those decisions.

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:02.840
Rational, rationalizing
processes of this sort

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.100
are both responsible to the contents

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.480
of the conceptual norms they apply,

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.150
and they exercise authority

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:12.440
over the development of
those conceptual contents.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.030
They are processes of
determining conceptual contents,

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.660
both in the sense of finding
out what those contents are,

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:23.000
manifested in the essentially
retrospective rationales

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.380
judges supply for their decisions,

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.810
and in the sense of making
those contents what they are,

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.370
manifested in the essentially prospective

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:33.520
shifting and sharpening of the norms

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.643
that each new application
and interpretation provides.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.320
These hermeneutic
practices give contingency

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.450
the normative form of necessity,

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.070
and by incorporating those contingencies,

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.583
infuse determinate content
into the developing norms.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.860
It's of the essence of
the kind of rationality

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.450
distinctive of this sort of
concept-determining process

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:59.270
to be articulated by these
complementary perspectives,

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.210
retrospective, determining as finding,

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.330
and prospective, determining as making,

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.080
responsibility to the
tradition one inherits

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.863
and authority over the
tradition one bequeaths.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:14.340
Looking backward along
the privileged trajectory

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.580
of precedents selected by the narrative

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.010
rationalizing any particular decision,

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.220
one sees only unbroken
expressive progress,

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.360
the gradual emergence into
the explicit light of day

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.830
of a governing norm that appears

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:30.820
as having been all along
implicit in earlier decisions.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.060
But looking forward at how legal concepts

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.890
and principles evolve by being
applied in concrete cases,

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:39.910
the discontinuities between
those narratives shows up

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:43.280
as sequential judges revise
their predecessors' judgments

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.270
as to which earlier applications

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:48.083
should be treated as precedential and how.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:53.260
T.S. Eliot describes this
aspect of Hegelian Vernunft

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.120
as at work in a different
corner of the culture.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.030
He says what happens when a
new work of art is created

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.030
is something that happens simultaneously

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.770
to all the works of art that preceded it.

01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:08.360
The existing monuments form an
ideal order among themselves,

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.100
which is modified by the
introduction of the new,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.060
the really new work of art among them.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.540
The existing order is complete
before the new work arrives.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.800
For order to persist after
the supervention of novelty,

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.750
the whole existing order must be,

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.680
if ever so slightly, altered.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.270
And so the relations,
proportions, and values

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:30.200
of each work of art toward
the whole are adjusted,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.163
and this is conformity
between the old and the new.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:40.000
Now, considering
genealogical counterfactuals

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.900
about what the norms would have been

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.870
had various non-evidential
factors differed

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:46.950
reveals a judicial process

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.520
shot through with contingencies,

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.160
as, for instance, when the order

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.720
in which two cases
happened to be adjudicated

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.110
evidently affects the content
of the law that results.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:58.860
The normatively contingent character

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.790
of any particular decision

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.600
to apply or not to apply
a particular concept

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.950
is manifested in the fact
that one always can explain

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.580
any particular decision genealogically,

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:13.300
in terms of what the
judge had for breakfast

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.923
in the derisive slogan of
jurisprudential theory.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.280
That is to explain it in terms

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.300
that do not appeal to
the content of the norm

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.570
whose applicability is in question,

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.510
to explain it instead, for instance,

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.290
in terms of the intellectual fashions

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:28.390
or public passions of the day

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.850
or by features of the judge's
training, temperament,

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:33.140
or political convictions.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:36.630
But to conclude that the
possibility of such an explanation

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.730
means that no norm is
therefore instituted,

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:41.670
that the norms discerned as implicit

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:44.910
in the tradition inherited
cannot rationally justify

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.800
one decision rather than
another in a novel case

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.180
is to insist stubbornly and one-sidedly

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.830
on occupying only one of the perspectives

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:57.960
that are, in fact, two sides
of one coin, as Hegel insists

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.990
and as jurisprudential
practice demonstrates.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:04.480
It's precisely to refuse
to see Vernunft whole.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.490
It's to embrace the semantic naivete

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.530
that ignores the essential role

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:12.690
rationally incorporating
those contingencies plays

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:15.250
in conferring determinate content on,

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:19.563
determining the content of
always evolving conceptual norms.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.570
Hegel points to the
generality of the lesson

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:24.960
he wants us to learn

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.950
from his Vernunft model
of the practice of reason

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:30.440
in a remarkable passage epitomized

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.170
in an aphorism expressing his
twist on a slogan of the day.

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:38.720
He says no man is a hero to his valet,

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.150
but that's not because
the man is not a hero,

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.703
but because the valet is a valet.

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:48.800
The passage continues,
explaining that the reason is

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.660
that the valet's dealings
are with the man,

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.900
not as a hero, but as
one who eats, drinks,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.680
and wears clothes in general,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.230
with his individual wants and fancies.

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.480
Thus, for the judging consciousness,

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.010
there is no action in
which it could not oppose

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:05.440
to the universal aspect of the action,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.030
the personal aspect of the individuality,

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:12.423
and so play the part of the
moral valet toward the agent.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.550
What Hegel calls the
universal aspect of the action

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.490
is its normative dimension.

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:20.360
The hero is a hero insofar as he acts

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.520
according to the norms
that articulate his duty.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.650
The valet views what the
hero does genealogically,

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.900
in resolutely naturalistic,
non-normative, reductive terms,

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.000
and so, as the passage continues,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.610
the valet explains the action

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.400
as resulting from selfish motives.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.700
Just as every action is
capable of being looked at

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.200
from the point of view
of conformity to duty,

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.380
so too can it be considered
from the point of view

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.830
of the particularity of the doer.

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:48.670
If the action is accompanied by fame,

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:52.010
then it knows this inner
aspect to be a desire for fame.

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.750
The inner aspect is judged to be an urge

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.500
to secure his own happiness,

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.720
even though this were to consist

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.840
merely in an inner moral conceit,

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.850
in the enjoyment of being
conscious of his own superiority

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:05.030
and in the foretaste of a
hope of future happiness.

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.990
No action can escape such judgment,

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.650
for duty for duty's sake,

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.300
this pure purpose, is an unreality.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.480
It becomes a reality in the
deed of an individuality,

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.150
and the action is thereby charged

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:19.680
with the aspect of particularity.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.870
That's the end of the quote.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:25.560
Here Hegel, writing in
1806, before the advent

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.860
of the great unmaskers of
the dawning 19th century,

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.800
acknowledges that every
application of a norm

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.170
is in principle liable

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:36.450
to a naturalistic,
genealogical explanation.

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:40.170
It can be seen, indeed,
can be correctly seen

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.090
as far as that vision reaches

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.440
from the point of view
of its particularity,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.020
its normative contingency.

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:50.970
But that valet's-eye
genealogical view is one-sided.

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:53.590
It fails to see the whole of the doing.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:57.460
For the valet fails to see
that a norm can also be active,

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.610
that the particular
contingent motives he sees,

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.680
what the hero had for breakfast,

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.300
can be given the form
of normative necessity,

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.040
can be incorporated in a narrative

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.870
that exhibits them as
in conformity to duty,

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:13.143
as correctly performed according
to the governing norms.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.342
Hegel calls the genealogical
valet's attitude

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:21.420
(speaks in foreign language),
literally, something like

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:25.430
a striving for the low,
an impulse to debase.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.800
His term for the practical
attitude of giving contingency

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.770
the normative form of necessity

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:34.200
is (speaks in foreign
language), magnanimity.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.913
It's a form of
norm-instituting recognition.

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:44.130
Its retrospective recognitive
aspect, he calls forgiveness.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:47.793
Its prospective recognitive
aspect, he calls confession.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.080
What one forgives is the
normative contingencies

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.290
that infect prior
applications of concepts.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.870
One forgives them not
wholesale, by a grand gesture,

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.190
but by the hard retail
work of constructing

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:04.410
an expressively progressive
historical narrative

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:06.600
in which they play precedential roles

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.840
as making explicit aspects

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.240
of the developing conceptual
content that are now revealed

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.973
as hitherto having been
all along implicit.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.890
The slogan of this generous
hermeneutic recognitive attitude

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.277
is Tennyson's when he says,

01:07:22.277 --> 01:07:23.967
"Yet I doubt not through the ages

01:07:23.967 --> 01:07:25.967
"one increasing purpose runs,

01:07:25.967 --> 01:07:27.437
"and the thoughts of men are widened

01:07:27.437 --> 01:07:30.280
"with the process of the suns."

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.690
This is what Hegel does
in his own writings,

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:34.940
first and foremost in the Phenomenology,

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.910
but no less in the histories he constructs

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.673
for philosophy, art, and
religion in his lectures.

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:44.700
Concrete, magnanimous,
hermeneutic forgiveness

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.040
is finding such a
purpose, that is, a norm,

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.490
to which the concept-application
being forgiven

01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:55.190
can be seen to contribute, so
widening the thoughts of man.

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:59.403
Hegel calls this making what
happens into something done.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.260
What the magnanimous interpreter confesses

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.150
is the contingent inadequacy

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:10.050
of each particular such forgiving
rational reconstruction.

01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:12.590
One confesses that one is
unable to find a narrative

01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:16.310
in which every contingency
is given the normative status

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.920
of a progressive precedential expression

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.210
of the underlying
developing conceptual norm.

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:25.150
In confessing, one
petitions one's successors

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:27.820
for forgiveness of that contingent failure

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.570
of one's own effort at forgiveness.

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:32.610
The (speaks in foreign language) rational,

01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:34.540
rationalizing process

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.930
in which conceptual norms are instituted

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:40.330
by diachronic magnanimous
reciprocal recognition

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:42.620
is a structure of trust,

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.250
trust that one's
trespasses will be forgiven

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:48.093
as one forgives those who
have trespassed before one.

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:52.400
So Hegel foresaw the
genealogical challenge

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.970
to rational normativity

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:56.510
that would arise from
a reductive naturalism

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:58.730
and would result in a small-minded,

01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:00.270
(speaks in foreign language) valet's

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.083
hermeneutics of suspicion.

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:05.640
The hermeneutics of magnanimity and trust

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.250
he recommends instead

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:10.960
is not based on fine
feeling or pious sentiment.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.660
Instead, he argues that the only construal

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.300
in which reason and meaning are threatened

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.460
by the possibility of genealogy

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.910
is a narrow, one-sided conception

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:23.440
that's mistaken because
semantically naive.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.700
In its place, he puts a
more capacious conception

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.010
of Vernunft as comprising not only

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:31.430
the norm-governed application of concepts

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:33.010
but the process and practice

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.540
by which their content is determined.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.460
At its core is the
magnanimous hermeneutics

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.970
that shapes genealogical contingency

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.973
into a normative, rational form.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:47.570
My aim here has been to sketch
in the broadest of outlines

01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:50.760
the insights that underlie
Hegel's inspiring vision

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.130
of the relations between the
normative and the natural.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:54.982
Thank you.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.982
(audience applauds)

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.513
- Okay, Bob has said he would be,

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.530
Professor Brandom has
said he would be willing

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.502
to take some questions for a few minutes

01:10:17.502 --> 01:10:21.093
if there are some as I'm sure there are.

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.943
- [Audience Member] Thank you very much.

01:10:22.943 --> 01:10:24.960
That was awe-inspiring,

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.540
and I'm sure I understand
only a small piece of it.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:31.340
The piece I did understand
was the reference to law,

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.210
and I was wondering about that

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:35.680
because it seemed to make
the case for Hegel worse.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.660
I realize you're presenting Hegel's vision

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.340
rather than defending it.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.600
But the very few lawyers
today who would accept

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.620
the romantic teleological
story you told about law,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.010
that as judges work
through the common law,

01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:52.780
they work it pure, that's the old trope.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.500
Even Dworkin, I think,
would have taken that

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.350
as a kind of sentimental conceit.

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:59.950
And I think what most people
thinking about law would say is

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:02.570
that sort of story is a necessary piece

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:04.300
of the legitimation of law,

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.230
the sociological legitimation of law.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.950
It also works as a kind of hard constraint

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:13.000
to impose some external
controls on what judges do,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.590
but not even the earliest
of the legal realists,

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:17.940
the what-the-judge-had-for-breakfast guys,

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.050
thought that judges just
threw up their hands

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:22.300
and, you know, awarded
damages to themselves.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:24.740
The point was that the concepts

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.060
were highly under-determinative,

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.200
but that there's some
determination by these concepts,

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.190
but basically the work of singling out

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:33.220
who won and who lost in a particular case

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.650
was explained genealogically

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.210
and that we had to tell
this progressive story.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.900
This progressive story came from outside.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.540
It came from the needs of power

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:46.540
to justify a system that by and
large serve those interests.

01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:47.810
And I think that, I mean, that's the worry

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:49.040
that one would throw back on Hegel,

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.700
that this progressivism comes externally.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.870
It's a legitimation story.

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.190
It makes us feel good about ourselves,

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:55.240
about the nature of the concepts we have,

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.030
but it's ultimately a myth

01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:59.280
about the contingencies we have.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.950
- Yeah, I mean, I absolutely
agree that if that were the,

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:05.900
if that were the story I
was attributing to Hegel,

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.920
it would be subject to
all those criticisms.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.860
I think, instead, you can see it as

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.680
articulating the normative fine structure

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.940
of what Dworkin calls
the judge's chain novels.

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.600
And what distinguishes the Hegelian story,

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.690
which I was really just able
to wave my hands at here,

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:24.770
but which in other places

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:27.730
I have written about more extensively,

01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:31.830
is that it's not that he thinks

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:36.610
that there are secreted in the tradition

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.943
some norm which is gradually getting,

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.850
all the pieces of that except the pieces

01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:46.850
that are of that statute
are being chipped away

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:48.220
by each decision,

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.580
and the already present
statute is being found.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.190
Rather, he thinks each judge

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:56.060
has to tell the story like that.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.010
That's the only form of rationalization.

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.120
The only form of reason you can give

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.850
for making one judgment
rather than another

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:07.070
is to find that rationale implicit

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.370
in the decisions that
have been made before.

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:13.530
But the very next judge's story
may be radically different

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:16.640
about what is progressive.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.810
The trajectory that he discerns,

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:25.810
which again is, as far as
he picks out the precedents,

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:30.290
expressively progressive and
cumulative and monotonic.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:35.290
Each precedent that he picks
out is revealing some aspect

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.060
that he's appealing to,

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.620
but it's relation to the rationale

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:43.100
that the previous judge told
may be radically different.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:46.510
And so Hegel sees, sort of at each stage,

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:50.950
when we ask, well, what is
the content of this concept,

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:53.900
we've gotta understand it as a snapshot

01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:56.930
of something that is being shaped

01:13:56.930 --> 01:14:00.310
in a process of this description.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.370
And I read him as thinking

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:03.630
that that's what we should be doing

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:06.770
for our philosophical
predecessors as well,

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:09.130
that he told one story
in the Phenomenology

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:10.650
and in the history of philosophy

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:14.560
about what each philosopher had discovered

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.390
such that if you put all
these things together,

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:20.010
you got to the system to his account.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:22.600
And I read him as
thinking that it's our job

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.320
to do quite a different one

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.360
and say, oh, well, yes, and
the piece that he got was this

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.803
and he misunderstood Leibniz and so on.

01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:36.710
So the romantic picture that
you were properly rejecting,

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.980
I think, is one that isn't looking

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.920
at this prospective discontinuities,

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.220
the radical discontinuities

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.610
between the retrospective
Whiggish stories.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:51.250
He thinks that telling stories like that

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.530
is the form of reason's
march through history,

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:58.730
but that in principle,
that process of determining

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.190
the content of concepts

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:04.653
involves also these
radical discontinuities.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.770
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
thank you very much.

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:07.603
That was excellent.

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:08.970
I have a few questions,

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:11.210
one general systematic question

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:13.180
and then more of a Hegel question.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.620
So here's the general question.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.960
Like if I understand you correctly,

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.520
Hegel has resources to fight

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.530
a globalized form of
hermeneutics of suspicion,

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:23.150
but you yourself said that almost no form

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.290
of the hermeneutics of suspicion is global

01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:27.640
unless it goes global and
you didn't mention that one.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.400
So I would like to hear
something about that.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.930
So I think some form of globalized form

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.610
of reductive naturalism
can be fought with Hegel,

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.690
but that doesn't give us a lot
of ground against a skeptic

01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:39.000
because the skeptic might say,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.110
well, all contents can be
reduced minus this one.

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:44.280
So, you know, if that's all the
the ground that we stand on,

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.640
that doesn't seem to be a lot.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.360
So I wonder whether you could
say something about that.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.467
- Well, I mean,
specifically on that point,

01:15:51.467 --> 01:15:54.850
I mean, I think the residue has got to be,

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.650
the bit that doesn't get
genealogically reduced

01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:01.080
has got to be an autonomous
discursive practice,

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.300
a language game one could
play that one played no other.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.930
So that's not just leaving, you know what,

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:12.780
one or two concepts out of
the genealogical target area.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.770
That's got to leave, you know, enough

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:18.480
for us to understand ourselves
as rational beings within.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.000
Now, if then you can be genealogical

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.950
about individual motivational structures

01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:28.080
or about political economy,

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.040
I mean, the question's going to be,

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.040
well, can you really be
genealogical about what our

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.970
regions of discourse or vocabularies

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:41.240
that after all threaten to spread out

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:46.240
to encompass the way we
understand ourselves.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.815
- [Audience Member] Okay,
and then the Hegel question.

01:16:49.815 --> 01:16:52.100
I mean, you draw distinction now

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.430
between the epistemic and the semantic

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:56.810
which does a lot of work in this paper.

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:58.520
But I wonder if you don't need,

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.430
in addition to that distinction,

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:03.560
the ontic if not the ontological.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.670
I know that you don't
like the concept of truth

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:07.200
to play a very important role here,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.950
but Hegel, of course, insists
in the subject of logic

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:13.330
that truth itself is the
object that he's contemplating.

01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:16.400
So I wonder if you have
a deflationary reading

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.470
of Hegel's obvious insistence on truth

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:21.150
because if I read him correctly,

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:24.100
he's saying that inferences are only,

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.410
that better reasons better
be sometimes best reasons

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.870
and best reasons are reasons
hooked up with the truth.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:34.234
So I'm wondering if there's a
deflationary account of that

01:17:34.234 --> 01:17:35.067
in your reading.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.780
- Well, I actually wouldn't read him

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:39.610
as saying what you've just said,

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:42.170
but I am perfectly happy to say

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.560
truth is absolutely central for him

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.900
and furthermore is front and center

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.620
in the story I'm telling.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.963
But it's not,

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.240
the best place to look to see
how he's thinking about it

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.920
is not the subjective logic

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.130
but the preface to the Phenomenology

01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:02.200
where he gives us what I take
to be a definition of truth,

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.870
though it hardly is gonna show up in your,

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:07.730
you know, coherence theory,
correspondence theories,

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:11.390
where he says truth is a
vast bacchanalian revel

01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.350
with not a soul sober,

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:15.770
where no sooner does an individual member

01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:19.440
of the drinking party fall
insensible beneath the table,

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.360
than another takes his place.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.930
So this is his theory of truth.

01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:25.070
Yes, this is the story.
(audience laughs)

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:27.200
This is the story about the process

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.670
of the development of these concepts,

01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:32.420
which are elbowing each other at the table

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.120
with their incompatibilities,

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.090
with their consequences to each other.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:38.400
But each one, each determinate concept

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.260
eventually shows itself

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.080
not to be adequate to the phenomena

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.730
to incorporate some claim
about what follows from water.

01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:47.410
What's incompatible with what

01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:51.490
that is precisely informed
by the particulars,

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:53.500
it falls beneath the table.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.370
We say, you know, that isn't the norm.

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:59.290
That concept that says
that if it's copper,

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:01.190
then this follows from it,
that's not quite right.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:02.600
That one goes beneath the table,

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.550
but there's always another
one to take its place.

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:08.120
And that's the locus of truth,

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.310
is that process which is precisely

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.380
where the semantic and the epistemic

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.500
are merely aspects of it but
not separable components.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.810
Now, obviously a lot of
work would need to be done

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:20.990
to connect that to the other things

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.200
he also says about truth,

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.200
but that's the one I'm talking about.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.300
- [Audience Member]
Would you kindly tell me

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.440
what is the definition of a fact

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.020
and what is the difference with truth

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:34.860
and how we can apply this
to ideas of fact and truth

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.430
in terms of making our judgment?

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:40.920
We make judgments every day,
thousands of them every day.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.333
Now, who has the best judgment?

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.340
- Yeah, well, I don't know
that I have a lot to say

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.480
about who has the best judgment.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.310
I mean, on this account of
truth, the essential thing is

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:54.710
that there's no final judgment about it.

01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:56.670
I mean, I think Hegel
would agree with Frege

01:19:56.670 --> 01:20:01.200
that a fact is a thought that is true,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.463
a thought not in the sense of
a thinking but of a thinkable.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.050
But that notion of truth
has to be understood

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:10.830
in terms of this process
of committing ourselves

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:15.110
to something as true, to
taking something as a fact.

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:18.930
And we've got to realize that
those are fragile attitudes,

01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:21.763
that none of them is unrevisable,

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:26.140
and in the end it may be
none of them are unrevised.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.570
Now it is one of Hegel's challenges

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:33.103
to make sense of the notion of
an objective empirical world

01:20:34.248 --> 01:20:35.550
that is the way it is

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:37.970
regardless of our attitudes towards it.

01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:40.160
And I think in the introduction
of the Phenomenology,

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.800
he gives us an account of
the nature of representation

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.617
that lets us do that.

01:20:44.617 --> 01:20:46.293
But there on hangs a tale.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.460
- [Audience Member]
Thank you for your talk.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:53.460
I have a question about this
globalizing genealogy project

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.730
that you mentioned because

01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:57.238
thinking about the
universal in particular,

01:20:57.238 --> 01:20:59.430
my field is modern Chinese history,

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:01.930
and when we think about the
universal in particular,

01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:06.420
it's always a sort of process
of how China went from,

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.670
say, being its own universal

01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:12.510
to, say, the Middle Kingdom
to but one nation among many.

01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:15.690
And so I guess on a very practical
level, I'm just wondering

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:20.570
how does this globalizing
genealogy work if,

01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:22.670
I mean, I don't even
know what it looks like,

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.040
I guess, on the one hand.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.937
Second, it seems like is this

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.570
sort of globalizing
genealogy as method that is

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:36.913
sort of useful to,

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.590
you know, a sort of ongoing conversation

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:43.180
that's been happening in
Western Europe and the US,

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.330
but how do you see it going beyond,

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:46.920
I guess, is the question I have.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.340
- I mean, my guess is that
we're slightly talking

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:52.550
past each other on globalization,

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:57.390
that, you know, I'm starting
with the notion of genealogy as

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:02.170
a particular kind of reductive naturalism,

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:07.170
as wanting to understand
how our discursive practices

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.100
in a valet's terms of causal processes

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.850
that are not normative.

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:17.700
And that has local and global versions.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.510
What it's local and global with respect to

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:21.210
is discursive practice.

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:24.960
The local versions are only
looking at some vocabularies.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.810
Freud, by and large, only cares about

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:32.850
our understanding of our
own motivational structure,

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:35.010
but the kind of argument he gives

01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:37.220
is one that one could open up

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:40.133
to talk about all of discourse.

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:44.160
And I was concerned to
give a counterargument

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:49.160
to that kind of radicalization
of a genealogical argument.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.350
But I doubt that those
considerations are gonna help much

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:54.963
with the concerns that you had.

01:22:56.530 --> 01:22:57.960
- [Audience Member] I
really enjoyed your talk,

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.590
both feeling that it
was a pleasure to follow

01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:03.320
and equally to be challenged by it.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.470
Your bringing up case law

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:09.900
as a paradigm of this normative process

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.590
made me think of my own
experience as a musician,

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:14.450
and it seems like that
there's just a lot of richness

01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:18.050
in using that as a way of
understanding the tradition,

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.960
particularly I think in
the Western tradition

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.550
where you have both a written
artifact from the past

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.510
in this tradition of interpretation

01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.073
and this living quality of it

01:23:27.073 --> 01:23:30.400
that is very stimulating
and enjoyable, thank you.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.200
- Oh good, I mean, I put in
the Eliot quote at the end

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.583
to indicate that this isn't
all about copper, you know,

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.420
or strict liability or whatever.

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:45.930
This is supposed to be a
story about concepts as such,

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:50.340
and in particular, if there's any go

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:54.030
to the normative fine structure
distinctive of tradition,

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.570
which is one of the things I'm saying

01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:57.200
Hegel has a lot to teach us about,

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.070
then that's gonna be true
in artistic traditions

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:05.070
absolutely as much as in
jurisprudential or scientific ones.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.550
- And that's all we have time for today.

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:11.270
Remember, Bob Brandom
will be talking again

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:13.423
in the Philosophy Department tomorrow on,

01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:15.163
what was the topic?

01:24:15.163 --> 01:24:19.023
It was about modal logic and
expressivism together again.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.720
But please join me in thanking him

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.309
for a very stimulating discussion today.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.309
(audience applauds)

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:34.366
(light music)
