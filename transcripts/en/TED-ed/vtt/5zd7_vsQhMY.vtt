00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.677
Well, I think that when I was in grade school,

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:10.204
I was still very much loyal to the way of thinking

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:11.592
that I heard around me,

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:14.195
so I couldn't imagine much further

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:17.684
than being either a lawyer or a psychologist.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.912
And it's only a few years later

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:25.085
that I found enough freedom in myself

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.579
to really ask what drives me

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.176
and what I would like to do with my life.

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:35.243
And maybe only ten years later or more,

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.575
my path really started revealing itself

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.299
and these are the moments when I was brave enough

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.379
to really listen to what I want to do

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.437
with every waking moment.
