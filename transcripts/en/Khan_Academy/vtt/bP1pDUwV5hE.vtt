00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.170
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Kahn Academy,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.217
and today we're learning more
about what I like to call

00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:08.040
"The Case of the Midnight Judges,"

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.820
Marbury versus Madison.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.840
This case was decided in 1803

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.040
and it established the
principle of judicial review,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.220
that the Supreme Court
has the power to review

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340
the constitutionality of Acts

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.250
made by Congress or the President,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.830
and overturn those actions that it

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.900
judges to be inconsistent
with the constitution.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.330
To learn more about Marbury versus Madison

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.430
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.780
Michael Klarman is a legal historian

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.570
and the Kirkland and
Ellis Professor of Law

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.760
at Harvard Law School.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.980
Kevin Walsh is a professor of law

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.775
at the University if Richmond Law School.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:48.930
So, Professor Walsh, can you
tell us a little bit about

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.830
what was happening in this case?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.360
Can you set the stage?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.193
- [Kevin] Sure, you're right,

00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.380
the case wasn't decided until 1803,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.990
but to understand where it came from,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.400
you really have to go back
to the election of 1800,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.890
and this election pitted
John Adams, the incumbent,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.570
Federalist president, against
his former vice president,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.520
Thomas Jefferson, the
Democratic Republican.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.390
And long story short,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.560
Jefferson ended up being President,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.730
and we have skipped a lot of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.010
really interesting things there,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.740
but Jefferson ultimately won.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.840
The Federalist who controlled Congress,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.640
seeing what was happening,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.490
made a present for the
incoming administration

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.490
in the form of some laws that
created some new judgeships.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.770
So some new federal judges,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.090
as well as some justices of the peace

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.810
in the District of Columbia.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.960
And then they proceeded
to stuff those offices

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.820
with loyal Federalists,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.610
and these were people
like William Marbury,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.390
who was granted a commission
as justice of the peace

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.342
in DC.

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:02.167
- [Michael] Marbury was appointed

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.600
by the Federalist President,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.400
the outgoing Federalist
President, John Adams,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.770
to be a justice of the
peace in Washington DC,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.980
but John Marshall, who was
both Secretary of State

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.330
and Chief Justice of the
United States under John Adams,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.340
he didn't have a chance
to deliver the commission,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.390
because these were midnight judges

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.750
who were appointed almost
at the last minute,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530
as the Adams Administration
was going out the door.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.250
So the commission for Marbury
was still sitting on the desk

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.540
of the new Secretary of
State, James Madison,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.190
when the Jefferson
Administration took over.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.240
And the Jeffersonians were outraged

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.190
by what they saw as an
effort to pack the judiciary

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.120
by the outgoing administration,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.930
so they were refusing to
deliver the commission.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.650
Marbury wants his commission,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.730
so he brings a lawsuit in the
United States Supreme Court

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.380
demanding that Secretary
of State, James Madison,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.330
deliver the commission to him,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.090
and that's what leads to the
case Marbury versus Madison.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.253
- [Kevin] So really, this is a case about

00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:08.208
some men trying to get the
jobs that President Adams

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.600
had appointed them to, but
that they weren't able to get

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.930
because President Jefferson
and his administration

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.260
refused to deliver the piece of paper

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.700
entitling them to actually take the job.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.533
- [Kim] Very interesting,

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.590
so this election of 1800, I
think, is very significant

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.990
in American history
because it was the first

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.770
peaceful transfer of power
between two political parties.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.820
The Federalists, kind
of led by John Adams,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.540
who added this stronger central government

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.320
as one of their core ideals,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.530
and then the anti-Federalists,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.520
or Democratic Republicans, led by Madison

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.810
and Jefferson who wanted a
weaker central government,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.650
more power to the states.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.990
So I think it's one of the coolest things

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.580
in American history that a political party

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.340
voluntarily gave up power,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.640
like when else in the history of the world

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.140
did a ruling party just
say, ah, you know what,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.894
now our enemies can rule.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:15.360
But, there's also this political fallout

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.810
from this transfer of
power between parties.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.130
- [Michael] And this is the first time

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.467
that Jeffersonian
Republicans are gonna be able

00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:25.060
to take control of the
national government,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.080
and the Federalists, the
outgoing Adams Administration,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.770
are horrified by this.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.310
They think of Jefferson as an anarchist,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.560
an atheist, they accused
him during the campaign

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.930
of being a miscegenator.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.630
They allege, it turns out correctly,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.495
that he sleeps with his slaves.

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:43.290
They allege that in New England he'll be

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.630
stealing their Bibles if elected,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.710
and the Jeffersonians don't
think much better of John Adams.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.360
They think he wants to be a king.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.852
He nearly got the country into

00:04:52.852 --> 00:04:54.190
an unnecessary war with France.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.630
So there's tremendous political animosity.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.020
Neither side really sees the opposite side

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.500
as the loyal political opposition,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.042
and then there's personal
acrimony as well.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:06.610
Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.140
both from Virginia, are distant cousins.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.540
They hate each other.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.710
John Marshall certainly
didn't think Jefferson

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.530
ought to be elected President in 1800,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.730
and Jefferson thinks that
John Marshall as chief justice

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.040
is trying to undermine
the federal republic

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.860
through his nationalist
rulings on the Supreme Court.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.330
- [Kevin] Well, it
wasn't a pretty transfer.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.511
John Adams left in a huff the morning that

00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:34.486
Jefferson was going to be inaugurated,

00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:38.350
but it was, as you say, it
was a peaceful transition.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.500
But the thing is, is a lot
of the issues that come with

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.492
transferring power from one
political party to another,

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:51.120
these were new issues for the country.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.380
And understandably, the
Jefferson Administration

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.170
resented the Federalist's
attempt to put their loyalists

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.870
into the judiciary.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.630
- [Michael] The Jeffersonians have won

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.420
the presidential election,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.800
they've won the congressional
elections by even more.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.620
The only branch of the federal
government still controlled

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.430
by the Federalists is the judiciary,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.680
and now they're packing the judiciary.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.600
They're creating 16 new federal
court of appeals judges,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.240
42 new justices of the peace,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.870
they're actually diminishing
the size of the Supreme Court

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.521
from six to five so as
to deprive Jefferson

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.200
of an opportunity to appoint a new justice

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.170
for one of those who is retiring.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.130
This is outrageous.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.360
And Jefferson also thinks it's outrageous

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.290
that Marbury has filed a
suit in the Supreme Court

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.230
and has asked the Supreme Court to order

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.090
the President of the United
States to do something,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.980
which Jefferson thinks is a violation

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.770
of the separation of powers.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.727
- [Kim] So, William Marbury
is one of these judges

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:57.108
that John Adams had appointed
in the midnight hour.

00:06:57.108 --> 00:06:59.580
He decides to sue,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.680
and this is directly to
the Supreme Court, right?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.850
'Cause it's in the Supreme
Court's original jurisdiction?

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.330
- [Kevin] Okay, so he sues
directly in the Supreme Court.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.360
Right now we think of the Supreme Court

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.550
generally as a court that
hears appeals, right?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.660
Usually you don't go there
in the first instance.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.580
But as we said, this was a new thing.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.280
And it was also new to be
suing the executive branch.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.830
So it makes sense, if you think about it,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.567
if you're going after the President

00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:30.960
and the President's Secretary of State

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.480
to go directly to the Supreme Court.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.700
- [Michael] Marbury brought
the suit in the Supreme Court,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.330
but the question and the case
is whether the Supreme Court

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.351
can here this within its constitutional

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:45.120
original jurisdiction.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.450
So under the Article
III of the constitution,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.160
at least as John Marshall
chooses to interpret it,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.785
in Marbury versus Madison,
this particular case

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:57.850
can't be in the Supreme
Court's original jurisdiction.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.990
It could only be filed somewhere else

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.320
and then appealed to the Supreme Court.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.690
- [Kim] So John Marshall's
a pretty big figure

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.740
in the history of the Supreme Court.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.130
Can you tell us just a little
bit more about who he is

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.190
and why he's so important?

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.950
- [Kevin] Sure, he is still the

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.630
longest serving chief justice.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.490
John Marshall was chief
justice from 1801 to 1835.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.490
He was appointed by President
Adams in early 1801.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.760
This was one of the final
acts of Adams' administration,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.710
and he went on to say that
it was the proudest thing

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.648
he had done for the American people.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.380
Marshall was a Federalist from Virginia.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.320
So this made him a little bit odd,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.220
because the leading
political figures in Virginia

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.150
were Democratic Republicans.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.950
But Marshall had been a soldier
in the Continental Army.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.260
He was at Valley Forge with
Washington and with Hamilton,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.320
and his experience is under
the Continental Congress

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.420
and under the Articles of Confederation,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.840
and then later serving in
state government in Virginia,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.900
made him realize that we needed

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.890
a much stronger national government.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.060
And that's what turned
him into a Federalist.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.060
So he was really in the mold
of Washington and Hamilton.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.765
And so this put him at odds

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.990
with the new President Jefferson

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.160
when Jefferson took office.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.480
Nevertheless, over the course of the

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.080
three and a half decades that
he was on the Supreme Court,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.020
Marshall gained a reputation
for being above politics,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.280
above party, and he was really successful

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.801
in bringing the court together

00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:51.801
as an institution, to speak
usually with one voice,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.870
for the constitution.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.600
So his great success was to
identify himself with the Court,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.850
to identify the Court with the
Constitution, and to identify

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.940
the Constitution with the people.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.773
- [Kim] All right,

00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:10.240
so Marbury sues for his
commission as a federal judge,

00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:14.800
and then Marshall and the
Supreme Court are tasked

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.277
with this issue of figuring out whether

00:10:17.277 --> 00:10:19.510
Marbury should get his commission or not.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.470
So can you take us through
Marshall's thinking?

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.770
How did he reason his way
to the answer in this case?

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.270
- [Michael] So there are
two different dimensions

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.430
to Marshall's thinking.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.320
One is the dimension of a lawyer,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.700
and the other is the dimension
of a political strategist.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.570
Marshall understands that
if he issues an order

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.700
to the Jefferson Administration
to deliver the commission

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.360
he will be defied.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.750
He knows that almost to a certainty.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.965
James Madison has refused
even to show up in court

00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:51.573
in response to an order to show cause why

00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:54.780
a writ of mandamus should not be issued.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.760
- [Kevin] So mandamus is from
the same root as mandatory

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.080
or mandate, right?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.210
It's an order.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.130
And here the issue was did
the judiciary have the power

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.890
using this writ of mandamus,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.710
to order the Secretary
of State to do something.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.380
- [Michael] So Marshall has to figure out,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.360
what can he do that isn't gonna make

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.670
the court look hopelessly weak,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.310
if he just says there's no jurisdiction

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.570
then people are gonna think he's supine

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.390
and he's afraid to
challenge the President.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.130
But if he orders the President
to deliver the commission,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.510
which is what he'd like to do,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.650
he knows Jefferson will defy him,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.150
and he has no authority,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.770
he has no enforcement capacity.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.100
So then the court will just look impotent.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.870
So what he wants to do instead is,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.050
he wants to act by indirection.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.380
The first thing he says is,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.410
the President's not above the law.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.590
The President can be mandamused.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.670
The second thing he says,
in this particular case

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.800
a writ of mandamus would
be the appropriate remedy.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.280
But the third thing he
says is, I have to ask

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.840
whether I have jurisdiction in this case.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.673
- [Kevin] The problem is,

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:01.610
the list of cases in the Constitution

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.700
that can be heard by the Supreme Court

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:05.399
in its original jurisdiction

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.990
did not include cases like Marbury's.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.760
So this was a problem because
Congress had passed a law

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.680
purportedly telling the Supreme Court

00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:17.050
that it could hear cases like this.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.220
- [Kim] Ah, okay.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.437
- [Kevin] That's what
Marbury was relying on.

00:12:20.437 --> 00:12:21.270
Right?

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.010
He wasn't just thinking,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.257
oh I'm gonna go to the
biggest court in the country.

00:12:25.257 --> 00:12:28.180
He was relying on a federal statute

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.277
that seemed to give
the court jurisdiction.

00:12:31.277 --> 00:12:34.727
But Marshall said that statute conflicts

00:12:34.727 --> 00:12:37.370
with what the Constitution says.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.320
It goes beyond the limits set

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.423
for this court in the Constitution.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.109
And when you have a conflict
between the Constitution

00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:49.690
and a federal law or any law,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.450
the Constitution wins.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.283
Right?

00:12:52.283 --> 00:12:54.970
So this is the principle
that has been called

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.290
Judicial Review.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.218
The idea is you have to review the laws

00:12:59.218 --> 00:13:02.580
to make sure they comply
with the Constitution.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.659
And if a law is unconstitutional

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:08.030
it can't be enforced by the Supreme Court.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.508
So it's a long way of
saying that Marbury lost

00:13:11.508 --> 00:13:15.430
because the court didn't
have jurisdiction.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.190
The court didn't have jurisdiction

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.010
because the law that
said it had jurisdiction

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.180
was unconstitutional.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.170
- [Kim] Wow, okay.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.950
So there's a lot going on here,

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.250
but one of the big takeaways

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.020
is this notion of Judicial Review,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.880
or the idea that the Constitution wins

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.920
and it's up to the Supreme Court to decide

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.930
whether that's the case.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.910
Can you talk more about the

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.780
affects of Judicial Review?

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.250
How does it check the power

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.360
of the other branches of government?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.918
- [Kevin] In order for a law
to be enforced against anybody,

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.630
all three branches of the government

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.700
have to have taken some kind of action.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.377
So Congress had to have passed a law

00:14:01.377 --> 00:14:03.910
and the President has to sign it.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.380
Then the law has to be
enforced against somebody

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.210
in a way that gives rise to a legal case.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.400
And then the judiciary gets the final word

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.110
in that legal case as to whether
the law is constitutional.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.730
So the one way that Judicial
Review operates as a check

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.880
on the President and the executive,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.700
is providing a backstop

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.130
against the enforcement
of unconstitutional laws.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.373
- [Michael] So when the courts
strike down President Trump's

00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.130
travel ban, that's Judicial Review.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.239
Or when the Supreme Court
said President Truman

00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:40.710
exceeded his authority in ordering

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.770
the seizure of the steal
mills during the Korean War,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.490
that's Judicial Review.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.970
Or when the Supreme Court
recently almost struck down

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.520
the Affordable Care Act,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.380
that would be an exercise
of Judicial Review.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.954
- [ Kim] Interesting, so

00:14:54.954 --> 00:14:59.954
this case and perhaps just
Marshall as chief justice,

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.300
in general made the court,
I think much more powerful

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.180
than it had been.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.300
Do you think this new power for the court

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.400
or expansion of power for the court

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.963
would have surprised the framers?

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.346
- [Michael] At the
Philadelphia Convention,

00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:18.960
more of the framers spoke
in favor of Judicial Review

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.050
than against,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.950
but the issue didn't come up very much.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.650
There wasn't that concerted
a discussion of it,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.370
and they neglected to explicitly authorize

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.220
the practice and the Constitution,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.400
which was kind of an oversight.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.910
It's just not a subject they spent

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.090
a great deal of time talking about.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.010
And even to the extent they
believed in Judicial Review,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.450
they probably didn't think
the practice would be

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.220
anywhere near as extensive as it's become

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.350
over the course of American history.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.520
The Supreme Court just wasn't
that powerful an institution

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.440
in 1803, and the fact
that it was declaring

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.930
the power of Judicial Review,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.240
but then was declining
to exercise it in Marbury

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.230
is very revealing of how
lacking in power the court was.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.940
- [Kevin] This was the first
time that the Supreme Court

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.383
exercised this power of Judicial Review,

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:11.430
and it is something that everyone agrees,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.280
a power that everyone agrees
that the Supreme Court has.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.660
And it's a big awesome power,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.188
and so it affects us because
we're still arguing over

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.350
how that power should be exercised,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.803
and that is an argument worth having.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.980
- [Kim] So we learned that
far from simply being a case

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.940
about one man's commission
getting lost in the mail,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.170
Marbury versus Madison
tested whether the President

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.760
or Congress was above the
law in the United States.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.520
Chief justice John Marshall's
answer was emphatically no.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.880
And the decision in this case established

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.470
an essential precedent
for the Supreme Court,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.490
the power of Judicial Review.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.020

Marbury versus Madison,
