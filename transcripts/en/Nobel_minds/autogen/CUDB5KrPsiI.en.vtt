a lot he established the principle of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
a lot he established the principle of
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.799
a lot he established the principle of
gene conservation in differentiated

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
gene conservation in differentiated
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.869
gene conservation in differentiated
cells half a century ago and so there so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
cells half a century ago and so there so
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.150
cells half a century ago and so there so
there was this very long run up and then

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
there was this very long run up and then
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.360
there was this very long run up and then
very rapidly you have transformed the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
very rapidly you have transformed the
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400
very rapidly you have transformed the
field by creating induced pluripotent

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
field by creating induced pluripotent
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.110
field by creating induced pluripotent
stem cells yes well I was able to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
stem cells yes well I was able to
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.480
stem cells yes well I was able to
initiate my project because of his

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490
initiate my project because of his
 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.330
initiate my project because of his
experiment 50 years ago actually he

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
experiment 50 years ago actually he
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.460
experiment 50 years ago actually he
published his work in 1962 and that was

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
published his work in 1962 and that was
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.310
published his work in 1962 and that was
the year I was born so I really feel yes

great we've honored there's a lovely
symmetry about that and it shows the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
symmetry about that and it shows the
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179
symmetry about that and it shows the
progress of science and one can't be too

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
progress of science and one can't be too
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.460
progress of science and one can't be too
rushed in expecting things to happen and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470
rushed in expecting things to happen and
 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.510
rushed in expecting things to happen and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.599
been long it was only in 2006 that you
created the first IPS cells so it hasn't

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609
created the first IPS cells so it hasn't
 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.610
created the first IPS cells so it hasn't
been long so I feel that this is I am

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620
been long so I feel that this is I am
 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.420

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
able to receive this award because of
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.369
able to receive this award because of
John Gurdon and also many other

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379
John Gurdon and also many other
 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.849
John Gurdon and also many other
researchers in the field this field has

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859
researchers in the field this field has
 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.379
researchers in the field this field has
been you know has a long long history

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389
been you know has a long long history
 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.150
been you know has a long long history
starting with John Gurdon so you know I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
starting with John Gurdon so you know I
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.140
starting with John Gurdon so you know I
very lucky I may have played some

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
very lucky I may have played some
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.530

it is not myself who initiated this
 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.520
it is not myself who initiated this
field so that my feeling right now I

greatest
 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.420
greatest
for stem-cell technologies are at the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430
for stem-cell technologies are at the
 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.090
for stem-cell technologies are at the
moment what what do you hope that that

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100
moment what what do you hope that that
 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.330
moment what what do you hope that that
will be the first benefit well I really

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340
will be the first benefit well I really
 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.870
will be the first benefit well I really
bring this technology to clinics I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880
bring this technology to clinics I
 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.630
bring this technology to clinics I
really want to help as many patients as

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640
really want to help as many patients as
 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
really want to help as many patients as
possible as you may know I started my

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450
possible as you may know I started my
 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.780
possible as you may know I started my
career as a surgeon 25 years ago but it

clinic thank you and I understand that
that IPS cells will be in fact going

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380
that IPS cells will be in fact going
 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.470
that IPS cells will be in fact going
into the clinic in trials next year for

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480
into the clinic in trials next year for
 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.840
