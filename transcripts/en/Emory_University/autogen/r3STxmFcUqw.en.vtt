00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.520
this program is brought to you by Emory

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:02.530
this program is brought to you by Emory
 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.920
this program is brought to you by Emory
University

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930
 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.959
of course vaccine research should

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969
of course vaccine research should
 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.379
of course vaccine research should
continue as well because we all dream

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389
continue as well because we all dream
 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.230
continue as well because we all dream
about an HIV vaccine and since the data

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240
about an HIV vaccine and since the data
 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.380
about an HIV vaccine and since the data
of the Thai trial which has been for the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390
of the Thai trial which has been for the
 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.600
of the Thai trial which has been for the
first time revising at least thirty

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610
first time revising at least thirty
 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:40.410
first time revising at least thirty
percent of protection in some volunteers

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.669
we are of course expecting to our data

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679
we are of course expecting to our data
 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.439
we are of course expecting to our data
with other vaccine candidates that are

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449
with other vaccine candidates that are
 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.110
with other vaccine candidates that are
on the pipeline today but you know I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120
on the pipeline today but you know I
 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.250
on the pipeline today but you know I
mean when you make a vaccine trial is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
mean when you make a vaccine trial is
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.260
mean when you make a vaccine trial is
taking a long time to get the data

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270
 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.500
so but again I think the vaccine

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510
so but again I think the vaccine
 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.790
so but again I think the vaccine
research it's also more promising these

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800
research it's also more promising these
 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.820
research it's also more promising these
days that it has been in the future

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830
days that it has been in the future
 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.930
days that it has been in the future
because after the step trial you know

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940
because after the step trial you know
 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.030
because after the step trial you know
this trial that was very disappointing

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040
this trial that was very disappointing
 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.010
this trial that was very disappointing
it has been a lot of thinking around the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
it has been a lot of thinking around the
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.719
it has been a lot of thinking around the
scientific community globally and today

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729
scientific community globally and today
 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.590
scientific community globally and today
I feel that there is a really much more

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
I feel that there is a really much more
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.310
I feel that there is a really much more
integration between basic research and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320
integration between basic research and
 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.870
integration between basic research and
clinical research on vaccine science and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880
clinical research on vaccine science and
 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.870
clinical research on vaccine science and
this is very important for the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880
this is very important for the
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.310
this is very important for the
development of future vaccine candidate

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
development of future vaccine candidate
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.160
development of future vaccine candidate
for HIV

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.850
and I am personally convinced that the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
and I am personally convinced that the
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.130
and I am personally convinced that the
progress that we will made in vaccine

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140
progress that we will made in vaccine
 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.660
progress that we will made in vaccine
research on HIV will serve also for

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
research on HIV will serve also for
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.120
research on HIV will serve also for
research and vaccine on other area I

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130
research and vaccine on other area I
 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.460
research and vaccine on other area I
mean for example malaria we don't have

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470
mean for example malaria we don't have
 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.220
mean for example malaria we don't have
any vaccine to that impressed infection

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
any vaccine to that impressed infection
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.479
any vaccine to that impressed infection
we don't have any vaccine appt at ITC we

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
we don't have any vaccine appt at ITC we
 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.030
we don't have any vaccine appt at ITC we
do not have a vaccine yet so we really

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
do not have a vaccine yet so we really
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.210
do not have a vaccine yet so we really
need to understand better the mechanism

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
need to understand better the mechanism
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.850
need to understand better the mechanism
the correlative protection as we said in

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
the correlative protection as we said in
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.350
the correlative protection as we said in
order to develop future vaccine

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
order to develop future vaccine
 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.470
order to develop future vaccine
candidate and to test these vaccine

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
candidate and to test these vaccine
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.740
candidate and to test these vaccine
candidates

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.790
you

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800
 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.890
the preceding program is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
the preceding program is
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.829
