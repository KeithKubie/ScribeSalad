1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,720
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,560
And today on our program we're looking
at brains and bodies and how sometimes

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,010
brains and bodies can
get wildly out of sync.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,880
And let me offer one more
flavor on this theme,

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,930
which has to do with something that
neuropsychologist Paul Brocks calls body

6
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,260
Schema Body Schema

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,030
is the brains sort of
working model of the body

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,160
in order for the brain to keep track
of where you are, where everything is,

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,030
it creates an inner representation
of you. Hmm. This is what he thinks.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,090
A model very much in the virtual reality
sense of where it thinks you are in

11
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,920
space and where it thinks you are.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,163
The point is that we,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,330
although we think there's a very solid
distinction between where our bodies and

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,840
in the world begins, in fact,

15
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:51,860
the brain has to work quite hard to
produce this kind of consistency of

16
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:55,760
experience. And clearly it can go wrong.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,360
This brings us to pilots. Okay.

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,640
My name is Dan Folger from I
spent 32 years in the Air Force,

19
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:06,740
25 that an active flying and uh,

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,330
this incidents occurred in July of
1952 at Luke air force base in Arizona.

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,070
Our story begins on a normal
training day. It was really hot

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,670
in the cockpit, flying down
at low level, below 3000 PDFs,

23
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:22,570
over a hundred degrees.

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,790
And Colonel Dan full, Jim was on
his fifth run, flying in formation,

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,370
doing a trading maneuver. He'd
done it a million times before,

26
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:31,860
but this time something happened.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,860
He pulled the plane up
hard and rolled out. Yeah.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,730
The next thing I knew I was,

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,140
eh,

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,560
you seem to be sitting up on the back
of the airplane looking down into the

31
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,394
cockpit.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,090
Suddenly he was outside the plane.

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,810
I could see what was going
on. I could see the ground,

34
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:57,240
I could see it with
another airplane. And um,

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,120
and when he looked in the cockpit
where he was supposed to be,

36
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,003
he could see

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,870
pilot. I was watching myself
not knowing it was me.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,030
What's going on here?

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,080
[inaudible]

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,820
I'm just going to watch
this for a little while.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,110
So he just sat there on the wing
of his own plane watching himself

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,020
fly the plane and just all of a
sudden the curtain snaps nurse.

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,500
No, it's not a dream. I'm actually,

44
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,400
that's me in the cockpit and I'm flying
the airplane again. But we began to,

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
to realize it, Luke, that uh,

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,350
in the eight weeks of
training period I was there,

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,130
we lost nine pallets.
They died. Yeah. Wow.

48
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,700
And most of them for running into the
ground or running into each other in the

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,890
air or an s or thing.

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,460
And that's an awful lot of pilot
solutions just in training.

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay. Fast forward. Many years,

52
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:58,120
army engineers are studying this problem
and they figured out some stuff about

53
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:02,730
it, not, yeah. And along
comes this guy, Jim Winter,

54
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,063
Jim Winter, he is his name,

55
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,940
the Federal Aviation Administration
or medical research program.

56
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:10,730
And he had a radical notion, if we're
going to really understand this, I mean,

57
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,960
really get to the bottom of this.

58
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:16,160
We have to induce this
experience on purpose.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,620
Make them go blank. Make them, yeah.

60
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,030
Create the conditions that exist in a
fighter jet on the ground in a controlled

61
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,880
environment so they can
study this [inaudible].

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,930
His idea was let's put
pilots in a centrifuge,

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,930
big a centrifuge and go to
these things at the astronauts.

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,700
You've got a 50 foot arm that spins
around and round and around and on the end

65
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:42,701
of that 50 foot arm does cockpit a
cockpit pretend cockpit mocked up to be

66
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,140
exactly like what a fighter aircraft
might be like with all the controls.

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,250
They screens the throttle.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,870
That's where the pilot sits and
gets spun around real fast. I see.

69
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,620
So when we put out a call for volunteers,
I'm Tim says Deck Commander Says Tech.

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,950
I met Dr Winter. He was one of the
ones that got involved in his research,

71
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,950
heroically volunteered to
fly the centrifuge and to
deliberately knock himself

72
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:13,470
out. Scared pilots don't do scared.

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,480
[inaudible] 10 [inaudible] pleasure.

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,980
This is a recording from the experiment.

75
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,350
The task was to chase
this little airplane.

76
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,980
So I'd sit there and you'd follow it.
And first couple maneuvers would be,

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,760
you know, three gs g forces
as the is the, it's like a,

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,960
it's like when you're on a roller coaster,

79
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,820
five gs that force that pins
you back in your seat, seven gs,

80
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,230
except really on a roller coaster.

81
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,590
You're only ever gonna experience
about two gs and then nine gs.

82
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,290
Nothing like these guys.
The high g forces herd

83
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,640
the skin on your face, sags,

84
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:50,380
your eyelids sag so low that you can't
see out from under him and you end up to

85
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,990
tilt your head back to look out from
under your own eyelids that are shaking

86
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:55,960
down in front of your
face. Meanwhile, yours,

87
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,980
you're tensing all your leg
muscles in your abdominal muscles,

88
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,140
in your arm muscles as hard.

89
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,450
You can learn to use
your body to fight it.

90
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:05,800
And what you do is you tend to every
muscle from your toes to your calves,

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,800
push it out, push it all the way
up, all the way up, okay. And uh,

92
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,680
you take a breath, right?

93
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,590
And you start to say the word Hook
and you hold it for three seconds

94
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,810
and then you finish it off by finishing
the k over the hook. So these pilots,

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,760
they sound like they're wrestling
or fighting or something.

96
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,023
Okay.

97
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,960
They're grunting and groaning and

98
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,663
hook

99
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,330
making all these hook noises.

100
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,740
It's like that.

101
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,360
The most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs.

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,920
Just to give you a sense of what
that might feel like for a pilot,

103
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:54,870
like Tim says, doc who weighs about 200
pounds. Once he makes a 12.4 g turn,

104
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,730
his body goes from 200 pounds,

105
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,530
two to almost 2,500 pounds.

106
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,910
That's like over the weight
of a car because of the
pressure pushing down on it.

107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,760
More crucially says when re those g
forces pull blood blood violently from the

109
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:16,011
brain is pushed from the head down toward
the feet and it pools and the abdomen

110
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,620
and the lower extremities
and when it pools down there,

111
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,560
it can't get back up to the brain
and that's when the problems start.

112
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,070
Does this sound good? No. He, Dr Winter,

113
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,330
he documented a particular sequence that
happens when blood is pulled from the

114
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,520
brain. The first thing you lose is vision.

115
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,200
Usually the first thing to go are your
eyes and you have what's called gray out

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,990
or loss of peripheral vision and a,

117
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:43,890
you start getting tunnel vision and then
you go through blackout where you can

118
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:44,611
see nothing.

119
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,090
You lose your sight and then if you
take the acceleration forces a little

120
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:48,924
higher,

121
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,210
you're lose consciousness.

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,033
When I woke up,

123
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,360
I remember just sitting there and
I mean this little white space,

124
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,210
I actually had no idea who I was, who
am I, where I was, what I was doing,

125
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,340
why am I doing it?

126
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm sitting in this little white ball
and I'm looking around and what is this

127
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,990
all about? I hear this beeping.

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,360
There's just quite like
BP and then at that moment

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,433
I realize

130
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,210
that I'm in a little room and that I'm
supposed to do something in that one of

131
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:25,780
the things I'm supposed to do is press
that button. Should I press the button

132
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,590
and at that moment I
realized, holy Macron a pilot.

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,510
I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying
it and I grabbed the controls and then

134
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,700
just a giant run.

135
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,710
I'm Tim Sefstadt, Callie macro.
I'm Tim Sestak. I'm Tim Jack.

136
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,130
I'm a pilot. I'm flying in.

137
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,750
The centrifuge all came back
to me at once and I was okay.

138
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,940
Okay. Commando says tech. Dr.
Bennett, how are you feeling again?

139
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,170
I'm like, I can't go home time.

140
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,630
Over the course of 15
years, when are you tested?

141
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:03,530
About 500 pilots in the center view.
She recorded their experiences,

142
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,490
measured everything he could think
of, and he found a few things.

143
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:11,360
First that the average blackout lasted
somewhere between 12 and 24 seconds.

144
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,320
One second. Yeah, and wild blacked
out. This is the interesting thing.

145
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:20,210
Pilots experienced these strange
little visions. Ephesians,

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,770
I'll give you an example
of the a individual that
that lost consciousness had

147
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,520
convulsive movements where he was moving
his arms forward and back for about two

148
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,830
or three seconds. When he came to, we
ask him what had happened. He said, uh,

149
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,740
yeah, it was a nice warm day and
I was out at the lake fishing.

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,010
All of a sudden I could feel like a,

151
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:48,450
I had a about a five pound bass on my
line and he was talking and each time he

152
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:48,811
tugged,

153
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:52,080
I haven't pulled back and then all of
a sudden I was back in the centrifuge.

154
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:52,914
I Dunno what happened.

155
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,900
These little dream lifts wintery
thinks this is the brain confused.

156
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:01,110
It's cut off. Meaning think it
from the brain's perspective.

157
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,440
It's lost the body and yet
the body is convulsing.

158
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,520
Trying to get blood back up to the brain.
Brain has no idea why it's convulsing.

159
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,730
It just sees arms flailing
about and thinks, well,

160
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,880
my arms are jerking back and
forth. I must be best fishing.

161
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,870
The things that are happening around you
frequently get incorporated into those

162
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,880
short dreamless. Here's one of his own.

163
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,290
It turns out he has tested himself
in the centrifuge many times.

164
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,670
A little dream that I had. I was going
down the aisle of a grocery store

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,270
floating, if you will. I don't
know that I was on a magic carpet,

166
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:40,271
but I sure wasn't having to walk and I
was just really motivated to try to pick

167
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:43,430
up some ice cream.

168
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,470
As I was going down the aisle and
I was moving down through the,

169
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,770
and I could see the freezer. I knew
the ice cream was over there. Yeah.

170
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
And I just could not move
my hand over to get it.

171
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,300
The next thing I realized was I was
trying to turn off the buzzer in the

172
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:03,140
centrifuge with my hand and I
could hear it. I could not move it.

173
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:08,141
And then just momentarily I got the
ability to have motor control return and I

174
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,543
can turn it off.

175
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,620
Yeah. I don't know where I am. Y'All
don't know where the hell I am.

176
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,330
I thought I was at the
grocery store, by the way.

177
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:26,830
The other thing is I couldn't control
my arm to get the get the found off

178
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,630
either. It's interesting

179
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,001
this recording,

180
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:33,810
you're listening to this from a day when
Dr wintery blacked out five times in a

181
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,170
row.

182
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,300
I don't remember anything
on that one. Okay.

183
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,530
And after that fifth run, which you're
about to hear, something weird happened.

184
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,880
Let you take a break. Just a
few seconds. Can't you Brad?

185
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,570
I don't know about that one.
I don't remember starting one

186
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,050
last ride coming up. God, I don't
know if you can take one more.

187
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,790
I'm hesitating because
I'm not ready yet. Okay.

188
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,170
I'm hesitating because I'm
not quite ready yet. Okay.

189
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,010
Just let me know whenever you get ready,

190
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,210
Ron, relax. Let your blood flow
through your brain may be like,

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,810
okay, I'm ready for that one
idea. Okay. Bob Checklist.

192
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,450
That istation data station is
ready. Operator. Operator is ready.

193
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:32,250
Medical medical is ready. Finally,
have you played sort of a final ready?

194
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,690
Haven't been activated. Are you ready?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going up this time.

195
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,740
Right? I remember going
up on that point. Yes.

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,473
Ron. Greg

197
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,283
[inaudible] [inaudible]

198
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,873
the

199
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,710
[inaudible].

200
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,370
Yeah, I think that was enough. At the
end of that last run, doctor winter,

201
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,660
he got off the centrifuge woozy
and stumbled down the hall.

202
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,310
I was really confused when a,

203
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,640
when I got off the centrifusion I
was walking down the hall back to my

204
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:32,660
laboratory and all of a sudden
I began to realize that uh,

205
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,970
I was above and behind myself and I
could see somebody who was myself walking

206
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:42,530
down the hall and I said,
Oh man, that's unusual.

207
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,630
Pilots are generally not
new age kind of guys,

208
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,660
but at least 40 of them in wintery
study did report what he just described

209
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,550
having an out of body experience.

210
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,100
We're just still an even smaller sub
sub group reported seeing the classic

211
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,200
tunnel with white light type thing.

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,310
All doctor wintery can say is
that that last sub sub group,

213
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,530
they were the ones who
were out the longest.

214
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,810
They had the most intense blackouts.

215
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,140
He's not ready to draw any conclusions
but he does suspect that the dream lists

216
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,190
divisions of seeing yourself from
above even the tunnel and white lights,

217
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,980
it's all part of the same situation.

218
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:31,450
The brain is just confused
at having lost the body

219
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,470
and peppermint and Kara old
produced that piece for us.

220
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:57,150
Thank you to them and thanks also to
our pilots. Dan Full Jim, Tim Systemic,

221
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,480
and of course Jim [inaudible]. Hello.

222
