00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.879
[Beeping in time to countdown]

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.710
[Airplane engine]

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.289
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Are we live?

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.219
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I think we're live.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh crap.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So today.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Hi guys.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.349
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Welcome to the Friday Review
of Games.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.349
I am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.890
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And I'm Daniel Pham.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And today we're drinking Red
Hoptober which is a seasonal by New Belgium.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
There you are Daniel.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Oh thank you very much.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh I know you're, you got
a chaser there.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.730
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, I got a chaser.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.890
The chaser happens to be The Balvenie.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Peated Cask.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.070
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Peated Cask.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: 17 year old.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.070
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: 17 year old.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.070
Yeah.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a limited release actually.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.890
They're doing some sort of really heavily
peated whiskey and they were switching casks

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.832
and they were like oh these peated casks would
be nice for a finish on our 17 year.

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:52.832
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's quite tasty.

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:53.832
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's actually quite good.

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:54.832
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's quite tasty.

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:55.832
Yeah.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:58.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, well weíre getting
late today because we're incompetent and--

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.800
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Apparently it must have been
my fault.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.120
I think I screwed something up in the last
show and it made it so terrible that Reto

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.380
was not able to fix all my mistakes in time
for this show.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.960
It's my fault.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.659
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, I mean it's not an excuse,
it's a reason, but you were blinded by the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.140
laser beams that shoot out from La Reto's
eyes whenever he gets mad about somebody misusing

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.140
the action bar.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You know, we're in a 150 square
foot space here and dodging those lasers is

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
pretty tricky.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.759
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's tough; you need, you
really need one of those Cyclops things.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.180
Either that or you stop reviewing apps that
are rated less than four stars.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.780
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: He was pretty upset.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, so with us is engineer
Reto Meier.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.400
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Hey everyone.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.479
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.049
And Daniel of course, usually engineers our
shows but today he's with us because since

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.539
he hasnít been writing java code for the
last 20 years turns out he's the only guy

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.150
on our team that knows anything about football.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.389
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, yeah it's true.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.240
So I believe we're going to be reviewing some
games and I happen to be the only guy that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.040
knows the difference between a round ball,
which is soccer and real football which Americans

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.860
play, made of pigskin.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.860
So that would be me.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860
No one else knows anything about football.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty much.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
I have no idea.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.550
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I was going to do the previous
show too but I donít know anything about,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.130
you know, over flow menus or you know, best
UI guidelines or any of that kind of stuff.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.130
So.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.599
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Plus it turned out that mostly
we were talking about soccer.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.599
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I think Cricket, right?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.849
That's what you call Aussie rules football,
is Cricket?

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.849
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Something like that.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.849
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.849
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's played with some kind
of stick, right?

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, and an insect?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.480
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And a horse?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.690
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uh yeah.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The horse, yeah exactly.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920
Does Mitt Romney play that?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uuh, maybe?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Who's that?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I dunno.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Let's go.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ok.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So somebody told me that I
have hair like him.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.180
Alright.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.709
It's time to talk about football because NFL
preseason is just getting over with.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.709
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.709
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The regular season is just
about to start.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.709
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's almost Labor Day weekend
here in America and we are gonna play some

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.190
games about guys in armor and tight tight
pants smashing into one another.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.110
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes and bending over.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.819
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh is that part of it?

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.819
Oh you're right.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.129
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah when they get set.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.129
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes indeed.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.129
Ok.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.129
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: When they get lined up

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So Dan's been field testing
all of these games for us.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.939
Apparently not just as part of his job but
because he likes them.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.939
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: ummmm yeah.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And we've got kind of a nice
line-up today I think.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.590
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I think we do, I think we've
got a pretty great line-up.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Except for the ones that Reto
suggested, they all have different, they're

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.760
not all actually football I think.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760
But uh.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So let's get started.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, what do you want to
talk about first?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.930
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So I'm going to go to Retro
Football.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh hell yeah.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.219
You know, actually I joke but the truth is,
my absolute favorite game a long time ago

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.960
was Super Bowl Sunday, did you ever play that?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960
No.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960
What game was it?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it was before your
time.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.890
As in probably before you were conceived,
but-

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.970
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: any any

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.189
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It was a commodore 64 game
and you know you chose your team and it had

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.319
all of the teams from the first Super Bowl
all the way up.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.319
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Uh huh.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which by the way, I didnít
realize these but, the Super Bowl actually

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.740
started fairly recently right?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.220
In the 30s or 40s or 50s?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's fairly recent to you?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well I'm just saying I was
reading up on the history of football and--

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: How old are you?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty old.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You can give that one away.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.931
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I was just gonna say apparently
in 1905 there were 18 deaths in the, what

00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:30.931
became the NFL.

00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:31.931
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You're kidding?

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:32.931
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No.

00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:33.931
No.

00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:34.931
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know why?

00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:36.710
Because back then they played real football.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.430
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: ok, real football?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Anyway so Commodore 64 game
you could pick any football team from any

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.150
of the Super Bowls that had ever played.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.240
And then you pitted against whoever.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.750
So you could literally like, the '71 Dolphins
versus the you know '82 Bears or something,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.620
I can't remember the exact years, but.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.620
And you'd call the plays.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.610
So you'd call the offensive play, you'd call
the defensive play and they'd run it out.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.610
And I loved that.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.610
I think that's why I like football, is you
know, is you've got the play and you can have

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.030
to see it work to see if you planned it right.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.389
I liked the strategic aspect.

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.569
I know a lot of people like more arcade-y
aspect, that's not me.

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.610
I like the play calling.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.949
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, ok.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.340
Well you'll probably like a couple of the
games that we're playing later.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.819
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.699
Anyway, that had absolutely nothing to do
with anything except that I saw the word retro

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.610
and football together and it took me down
memory lane.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.610
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It had something to do with
your age.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.030
Can you pass me that sack of Depends there?

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.030
I think I might need it.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.030
I'm kinda excited.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.569
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Why donít you just take the
scotch instead?

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Why thank you, sonny.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.900
Mmmm.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.900
Tell us about Retro Football.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, so Retro Football.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.830
So we're starting out with the poorest of
all the titles that were suggested.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.130
Just so we can build up some momentum before
we play some of these other games.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.890
And we're gonna start by looking at the menu.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.289
Let's see New Game, Options and About.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.150
So I'm the kinda guy that just skips straight
to the gameplay.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Isnít everybody?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.150
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.479
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: When I want to play a game
I just want to get straight to the entertainment

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.479
part.

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.520
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's right.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Options, man.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.060
Let's just ñ

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I don't need Options.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.060
About?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.060
I'll figure it out as I go.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.060
So, New Game.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.009
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now the first thing I just
want to mention is, and this is not a gameplay

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.879
thing at all, but none of this text is anti-aliased.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.289
Which you can almost argue makes it look retro,
except not the good kind of retro.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No, it's the crap kind of retro.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: There's a big difference guys.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.220
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Make sure you know where that
line is.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There's like "Everybody Dance
Now" and there's "Sussussudio".

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520
K?

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.370
Make sure you're on the right side of that
line, that's all I can say.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.370
Alright so.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.810
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I donít know what that is,
but it just sounds terrible.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.810
Exactly.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.810
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So, here you can choose--

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It was a disease; a lot of
people had it in the '80s.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.669
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So right here you can choose
quarter length and they have four options.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:06.250
And to me, it's not really apparent what the
benefits are to changing the quarter length

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.250
right now.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.250
Other than--

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Gameplay?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sorry, but I'm going to interrupt
for a quick second.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Sure.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Have we been muted this whole
time?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No no no.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But there is some rustling,
I wonder if your mic Daniel, has slid down

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.250
some?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's possible.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.250
Here, we'll uh--

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.360
Dude your mic was like in your pants.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.460
Could you hear him?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It was coming through pretty
well considering

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.561
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You have a really odd vocal
arrangement.

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:26.561
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You guys weren't supposed--

00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:27.561
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Perfect.

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.561
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You guys weren't supposed to
find that out about all--

00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:29.561
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:30.561
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: - that till next year.

00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.930
I'll put it right in the front.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.930
Yeah.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.930
That must be it.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.069
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright, that's nice.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:37.069
Thank you.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:39.660
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And as you can see it is duct
taped.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.860
For those of you that are wondering at home.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So everyone knows this is a
professional set up.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.800
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, of course of course.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800
Yeah.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.449
So we're just going to go with the 2, 2 minute
and 30 second quarter length.

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:56.960
We're gonna go with, let's go with All Star
difficulty.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.259
And we're gonna go start game.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:02.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: By the way, while Daniel is
doing this, if you see me typing over here,

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.680
it's because we donít have a producer today.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.629
I'm handling the Livestream, if you have any
questions at all for us go ahead and put them

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.880
on the YouTube Livestream, that's what I'm
monitoring.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.610
I donít have enough attention to monitor
anything else.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.530
So, don't look at the G plus invitation or
the GDL page.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.310
Just right on the YouTube page, if you put
down a comment I'll see it.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.740
And if you're lucky, we'll answer it.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.740
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yep.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, by the way, quick shout
out to our buddy Daniel.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.000
Oh- who has no producer- Yes Dan, we have
no producer, do you wanna produce?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.920
Go for it, jump right on here.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.419
Dan Galpin everybody.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.760
Dan Galpin is actually away today.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.750
He's at PAX with Koh Kim.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.750
So--

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: -both of the people that you
saw last week -now they were supposed to like

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.630
call up and do a Hangout with us and everything
but we get a call at like 12:55 saying hey

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.180
we're doing that Hangout?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.100
No Dan, we're not doing that Hangout.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.490
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Literally 5 minutes before
the showñ

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If you called me at noon we
woulda done the Hangout.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.880
Alright, so anyway, and also shout out to
our buddy Marcus.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880
Thanks for joining us.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.060
And everybody else who's on the Livestream.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.190
Now let's go ahead and play some football.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.190
Wow.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.850
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is, oh oh ok so I see
what kind of retro this is now.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.950
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes, it's the crap kind of
retro.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.500
Like I said we're building up to the great
games.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I see what you're saying.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.290
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We're starting out with a really
poor example.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No this is great, this is
great cause this is like, I remember these

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.060
things.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.120
You know you'd see them in like Shakey's Pizza
or something.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.601
And it'd actually be all plastic.

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:36.720
Plastic top and they'd just have lights underneath
that'd turn on.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.320
Even when I was a kid and they were brand
new, I thought they sucked.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.300
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Wow.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.300
This is a good imitation of that.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a good recreation of
that, I mean, if you liked stuff that sucked

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:45.930
in the '80s.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.930
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: mmm hmmm

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm not really selling this
am I?

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.079
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No, you're not, no.

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:50.280
So let's just dive right into the game.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: let's do that.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And ignore everything that
Ian just said.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.829
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So let's take a look.

00:09:55.829 --> 00:10:00.839
So right away you can see that the kick button
is flashing so I guess that it wants me to

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:01.839
kick.

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:05.850
If you haven't done the tutorial, which most
of the time I donít do, you probably won't

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.850
know what to do.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.110
But let's just press the button and see what
happens.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.110
Kick.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.110
Great.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.140
So it looks like the ball is traveling across
the field and this is the point where I usually

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.820
start button mashing because I donít know
what the heck is going on.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.380
So I'm just gonna randomly touch the screen.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.500
And it looks like the X's and O's are flashing
and at this point it'd be really great to

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.960
have some kind of indicator to let you know
what to do next.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.829
For those of us that do know football you
can look at the scoreboard you can see that

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:41.649
its first down, 10 yards to go.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:48.600
But from a gameplay perspective, it's not
really clear like what commands you can push

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.389
to start the next play.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:55.790
So all you see here is like a pass button
and a couple of arrow keys for running but

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:01.630
it doesnít really say you can do one or the
other which is kind of what you're supposed

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.630
to do.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.910
So let's just randomly push the pass button
and see what happens.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.910
Nothing.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.430
No feedback.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.470
Let's push the run button.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.820
Great so then youíve just started a play
and apparently now it's second down and I

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:22.310
was blocked and there's, there's really no
feedback.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.920
There's no gap between starting a new play
and getting crushed by the defender who just

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.570
is an X on the screen.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.560
So it'd be nice from, you know, from when
you start the play to when you actually get

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.000
crushed to have some kind of indication that
you can move up or down or dodge the defender

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.920
in some way or more the running back, you
know that kind of stuff.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: is that what you're supposed
to do?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
You're supposed to--

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah you're supposed to run,
you're supposed to press the buttons and run

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920
around.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh oh oh oh.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: But see now its 3rd down, oh
my god, now its 3rd down, now its 4th down.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wait what?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And all the sudden, yep its
4th down.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: how'd it get to be 4th down?

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.130
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I donít know.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: you didnít like stop or anything
right?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: there's absolutely no feedback.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We're playing by the Retro
Football rules.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.020
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.020
Yes.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I see.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.020
Ok.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.020
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, there's just-

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Are you sure this isn't Aussie
rules football?

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.410
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's possible.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.410
It's possible.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Iím pretty sure thatís not
Aussie rules football.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.880
You wanna have a much more elliptical playing
surface for that.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.930
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Elliptical playing surface,
not flat.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.930
Great.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: right, they play in a paddock,
not a field.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.720
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I have no idea what that is.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it's where you keep
horses.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You haven't spent much time
in the country, have you Dan?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I've only been out of the country
once.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: [laugh] I meant the country,
as in like you know, not the city.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.089
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, the stuff that's
passed Livermore and Gilroy?

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:41.339
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Might as well be Europe to
me.

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, pretty much.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.540
Gotcha.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.089
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Might as well be Europe.

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:47.300
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Fair enough, alright guys.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.079
Let's go ahead and take a look at another
game.

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:50.079
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:51.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think we've plumbed the
depths of this one.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, so that's, it's pretty
much it.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:13:00.800
I mean it does definitely take me back my
only complaint is, it takes me back to the

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.630
part of my life before video games were fun.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's absolutely true.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I can see it appealing to
people, not to me personally, but it is a

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.320
well done emulation of that anyway.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.320
Let's take a look at something else.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, so let's go to, let's
actually go to NFL kicker.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: NFL Kicker.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.140
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Awesome.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.050
Great.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.440
Because as we all know, kicking is the most
important and exciting part of football.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.040
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So, the tablet's now covering--

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's alright, that's ok.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.290
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: -part of your face.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.699
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:36.339
You can see the cable from the tablet but--

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:37.339
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: that's fine.

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:38.339
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I've dealt with worse.

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:39.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I think people'd rather look
at the cable than your face.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah, probably true.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.139
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And my face is big enough
you can see it anyway.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:44.940
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, it's huge.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty much.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:53.040
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So, I've already gone through
some of the game to, you know earn ranks and

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.839
my rank right now is a Starting Kicker.

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:59.040
So when you first start the game you would
normally start as Rookie and as you played

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.139
through the tutorial your rank goes up based
on your score.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.769
So I've already gone ahead and unlocked some
of the additional stages but let's go through

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:08.769
the basic skills.

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:10.540
And learn some kicking tips.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.560
So this is great, while it's loading I get
to learn some kicking tips try to aim for

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.000
the scoreboard every time, blah blah blah.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.250
And we get some 3D rendered cheerleaders.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.250
Awesome.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wow.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.300
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that's not pandering at all.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.339
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Definitely not.

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:32.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's, some of that animation
was a little disturbing.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: A little bit.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.139
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: But NFL cheerleaders in real
life are a little disturbing so I think that's

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:40.620
spot on.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:48.399
And as you can see, my player is wearing the
same number that I am, number 52 Patrick Willis,

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:53.079
but in the game I named him something totally
different.

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:58.480
Points to you guys out there who know what
thickness is referring to.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.300
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300
Thickness?

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:07.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's a quip made by a NFL player
Asante Samuel, he tweeted something having

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.750
to do with thickness.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.600
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And no one could figure what
it was and so now it's become a really popular

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.720
internet meme.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: nice.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.540
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yes.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.540
So I decided to use it.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm so glad we have you around
Daniel.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.540
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.540
Yeah.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or otherwise we'd totally
not be hip at all.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:30.320
Ok, so apparently this is, I'm just gonna
turn the camera like and I'm just gonna flick.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320
Tell me that I'm not a pro.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That was such, that was pro.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
--
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That was a pro shot.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320
Yeah.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's, that's a thousand points.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I donít know.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I thought it was like three.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.769
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It'd be nice if they told us.

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:44.170
Well it is, it's kind of a tutorial of basic
skills.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.170
There's no-

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh I see.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: points awarded anyway.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So control the ball while
it's in flight.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yep.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.250
It's pretty-

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Controlling the ball while
it's, is that actually part of a NFL game?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No, so this is actually into
the realm of fantasy.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh like, I wish I could control
the ball.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.110
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, like Billy Cundiff last
year in the playoffs, he cost the Ravens the

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.440
game missing that, really shanking left you
know that field goal from 23 yards out.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If only he had this particular
ball.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, if only he was able to
control the ball in air he wouldn't have missed

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.899
that goal post by you know like, 50 million
miles.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.069
Sorry to all you Ravens fans out there.

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:24.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's ok, I donít think we
have any Ravens fans on here.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No probably not.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nah.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.069
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Tap the screen to continue.

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:33.200
So now you can get extra points for accuracy,
you can control the ball and use the control

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.449
scheme that we just found.

00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:37.430
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh watch the wind!

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ohoh no, fail.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.910
No good.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.899
Let's try this again.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:43.899
Still fail.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:46.220
Apparently I'm terrible at this game.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah I donít know man.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.370
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah I'm sorry guys this is
a fail.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well here let me try.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.110
Maybe itís not, maybe it's not, is it a swipe
while you're in there?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.089
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, it's a swipe.

00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:01.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah you're right.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.370
Unless, or are you actually supposed to touch
the ball?

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: the wind is actually a lot
stronger than ñ

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah it's really strong, you're
right.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.130
Ok alright, so well anyway.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.130
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That looks like it's got some
promise anyway.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.570
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah let's go to some of the
different game modes.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I like, the graphics are really
impressive.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah I really like them a lot.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Except when you really zoom
in on the crowd and then realize that that

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.910
totally doesnít work at all.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:24.910
What?

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.770
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.700
So the back button actually, it's a little
bit jarring.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:34.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah this the old school way
of doing the back button like, before we really

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.960
figured out how to make games good.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.801
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah it's not really clear
here if you wanna actually exit the game or

00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:41.680
if you wanna go back to the main menu or what
you really wanna do.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's find out.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680
I'm betting-

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's a mystery.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680
Ooh.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh ok, so yeah.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Nice.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680
So back to the game right?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, what we'd really prefer
is that you just go back and then give the

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.370
user a way to go forward again.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.660
Instead of trying to do a confirm, in Android
you usually donít have to tear down and rebuild

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.080
a whole lot of stuff to move from screen to
screen.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.710
So unless your game is literally using all
available RAM on the system, in which case,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.680
you're kinda screwed anyway.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.060
You should be able to go back to a menu screen
like this and give the user a way to say oh

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.710
no wait, I wanted to continue my game and
get back into it without having to ask for

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.590
confirmation to move from screen to screen.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.570
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Do you have another piece of
tape?

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: The Google glue.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.760
Duct tape.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.840
Fixes everything.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's pretty amazing,
that one's lasted us like four weeks.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: wonderful.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: perfect.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ready to go.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Let's go to the next game mode,
In the Zone.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:48.090
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: In the Zone, here we go.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:58.840
It's giving us a tip coffin corner; it's got
a nice image of Lucas Oil Stadium.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.910
Alright, let's get kicking.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:09.460
So in this game mode it's basically employing
all your basic skills you learned in the tutorial

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.980
from before.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:23.060
And it's got, really great controls for, oh
that was a fail.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.950
So here we go, let's try this.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:32.010
Every now and then you get like a little gold
bar on either side of the field post and if

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.640
you're good enough to hit that gold section,
you'll score some additional points.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.780
And it doesn't happen very often with me as
you can see because I'm a terrible kicker.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:47.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: By the way we have a message
from our coworker Dan Galpin.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.660
He says Pham's football flicking fails frequently.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.280
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Thanks Dan.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280
Thank you.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280
Appreciate that.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Thanks a lot man.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So, you know, I won't bore
you with this anymore.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.190
Let's find another game mode that's a little
more interesting.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.900
That's pretty standard.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:09.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I think you know, we've
got 15 minutes left, why don't we move on

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
to some other games instead.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think we can say this is
some cool game play, and if you like the flick

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.990
games, it's a pretty good example.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yep.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah it's got all the licenses;
it's got a really nice set of graphics.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.670
Got a few things wrong, I'd really really
like to see the back button handled differently.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.390
Because right now it just looks a little amateurish.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.270
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I agree.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But everything else, despite
the fact that I donít think it was actually

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.380
created with this device in mind, it looks
pretty good on the tablet.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.520
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I agree.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520
I totally agree.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.610
The graphics are sufficiently high resolution
to overcome any other short comes.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.610
Did a good job.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.610
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Actually we're gonna keep it
in portrait mode.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We're gonna show one more flick
game really quick from the same developer.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.521
If I can find it.

00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:02.160
It is NFL Flick Quarterback.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.750
So this is a nice little twist on flick games.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:19.440
Waiting for that to load.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.900
And as with the last game, I've also achieved
a rank of Starting QB and that's up from Rookie.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.570
So let's go to the first mode, Play Maker.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: OK.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.590
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So the same style.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.420
Same info loop between game loading.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.310
I've obviously chosen the same player with
the same name as last time.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:50.020
And this is great, now in this mode your goal
is to pass the ball as effectively as you

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.210
can to the receiver.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.090
And using the same control schemes as the
kicking game, you know, you flick and you

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.140
can control the ball in midair left or right.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright the receiver is kind
of a douche.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah he is.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.240
All receivers are douche bags, I thought you
knew that.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240
And-

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: OOOH.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.240
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: - that's a fail.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.110
And this receiver actually makes some really
crazy moves.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.620
Moves that no normal receiver in the NFL would
be able to make.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.580
He must be on steroids.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cause nobody in the NFL is
for sure.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.850
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Nobody in the NFL is on steroids.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wow that's like duct tape
hands.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yeah.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty amazing.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.630
This looks like a fun game.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.600
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yeah, this is actually pretty
cool.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.930
So, you know you can score a lot of points
for ñ

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Once again just you know,
look at how crisp those graphics are.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.990
All those in game graphics are just, theyíve
really done a good job of adapting to different

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.820
resolutions and making it look awesome.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.430
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yeah, I'm really enjoying this.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.110
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I can tell.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.900
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So let's skip this game part
and go to the next one.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.900
That's pretty much it.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.670
There's a couple additional things you can
do.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.341
So if you take a long time to pass the ball,
which I wasn't doing, it's possible the one

00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:08.430
of the defenders is gonna rush you and you
can juke them.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.420
But I think the quick fire mode here is gonna
have that also.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh cool.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.740
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So with Quick Fire your goal
is to pass as many balls as possible without

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.740
running out of time.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.201
And every time when you successfully complete
a pass you get additional time and if you

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:25.900
get an interception you get points, you get
time deducted.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, the only thing that
I don't really like about this game is all

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.060
the cheerleaders have the same uniform.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.060
What's with that?

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Because they all cheer for
the same team.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: America?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yes.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: They cheer for America.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Team America.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:39.790
Great movie-

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.670
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: - if any of you guys haven't
seen it.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.230
Bonus points to anyone who knows the lyrics
to the song.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Everybody knows the lyrics
to that song.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.180
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So I've got 44 seconds.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:24:01.120
So let's pretend I'm a really crappy player,
uhh sacked.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:07.550
So I really like the animations in between,
you know they've taken the time to animate

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.560
the player getting up, dusting himself off.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560
You know it-

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, they've really taken
a lot of care.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.900
So speaking of animations, I think that's
a good segue into our next game which is,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.750
well it would be NFL Rivals and it's not.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.330
And I'll tell you why it's not NFL Rivals.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:31.240
Because even though NFL Rivals is a great
game, for some reason they have never, they've

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:38.920
never taken the Nexus, any of the Nexus stuff
that we've got off their blacklists, so I

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.470
can't install NFL Rivals and I can't install
on I'm sorry, on my Galaxy Nexus, I can't

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.090
install it on my Nexus 7.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.240
Can't install on the Transformer Prime.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.350
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I was really really disappointed.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.320
You know when I went to go and try to play
the game, you know I've got a box of Nexus

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.740
devices and none of them were able to play
the game.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So we're gonna review Back
Breaker instead.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let me just turn off this
sound.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.700
Yeah.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.780
That's not how I turn off the sound.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780
Ok.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.120
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Get it right Ian.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:17.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, that's interesting because
I, as you can see it's muted but it is still

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.530
playing music isn't it?

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.530
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So there's a problem right
there.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.810
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes, please fix that.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.530
So with this I can.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:35.270
So, this Back Breaker there I'm gonna set
my player, I'll call him player.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:40.430
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You shoulda named him thickness
just like the rest of the players.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok, oh look.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.430
I put a character term in my players name
and now he has no name.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.430
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Oh, he's nameless.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.430
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.270
And he plays for the Assassins.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.380
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I don't really like them.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or the Hawks or the Pioneers.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.250
I think these are Aussie rules football.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.090
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, definitely not American.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.090
Maybe Canadian.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.090
Maybe the CFL.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Maybe.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What was the name of this game?

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Back Breaker.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Back Breaker.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah but it's basically the
same as NFL Rivals and I'll tell ya what's

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.860
different, is NFL Rivals actually has the
licenses.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:24.850
And in addition, the friend challenge mode
allows you to gain points for your favorite

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.960
team, which I thought was really cool.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.522
So if I put in like Seattle Seahawks, that's
my team right, then I would-

00:26:29.522 --> 00:26:31.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You're a Seahawks fan?

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm from Seattle, man.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Oh come on.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh really?

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.730
You don't think you should cheer for the home
team?

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: you can cheer for whatever
team suits your fancy.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Just not the Seahawks?

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.860
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: If it happens to be those pansy
ass Seahawks then, you know, thatís ok too.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hey man, they pretty much
humiliated the Raiders.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.230
Which I know is your favorite team.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.220
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Actually yeah, I really donít
like the Raiders.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:59.720
I'm a Niners fan obviously, I'm wearing a
Niners jersey and my fianceÈ is from San

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.780
Diego so she's a Charger's fan.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.080
The Chargers are huge rivals with the Raiders.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.531
There's no way I could ever like the Raiders,
for two reasons-

00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I understand then.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Anytime they get crushed by
anyone else, it makes me happy.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So anyway.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.080
These football games, again, this is Back
Breaker, it's not quite as advanced as NFL

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.590
Rivals but it's the same basic idea.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.840
Where you're basically just trying to run
down the field and there's a guy trying to

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.781
tackle you and you juke him, you can spin,
you can do all kinds of stuff you know, go

00:27:31.781 --> 00:27:35.840
back and forth and if you get into the end
zone, I guess you win.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I really do like this, the
action aspect of the game.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's fun.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean for, and of course
NaturalMotion, you know their whole deal is

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.380
they made the you know morpheme system that
you know like the Star Wars games use.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.320
They're really animation experts and a lot
of the animation used here is really amazing.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.680
So, we like the game.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.010
We just wish that NFL Rivals was available
for a few more platforms because we think

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.320
it could be really cool.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.241
I really really like the idea that as you
know, as you gain points in the game, you

00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:10.190
are gaining points for your team.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yes.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Reto can we get that there?

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.160
[Inaudible] Ok, so anyway.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.960
Well obviously our audience is hugely enthused
by American football because we've got a record

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.370
21 people watching right now.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.600
Thanks for you guys that stuck around.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.130
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's probably just my ugly
mug.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.860
That's Daniel and Koh and like 19 people standing
there drinking beer.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I think I managed to figure
out a way to get Daniel to dial in via Hangout.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.770
So if it'só

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh oh bring him on.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180
Yeah.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah let's bring Daniel Galpin
on.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's right, Daniel Galpin's
coming on!

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.060
And the numbers just go up and up and up.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.110
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Dan Galpin!

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh my God, that's him!

00:28:54.890 --> 00:29:00.410
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We're now replacing Ian's face
with Dan Galpin's face and we can't hear-

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.550
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's perfect.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.540
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And we can't hear you.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hi everybody, I'm Dan Galpin.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.590
Canít hear you Dan.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.030
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, I can't hear Dan right
now.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The monitor, everything, back
on?

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.850
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Let's have a drink while we
wait.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That sounds good.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.140
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.140
Cheers.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.391
This is good beer by the way.

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:29.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, very hoppy for sure.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.870
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: If you would like us to do
a beer episode every week, let us know in

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.870
the comments.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Every week, that might be
a little much, but yeah.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No, if we just do a 10-15 minute
beer review, it'd be really short.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.920
Maybe we'll pre-film it.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There ya go.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.350
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Throw us ideas.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.920
We'll figure it out.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:54.580
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, while we wait for
Reto to sort out the Dan Galpin situation,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.580
let's-

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's move on to the next
game.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.580
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Let's move on to the next game.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.580
Yeah, so.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.650
We didn't get a chance to play Madden yet
but I think that's probably the next title

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.510
we should spend the time on.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure you bet.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:05.730
Let's do some Madden, that sounds awesome.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.110
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Since we've only got 10-15
minutes left.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.350
So Madden's kinda the-

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.911
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's the go to game.

00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:11.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's the big dog, yeah.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:17.570
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I'm sure for anyone who is
an NFL fan, or even a video game fan, you've

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.570
played some sort of-

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: -some sort of Madden before.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now the interesting thing
about, that you know, we're always telling

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.970
people make sure you can flick this.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.750
The thing that really confused me about it
was that ñ

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You can flick and hit the arrows?

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.750
Well actually the first time they released
though, you could only do one or the other.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.730
You couldn't do both.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.210
But yeah, so.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.210
I dunno.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.320
Put up your, you're a Niners fan.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No don't.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320
Not the Cowboys.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320
Please no.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.110
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's just where it stopped.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.670
That was what the slot machine settled on.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.670
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.670
Niners, there we go.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:53.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, sounds good.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:54.670
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Nothing but, nothing but Niners.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.110
Alright, so this is a pretty good great splash
screen.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.110
I really like that.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.679
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah, I mean its Madden,
what can you say?

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:02.210
You know.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.030
They had us download 250 Megs before we could
even play the game.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.030
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.030
Yeah, I'm sure-

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And they're pretty solid on
art.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.440
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright so, maybe this is one
of those games where I will explore some of

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.310
the additional menus before we actually start
playing the game.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.310
Go for it man.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So let's, you know, let's check
it.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.430
So let's go to game modes and see, so-

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really nice interstitials
here, lots of good animation.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.070
You can see the graphics are really crisp.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.580
Love that.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.960
The only thing I donít like is this big ass
prominent back button down at the bottom here.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: it's a little bit-

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: why do I need that?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I donít know.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There's a back button on the
screen-

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: - right before that.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.950
You know why not just use this the system
back button?

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.290
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: it's kinda weird.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.530
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Don't fix it if it isn't broken.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.700
So, there's, looks like there's three different
types of game modes; exhibition, season and

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:54.490
play-offs and if you know anything about football,
you'll know that there's real, in the actual

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:59.730
gameplay in football, there's no real difference
between exhibition, season and play-offs,

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.730
it's mostly the same.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.740
So it's not really apparent to me what each
of these really does.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.750
So let's just choose one, exhibition, since
we just finished the pre-season today or yesterday

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:16.840
actually, let's just go with that.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.570
[Pause]

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:26.309
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Not bad.

00:32:26.309 --> 00:32:28.370
And it, that was strange.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.030
So we did freeze for a few seconds there and
that was a bit unusual, I didnít expect that

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.030
to happen.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, that's alright.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.480
It's got its ups and downs there.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.360
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Rams and Niners.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.280
Now I gotta complain a little bit about texel
density on this SF logo here.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.890
I mean come on you guys.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:48.890
That's bad, it looks bad.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: You guys can do better.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.890
Oh look we see, there's Dan Galpin on the
screen.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hey Dan Galpin on the screen.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.290
Sup man.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.290
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: Hey, what's up?

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.290
So yeah I need to actually switch back over,
I was typing comments in the other window.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.290
Can you hear me?

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Totally.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah totally.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: So I'm here at PAX, Koh and
I have been walking around and checking out

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880
all the crazy booths, all the people wearing
cosplay which is funny because I think Koh

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.910
might be the only person here wearing a dress
who actually isn't doing cosplay.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:22.550
So, I wouldnít be surprised if people were
walking around asking her which character

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.650
she is.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.340
And like I said, it's been pretty awesome
here.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.290
It's kinda the craziness you expect over at
PAX.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:35.880
I'm sure all of our dedicated fans are actually
here and that's why they're not watching today.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.190
Either that or they just ñ

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I dunno Dan, I dunno, is it
you being gone, is it the football thing,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.700
is it just me?

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.700
I dunno.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.700
Is it my haircut?

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700
I dunno.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.700
But yeah we're-

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.010
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: I would say I'm not convinced
you've had enough to drink on the show although

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.790
the show has been really funny.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.790
So-

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is possible.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.020
That is definitely possible I have not had
enough to drink.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.020
But yeah.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.020
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We can fix that.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah we're working on it.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.230
We're getting there.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.330
Yeah we're having this Red Hoptober, you gotta
try it.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.330
It's good stuff.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.330
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.330
It's not bad, yeah.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, what's the coolest thing
you saw at Pax?

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.330
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: [inaudible] Save some for
me tomorrow.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.330
What?

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, what's the coolest thing
you've at Pax so far?

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.330
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: I've actually gotten to see
a true triple town t-shirt in the flesh.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: WOAH.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:15.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Triple town t-shirt.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:22.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wait, so are you gonna score
some of those for us?

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yeah.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640
Get me one, make sure you get me one.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: I will ask.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.380
Not sure if they're available for purchase.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: oh oh oh oh no.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.639
Oh no.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:33.639
You do.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.639
Oh no.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.639
There's no purchasing, Emory owes me.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.639
You tell him that.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.639
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: Ok, I'll let him know.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cool, what else have you seen?

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.639
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: But Koh's gotten lots of
[unintelligible] around the show a lot more

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.639
than I have.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:47.399
What we're gonna do is take the video camera
around and try to take some shots for you

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:49.240
guys for next week.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:55.090
And hopefully you know, come up with kind
of a state of the industry here at PAX.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's great.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.470
Yeah, we're gonna do a PAX retrospective next
week, we'll be looking at some of the games

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:05.690
that Dan and Koh saw and do a little bit of
the walking around thing, some of the on air

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.970
stuff, we're gonna do some video editing,
it's gonna be cool.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.640
We're really looking forward to it, Dan.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640
Where are you at now?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.060
It looks so peaceful and calm.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah it looks nothing like
Google.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: Yeah, this is the patio outside
the convention center.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.590
So it's basically me and about a thousand
people smoking.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.590
That's awesome.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.110
Well say hi to all of them.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.700
Give them our URL, cause God knows we need
some viewers.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.700
Only 20-something of them today.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah I know man, it's kinda
sad.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: This was good stuff.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.420
This was better than a lot of sitcoms actually.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:41.630
So I mean I think we're reaching a good comedy
threshold here.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Do you think we'd do better
with a laugh track?

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.100
Cause ñ

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: We've got drama.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.740
I mean, there's always the question of whether
or not the technology's actually gonna work.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's on purpose.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.390
I hope everyone knows that the technology
you know, was screwed up on purpose.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.640
Otherwise things would be too perfect.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's right.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.480
We wouldn't do this on accident.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480
We're Google.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No we're not.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.370
No we're not, we're just Android powered radio.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.810
Nobody even knows we're doing this.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.330
We're in this 100 square foot room you know,
in like the corner.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.580
Like, no lights, it's pretty decrepit in here.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But it's awesome.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600
It's great.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.380
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: Actually, the view of this
office that I get from the Hangout is actually

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.380
pretty cool.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.710
I've got like the top of Ian's head.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:29.490
Hey Dan.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.600
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: there we are.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.930
Yeah.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:39.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: you've got the really cool
on-air screen behind you.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's true.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.010
Yeah.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.010
Alright, well cool.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.210
Well keep us posted Dan, have fun at the convention.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.780
Don't forget to come back in time to make
your salsa or whatever.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.780
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, we-

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We're probably gonna be too
drunk to make it tonight.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.510
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We miss you.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:55.510
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: I fully understand.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.510
Don't worry, we're gonna come prepared.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.510
Alright, see you tomorrow man.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:59.820
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Take care, weíll see ya later.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Take care.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.830
&gt;&gt;Daniel Galpin: Cheers.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:07.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, so now we're back
to the coin toss.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.180
This is, this is my favorite part of every
NFL game.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.180
The coin toss.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really?

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's the most- No.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180
No.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It is pretty sweet though,
isn't it?

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.180
Look.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.380
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: But the coin is quite detailed.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.380
That's a good looking coin.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's a really thin coin.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.840
That's like a, yeah, it's like a two dimensional
coin.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Coin wafer.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That coin breaks the space
time continuum in multiple ways.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.960
Oh look, I can either defend or defend.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.960
Oh wait.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.960
Oh oh I can defend-

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, you can choose which
side-

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which side is defending, ok.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.650
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: But since the wind is straight
up at 10 miles an hour, it really makes no

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.650
difference.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:42.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Gotcha.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You should totally defend.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.650
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.650
Oh great.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.650
That's a good point Reto, we definitely defend.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think you're getting the hang
of this NFL stuff.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.490
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Good for you.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:56.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See in Aussie rules they donít
have defending, it's not a thing.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.820
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's just attack attack attack?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty much.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.820
Yeah.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.820
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ok.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.820
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's actually pretty accurate.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.820
Ok.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.190
And this is the stuff, I love, I love the,
all the play calling.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Me too.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cause God knows I love good
squib.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.320
Would I like to see a tutorial?

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.400
Ok, so they really put a lot of thought into
this game.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And you'd expect that.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean it's EA, it's Madden.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.650
This is one of their major franchises.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.460
You know, I don't know if you were at E3 last
year but do you remember they actually had

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.900
it spread across, you know, they're like,
had Madden on every single screen known to

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.900
man.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No I was not at E3.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.690
But I could totally imagine them having Madden
on everything that they own.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See, that's the thing, you're
supposed to say oh yeah I was at E3, you're

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.560
right.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.460
Do you remember that one time we got totally
drunk at that bar?

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, I do, yeah.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That was a great, great time.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah because we're industry
insiders.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: but yeah.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.960
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: no, I'm just agreeing with
you because I was so drunk I don't remember

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960
anything.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that's a good point.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.630
Alright, so ok.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:53.330
I will say though that when promised a tutorial
I was hoping for a tutorial.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.090
I don't consider this a tutorial.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.450
I consider this to be a man page with pictures.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.480
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.890
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Everything in Madden should
be a man page, with pictures.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.380
No text.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: right.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.890
So yeah, what the, wait, oh I'm dragging the
ball down, then up.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.980
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Wonderful.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.800
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I guess, yeah.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.370
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Great kick off.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That was a pretty good, right
into the end zone.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Five yards deep.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: How good am I, man?

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: David Akers.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That guy shoulda just-

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.130
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: How great is David Akers?

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.970
I dunno, how great is David Akers?

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.120
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: He's pretty great.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: David Akers is so great, yeah
that's why- As I was telling him just the

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:38.020
other day, David Akers, you're not bad but
my buddy Daniel actually thinks you're great.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.270
I think, you know, seen better.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.270
Ok.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.270
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.270
David Akers, if you're watching this, cheers.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.270
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Keep it up.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If you're one of the 22 watching
now, which I can only assume that it's 22

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.790
now because Dan got back online.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hi Dan.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.750
Alright.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:54.750
So yeah.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:59.330
Glad to have you guys, I'm sure that the post
live audience will be huge.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:03.860
Actually we were just talk, actually no, this
is a good time to talk about this.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.450
So, we were mentioning that we might want
to change the time of this, because we realize

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.810
that actually this is probably not something
that people watch at work.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.700
So when we looked at our audience statistics,
it's mostly people in Europe who are watching

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.300
us right before they go to bed.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:25.930
Because it's basically, you know, they need
to shoot up and as they're shoving the intravenous

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:31.060
alcohol needle into their veins, it's either
us or the Simpsons.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.500
And they've already seen all 600 episodes
of the Simpsons.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.040
But, my point is that we donít have a lot-

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.760
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: that's a little bit flattering.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: -not a lot of ya.
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I'll take that.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.910
Absolutely.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.910
Yeah.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:43.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I'll take that.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.200
So, but yeah, not a lot of people in the US
watching us right now.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.620
Probably because they have better things to
do, like work.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.620
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.540
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah cause that's all Americans
do, they work, they watch football, drink

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.210
beer and eat cheeseburgers.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's right.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.570
Usually at the same time.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:04.820
But here's the thing, if you, we also know
that we're a little late for the European

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.050
audience and I don't know even know what time
it is in Australia because, as far as I'm

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.710
concerned they're on a different planet.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.710
If you ñ

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's 25 o'clock.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, there you go.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.500
If you have any ideas as to like a better
time for us to broadcast, keep in mind that

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.530
it just needs to be late enough to drink because
otherwise we can't speak at all.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.890
I think I've proven that adequately.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's just about eight o'clock
in the morning in Sydney.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which is a terrible time to
drink beer.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.120
Eight o'clock in the morning?

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.460
That's getting started late.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.530
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: it's 12 o'clock somewhere in
the world.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:44.800
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright so anyway, point is,
in the comments, please give us some ideas

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.520
on you know, when we could get going and-
Oh, Dan mentions that we're good substitutes

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.520
for David Hasselhoff.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.950
Bite your tongue Dan.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:54.950
We are never-

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:55.950
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: No.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: - going to be good substitutes
for David Hassellhoff.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: David Hasselhoff is in a league
of his own.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: He's, he's amazing.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean sure, he does eat cheeseburgers,
but that's the only-

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:09.680
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: And he gets drunk and he, you
know, gets his videos posted on YouTube when

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.810
he doesnít want them to.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:11.810
By his daughter.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.800
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I guess he does have a lot
in common with us.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.330
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It's a little embarrassing,
but it doesnít diminish his star power in

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:17.330
any way.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's uh..

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Let's get back to the game.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah yeah exactly.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:27.500
Let's just get on with this double entendre
stuff out of the way and choose between plays.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.350
Let's see I've got man cover 1, man cover
2 and goal line tight man.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.390
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Right off, so right off the
bat.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:42.200
I can say that right away, for a non NFL fan
or someone who's never played Madden before,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200
this can be a little bit confusing.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's really confusing.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.040
Now it does have a few like lines and stuff.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.381
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So, from a Madden perspective
it's great because you've got all the options

00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:52.381
you want.

00:42:52.381 --> 00:42:58.500
But from a Android gaming perspective, I think
they could do a better job of explaining a

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.140
little bit about what selections do what.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And this is actually one of
the, so this game released almost a year ago

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.800
today and that is one of the main responses
we got, when we released it, we featured it

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:18.400
and people were telling us two things: first
it's too confusing and second it's built for

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.090
this device, tablet device.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.250
On the phone it's really hard.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.250
Yeah.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really difficult to use.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.560
I actually think a 7 inch tablet is pretty
much the device that I want to play this on.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I agree.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.570
I think a 7 inch would probably the best form
factor for this title.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:38.810
So let's just choose one, letís say, ok let's
play this game as if I was a 14 year old girl

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.070
in Europe who has no idea what football is
and just select one.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.870
Which is, oh let's pick that one.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: see the thing is, I had just
assumed that we were.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.900
Ok.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: My mistake.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.990
Alright.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: So-

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, you've chosen cover 2 there
instead of man cover 2, is there a particular

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.460
reason you've gone with that option?

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.550
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: It was, my short arms couldn't
reach all the way over to the other side of

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.550
the tablet, so-

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Your spindly little girl arms
couldn't make it to-

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:04.710
Exactly.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.710
Exactly.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.710
Yes.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: - man cover 2?

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:08.710
It makes sense.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:09.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I'll try harder next time.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.710
Sorry.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: please do.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:12.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ok, I'm reaching reaching man
cover 1.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:18.740
So what is nice is that all you have to do
is choose the play and it does it for you

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.640
and a lot of times Madden does require some
additional interaction.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.700
And so, playing defense, there's not much
you really have to do other than choose a

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.450
defensive play.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.850
And I everything is-

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.850
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Cause you kinda watch that?

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:33.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, you're like watching
a movie.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.320
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.550
Now I think what's really interesting is,
just technically speaking, the lighting on

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.550
this is really cool.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.820
And they're doing soft shadows, which is awesome.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.060
But what I think is really odd about this,
and I donít know if it's for technical reasons

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:56.130
or if it just, sort of slipped by but the
shadows are reversed in terms of contact.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:01.740
Like, a real shadow is darker near the feet
and by the time you get up to the head shadow

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.570
it's diffused enough that it's actually quite
a bit lighter in general.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: the grass is reflective, Ian.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh ñ

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: In the game.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: -well that explains the whole
thing.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See I'm learning so much about
football that I never even realized.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: yeah.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: we're just, we're playing
football on an extremely high albedo field.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:21.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: so wait, does NFL not get played
on actual grass?

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: so, yes and no.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.250
Yes there are some fields, like Candlestick
Park in San Francisco which get played on

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.530
natural grass.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:33.560
And there are other fields which create injuries
because they are played on astro turf or other

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.620
artificial turfs.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.110
And they, they're terrible.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what; don't get all
high and mighty with me, Reto.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:47.760
I happen to know that in 1977 Aussie rules
football started to move away from having

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.590
horse turds in the pasture and that has never,
I'm sorry, the paddock and things have never

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.590
been the same.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.590
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: What is a paddock?

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: it's a place where you keep
horses.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.590
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: ok great.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:57.590
Ok so.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.320
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ian, you're absolutely right
and it's a controversy that remains to this

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.320
day unanswered.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.320
I for one am outraged.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: exactly, you're a pro-turd.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: absolutely.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Good.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.780
Good.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.780
You and I can get along.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well of course.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.490
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I'm sure they care to know
if I would also be outraged.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So I'm gonna keep covering,
blitzing and doing my tight man.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: -tight man.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: don't really want to see a
tutorial because we've already concluded that

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.330
those are useless.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.760
Unless you know how to read.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Fumble, great Niners defense.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: ok

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Defense recovers.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.350
So this is our first chance to actually play
some offensive plays and-

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm slightly disappointed
in the--

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've been pretty offensive
so far, I don't know how much offensive we

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.190
want to get.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: quite possibly.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.900
Alright, tell me this, show me how to do this,
this is interesting part.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.860
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ok so since the Niners are
terrible at passing, I'm gonna try to find

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.460
a running back run play.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.240
We'll do, that one.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: ok, it's the [random made
up word sounds].

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.440
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Wishbone.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:01.420
Well it's either wishbone or a shotgun.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Alright, so it's really not-

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a-

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.990
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: -apparent to me how to actually
start at the play.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Did you find out, so, when
they came out, I remember they were publicizing

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:14.890
this, the game was supposed to have this like
bullet-time mode where you could like stop

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.150
the play and select the receiver and things
like so you wouldn't have to have like super

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:19.150
quick reflexes?

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.150
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: you probably didn't really
look into that because you have super quick

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.050
reflexes but I thought it might open the game
up to people like me who are old.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: just because I look like I
have super-fast reflexes, doesnít mean I

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.700
do.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700
You know, after a couple of these--

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I can only assume it takes
super-fast reflexes to make your hair look

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.750
like that.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.030
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Nah, it's actually always like
this.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.570
For those of you that are wondering, no you
can't have hair like me, I wake up like this

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:41.570
every day.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:45.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: you know, we once were in
Barcelona and we didn't speak a word of Spanish

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:51.260
and we had to find Daniel Pham in a restaurant,
and our admin just walks up to the maÓtre

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.940
d goes like this, and was like oh si.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:00.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, that's the guy, the Asian
guy with the hair and the glasses, yes.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.040
That's me.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I actually have a question about
the user interface.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.360
Now, on the bottom right there appears to
be-

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No it's not an action bar
Reto!

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: -It looks like gender symbols;
I'm not entirely sure what the one on the

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.660
left means.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, it's-

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.970
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: let's press it, and it doesn't
do anything.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.230
So, actually there we go, so it tells you-

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh it's so you can get on
the offensive hot route.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That would actually make a lot
of sense.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It really does, doesn't it?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's 2:57, I'm gonna ask you
guys to start wrapping it up.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.630
Because I have to go and phone screen someone
at 3 o'clock.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.940
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ok, so let's-

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ok.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Let's really, ok.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.800
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright we really donít have
any time at all.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.160
But we played some Madden, we talked to Dan.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.840
We turned in a show that 20 people watched.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.210
It's a good time.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:51.070
Hope to see the rest of you out on the internet
after the show, you know, cause we do have

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.860
to make sure our ratings are higher than Reto's
app clinic ratings.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.860
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Otherwise our boss is totally
gonna shut us down.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.210
Please.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Not really.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.090
Well it's been great to see you guys.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.190
We will see you next week.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:11.100
We have not decided on a theme for next week
because we are incredibly lazy.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.100
But--

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yes, we're slackers.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.491
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: -If you have some ideas for
games you would like us to review, please

00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:18.380
let us know on our Google Plus page.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:24.150
It's developer.android.com/plus very easy
to remember, that's a plus sign.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.470
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: That's right there.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.060
So, let us know what you'd like to see.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:36.040
In fact, we'll start a little post going right
after the show.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.640
Let us know what you'd like to see us review.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.830
We'll also be taking a look at Dan's quest
to PAX.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.460
Koh Kim will be back joining us next week.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.040
And we'll also be talking a little bit more
about the games that are being featured right

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.430
now and the process of that.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.710
All of that coming next week.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:58.480
Until then, we'll see ya later.
