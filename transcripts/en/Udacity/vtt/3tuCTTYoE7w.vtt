00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.550
All right. So we covered a lot of

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.080
material now on queries. Let's do a quick recap.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.970
First, we used a query by kind to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.570
get all the conferences. Then we combined the query

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.620
by kind with an ancestor filter. And finally,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.230
we applied property filters. Remember, property filters gives you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.140
a lot of flexibilities when doing queries. Now, the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.390
time has come to look under the hood of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.050
Vapor Store, and see how these queries are actually

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.290
run. The time has come to look at indexes.
