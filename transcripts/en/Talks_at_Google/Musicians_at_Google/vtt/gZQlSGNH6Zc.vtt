DAVE STRYKER: It's great
to be here at Google.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.840
Just getting a
quick sound, here.

00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:23.687
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:23.687 --> 00:06:24.520
Thank you very much.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.365
How about it for great Jared
Gold on the Hammond B3 organ.

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:32.200
The great Mark Whitfield
Jr. on the drums.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.330
My name's Dave Stryker.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.080
Thank you so much.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.440
So with the organ
trio, we always

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.840
have to start out
with the blues.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.475
So that was called "Blue
Strut," one of my tunes,

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:47.850
and we're going
to continue, now,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.945
from a record I did
called "Eight Track--"

00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:53.390
something by the
great Curtis Mayfield.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.440
And this is a lovely,
sensitive love ballad he

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.468
calls "Pusherman," "Super Fly."

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:03.965

[APPLAUSE]

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.660
How about it for Mark
Whitfield Jr. on the drums,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.940
Jared Gold on the organ?

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:21.713
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.170
That was, of course, by
one of the fantastic jazz

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.904
groups of all time, Bread.

00:22:36.904 --> 00:22:38.820
I know none of you know
who I'm talking about.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.680
It was a group from the '70s.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.630
They weren't jazz.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.630
But this record I did
called "Eight Track--"

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.040
how many of you have heard
of what an eight track is?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.145
I know this is going back.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:57.120
All right, well, I
did a couple records

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.650
called "Eight Track"
and "Eight Track II,"

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.250
and did tunes that I grew
up with from the '70s,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.460
but put our jazz slant on it.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.439
So that came from that.

00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:09.480
And there was a lot of
great tunes from that era,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.379
so it's fun.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:13.920
And a lot of people
know those tunes,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.934
so it's a cool way to
connect with people.

00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.850
RICHARD BIELAK: I like
to hear origin stories.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.490
How did you get
started playing jazz?

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.930
DAVE STRYKER: Well,
when I was coming up,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.710
it was about The Beatles.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.090
I had an older sister
who was into The Beatles,

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.380
and so it's just really cool
to watch them on "Ed Sullivan

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.510
Show" and stuff.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.130
And I said, I want
to be like that.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.260
I want to be cool.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.030
So it's all about being cool
when you're a kid, right?

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.210
And started taking guitar
lessons when I was about 10,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.230
and playing in bands
and stuff, and playing

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.540
all the tunes that were on
the radio, and rock stuff.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.410
And went to a jam session.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.560
Got better, went to a jam
session at The Union one time.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.390
And they were playing some
jazz, and so I got up there

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.380
and sat in.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.370
And I had long hair,
Fender Telecaster,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.030
and I just got up there and
started ripping my rock licks.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.310
And one of the guys came
up and said, hey, man.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.060
This is jazz.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.320
You can't be playing that rock.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.289
So I was like, uh-oh.

00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:20.330
You mean I'm not amazing?

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.400
So the next day, I
went to Homer's Records

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.499
in Omaha, Nebraska--
where I'm from.

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:28.790
Said, where's the jazz records?

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.789
And he said, back there.

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:33.540
So I went back and ended up
walking out, believe it or not,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.090
with a John Coltrane record
called "My Favorite Things,"

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.770
and a George Benson
record called

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.000
"Beyond the Blue Horizon."

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.450
And I don't know
how that worked,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.020
but those are still two
of my favorite records.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.059
And just started
listening to it,

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:50.100
just like I had been
listening to the rock stuff.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.640
And I was like, wow, I've no
idea what's going on here.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.850
So it was intriguing.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.520
And me and my friends just
started learning tunes.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.530
And back then, we were
working six nights a week

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.800
at The Hilton, playing--

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.040
the first two sets would
be playing jazz tunes--

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.350
"Satin Doll" and
"Girl From Ipanema"--

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.180
while people danced or ate.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.890
And then the last two sets
would be top 40 of the day.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.500
So just got into it that way,
then just kept practicing

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.090
and moved out to LA
for a couple years.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.900
And we started sitting in
with some people out there.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.930
And then moved to New York about
1980, and went up to Harlem

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.290
and sat in with a guy
named Brother Jack McDuff.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.550
And he gave me a gig, and he was
one of the greats of the organ.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.020
And he had previously had Grant
Green in his group, George

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.025
Benson, and Pat Martino.

00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:51.150
RICHARD BIELAK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.080
DAVE STRYKER: Yeah, so
when I joined the band,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.276
he finally got a good
guitar player, so it was--

00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:59.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.590
Yeah, so that was--

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.454
then after that, I met the
great Stanley Turrentine,

00:26:07.454 --> 00:26:08.870
and he asked me
to join him, and I

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.036
was with Stanley Turrentine,
the great tenor player,

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:14.070
for over 10 years.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.190
And all at the same time,
I'm in New York playing

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:17.231
with all the people here.

00:26:17.231 --> 00:26:21.810
And just keep practicing.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.690
That's the great thing
we love about jazz,

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.002
is the improvisation
aspect of it.

00:26:26.002 --> 00:26:28.460
Whereas we're playing melodies
at the beginning and the end

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.830
of the song, but
in the middle, it's

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.920
wide open and we're playing
over the structure of the song--

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.970
the harmonic structure.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.570
But anything can happen.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.091
It's really exciting.

00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:41.840
RICHARD BIELAK: It's
different every time.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.090
DAVE STRYKER: Yes.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.549
RICHARD BIELAK: So you write
lots of your own tunes.

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:47.340
How do you do that?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.798
Do you just wake up one morning
and decide to write a tune,

00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:51.236
or you have a process?

00:26:51.236 --> 00:26:54.710
Or just you play something
sometimes, and it sounds good?

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.190
DAVE STRYKER: Yeah,
a lot of times tunes

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.970
would come out of an interesting
harmonic structure or core

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.790
changes that I thought would
be cool to play on-- that I

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.320
thought I could play over well.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.106
So I would write a
tune around that.

00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:09.980
A lot of times, you'll
come up with a melody,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.592
and then you just
want to flesh it out.

00:27:13.592 --> 00:27:15.300
So there's a whole
lot of different ways.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.010
A lot of times--

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.135
I work well under pressure.

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.801
So if I have a record
date or something,

00:27:18.801 --> 00:27:19.790
I'll realize, oh, man.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.140
I got to write some music.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:29.780
So having that coming
record date or gig, whatever

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.540
I have coming up that I
need to learn music for,

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.860
that will inspire me
to write music, too.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.300
But I have written
a lot of music,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.710
and I find that that part
of my musical personality,

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.515
as well as my playing,
all goes together.

00:27:47.427 --> 00:27:49.760
RICHARD BIELAK: So you did
this record a couple of years

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.430
ago with a bunch of horns.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.960
That was "Routes."

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.274
And did you do all the
horn parts as well?

00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:56.690
DAVE STRYKER: On
that record, that

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.720
was actually by my
partner, Steve Slagle,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.401
that we had we have a group.

00:28:01.401 --> 00:28:02.900
And we did a record
called "Routes."

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.730
And he did most of
the arranging on that.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.730
And I wrote some of the tunes.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:09.050
But he did the horn arranging.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.050
But I've also done horn
projects with four horns called

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.990
"Blue to the Bone," where I
did a lot of the arranging,

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.300
or I worked with
the other people,

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:23.430
like Bob Parsons as arranger to
write you know the horn parts.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.770
So it keeps it interesting
to do a whole lot

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.260
of different things.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.040
I guess I've been putting
about one record out a year

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.090
since about 1988
was my first record.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.300
And I was with a European
label for many years called

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.200
SteepleChase.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.230
And I could count on at
least one record a year.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.550
So it's always cool to
have a goal or something

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.870
to look forward to to inspire
you to try to write some music

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.535
or think of a new project.

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:55.410
So I've done all kinds
of records, everything

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.914
from just a trio, to big band.

00:29:00.914 --> 00:29:03.330
RICHARD BIELAK: So one other
thing I wanted to talk to you

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.450
about is teaching.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.980
So you teach a lot of, I
guess, college students.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.460
How do you find
this new generation?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.760
DAVE STRYKER: They're terrible.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.260
No.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.770
RICHARD BIELAK: I thought so.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.269
[LAUGHS]

00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:15.980
DAVE STRYKER: Just kidding.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.840
I enjoy it a lot.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.790
I teach.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.640
When I came up--

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.550
don't tell anybody.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.150
But I actually came
from the school

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.590
of just playing on the road.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.420
You know?

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.940
And I didn't go to college.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.030
Not that-- I just was gigging.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.437
Like I said, I was working.

00:29:40.437 --> 00:29:41.520
I was just always working.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.201
And my folks were
supportive of that.

00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:44.700
You know?

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.590
They saw that I was
doing something I loved.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.520
And so I learned
the music like I

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.260
think most people have learned
it that are the greats,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.500
and that is from listening
to the who came before.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.740
It's an oral tradition.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.780
This is jazz.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:06.240
Everybody from Louis
Armstrong, maybe one

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.680
of the first jazz guys.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.710
He used to listen
to King Oliver.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:15.300
Dizzy Gillespie and
Miles listened to Louis.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.120
But everybody kind of puts
their own thing on it.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.060
Charlie Christian was one of
the first jazz guitar players.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.330
And he influenced Wes
Montgomery and George Benson,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.100
who influenced guys
of my generation,

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.100
like Pat Metheny
and John Scofield.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.240
And so it's just a continuing
evolution of the music.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.620
But that's how I learned how
to play is listening to records

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.839
and taking ideas off the record.

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:44.880
We call it transcribing,
which you would actually

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.570
note for note take off like Wes
Montgomery or George Benson,

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.250
Pat Martino, Miles, Coltrane
solo off the record,

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.200
figure out how they're playing
over these chord changes.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.980
And hopefully, some of that
rubs off on your own playing.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:07.770
And so when I teach, I try to
use those ideas that I used

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:12.130
and try to help them
figure out their own voice.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:12.630
You know?

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.360
So it's very gratifying to do.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.600
And I didn't expect
to be doing it.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.300
And it's just part of what I do.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.580
I mean, I'm very busy
playing, and touring around,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.390
and recording, and producing.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.220
And I have a record label now,
and doing all kinds of stuff.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.700
But I enjoy it.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.210
Going out to Indiana is nice.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.610
I go out every other
week and teach out there.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.070
RICHARD BIELAK: So you started
this new thing, speaking

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.199
of technology, with ArtistShare,
where you have online lessons.

00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:45.490
DAVE STRYKER: Yeah, that just--

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:46.680
RICHARD BIELAK: So how
is that experience?

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.350
DAVE STRYKER: That's great.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.516
I mean, I just started this.

00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:52.020
And this whole internet
thing, I really

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.330
think it's going to catch on.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.520
I feel like I'm really
on the ground floor here.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.736
No.

00:31:58.736 --> 00:32:00.080
RICHARD BIELAK: The 11th floor.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.121
DAVE STRYKER: 11th floor?

00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:02.980
OK.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:09.210
Yeah, so I just launched my own
jazz guitar teaching website

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.710
at ArtistWorks.com.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.260
And it's an amazing
company out in Napa Valley.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.030
And they have what's called
video exchange technology.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.830
And David Butler is
the guy who started it.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.760
And he was originally
one of the guys at AOL.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.820
And he's a really great
guy and a really smart guy.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.950
And he started this website.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.130
And they do everything from
Bluegrass and rock and roll

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.470
to classical and jazz.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.230
So I'm kind of the
jazz guitar guy there.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:42.690
And how it works is it's
a subscription site.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:48.330
But I've put up about maybe
120 lessons, everything

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.450
from basic, intermediate,
up to advanced.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:55.890
And the lessons are,
say, 10 minutes long.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.540
And I cover a subject.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.930
And then the student
can send in a video

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:05.580
of them playing of what I was
just working on with them.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.000
And then about once a week,
I answer the video exchanges

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.740
by sending them a video.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.080
So it's not in real
time, but you're still

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.890
getting one-on-one with me.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.350
And it's kind of cool.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.630
You signed up, you told me.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.270
RICHARD BIELAK: Yes, yes, I did.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:20.390
It's very cool.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.140
DAVE STRYKER: I expect
to get you on there

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.960
very soon with a video for me.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.520
In case you don't
know, Richie is

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.500
a fine jazz guitarist himself.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.600
That's how we know each other.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.500
He's studied with me.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.583
RICHARD BIELAK: Thank you.

00:33:31.583 --> 00:33:34.940
DAVE STRYKER: And yeah,
so it's really cool.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.510
And you don't have to
send in video exchange.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.150
If you subscribe, you can
watch other people's things.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.340
So it's kind of a cool thing.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.930
And it's brand new for me.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.909
So check it out at
ArtistWorks.com.

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:50.450
RICHARD BIELAK: So does anybody
have any questions, or should

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.919
I--

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:52.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.750
First, thanks for coming.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.080
DAVE STRYKER: Sure.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.310
AUDIENCE: It's fantastic.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.280
I was wondering if you could
speak a little bit to the state

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.510
of jazz in general.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.640
Obviously, you mentioned
spending a lot of time

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.130
out on the road, dabbling
in new technology.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.070
But when you look at the
mainstream situation, I mean,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.960
even rock and roll is
struggling right now.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.902
And jazz has been out of
the spotlight for a while.

00:34:11.902 --> 00:34:13.610
I'm just wondering if
you, as an insider,

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.699
could speak to what you found
out in the world and the scene.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.139
What's the world of jazz like?

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.230
Is it healthy right now?

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.813
Is there a lot of
good stuff out there

00:34:20.813 --> 00:34:23.719
that you've found versus
kind of getting buried

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.659
by the avalanche of pop music?

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.159
DAVE STRYKER: Great question.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.739
Jazz is very healthy
and alive, especially

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.719
where we are right here.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.670
There's so many exciting
things happening

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.239
and people trying new things.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.880
There's other fads of
music that come and go

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.750
and groups come and go.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.130
People have a hit.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.719
You don't hear
about them anymore.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.850
Jazz is always going to be here.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.520
To me, it's real music.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.639
It's America's art form.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.600
It's something we've brought.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.910
It comes from the blues.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.280
And it's not going anywhere.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.440
You know?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.050
You're not going to make
millions of dollars at it.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.350
But nobody does it for that.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.960
They do it because
they love to play.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.810
They love this
interaction you do.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.990
There's nothing like this.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.214
Those solos we just
played just now,

00:35:18.214 --> 00:35:20.130
they might not have been
our best we ever did.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.685
But they were the only one
that happened at this moment.

00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:25.310
And it was because
of the communication

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.420
between the three of us.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.180
And just that interaction
is a beautiful thing.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.490
And that's one of the
things that jazz has--

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:38.119
the blues and the influence,
and then the harmonic things

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:40.160
that have been brought to
us from all the greats,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.760
from Louis Armstrong up to
Charlie Parker, and now,

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.130
Herbie Hancock, all
these great players.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.410
There's so many young
players out on the scene

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.950
right now doing exciting things.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:57.440
So the audience for
jazz is growing too

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.000
with different
influences coming in,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.970
with people like Robert
Glasper and different people

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:06.230
incorporating hip-hop
and different rhythms,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.310
bringing in different audiences.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.060
So in that way,
it's also growing.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:15.290
But as far as just straight
ahead jazz, I mean,

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:16.990
it'll never go
anywhere because it's--

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.040
the people that love it just
want to hear some swing,

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.220
head down to the
Village Vanguard,

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.740
or any of these clubs in town,
the Jazz Standard, Birdland.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.990
There's a whole bunch of club.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.040
Smalls has a lot of
great stuff happening.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.250
So yeah, especially
in New York, there's

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.590
some amazing things happening.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.082
Thanks for that question though.

00:36:44.082 --> 00:36:45.290
RICHARD BIELAK: Anybody else?

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was kind of trying

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.246
to watch your right hand.

00:36:51.246 --> 00:36:53.120
I was trying to figure
out what it was doing.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.960
It looks like you have
sort of a hybrid technique.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.610
You've got pick.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.568
You've got fingernails.

00:36:56.568 --> 00:36:58.607
You've got-- what's
going on there?

00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:00.690
DAVE STRYKER: I really
can't answer that question.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.450
I'm sorry, man.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.794
It's just a secret, top secret.

00:37:03.794 --> 00:37:04.460
People ask that.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.450
Like right now, my
pick is right there.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:14.270
And so when I play, if I want
to play like a single note line,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.649
my pick--

00:37:15.649 --> 00:37:19.072
[DEMONSTRATES PASSAGE]

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.917
That's with the pick.

00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:31.000
Now, if I want to switch--

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.522
[DEMONSTRATES PASSAGE]

00:37:32.522 --> 00:37:33.980
--then the pick
just goes in there.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.340
I just hold it there.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.124
And I can use my fingers
individually to comp.

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:42.540
We call it comping when you're
playing chords or whatever.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.907
[DEMONSTRATES PASSAGE]

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:56.080
So then I switch to
the pick right there.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.840
So you've got to be able to--

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.290
to me, I just did it naturally.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.950
I don't know.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.750
Some people though--
I think you could also

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.750
do like Eddie Van Halen,
and get a mic stand,

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.230
and put 500 pics on there.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.220
You know?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.060
That works too.

00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:16.340
Or you can set it on your leg,
and then it falls on the floor.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.089
And you can stop and
pick it up, you know.

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:21.190
There's a lot of
different techniques.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.230
Some people put
it in their mouth.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:27.191
This I don't recommend because
it interrupts the gig when

00:38:27.191 --> 00:38:28.690
you have to go to
the emergency room

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.950
because you just
swallowed your pick.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:32.890
But yeah, that's all.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:33.640
That's the answer.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.050
I just keep it right there.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.830
And then I still can
use this finger to--

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.751
[PLUCKS STRING] play with so
I have my five fingers here.

00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:43.792
RICHARD BIELAK: OK, so
how about some more music?

00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:44.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:44.776 --> 00:38:46.692
DAVE STRYKER: Yeah, you
want to hear one more?

00:38:46.692 --> 00:38:47.320
All right.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.340
So let's bring up Jared Gold
on the Hammond B-3 organ

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.110
and a Mark Whitfield, Jr.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.510
We could do a whole talk on
this instrument right here.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.000
With the advent of
digital technology

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.090
and digital keyboards, you're
never going to see one of those

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.890
too often.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:13.370
This has got tone
wheels in it and tubes.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.916
It's called a Hammond B-3 organ.

00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:16.040
And that's called a Leslie.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.540
It's a rotating speaker.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.270
But it's a classic sound.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.270
And like we talked about, Jack
McDuff that I got to play with,

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.610
he was one of the greats of it.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.350
Jimmy Smith is another one.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.100
So a lot of times, you'll just
see a little digital keyboard

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.630
that simulates
the sound of that.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.180
But this thing, you
actually feel it.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.580
Right?

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.030
Yeah, it's cool.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.871
All right, so we'll do something
off my new record, Strykin'

00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:41.370
Ahead.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.034
This is a tune I wrote
called "Shadowboxing."

00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:45.950
Thanks for coming out
and hanging out with us.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.880
[MUSIC - DAVE STRYKER,
 "SHADOWBOXING"]

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.890
[ORGAN SOLO]

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.754
[DRUM SOLO]

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:24.788 --> 00:48:28.260
[GUITAR SOLO]

00:50:13.795 --> 00:50:17.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.070
DAVE STRYKER: Thanks a lot.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.370
All right, Mark Whitfield,
Jr. on the drums.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.392
Jared Gold on the
Hammond B-3 organ.

00:50:31.392 --> 00:50:32.350
Dave Stryker on guitar.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:33.516
Thank you very much, Google.

00:50:33.516 --> 00:50:34.540
It was great being here.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.890
[APPLAUSE]
