00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:12.530 align:start position:0%
doing like yeah how I work out for the
 

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.930 align:start position:0%
doing like yeah how I work out for the
meth<00:10:12.710><c> end</c><00:10:12.950><c> yeah</c><00:10:13.340><c> that's</c><00:10:13.490><c> why</c><00:10:13.580><c> it's</c><00:10:13.700><c> called</c><00:10:13.820><c> the</c>

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:13.940 align:start position:0%
meth end yeah that's why it's called the
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.830 align:start position:0%

the<00:11:35.850><c> layout</c><00:11:36.149><c> especially</c><00:11:36.660><c> stop</c><00:11:37.410><c> that</c><00:11:37.620><c> this</c>

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.130 align:start position:0%
the layout especially stop that this
 

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.650 align:start position:0%
the layout especially stop that this
isn't<00:11:38.459><c> my</c><00:11:38.670><c> cell</c><00:11:38.970><c> phone's</c><00:11:39.180><c> over</c><00:11:39.330><c> there</c><00:11:39.540><c> I</c><00:11:39.570><c> know</c>

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:42.029 align:start position:0%
I am oh but at the layout especially I
 

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:43.579 align:start position:0%
I am oh but at the layout especially I
think<00:11:42.240><c> has</c><00:11:42.360><c> sums</c><00:11:42.600><c> up</c><00:11:42.750><c> the</c><00:11:42.899><c> episode</c><00:11:43.290><c> where</c><00:11:43.470><c> it's</c>

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:43.589 align:start position:0%
think has sums up the episode where it's
 

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
think has sums up the episode where it's
both<00:11:43.740><c> very</c><00:11:43.770><c> simple</c><00:11:44.610><c> but</c><00:11:44.880><c> you</c><00:11:45.180><c> know</c><00:11:45.360><c> has</c><00:11:45.690><c> very</c>

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:45.930 align:start position:0%
both very simple but you know has very
 

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.660 align:start position:0%
both very simple but you know has very

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
color and the shading and the layout but
 

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.190 align:start position:0%
color and the shading and the layout but
it's<00:11:50.130><c> still</c><00:11:50.279><c> based</c><00:11:50.550><c> a</c><00:11:50.760><c> very</c><00:11:51.029><c> simple</c><00:11:51.480><c> idea</c><00:11:51.870><c> and</c>

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's still based a very simple idea and
 

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.889 align:start position:0%
it's still based a very simple idea and
I<00:11:53.100><c> love</c><00:11:53.640><c> that</c><00:11:53.790><c> I</c><00:11:53.850><c> think</c><00:11:54.060><c> those</c><00:11:54.180><c> just</c><00:11:54.480><c> such</c><00:11:54.720><c> a</c>

I love that I think those just such a

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:03.149 align:start position:0%
