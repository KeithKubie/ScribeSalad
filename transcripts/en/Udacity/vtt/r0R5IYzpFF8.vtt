00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now for the quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One of these 5 facts allows to infer most, if not all of the others,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and, therefore, it is the most crucial of these 5.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Which one is it?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Is it the problem history?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Diagnostic information?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The experienced behavior?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The expected behavior?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Or a one-line summary?
