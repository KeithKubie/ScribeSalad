Speaker 1:          00:02          So we've talked about the main events in Nmr spectroscopy for determining structure that is about, um, about the chemical shift and about spin spin splitting that that, uh, allows you to tell how many nearby nuclei there are a, today we're going to talk about, uh, some complications that make the spectrum more complicated, uh, and perhaps more informative, uh, in terms of high order effects, higher order effects in spins, been splitting and then about using Nmr to study, not structure but to study rates. And we'll do some [inaudible] labeling stuff there. So spin, spin splitting with other nuclei besides, uh, besides protons next door. And we actually saw some of this last time with deuterium splitting with, uh, [inaudible] splitting. For example, if there's a signal like this and you blow it way up by 30 times, then you can see that what gives these things that are so far apart, 126 hertz.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Do you remember this last one? What are the size of splittings you normally see for protons that are on adjacent carbons there? The order of seven hertz right here, we got 126. What's the big thing that's going on? What makes a coupling so big? Okay, it's c 13 h in fact, uh, so 99% of the sample, if you haven't specifically put, see thirteens in there are see 12 but about 1% or see 13 so you'll see that. Now here's a paper from from 1959 which first noted something interesting about these see 13 h coupling constants that they relate to the amount of s character in the carbon atomic orbital that's involved in the bonds. Remember we said that the, that the information has to be communicated through the electrons because the action of of a magnets through space, if you average overall angles of rotation in a liquid goes to zero, right?

Speaker 1:          02:08          So you communicate through the bonds. The nice thing about that is so strong for JC 13 age is the thisi 13 has just one bond to get to the age. So it's a very short path to communicate. Okay? Now, but you remember also that to do that so that it doesn't average out as you tumble the s you have to have the electrons in an s orbital. So the hydrogen uses it's s orbital, that's all it's got essentially. But carbon can use SRP. So the hybridisation, as they say here, relates to the coupling constant, uh, because they, the, to communicate that electron must be on the [inaudible] nucleus. So this is a table from that paper. It gives the coupling constant in units of per second, those were then changed to be called Hertz nowadays. Okay. So here are a bunch of different, and they're JC 13 h coupling constants.

Speaker 1:          03:02          If we make a histogram of them, you see that there's a group between 100 2,141 between 150 and 170 and another group down around two 50. So there, there are different groups evolved here. There are three different populations. We could draw the lines between them. And then if we look to see what the carbons are that bear these hydrogens that show that splitting, uh, we could look first at the very big ones down there. And what's special about those carbons that are splitting the hydrogens right there? Triple bonded. So sp hybridization, 50% s in the bond to hydrogen, right? The ones here, the green ones, right, are in aromatic systems, right? So they have sp squared hybridization except for cyclo propane. Why would it have such a, such a high coupling? Constant? Why would it have a lot of s character in the bond to hydrogen?

Speaker 1:          03:59          The carbon that's in a cycle of propane, right? Because it's bonds normally or tetrahedral SPQ cubed. But when you try to make a smaller angle, right? It's more p character in the, in the, uh, in the bonds to the other carbons, therefore more s character coming out to the hydrogens. So we can actually see that hybridization change in the Nmr. And then these other are normal, a methyl groups, SB cubed, hybridized carbons. So here in, uh, in Nmr we have direct evidence for this hybridization stuff we talked about last semester. Okay, so it's SPSP squared s cubed. Now here's a subtle point, uh, perhaps we shouldn't be spending time on it, but it's so interesting. And I suspect the curious among you may have wondered about this because we talked about a coupling goes through the bonds, right? So from h to see, to see to age, how about h to c to h?

Speaker 1:          05:00          That's a shorter path, right? So methane, if you're looking at one hydrogen, how many other hydrogens, which you think it would be coupled to three, right? And they could be in one, three, three, one. So you should see a quartet for a proton of ch four. But you don't, you just see a single sharp peak. So where did the splitting go? And this is related to what we talked about last time, where a book said that, that there is the splitting constant, a zero. And I said, that's not true. The splitting constant is high, might be 10, but it's not observable. So why is it, why doesn't, why don't you see quartets for ch four? Okay, so here's a one of these spectrum. Actually, if you, if you go up here, uh, and you can click on that and get taken to the website of a, of chem two 20 where they have problems.

Speaker 1:          05:54          I'll work one problem later in the class if we have time. But there are others you can practice on there. So this is a compound and I'll tell you it's answer. It's cinnamic acid. It's related to the Aldehyde related to this acid cinema. Aldehyde is the smell of cinnamon day. So what do we expect when we look at the Proton spot? This is the proton spectrum of it. What do we expect? Well, notice that, that we can draw a resonance structures, which will put positive charge on the carbon with that hydrogen. So remove electron density from that hydrogen or from that one or that one or that one. So those all should be shifted down field relative to where they would otherwise be relative to the ones that aren't blue. Right? So, uh, when we, when we look at the compound, then we see these really complicated peaks in here.

Speaker 1:          06:46          We throw up our hands trying to understand that. And then we see here two doublets really nice, Sharp, clean things. So what do you think the two doublets are out here? Let's ignore that bit for the time being and talk about these two doublets. What do you, what's protons do you think those come from? Which one is this? Okay. And let me start going around the compound. The O H is way down further. We're not showing that. Okay, so I'll go down. I come to his, this one. What do you think that is right now? That's the one up here. This is where a double bonds normally come, right? Then you come here and that one is a carbon on a hydrogen audit. Double bonded carbon. But it's down here because it's, it's lost electron density, right? Where we drew resonance structure where the blue ones were more positive.

Speaker 1:          07:40          And then here we have hydrogens that are on the benzene ring shifted down this way because of the ring shift, the aromatic ring current that we talked about last time, right? And now there's a group of three and a group of two. These are, these are positive and are shifted down. That's the group of to the group of three here is these two plus this one which would shift to be shifted down because it's positive but up because it's far from this sp squared carbon. Let's not worry about why that is, but at any rate, that's the benzene ones, but that's not what we're going to talk about here. What we're going to talk about is the clean signals here and here. Okay? Now this is measured with a magnetic field of 7.05 Tesla. That means it's a 300 megahertz spectrometer, so instead of using parts per million down here, we could change to hertz if we wanted to change to a frequency scale and in terms of frequency, if we call zero the middle, then that's a lower frequency at the top, higher frequency to the bottom.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Okay? Now it turns out that the ratio of the chemical shift difference, Delta measured in Hertz, not in parts per million. We want to be comparing apples with apples here hurts with hertz, so the chemical shift from here to here is much bigger than the coupling constant Jay, right? It's 24.4 times as large and that's the pattern we see. Now suppose we used a smaller magnetic field, right? What's going to happen? The chemical shift in parts per million will stay the same, right? But it'll be the same fraction of a smaller frequency. If we use a smaller field, the precession frequency gets smaller. So if we measure in Hertz as we're doing here, they'll come closer together. But Jay will stay the same because it doesn't depend on the field, right? The Mag, the magnets are not dependent on the field right there. Coupling. Okay, so what will happen?

Speaker 1:          09:43          These two doublets will move together, right? So 2.89 it turns out the ratio is 10 or 0.86 a Tesla. It would be three notice incidentally that this would be a much cheaper spectrometer because it would, it would have only attempt as big. The magnetic field is the other one, right? But also those other peaks are going to be in the middle. Everything's going to be getting on top of one another and I'm just showing you what would happen to this double doublet. Okay. There is a 0.29 and finally, if we're a hundred times smaller at 0.2 for the ratio of chemical shift to Jay measured in the same units and hurts, you get the purple pattern. Now notice that the j is always the same, the splitting between the two peaks, but what do you notice between the doublet? What's curious about this?

Speaker 1:          10:39          I mean, I'm sure you all see some of the peaks are disappearing and others are getting stronger as they come together, right? The outer peaks are getting very weak and in the limit where the chemical shift was zero, right? The difference as in methane, then the outer peaks disappear altogether and you just see one peak. Okay? Now notice that that part in the original spectrum was a mess because all those hydrogens of the of the benzene ring have similar chemical shifts and they're all coupled with one another. So it's more of this same thing at all on top of one another and very complicated. So we'll forget that. Let's think about what causes this change. This is so called higher order effect, not the simple thing that you have a chemical shift, count the neighbors and get one to two to one, one, three, three, one, one, four, six, four, one kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          11:37          Okay? So here we are plotting the energy in a big applied field of different nuclear spin states. And we're talking about just two nuclei, okay? So they could both be with the field that would be low in energy or one with and the other against or against them, the other width. And then they could both be against the applied field. So you'd have these different energies, right? And that's the 100 megahertz. This, that's the energy that it would take to get from here to here, right? By, uh, flipping the red spin would be a hundred megahertz, right? But now, so, but all of these look the same, right? Whether you do a red line and flip the Red Arrow or do a blue line and flipped the Blue Arrow there. All the hundred megahertz or whatever frequency or 300 megahertz in that spectrum we were looking at before. Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:29          So we're going to see just a single peak at at first glance, but if we hold men and magnify things so we can see small differences. So in large this center portion by a factor of 10 to the fifth so we can see the difference. It's just a part per million in the difference between the environment of the blue and the environment of the Red Proton. Then as we expand that, we see that they're not quite the same. It's harder to flip the blue proton than it is to flip the Red Proton. The Blue Proton is in a higher field because of the chemical shift difference and if we call that difference Delta over to now you'll notice that that made the red line's shorter by Delta over to and the blue lines longer by Delta over to doing that. Okay, so now we're going to see a chemical shift of Delta one is smaller by Delta over to the other, larger by Delta over to the differences Delta that Kevin uncle shift.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Okay. So that's the chemical shift. And now suppose the spins interact not only with the big blue field, but also with each other. And just suppose that there are coupling through these electrons is such that they prefer to be anti parallel. You could have the opposite sign of the coupling constantly. They could prefer to be parallel, but let's suppose they prefer to be anti parallel. So the ones where they're anti parallel will go down in Nrg, the ones where their power parallel, we'll go up in energy. Okay, so let's do that. Okay. And now what happened to the, to the red and blue peaks? Notice that this red peak got this red transition, went to lower energy, but this one went to higher energy, right? And this blue one went to lower energy, but this blue one went to higher energy. Everybody see that? So what's going to happen?

Speaker 1:          14:22          The red peak is going to split. There's going to be a lower and a higher red peak. There's going to be a lower in a higher blue peak. So it's going to look like that, right? And those that's going to be Jay, if these shifts are Jay over for this transition got longer by Jay over to this one, got shorter by Jay over to, so the difference between them as Jay now. So that's where these, in terms of the energy of the things interacting with one another, that's where we get chemical shift difference and spins. Been coupling Jay. Okay? So that looks just fine. And that's what's called the first order spectrum. That's what we've been talking about. But there are higher order effects and I think you'll find this cute. Okay. Because Jay does something else besides just shifting these levels, right? It also mixes this state with this state, okay?

Speaker 1:          15:19          And it mixes them into a sum and a difference. And of course we've seen things just like this before. That's what it looks like in the case of magnetism. The sum has the two pointing in opposite directions along Z, but not along x. And the, and the, uh, the difference has them pointing opposite directions all together. Okay? Now when you do that, when you mix this with this, you get the difference, which turns out to be a little lower in energy and the sun, which is a little higher in energy. And of course that's just like mixing a p orbital on carbon with a p orbital on oxygen and a CEO double bond. You mixed the two, their energies don't match. So you get this one has more of that in it. This one has more of that and it, oops, I wrote this wrong and that should be red and blue. Okay, I'll change that. Everybody with me. So I didn't tell you exactly why these, why it couples to this, but it does. Okay, so this shifts those energies, right?

Speaker 1:          16:24          So that, notice that that makes the reds a little bit smaller. Both of the reds smaller, right? And both of the blues larger, right? So it shifted the reds to the right and the blues to the left, right? So the peaks aren't so Delta isn't exactly what you thought it was going to be. Right. That is the shift. The difference between the average of those two isn't exactly the chemical shift because of this higher order effect. But there's something much more interesting that happens, right? That one is non magnetic. Obviously they cancel one another, but how about the other one? It's not magnetic along Z, right? But it's just as magnetic along x as either of those other states. The top one of the bottom one is right, so it has this resultant, so it says magnetic perpendicular to the main field as either the one that was where they're both against the field of the one where they're both with the field. So this one is magnetic and that one's not magnetic. That is, this one can interact with the magnetic field of light. But this one can't interact with the magnetic field of light. So if we look over here, we see that this one is weakened. It's not interacting with light. This one is interacting even more strongly with light.

Speaker 2:          17:51          Hey,

Speaker 1:          17:52          now what that means is, so this one is really strong in this one is weak. Now in terms of interaction with light, okay? So this influences the intensity of the transitions. Okay? Now what it does is it makes the ones that involve this level, that's this red one in this blue one gets stronger and these get weaker like that.

Speaker 2:          18:16          Hey,

Speaker 1:          18:17          so what's going to happen over here? This one, which is the shortest of all, and this one, which is the longest of all, this one in this one get weak, or pardon me? Pardon me? Uh, no. This is the longest of all. This is the shortest of all this red one. So those get weak, but the inner ones get strong. So it changes to look like that. And the more you mix them, the bigger they're separated by Delta or Delta over to their mixed by Jay. So the more the bigger Jay is compared to Delta, the more they'll mix, the more they'll be exactly like this, which is when they're completely mixed in, the stronger these will become in the week or these will become so is the delta gets smaller and smaller in terms of Hertz. As you change the magnetic field, the outer peaks shrink.

Speaker 1:          19:09          And the inner peaks grow, right? So that's why methane has a single peak and you can't see it splitting, even though the coupling is still there, you just can't see it. So the radio frequency light loses its handle on the flanking peaks as Delta becomes small compared to Jay as shown here, right? So by increasing Delta measured in Hertz, that is by using an expensive big field, you make things more like first order spectra that are easy to interpret. One to two, one to two to one, one, three, three, one, one, four, six, four, one and so on.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Okay? So that's, that's the subtle aspect. Now we're going to talk about how you use Nmr to study dynamics to study rates and what we mean by the Nmr time scale and how decoupling works. Okay? So we looked at this spectrum last time. This is a spectrum of ethanol measure. Does it says over here by your own ta? Uh, they'll Lichter. Okay. Now, if we look at these three peaks with that we see there, the Oah, the ch two and the ch three and we analyze these last time and saw that this is a triplet. This is a triplet both being split by this ch two, but this one is a quartet of doublets. Okay, now that was measured in dms. Oh, solvent, right? For a special reason. Remember that peak came from dms, so that had a little hydrogen in it as well as deuterium.

Speaker 1:          20:45          Okay? If we measured in chloroform was a little bit of acid in there or a Phil did, he measured this one as well. Notice the peaks shift a little bit, right? Especially the Oah peak shifts a lot, right? The other shift a little bit, this one, not too much. Okay. But what's much more interested in than these shifts is what the peaks actually looked like in terms of their splitting. Now bear in mind, this ohp cause here, it's now over here, but I'm drawing it here. So instead of a triplet, it's now a singlet, right? And this one, instead of being a quartet of doublets is just a quartet. No changes over here,

Speaker 3:          21:28          right?

Speaker 1:          21:29          So what's, we've lost the splitting between the age and the ch two. It's no longer split. It's not split by the ch two and the ch two is not split by the age. So what's going on when we did this? In fact, let's all, let's what happens if we don't have the acid in there? If we don't have the acid in there, this peak moves way over here. This one stays the same place. We're still in chloroform solvent, and this one stays the same place, but the Oah really changes. Okay, but look, but what's again, much more interesting is what the patterns look like. They look like that now,

Speaker 3:          22:13          right?

Speaker 1:          22:14          So this, instead of being either a triplet or a single, it is a really broad low peak, right? This one is, it still looks a little bit like a quartet of Douglas, but it's much broadened, right? This one is the same as it was before,

Speaker 3:          22:31          right?

Speaker 1:          22:32          So something really funny is happening here. Now let's look at the integral ills, right? Okay. So within experimental error, the it's one to two to three, right? It's 0.96 to two to 3.04 in uh, in dms. So, okay, in a CDCL three it's 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.05 again with an experimental error. One, two, three. But the one that had a little bit of acid in it is much more interesting, right? It's two to three. That's fine. But this is bigger. 1.1400000000000001. So that peak, this peak here, the sharp peak here in the one that has acid in it, right, is bigger. They're more protons there than just one. How did that happen? It's an average of both the Oah that's on the alcohol and the h plus right now. Let's see, how did that happen? Well, h plus can go onto the alcohol and then the age that was on the alcohol can come back into the solution.

Speaker 1:          23:48          So we've exchanged those two H's and if that happens rapidly there h is moving all over. Most of the time they're on alcohol, but sometime 14% there on h there is h plus. And what you're seeing is the average of those in this case. So this is averaging the H's are zipping around from Mali, not only from, uh, not only between acid and alcohol, but from one alcohol, two another alcohol, right? By way of the acid. And what that means is, remember the reason we see splitting is that there are these spin isomers. There are different molecules in there. Some molecules have the neighboring ch two both up, some have them both down, some have one up and one down. But if you're zipping from molecule to molecule very rapidly, you see the average, which is nothing, right? So when we have acid in there and it's averaging very fast by going on and off and then going to different molecules, right?

Speaker 1:          24:52          Then we see sharp peak here, the splitting disappears here. What's going on? Okay, well how about the Roi h chemical shift, that thing? Okay. It's the average of many hydrogen bonded structures. So because they're, the hydrogen bonds keep getting made and broken very rapidly. So you average among many different hydrogen bonds, but the age stays with the original molecule. It's not going from molecule to molecule and just breaking hydrogen bonds and going back and forth and that and how fast you do that and how much you do. It depends on concentration on what the solvent is on the temperature and so on. But how about the spin spin splitting between the ch two in the, Ooh, right? That can be the average involving h exchange among many molecules. It's fast if you have h plus, it's slow in dms. So, so in dms, so you saw h is staying with their molecule and you see they're splitting in h plus they go from molecule to molecule fast.

Speaker 1:          25:59          You see the average. And what happens if you don't, if you have chloroform, but you don't have the h plus, it's some kind of averaging is beginning to happen it looks like. So let's, so it's clear that if you have h plus in there, it can zip around. What happens if you're just making and breaking hydrogen bonds? Well, you could have three, uh, uh, alcohol's hydrogen bonded together in a circle k and they could trade which hydrogen. So this is a mechanism for exchanging hydrogens from one alcohol to another. And then as you go, as the tremor comes apart, the molecules become another tremor and do this exchange another, another, another. This is a mechanism, a slow mechanism, much slower than this h plus thing, right? Which can allow slow averaging of the H's, right? But if you have dms, l was the solvent. This doesn't happen.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Why? Because dms, oh, falls forms very strong hydrogen bonds with Doh, and it doesn't form these trimers in which the hydrogens can shift from one molecule to the other, right? If, if DMS, so we're a strong enough base, it could pull the h off and be like an acid catalysts. That would be a base catalyst. Pull it off one molecule, put it on another one, right? But it's not that strong base. It's just strong enough to forbid forming those hydrogen bonded trimers. Okay, so we can get this averaging, but wait a second. We looked at this one a couple of lectures ago when we were looking at IIR and we said that even though this was said to be an anhydrate, it had these water peaks and we said there were two kinds of water peaks. They're the ones that are hydrogen bonded here and the ones that are not hydrogen bonded.

Speaker 1:          27:49          That's two different peaks, right? But shouldn't those average the same way they do it in Nmr, right? Where whereas you make one as Molly, you go from molecule to Mali is molecules come apart and come together. Hydrogen bonding, you quickly average those. Why don't you get averaging in the IRR when you do get averaging in the Nmr? Another question is what's fast? How fast does it have to be to see a blur or to see the average as a sharp average rather than to see the two distinct things? Okay? Now, uh, this particular sample is a solid, so you could imagine that these, that these are held in place by the surrounding molecules, right? But you see the same effect in solutions. So that's not the difference. Okay. Now notice that in are we have wave numbers here that tell us how fast this is vibrating and how fast this is vibrating.

Speaker 1:          28:47          And this one is a 110 times 10 to the 10th hurts. And this one, this Ooh bond is 102 times 10 to the 10th hurts. That is the difference between them is 10 to the 11th hurts. Right? Whereas the difference we were looking at in the alcohol things were a hundred hertz or a few hundred hertz at most. Okay. So this is a much bigger frequency difference here in IRR than it was an Nmr. Now what does that have to do with anything? How long does it take to measure a frequency? Precisely how long is long for purposes of an average? Okay, well suppose you have two different swings. I'm going to put these two guys on, swings up to the ceiling and they'll start swinging and they swing at a certain rate, right? But they won't swing it exactly the same rate. Okay. If this, if this, if the, uh, if they're a little bit different, the two swings.

Speaker 1:          29:47          Okay. So suppose one of them is pretty fast swinging. One of them swings at 20 hertz and the other swings swings at 21 hertz. Right. And I'm going to try to push them, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna adjust the frequency I'm pushing out. I'm just going to sit here and go bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom, Bom, bom. And I'm going to do it at 20 hertz. Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. So the guy that's swinging naturally at 20 hertz, I always push him every time he comes just right. Okay. So the light field in the, in the I our case or the Nmr case, uh, matches perfectly for 20 hertz, but it doesn't match for 21 hurts. Of course. Now if I just did it for a little while on the 21 hurts just for a little while, it would be all most in phase and I'd be pushing them.

Speaker 1:          30:36          Right? But after a little while, we get out of phase and I'm pushing when he's coming in and pulling when he's going and so on. So it's gonna, it's gonna get out of whack. Now, how long does it take to get out of whack? Right? How long do I have to be doing this in order to find out that I'm not really doing anything with it? Well, notice that a one pulse, a one second pulse samples, the full range of phases from being completely in phase to coming back to being completely in phase again. So if I do it for one second, I get nothing, okay? It just cancels on this one. Everything was golden, okay. But obviously then there's no net interaction with the light in that one over a course of one second. So a one second light pulse can clearly distinguish between 20 hertz and 21 hurts everybody with me.

Speaker 1:          31:33          That means suppose we have 22 hertz. Okay. A swing that I'm trying with my light to hit, but I'm going at 20 hertz, right? So that goes through two complete cycles there. In fact, it goes through one complete cycle. You can tell it's not working after only half, uh, after only half a second. Um, that is one over the difference in lambda that's long enough to sample the full range, favorable and unfavorable. So I can more quickly tell the difference when the frequencies are more different. Right. It depends on one over the frequency difference. That's how long I have to go to know that I'm not gonna get any action out of it. Okay. Now, here's the interesting thing. Suppose the frequency is changing in time. It's averaging a proton is jumping from one position to another and changing its frequency. Okay? Suppose that it goes for 20 at 22 hertz for awhile.

Speaker 1:          32:37          Then at 20 hertz for awhile it's in a different environment than at 22 hertz. Then at 20 Hertz, then at 22 hertz, then at 20 hertz for awhile. Okay. Jumping back and forth randomly at a certain rate. Okay. Now obviously that's not going to work with the 22 hertz light. It goes in and out of phase, right? So we won't get any absorption of 22 hertz light supposedly tried 20 hertz light. So we'll move it up there. Again, it goes in and out of phase, right? No Pr, no profit in that one. But suppose I tried 21 hurts right now. It stays pretty much in phase, so it's averaging properly. Right. And so what will you will see is we have a very good match at 21 hurts the average frequency and we'll see a single sharp peak. Uh, 21 hertz will work 20 hertz won't.

Speaker 1:          33:37          22 we'll, we'll see an average peak. What's the, what's determining it's how long the pulse is compared to the difference in frequency. If the pulse is long enough, uh, that, uh, as long as the difference in frequency, then we can tell it. Okay. So when do peaks average? When Adam's don't stay put long enough to tell the difference in frequency between the two sites that they're changing between. So if two peaks differ by a hundred Hertz, you have to count for a hundredth of a second roughly to tell them apart. Okay. But in the eye, are they differed by 10 to the 11th hurts? Right. So the exchange of position would have to be 10 to the 11th times a second. Right. In order to be able to see separate peaks, right? And, and that's, that's as fast as Adam's vibrate. They can't change their partners that rapidly.

Speaker 1:          34:33          Right? So that's why in the IRR you don't see averaging when you do see it in the Nmr, because the Nmr differences in frequency are small. Just a few hurts or a few hundreds of hurts, right? So if something happens in 100th of a second, you can see separate peaks for it. Okay. But you can't do that in the IRR because the differences in frequency are so large. Okay. So this gives rise then to what's called the Nmr timescale. Now suppose you had Cyclohexane d 11 it gives this spectrum, right? It gives spectrum for axial and equatorial hydrogens, right? Incidentally, notice that that's sort of as if this were like benzine with a ring current, it gets shifted down when it's out beside and shift it up when it's along the axis. At least that's a way to remember it. I'm not really sure that that's the explanation.

Speaker 1:          35:28          I'm not really sure that that a ring current is true. But anyhow, you can remember which is which if you want to, okay, now notice this is a special Molecule d 11 why? Just one proton? And the reason is that you get very complicated spins, spins, splitting. If these are all hydrogen because the axial will be split by that. This equatorial will be split by that axial one because they don't have the same chemical shift, right? So they're going to split one another and then they'll all be also be split by these with different coupling constants and so on. So we make all those deteriorate, we get sharper peaks so we can study it. Okay, so it's d 11 right? But notice this is at minus 89 degrees centigrade. And watch what happens if you start warming up that the difference between the, the difference in a chemical shift is 0.48 parts per million.

Speaker 1:          36:25          And this was measured in an old spectrometer in, in 1964 by frank bovie at bell labs. And at the difference here is, is 0.48 parts per million at 60 megahertz or it's 29 hertz. We got to put it in frequency. If we want to talk about this kind of thing. So 29 hertz difference in frequency. Okay, now we go from minus 89 to minus 68. The peaks get broad to minus 63 broader still. And moving in at 60, they coalesce and become a single peak at minus 60. At minus 57, it starts sharpening up and sharpened up. Still more at minus 49. And what do you think that looks like at room temperature? So single, really sharp peak, sharp as these are sharper. So it's detangle sharp peak up there. Uh, even if you have c six h 12, because it's flipping back and forth rapidly enough that it's averaging the chemical shifts and once the chemical shifts become the same on average, then you can't see the splitting anymore.

Speaker 1:          37:29          Okay? So, so cyclohexane gives a single sharp peak, but this allows you to tell how fast, because you know this frequency difference, right? So it turns out that they less to give a single peak when it's about, uh, at about that same, uh, the lifetime is about the same as that. It's, it's, it's actually four times that. But for qualitative purposes it's the same at the time they coalesce. So, so it's about, it's about a hundred times a second, right? That it, that it's flipping back and forth at minus 60 degrees. But you can measure this, you can fit these lines to theoretical calculations for rates at other temperatures. Or you can go to a different spectrometer which has the same chemical shift difference, but a bigger frequency difference. And then get at what temperature you have that frequency or four times that frequency, right? So that's a great way to measure the rates.

Speaker 1:          38:24          And by measuring the rates at different temperatures, you can get what the barrier is. And that's where we got the number from last semester when we were talking about confirmational analysis, we said that the barrier for flipping one chair to another in Cyclo hexane is 10 and a half kilocalories per mole. And that's where you get it. It's not easy to measure something like that, but Nmr allows you to do it right. So this is a handy way to measure really fast rates and very small barriers that correspond to these fast rates. So the Nmr application and dynamics is very important for studying a fast rate processes. Now let me see. I at the time, yeah, we got, uh, let me just go very quickly. I'm going to go really quickly through this, so to, so we can get to a little bit of something else.

Speaker 1:          39:13          But this was the kind of question that I might ask on an exam. Uh, the first part of the question one had to do with making this molecule. We've talked about making Hemi asset towels before, but the relevant part here is question two, which was the sketch, what you'd expect for the Nmr spectrum of that compound. Okay. So let's look at the different, uh, groups and you predict what we're going to get in terms of chemical shift. First A, how about its chemical shift? Where do you expect that on the spectrum? The OAH, it'll be downfield because of the, oh, but it'll be almost any place because of the hydrogen bonding and so on. That has a big range. And how about the splitting?

Speaker 2:          39:55          Yeah. Should it be a singlet doublet, a triplet court that quintet? One four, six, four one.

Speaker 1:          40:06          What determines the splitting of this?

Speaker 2:          40:09          Jeez.

Speaker 1:          40:10          How many protons are on the next adjacent Adam? Right? So here we coupled through this bond, this bond, uh, to here, right? These are too far away. Those are removed by one, two, three, four bonds. But to hear it's only one, two, three bonds. Right? So it should be a doublet, right? Everybody agree? It should be a doublet.

Speaker 2:          40:39          Sebastian, you shake your head slightly is on,

Speaker 1:          40:44          it depends in dms. So it would be a doublet, but mostly you don't use that. And in chloroform it would be exchanging, right? So you wouldn't see the splitting. Okay. So it could be almost any place between one and six for hydrogen bonding and the splitting is probably, it would be a broad singlet because of rapid ohia exchange. Okay. Now let's go to be, where should that be? Kind of cool.

Speaker 2:          41:08          We'll ship way up the right way. Up The left, in the middle, almost to the right.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Okay, so it's c h three is that are on, it's a co, it's hydrogens that are on the carbon and the next atom is carbon too. That's up at the right. Right. But it has a couple of oxygens here. Right. So it'll be shifted down a little bit. Okay. Slightly de shielded by two atoms on the neighboring carbon. So one might predict someplace between one and two and there's a compound that's very like that. That isn't 1.3 okay. How about the splitting?

Speaker 2:          41:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:47          By this one, now it has three bonds to get from here to here. Right? So that should be a splitting. There's no exchanging there. Okay. So it should be a one to one doublet split by Jay should be about seven hertz. Okay. Now how about c? What should it look like? Where should, what should its chemical shift be relative to say these hydrogens? Eric was saying, I said double it. Quadruple. I knocked the splitting. Where's should watch it? The chemical shift. B first.

Speaker 2:          42:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:24          It's attached to a carbon. What's that carbon attached to Amy. Their oxygen. So will be shifted down more than this one was right, because it's closer to the oxygen's. Right. So, so it's de shielded by two oxygen atoms on the same carbon. Right. So, uh, it'd be between four and a half. There's a real, there's a analog that's at 4.7. Okay. Now how about Derek, now you tell us about the splitting of this one. I think it's a doubling or tripling or quadrupling downwards. I don't know that it would be if it were split by this, that makes it a quartet. Alright. Yeah. And this would make it a doublet, except we already said that that's probably exchanging, it would depend on the solvent, right? So probably it would just be a one to three to three to one quartet, right. Ajay about sonar. It's okay. Let's keep going. How about this one? What's that going to be like,

Speaker 2:          43:18          Jack?

Speaker 1:          43:21          Chemical shift for that ch three, pardon me? Maybe about two because it's attached to a carbon which bears oxygen, right? So, so slightly de shielded by the assets rather like this one. Right. Which is attached to a carbon which bore two oxygens. So not as far down. Is that okay? The 1.1. Okay. And how about the splitting of that one, Jack? Just the Dublin because these are too far away. Okay. One, two, one, double at seven hertz. Okay. Now let's go to e. What's it gonna look like about its chemical shift? Debbie,

Speaker 2:          44:01          be,

Speaker 1:          44:02          yeah, because it's got an oxygen on the same carbon, right? Right. So it's, it's 3.8 out that, okay. And how about its multiplicity? How many hydrogens? Splitting it,

Speaker 2:          44:15          three Vons away. I can't hear.

Speaker 1:          44:30          Well, we already that this one is going to be a doublet split by that. If that's true, if, if this one splits these than these, split that. And so does the top ones. So how many altogether? Six. So it'll be seven lines in the binomial intensity, right? Seven line, multiply from the six atoms on the neighboring carbons. Seven Hertz. Right. So that's going to be really, you know, the whole bunch of them. Seven lines. Okay. Now how about F, Chris? Same as D, right? It's got the same conductivity as d, same hydrogen coupling and so on, but it's slightly de shielded by the Austrian out on that. So that's this. I copied that from here and I copied this from here. And that's what you said, but it's different from d because here is a chiral center. So one of those is our pro our and the other is pro s, right?

Speaker 1:          45:35          They, they're different within other chiral center. So in fact, when you look at a situation like that, there are two that are really close to one another, two doublets. Okay. There they're about the same. But I, I, I caught you. What? All right. Yeah, you do see that not in every molecule. Notice that's an ice appropriate group to ch three s on a Cah attached to something. If the rest of the molecule is chiral, those will be different. Right? That depends on what the molecule is. Sometimes hardly, hardly observable, but very often you can see it. I saw one when I was a graduate student, I got a spectrum like that and I couldn't, I said, what the heck is going on? So that was a standard question I would ask on exams down here of graduate students at that time after I learned it myself.

Speaker 1:          46:25          Okay, now, proton decoupling. Um, let me just start this and then we'll show the example next time. So we have JC 13 h here. Okay, now notice that when we put this in a magnetic field, a certain magnetic field, the Proton, we'll precess at 100 megahertz. How about the c 13? Well, it precess it a hundred megahertz. No, because it's a much weaker magnet. It doesn't feel as much torque. It doesn't precess as fast, right? So the h has a steady field in that direction, or there are other ones that have exactly the same steady field in the opposite direction. Now see, see, 13 is 25 megahertz. It's only a quarter as strong as a magnet. So it precesses much more slowly. It's a smaller magnet and it can be either up or down. Okay? So both of these things are happening when we put it in a magnetic field.

Speaker 1:          47:22          Okay? And here's the Nmr spectrum. And we've seen that and saw the, the uh, the satellites that the, these come that peak, this peak comes from. See twelves, this is from [inaudible] when they're down. And this is the Proton precession when the c 13 is up reinforcing the applied field, okay? And at the same time, if we looked at the c 13 spectrum, notice that essentially all of of hydrogen is protium only 0.015%, very little as deuterium. So you don't see that big peak in the middle here because all the hydrogen is either this way or this way, right? And the amount, the magnitude of this splitting in both cases, 125 hertz, that's fine. Okay, so now suppose we do something really cute. Suppose we've put two radio frequencies in, okay, one one at 100 megahertz, one at 25 megahertz, right? But what we're going to do it, the way we're going to do it is to have irradiate 100 megahertz all the time.

Speaker 1:          48:28          So what does that, but just do a pulse, a 90 degree pulse of the c 13 to twist it down into the plane and then allow it to precess and that's what we're going to listen to, to see if we got a signal. We're going to listen to the c 13 while irradiating the age. Now what effect does that happen? If you were in a frame rotating a hundred megahertz, you'd see that this little hundred megahertz field is going to cause this, this the hydrogens to precess like this to go up, down, up, down, up, down. What determines how fast they go up and down, how fast they've precess. What determines that?

Speaker 1:          49:11          It's how big this field is, how strong the field is. The stronger the field, the faster the precession. Okay, so that means h is going to be up then down, then up then down and how fast it's going up, down, up, down, up, down. Depends on how much power we put into our radio. Okay? If we do it fast enough, we see the average of the [inaudible] and decouple the spectrum. We can see the c 13 spectrum without the h splitting it by making the H's quickly go up and down. How fast do they have to go up and down in order to average the 125 hertz splitting to be nothing, to just be a single Pete, how fast.

Speaker 2:          49:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:57          Once you've had time to review the lecture, you'll be able to answer that about 125 times a second, right? The frequency differences, how fast you have to flip to average. Right? So if you put enough power on the hydrogen, you remove the splitting from the c 13 specter, which can be handy as we'll show you the next time.

Speaker 2:          50:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:21          So the decoupling power determines the rate of this precession and this we'll see next time.
