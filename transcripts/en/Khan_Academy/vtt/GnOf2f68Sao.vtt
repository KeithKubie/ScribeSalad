00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.894
- [Instructor] All
right, in the last video,

00:00:01.894 --> 00:00:04.977
we talked about the election of 1824,

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:08.781
which turned into a grudge match

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:11.753
between John Quincy
Adams and Andrew Jackson

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:14.488
in which Andrew Jackson
won the popular vote

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:17.044
but John Quincy Adams
won the electoral vote

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.060
and the tiebreaker turned out to be

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.457
Speaker of the House Henry Clay,

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:23.773
who helped give the election to Adams

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.899
but then was shortly named
Secretary of State by Adams,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.936
leading Andrew Jackson and his partisans

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:35.322
to claim that a corrupt
bargain had taken place.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:38.527
And this really shows how the nature

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:41.513
of American politics had changed

00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:45.151
because this sort of you scratch my back,

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.463
I'll scratch yours was common
practice in American politics

00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:52.596
between a few elite men who were generally

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:54.650
in charge of the political process.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.863
But Andrew Jackson and his supporters

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:58.625
say that this is undemocratic.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.943
This is the kind of elitist hokum

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:06.904
that we do not need in our
nation of free white men.

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:10.654
So, four years later in
the election of 1828,

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.701
it is a Jackson/John Quincy Adams rematch

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:18.732
and the gloves are off.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.657
So, in the first video in this series,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:24.827
I mentioned that during this time period,

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:28.274
a lot of the aspects that we consider

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:31.583
part of American politics
first came to the fore.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.561
And one of the things that you'll see

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.024
in the election of 1828,
really for the first time,

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.524
is down and dirty mudslinging,

00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:44.944
or making angry attacks
ad hominem, or at the man,

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.927
rather than at his principles,
attacks on your opponent.

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.724
So, Andrew Jackson probably already had

00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:55.286
all the ammunition he needed

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:58.741
with the corrupt bargain of 1824.

00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.746
John Quincy Adams kinda considered himself

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.415
above this kind of mudslinging.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.385
But his supporters did not,

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.126
and they came out with some real gems.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.102
Not only did they put out
handbills with coffins,

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:13.357
this is known as the Coffin
Handbill to this day,

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:17.451
detailing how many men had
been killed by Andrew Jackson,

00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:20.221
either through execution or duels,

00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.011
they also accused his
mother of being a prostitute

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:26.682
and his wife of being a bigamist.

00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:28.933
In fact, Andrew Jackson's wife died

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.085
shortly before his inauguration

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.688
and he believed to his dying day

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:36.559
that it was the terrible
slanders about her

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.814
that had led to her untimely death.

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:42.560
Another first for the election of 1828

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.556
is Andrew Jackson as the first candidate

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.574
for the Democratic Party.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:50.451
This is a new party united around Jackson.

00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.961
In the previous election,
all of the candidates

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:55.076
had been Republicans
in one form or another,

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:56.927
but now the Republican
Party is going to start

00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:00.443
to fade away and the Democratic
Party will come to the fore.

00:03:00.443 --> 00:03:02.095
And this is the same Democratic Party

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:04.802
that is still in existence
in the United States today.

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:07.508
Of course, its goals
and ideas have changed

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:09.605
a great deal since the 1820s.

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:13.283
And with his Democratic Party
and even with the supporters

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:16.220
of John Quincy Adams,
what Jackson taps into

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.303
is this kind of mass party democracy.

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:22.802
He has great party machines

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:26.595
working for him in Eastern cities.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:29.975
He also really takes
advantage particularly

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.798
of people on the frontier,

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:35.965
so white people who are
looking to expand westward

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:42.089
to kind of make it, as we
would say, rugged individuals,

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.494
people pulling themselves
up by their bootstraps

00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:47.677
and they saw that in Andrew Jackson

00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:50.993
because he had been born fairly penniless.

00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:54.828
And then, by the time he was
elected president in 1828,

00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:57.032
he had become part of the frontier elite.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:03:59.050
He was now a slave holder;

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.839
he was one of the guys who had made it.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.760
But those on the frontier looked to him

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.749
and saw the example of
what they wanted to be.

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.417
Jackson also had the
advantage of being a war hero

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.840
from the Battle of New
Orleans in the War of 1812.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.753
And throughout the 19th century,

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.954
those with valorous military service

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:20.733
will do well in national elections.

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:23.904
And another thing that Andrew
Jackson does quite well

00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:28.071
is harnesses anti-Indian,
anti-Native American sentiment.

00:04:30.113 --> 00:04:34.280
John Quincy Adams had attempted
to bargain in good faith,

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:39.791
to try to hold up the
side of the United States

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.898
with Native American nations
living in what was then

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:46.793
the territorial borders
of the United States.

00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:48.268
He'd bargained with them

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:51.529
as if they were sovereign
nations unto themselves.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.534
Andrew Jackson understood
that white settlers

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:58.477
desperately wanted Indian lands

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.362
and he played to those white settlers,

00:05:01.362 --> 00:05:04.042
assuring him that he would do his utmost

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:07.402
to remove Native Americans
from those lands,

00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:10.648
a promise that he will make
good on during his presidency.

00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:13.731
So, Jackson wins the election of 1828

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:19.266
and immediately it's
obvious that the democracy

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.560
under Jackson is quite different

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.814
from the American system
under previous presidents.

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:28.981
At his inauguration, he
turns to the crowd and bows,

00:05:29.978 --> 00:05:31.972
signaling that he thinks of himself

00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:35.056
as being beneath the
people that he's serving.

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:37.497
He also opens up the White House

00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:40.446
during what's called the Inaugural Brawl,

00:05:40.446 --> 00:05:43.350
and it's believed that many
people went into the White House

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.313
and they wrecked the china and
they destroyed the furniture

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:48.270
and they wouldn't leave
until people told them

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.453
there was alcohol outside on the lawn.

00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:53.698
And to an earlier generation
who had been raised

00:05:53.698 --> 00:05:56.940
with this early American aristocracy

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.107
of the Adamses and the Washingtons,
this looks like anarchy.

00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:02.972
They thought this was the beginning

00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:05.265
of the French Revolution
in the United States.

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.929
It was not, but it was the beginning

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:12.206
of massive party politics,
political campaigns,

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:16.228
and the beginning of a new
politics in the United States

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:18.514
that appealed to the common man.

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.571
And we'll talk more about
that in the next video.
