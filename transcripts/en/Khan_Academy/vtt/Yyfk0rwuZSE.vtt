00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] Function
G can be thought of

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.027
as a stretched or compressed version

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:08.144
of F of X is equal to
the absolute value of X.

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.261
What is the equation for G of X?

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.540
So you can see F of X is equal

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.822
to the absolute value of X here in blue,

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.290
and then G of X,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.102
not only does it look
stressed or compressed,

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:20.613
but it also is flipped over the X axis.

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:21.960
So like always, pause this video

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.049
and see if you can up yourself

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:26.772
with the equation for G of X.

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:29.873
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:31.753
So there's a couple of
ways we could do it.

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:34.249
We could first try to flip F of X,

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.677
and then try to stretch or compress it,

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:37.419
or we could stretch or compress it first,

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.258
and then try to flip it.

00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:41.285
Let's actually, let's flip it first,

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:44.477
so let's say that we have a function

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.310
that looks like this.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.607
It's just exactly what F of X is,

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:50.568
but flipped over the X axis.

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:53.023
So it's just flipped over the X axis,

00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:55.990
so all the values for any given X,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.708
whatever Y you used to get,

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.104
you're not getting the negative of that.

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:02.200
So this graph right over here,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.786
this would be the graph.

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:06.758
I'll call this, Y is equal

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:09.758
to the negative absolute value of X.

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.592
Whatever the absolute value of X

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.001
would have gotten you before,

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.593
you're now going to get the negative

00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:17.288
of the opposite of it.

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:20.214
So this is getting us
closer to our definition

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.752
of G of X.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:25.152
The key here is how do
we appropriately stretch

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:27.735
or squeeze this green function?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.609
So let's think about what's happening.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.917
On this green function,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.834
when X is equal to one,

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.418
the function itself is
equal to negative one,

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:40.827
but we want it, if we want
it to be the same as G,

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:43.242
we want it to be equal to negative four.

00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:45.855
So it's actually four times the value.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.432
For a given X, at least for X equals one,

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:51.163
G is giving me something
four times the value

00:01:51.163 --> 00:01:53.028
that my green function is giving.

00:01:53.028 --> 00:01:54.888
That's not just true for positive Xs.

00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:56.761
It's also true for negative Xs.

00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:57.775
You can see it right over here.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.830
When X is equal to negative one,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.429
my green function gives me negative one,

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.273
but G gives me negative four.

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:09.158
So it's giving me four times the value.

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.628
It's giving me four
times the negative value,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:12.904
so it's going even more negative,

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.220
so what you can see, to
go from the green to G,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.148
you have to multiply this
thing right over here by four.

00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:22.732
So that is what essentially
stretches it down,

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:25.216
stretches it down in
the vertical direction.

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:29.337
So we could say that G of X is equal to,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:31.381
it's not negative absolute value of X,

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:35.048
negative four times the
absolute value of X.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.430
And you could have done it the other way.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.681
You could have said,
"Hey, let's first stretch

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.023
"or compress F."

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.223
And say, alright, before
we even flip it over,

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:44.656
if we were to unflip G,

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.434
it would look like this.

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.220
If we were to unflip G,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.220
it would look like this.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:55.095
If were to unflip G,

00:02:56.298 --> 00:02:58.131
so this thing right over here,

00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.434
this thing looks like four times F of X.

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.267
We could write this as

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.960
Y is equal to four times F of X,

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.841
or you could say Y is equal to four times

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.729
the absolute value of X,

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.656
and then we have a negative sign.

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.645
Whatever positive value
you were getting before,

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.659
you now get the opposite value,

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.698
and that would flip it
over and get you to G,

00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:25.865
which is exactly what we already got.
