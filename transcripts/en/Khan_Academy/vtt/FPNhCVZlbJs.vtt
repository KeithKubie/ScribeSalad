00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.300
In this video, I want
to talk about how

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.860
we can convert repeating
decimals into fractions.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.360
So let's give ourselves
a repeating decimal.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.390
So let's say I had the
repeating decimal 0.7.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.250
And sometimes it'll
be written like that,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.820
which just means that
the 7 keeps on repeating.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.040
So this is the same
thing as 0.7777

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.020
and I could just keep going
on and on and on forever

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.930
with those 7s.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.340
So the trick to converting
these things into fractions

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.349
is to essentially set
this equal to a variable.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.140
And we'll just show
it, do it step-by-step.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.764
So let me set this
equal to a variable.

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:38.380
Let me call this x.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.710
So x is equal to
0.7, and then the 7

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.640
repeats on and on forever.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.582
Now what would 10x be?

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:47.790
Well, let's think about this.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.960
10x.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.494
10x would just be 10 times this.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:54.410
And we could even think
of it right over here.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.540
It would be, if we
multiplied this times 10,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.970
you'd be moving the decimal
1 over to the right,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.110
it would be 7.777, on and
on and on and on forever.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.800
Or you could say it
is 7.7 repeating.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.040
Now this is the trick here.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.550
So let me make these
equal to each other.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.880
So we know what x is. x is this,
just 0.777 repeating forever.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.270
10x is this.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.100
And this is another
repeating thing.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.530
Now the way that we can get
rid of the repeating decimals

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.400
is if we subtract x from 10x.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.900
Right?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.790
Because x has all these 0.7777.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.102
If you subtract
that from 7.77777,

00:01:32.102 --> 00:01:33.810
then you're just going
to be left with 7.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.920
So let's do that.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.220
So let me rewrite it here just
so it's a little bit neater.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.080
10x is equal to 7.7
repeating, which

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.490
is equal to 7.777
on and on forever.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.360
And we established
earlier that x

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.900
is equal to 0.7 repeating,
which is equal to 0.777

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.520
on and on and on forever.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.440
Now what happens if you
subtract x from 10x?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.400
So we're going to subtract
the yellow from the green.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.770
Well, 10 of something
minus 1 of something

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.680
is just going to be
9 of that something.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.650
And then that's
going to be equal to,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.110
what's 7.7777
repeating minus 0.77777

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.630
going on and on
forever repeating?

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.250
Well it's just going to be 7.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.750
These parts are
going to cancel out.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.940
You're just left with 7.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.980
Or you could say these
two parts cancel out.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.530
You're just left with 7.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.800
And so you get 9x is equal to 7.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.330
To solve for x, you just
divide both sides by 9.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.882
Let's divide both sides by nine.

00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:37.090
I could do all three sides,
although these are really

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.280
saying the same thing.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.200
And you get x is equal to 7/9.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.060
Let's do another one.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.750
I'll leave this one here
so you can refer to it.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.210
So let's say I have the
number 1.2 repeating.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.330
So this is the same thing
as 1.2222 on and on and on.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.200
Whatever the bar is
on top of, that's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.700
the part that repeats
on and on forever.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.520
So just like we did over here,
let's set this equal to x.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.610
And then let's say 10x.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.930
Let's multiply this by 10.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.620
So 10x is equal to, it
would be 12.2 repeating,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.420
which is the same thing as
12.222 on and on and on and on.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.805
And then we can
subtract x from 10x.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.180
And you don't have
to rewrite it,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.471
but I'll rewrite it here just
so we don't get confused.

00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.040
So we have x is equal
to 1.2 repeating.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.240
And so if we subtract x
from 10x, what do we get?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.150
On the left-hand side,
we get 10x minus x is 9x.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.110
And this is going to be
equal to, well, the 2

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.750
repeating parts cancel out.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.910
This cancels with that.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.660
If 2 repeating
minus 2 repeating,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.780
that's just a bunch of 0.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.810
So it's 12 minus 1 is 11.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.720
And you have 9x is equal to 11.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.060
Divide both sides by 9.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.635
You get x is equal to 11/9.
