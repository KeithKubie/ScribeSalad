00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:14.170
BRUCE FLATT: Thank you, Pranesh.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.830
And thank you everyone
for joining today.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.660
I was given the task
of trying to give

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.510
an overview of the investment
principles for real asset

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.020
investing that we follow
within Brookfield.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.610
And I would just say
that over the years,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.840
we didn't have any secret sauce.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.880
And we had no strategy.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.980
Really, when we
started, I would say

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.760
it was based on a value thesis.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.690
And over the years we've
tried to learn and develop

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.060
a strategy that worked for us.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.610
And maybe the number
one thing that I

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.540
would say to anyone
that is investing

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.510
is that there's never
a right strategy.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.260
It's whatever
strategy fits yourself

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.940
and what you want to do.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.070
So I'd start off with that.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.600
For us, though, we
generally have always

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.710
operated in a methodology
where we're trying

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.440
to walk away from the cliff.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.830
And we keep this
slide in the office,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.330
in many of the
offices in the world,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.870
to really indicate and
remind all of our people

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.760
that one should always
look for opportunity away

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.500
from where the crowd is going
and not go with the crowd.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.810
And in real asset
investing, that's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.450
a very important
lesson to learn.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.130
15 or 20 years ago, we wrote
down the investment guidelines

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.130
that we had for the company.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.760
Ever so slightly over the
years, those have changed.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.280
But largely, they are the same.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.400
The first one is
to identify places

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.690
where we have a
competitive advantage

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.840
and invest in those areas.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.700
Second, always try to
invest on a value basis.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.950
So go away from where the people
are going and invest where

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.820
other capital is not .

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.040
And we found that's very
important to investing

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.810
in real assets.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.880
Third, what we're
looking to do is

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.180
to buy assets or
find assets that have

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.880
cash flow inherent in them.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.190
Or we can build the cash
flows within the business.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.890
So they may not have
cash flow day 1.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890
You may have an office
building and you may just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.060
have a piece of land,
but inherently it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.480
in a good place where you can
build it to generate cash flow.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.890
And it's similar to many
things in the world.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.710
And lastly, I guess we've always
tried to adhere to the strategy

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.700
that being contrarian and
not being where the crowd is

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.010
going is hard to do, but the
most lucrative if accomplished.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.620
Measuring your success
is always important.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.590
And there's, I guess,
four things that we've

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.180
tried to do to measure success.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.310
We always look at success
on a total capital

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.160
basis over the long term.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And really that gets you staying
away from short-term objectives

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.030
within a company, which is often
where companies make mistakes.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.750
Second, we always try to
encourage all of our people

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.580
to take calculated risks,
but compare that risk

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.240
with the return that one might
get out of the investment.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.510
Third, we always look for the
return over the longer term,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.700
as opposed to the short term.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.250
And we'll sacrifice
short-term returns

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.280
to achieve long-term success.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.800
And lastly, and I'll come to
this later in the presentation,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.390
but we seek profitability
rather than growth,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.830
because growth doesn't
necessarily in what we do

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.070
add value.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.290
Sometimes it does, but it
doesn't necessarily add value.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.830
And as to business
philosophy, we've

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.600
tried to build the business
across everything that we do

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.060
and the relationships we
have based on integrity,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.580
because if you're
going to endure over

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.100
very long periods
of time, you need

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.280
to have strong relationships,
both outside the company

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.900
and within the people
within your business.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.120
And we try to make everyone
within the business

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.190
think and act like owners.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.830
And there's many, many
ways you can do that,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.010
but we try to accomplish
everyone thinking and acting

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.420
like your owners.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.380
And often that comes with
the incentive programs

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.780
you have in place, but
there are many other ways

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.250
to do that out there.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.900
And lastly, I guess the
ethos within the company

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.480
is to treat everyone's
money like it's your own.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.570
And we try to
accomplish that again

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.170
in many ways across the company.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.770
But the business
model of our company

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.900
and what we've tried
to do with the business

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.330
is try to make it very simple.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.040
And it really just boils
down to five things.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.960
We try to use the global
reach we have to acquire

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.900
real assets on a value basis.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.380
Once we buy them,
these are assets

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.080
that can be easily financed with
long-term capital that doesn't

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.670
participate in the equity.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.080
And therefore, the leverage
to return to the common equity

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.330
owner is significant, as
long as you do it properly.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.280
Third, we then try
to take the people

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.050
that we have in the business
and enhance the cash flows

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.300
through using all those
people in the operating

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.280
platforms we have to grow them.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.330
The equity we find, we get from
our institutional and other

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.890
clients globally.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.970
And we look to continue
to grow and buy

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.510
real estate and infrastructure
assets with that capital.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.970
And then we just do this
over and over again and.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.080
Generally , we're very long term
in nature and often own assets

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.530
much longer than other people.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.930
But all the assets
we own and buy

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.770
are of similar cash
flow characteristics.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.600
But we try to use the advantages
that we have in everything

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.290
that we do.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.890
And there's really four that
I'd like to highlight to you.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.940
And when you think about
real estate or infrastructure

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.330
investing, these are
really four characteristics

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.610
we think can be very helpful.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.300
As I said, size
does not necessarily

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.370
generate profitability.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.550
But given the
scale that we have,

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.260
we've been able to use
size as a differentiator.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.630
And today, given the
size of the organization

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.220
that we have and
the size of capital

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.200
that we have to
put to work, there

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.130
are often only one or two
other people in the world

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.770
that someone can bring
a transaction to.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.290
That gives us a
competitive advantage.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.500
And if we can use the
other advantages we have,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.780
it differentiates our
money versus others.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.290
Second, over the last 20 years
we built a global business.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.100
Very few other investors
like us have as large

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.840
of global business as we have.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.090
And that's allowed us to move
capital to where we can best

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.860
find the opportunities.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.310
Two years ago,
that was in Brazil.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.500
Recently, it's been in India.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.180
In 2009, as Pranesh
mentioned earlier,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.790
it was in the United States.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:04.190
But that global platform allows
us to take ideas and turn them

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.100
into actionable opportunities.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.690
If you don't have a global
platform, you can't do that.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.150
Three, most of the
capital we have

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.880
has limited restrictions on it.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.770
Therefore, we can invest--

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.970
we're agnostic to
the opportunity

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.370
type, the form of investment.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.610
Whether it's a public
company, a private investment,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.049
or some other convertible
debenture or common equity,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.340
we're agnostic to that.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.340
Often people have restrictions
on the way they invest.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.030
And if you can be
more agnostic to that,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.000
it's helpful to the
long-term returns.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.980
And lastly, our
operating businesses

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.440
give us a strategic advantage
to be able to run the businesses

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.420
and operate the things
once we're there.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.620
This generally enables one
to find value investments

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.870
no matter what the
environment is.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.812
And often in
countries, for example,

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:09.520
in the United States
today, stock markets

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.890
are at their high, bond
markets are at their high.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.970
And often one would say, it's
tough to find opportunity

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.390
within that environment.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.810
And to some degree that's true.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.050
But if you can use
your advantages

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.040
to be able to find opportunities
within that sector,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.130
you should be able to continue
invest despite the environment

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.720
in a country.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.540
And there's a few
reasons for that.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.050
Often our investments
are longer term

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.180
and are more
illiquid than others.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.162
So our advantage is that we're
willing to be longer-term

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:44.620
investor, and we're
willing to have

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.390
something that's illiquid
versus what others might accept.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.180
Often they're larger
in size, and that's not

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.550
attainable by others.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.430
Often they're not
easily acquired--

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.530
it's tough work to do it--

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.070
syndicated or
operated by people.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.900
We bought a pipeline in
Brazil 2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.146
That pipeline is a major
infrastructure asset

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:11.770
in the country.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.700
Not everyone can run a
large pipeline in Brazil.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.230
Often these investments
are seen as risky

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.090
if you're not
intimately involved

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.270
in them, which is a
strategic advantage if you

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.940
do operate the type of assets.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.760
They require skilled
people to operate them.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.590
And most of the time, when
we're making investments,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.630
it's not fashionable.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.650
Most investors follow fashion.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.730
If you cannot follow
fashion and follow value,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.800
the returns will be much
greater over the longer term.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.360
It helps, though,
for our business

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.060
that we've been in the
front of a strong trend

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.100
in the institutional
market over the years

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.497
because, sometimes
you can have capital

00:11:00.497 --> 00:11:02.080
and you think it's
a good opportunity.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.260
If you can't find equity
to be able to invest,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.560
it's often difficult to do.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.060
And the biggest part of that
is that these real assets,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.770
being real estate
and infrastructure,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.330
have a strong return profile
for people to invest into.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.710
And there's just a
few reasons for that.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.630
One, they generally earn
good cash on cash yields,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.470
or ultimately will
once a program for them

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.920
is put into place.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.479
Two, they generally can be
contracted for long duration.

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:37.270
So you have security
task flow and often it

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.760
increases over time.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.580
Sometimes that's by
inflation and sometimes it's

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.000
by other means.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.620
Fourth, often these
assets are scarce.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.940
And as many of you know
from living in cities,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.500
the world is urbanizing.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.610
And what it means is the value
of real estate in city centers

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.280
is getting more
valuable every day.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.710
And that means assets
appreciate in value.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.860
The private nature of
them for pension plans,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.770
institutional investors, allows
the volatility to be low.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.070
So they're not looking
at the stock market

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.770
return in their portfolio
going up and down every day.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.220
And the returns are generally
far greater than other options

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.400
available to investors.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.030
And I'll cover that in a second.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.920
This slide just shows
the institutional capital

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.600
in the world.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.730
And it's growing exponentially.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.560
Back in 2008, it
was $23 trillion.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.550
Today, it's estimated in the
range of-- the last number that

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.360
we had was 2016--

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.570
is estimated just
over $40 trillion.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.500
And it should be over
$80 trillion by 2025.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.180
So there's very substantial
amounts of money

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.260
that's going into
these sovereign plans.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.470
And for us and
who we invest for,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.220
the most important
things that are happening

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.410
is that the
institutional plans are

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.225
putting more of that $23
trillion, $43 trillion,

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:17.620
$80 trillion into real assets,
real estate and infrastructure

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.000
and alternatives.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.850
And if you look back
to 2000, the percentage

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.630
in their portfolios
in general was 5%.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.680
Today, it's 25%.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.620
And we think that number
will be 40% by 2030.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.220
And what's happening with
that there's this therefore

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.200
an exponential increase
of money being taken out

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.590
of equities and bonds going
into these type of real assets,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:51.520
really because they fit the
profile of their portfolio.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.740
And it simply comes
down to this one simple

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.590
mathematical exercise.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.410
Bonds yield 1% to 3%.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:08.740
If you're in Japan, it's
0 if you're 0 to 30 years.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.280
If you're in Germany, it's
40 basis points at 10 years.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.920
It's negative 60 basis
points on the cash rate.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.970
And in the United States,
we're pushing 3% today.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.180
Equities generally if
you buy an index fund,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.700
you probably will earn 6% to
8% over the next 10 to 20 years

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.540
if you stayed in
and didn't trade.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.730
And real asset yields
can offer 6% to 20%.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.535
So if you buy real
estate or infrastructure

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:41.980
and you do it right,
you can earn 6% or 20%,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.950
depending on that type of
thing you do, where you do it,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.970
how you do it, and
those type of things.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.900
And that's really why
significant capital

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.290
is moving into these sectors.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.600
And we think that
will stay because we

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.581
think that we're in a continued
range of low-ish interest

00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:02.080
rates.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.550
And that doesn't
mean they're going

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.820
to be 3% on a 10-year
treasury in the US.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.000
But what is happening is that
global rates are very low.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.530
And that's continued to keep
the 10-year rate in the United

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:20.860
States low despite the
cash rate being pushed up.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.170
And if you take all
of that, I guess

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.430
we've tried to operate with some
guiding principles of what you

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.980
should do when you're
investing in real estate

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.910
and infrastructure.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:36.430
And we tried to use those as
guiding principles for how

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.620
you invest into these type
of assets for all our people.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.300
And when we started the
business 30 years ago--

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.230
and it was very small--

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.590
you could to a few
people in the office.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.130
But today, with 1,600 people
in our investment manager

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.930
and 75,000 people
in the company,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.290
it's important to have
those guiding principles.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.210
And we have eight, and I'll
go through those principles

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:09.040
and a few examples
as I'll talk through.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.650
The first one is, if we
can find great assets,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.990
we should always
buy great assets.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:22.510
And if one has to pay a
little more for great assets,

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.600
that's OK.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.750
But make sure you buy quality.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.590
Now, don't do it at any
price, because price is always

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.610
important.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.300
As I stated earlier,
go away from the trend

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.380
and try to buy value.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.660
But if you can buy
great assets, especially

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.310
during distressed
times, buy great things.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.180
Just a short example, in 1996,
we bought an office building

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.990
on Park Avenue.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.960
We paid $432 million for it.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.660
We've been through
four cycles since then

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.680
of which included 9/11 and the
financial collapse of 2008.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.450
We sold this asset for
$2.2 billion last year.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.859
So we held it for 21 years.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.290
For 10 years, we've
had no money in it.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.180
Meaning we financed
all our capital out.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.040
In the end, we had a $900
million mortgage on it.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.250
So we had financed out
our original investment

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.339
plus another $500 million.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:25.210
But this was an asset
on Park Avenue, which

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.750
was in the center of Manhattan.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.260
And no matter what was
happening in the world,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.720
as long as in the
fullness of time, as long

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.740
as you kept that great asset,
it was going to be worth more.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.890
And there were times when
it was tough to own it

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.870
and cash flows
didn't look so good.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.650
But a great asset
in a city could

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.890
be paid up for a little
bit during a period

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.710
of stress, which we bought
it during a period of stress

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.990
in 1996.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.100
Second, we try to invest
assuming that we're going

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.380
to own the assets forever.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.200
Now that last asset I showed
you, we owned for 21 years.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.260
In most people's investing
principles, that is forever.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.890
But we try to buy everything
that we'll own it forever.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.190
And the most
important point there

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.840
is if you're buying it and
going to own it forever,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.690
you look at it with the
long-term fundamentals

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:23.680
involved.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.530
Not what's going to
happen to it next month

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.340
or whether it will trade
up in the stock market,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.930
it's that you may have
to own it forever,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:39.610
and even though we may
not own it forever.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.550
An example, we bought this--

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.880
incredible picture actually--
it's a pump storage facility.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.750
So we own water.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.610
We run it down.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.990
We generate electricity.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.290
And at nighttime with
electricity costs lower,

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.230
we pump the water back
up to the top of the hill

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.420
and put it in this bathtub.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.140
And it's an incredible asset.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.810
And when we looked at it, we
bought it from a bankruptcy

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.730
in 2004.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.286
And we didn't know what we
were going to be able to do it,

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.910
what we'd be able to
do with the asset.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.730
It had no income on it.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.300
But we knew it is a great
asset, and we underwrote it

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.840
that we would be able
to hold it forever.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.239
Three, in the
things that we do--

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:28.780
and this isn't relevant to every
business-- but in the things

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.655
that we do in real estate
and infrastructure,

00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:37.660
the number one thing that drives
value within an investment

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:43.310
is up front if you can invest
in something in a great spot

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.820
and if you can buy it at
less than replacement cost.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.750
And if you can, it most
often indicates value

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.140
because the competitive
product that will ultimately

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.610
compete against you will
cost more than what you paid.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.550
So you should be able to
either earn a higher return

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.130
or out price your competition
during the investment.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.110
And that's probably
the number one thing,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:11.410
which is why in our business
what you're always trying to do

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:16.430
is to move your capital to the
places where others are not.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.980
We bought this company called
Terraform Power in 2017.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.210
It's a solar and wind business.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.950
It has a large business
in the United States.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.660
We had never been within
the solar business

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.100
before, largely because
everyone was building it,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.870
and the stock
markets were trading

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.460
at above replacement cost.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.530
But it got into
financial trouble,

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.030
and we were able to buy it at
60% or 70% of replacement cost.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.120
And with that, we think
the returns going forward

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.880
will be significant.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.100
In 2014, we bought a number
of office parks in India

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.370
after having been in
India for a lot of years

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.150
observing what went on and
not making any investments.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.640
And these office parks we
bought probably at 40% to 50%

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.960
of replacement cost,
which only because

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.590
of the structure and the
scarcity of capital that

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.900
was in the country at
that point in time.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.370
Fourth, the greatest
mistakes, as opposed

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.440
to the greatest
opportunities, the greatest

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.920
mistakes in real
asset investing,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.260
in particular in real
estate and infrastructure

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.250
have been made by those
misfinanced their assets.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.140
Leverage is a phenomenal thing,
because these type of assets

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.140
are easily financed with
2/3 of the capital, which

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.020
means you have 100% of
an asset working for you

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.720
and only 33% or 40% of
the equity invested.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.780
That's an amazing--
there are very few

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.550
things in the world
that you can leverage

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.110
in that fashion prudently.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.610
But one must do it prudently
with term financing

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.810
and ensure that you can
survive the market downturns.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.850
Many, many people
bought great assets

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.860
and lost them due to that, which
I'll give you an example here.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.720
We bought General Growth
Properties in 2009

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.390
out of bankruptcy.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.190
We bought some more in 2014.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.980
And we just are in
the midst of hoping

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.950
to take it private next month.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.070
The instructive point here
is that in 2009 this company

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.130
was one of the great retail
mall companies in America.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.440
And it misfinanced.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.130
And the only reason the
opportunity was available to us

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.750
to buy it at that point in time
is because the former owners

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.320
misfinanced the business.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.350
It otherwise would never
have been available.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.780
And in fact, no other
company in the US

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.540
had been available
before that for 15 years

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.790
and probably won't be
now for another 15 years.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.800
The greatest thing that
indicates to us its the time

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.450
to buy assets that we buy is
that when capital is scarce

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:21.330
it generally indicates
it's the right time to buy.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.570
So we look around
the world trying

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.770
to find the opportunities
where capital is scarce,

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:33.810
capital has runaway, and we
have people that can enable us

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.350
to action opportunities.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:43.890
In 2016, we bought a
graphite electrode company

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.900
in the United States
out of bankruptcy.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.970
It has plants all
over the world.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:55.830
And this company
provides the consumable

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.270
to melt steel in
the United States.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.490
And at that time,
the steel market

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.280
was incredibly under stress.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.491
But we were able to purchase
it, and it was really only

00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:11.490
because there was nobody
else in the market that

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.000
would put capital into the steel
industry at that point in time.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.630
Subsequent to this, we
reorganized the business.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.290
We've now taken it public at
eight times the price that we

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.400
paid.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:29.520
And it trades-- it's
listed on New York today.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.460
We try with all of
this never to be

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.580
too positive or too negative.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:42.720
And I would just say the
news media and stories always

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:48.810
project in our view information
to the positive too positive

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.210
and to the negative
too negative.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:56.010
So when one reads those
papers and the information

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:01.450
on the internet, you have
to be able to distill that.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.130
And what we try
to do is never be

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.620
too positive or too negative.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.080
And I'll just use
a small example.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.320
We bought this metallurgical
coal facility in 2009

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.310
in a bankruptcy.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.400
It's an amazing facility.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.570
It's shipped 85
million tons, which

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.850
I think is the largest
facility in the world

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:27.230
of metallurgical coal for steel
making to Korea, Japan, India,

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.630
China.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.710
It's in Northeast Australia.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.630
And two years
before, the company

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.320
that owned it before we
bought it paid 1 and 1/2

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.030
times its replacement cost.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.250
We bought it for 0.75
replacement cost.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.250
The fact is the only
thing that changed

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.430
is that they were too positive
at the time they bought it

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.330
about what was going on.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.780
And we were able to buy
it because we weren't

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.160
too negative about
what was happening

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.170
when we made the investment.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.010
So that's always what we're
trying to balance when

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.140
we're looking at investments.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:08.440
And lastly, I just say that
what the rest is just execution,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.490
execution, and execution.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:16.270
And these are difficult
businesses to operate.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:23.830
But generally, if you work hard,
you can earn decent returns.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.810
We just bought a
business in the United

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:31.660
States out of a bankruptcy
called Westinghouse.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.570
It services nuclear
plants around the world.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.780
And the whole story
here will be how

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:42.460
do we remake the business over
the next three to five years.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.440
And it will be about execution.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.110
So often we get asked-- that
sounds like a positive story--

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.860
what about what's hard?

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.240
And I would just say
we make many mistakes.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.140
It's not possible in investing
not to make mistakes.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:07.810
So everyone at Google should
remember that every mistake,

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.380
you just have to
keep making them.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.040
So we try to limit the
amount of mistakes--

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.380
or we try to not limit
the amount of mistakes,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:20.380
we try to limit the effect of
what the mistakes we make are.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.830
And some of those things are
we've done that are wrong,

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:32.770
sometimes we have got seduced
by a bad business cheaply.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.770
That's a mistake in what we do.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:40.210
Sometimes we started too large
in a new business or a market.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.950
Sometimes we got the
compensation incentive

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.260
plans wrong.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.490
Sometimes we weren't as strict
on the financial covenants

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.550
in an up market, because
what happens in an up market

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.560
and the things that
we do is everyone

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.980
wants to lend you money.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.000
And they'll lend it
to with covenants,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.580
which are freely available.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.380
And you need to be
very careful with that.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.930
And lastly,
sometimes we've taken

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.280
on an undue development
risk in new jurisdictions

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.110
or unstable ones.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.910
And I'd just say those are the
things we've made our mistakes.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:23.200
None of them have been
damaging enough to the company.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.220
And we try to learn
from those all the time.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.970
And I'd say the world in what
we do is always changing,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.320
as it is for everyone here.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.350
And I like to use this slide.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:41.170
This is Dubai in 1991,
which I did happen to go to.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.800
And it looked like that.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.940
And this is Dubai, as
you all know, in 2018.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.100
And the little slide
in the bottom right

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.750
is ICD Brookfield Place.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.590
So we're actually building a
large office complex there,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.960
an amazing office complex.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.940
But it's amazing what
changes in the world.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.610
And I like to look at those two
slides every once in a while.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.760
And it just tells
you that the world

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.510
continues to grow and evolve.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:15.050
And what we like to focus on is
that change brings opportunity.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:19.120
And I'll mention four
related to our business.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.200
There are significant,
we believe, retail

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200
real estate opportunities
and the integration

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.530
with retail and the internet.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:35.451
And because of that, it's one
of the most hated industries

00:29:35.451 --> 00:29:35.950
today.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.620
And we think that there will
be a significant opportunity

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.670
over the next 10, 15
years because of that.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.890
Second, we're a participant
in the renewable power

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:50.830
industry with scaling up
our production capacity.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.660
The industry has
changed dramatically

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.900
over the past 10 years.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.836
And we think as one
of the leading players

00:29:58.836 --> 00:30:00.210
in the industry
we can capitalize

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.380
on that in a significant way.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.400
Third, natural gas because
of technology and fracking

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.050
became very cheap, in
particular in North America.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:17.280
And as a result of that, it
has totally changed industries.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.030
It's brought chemicals
back to America.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:25.020
It has reversed
pipelines that used

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.320
to go-- we reversed a pipeline
that went from south to north

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.290
is now going north to south.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.940
And it's changed industries
across North America,

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.330
and that's going to
continue globally.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.910
And lastly, we think
there are a number of--

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.640
and you're experts
at this here--

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.550
but we think there's a number
of real asset technologies

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.900
that we can deploy within
our economy of Brookfield

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.970
to be able to make operational
improvements and enhancements

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.290
within the business.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:07.270
So to sum up, I'll leave you
with six points of just where

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.690
we're thinking as a summary.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:16.390
But we think generally,
as you and as you put this

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.130
into your thinking
on investing, we

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.590
think that interest
rates are going

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.660
to stay in a low-ish band.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.550
That doesn't mean
they're staying the same.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:29.000
It means they're staying
in a low-ish band of rates.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.490
Two, we think that institutional
funds will continue to grow

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.040
and that that capital
will be available

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.350
for further privatizations
in the stock market

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.520
and investing globally.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.470
And that will continue to
drive business investments

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.970
around the world.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:53.690
These capitals are heading
to north of $80 trillion,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.830
which is very, very
sizable amounts of money.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.680
Our suggestion to
anybody that's investing

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:09.130
is to invest long term and
try to capitalize on the fact

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.180
that most people
don't invest long term

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.300
and often want liquidity
within their assets

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.070
that they invest in.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:23.230
And there should be a premium
for that if you can capture it.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.030
Fifth, opportunity
clearly lies in our view

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.280
where the sheep are not going.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.250
So try to be where
others are not.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.780
And it doesn't feel
good often, sometimes

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.200
for long periods of time.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.980
But in the end, it's
often extremely lucrative.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.560
And the last, the
wealth that can

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:55.240
be generated through compounding
of returns is significant.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.800
And I'm going to end on this
slide for the presentation.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.260
And I just say the
most amazing thing

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:13.710
that the investment world has
is the compounding of return.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.810
And when I say that
it's arithmetically

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.400
the compounding of
interest returns

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.110
is what everyone understands.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.480
But the compounding of
returns with businesses,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:29.110
if you can do it exponential
numbers or at larger numbers,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:35.320
the numbers go exponential, as
all you mathematicians know.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.240
It's amazing what
it accomplishes

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.150
if you can not make mistakes--

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.910
too many mistakes or lose
capital on the way through--

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.070
and you just keep
compounding a return.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.030
And it really is
an amazing concept

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.510
in the world of investing.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.600
And not that many people
pay attention to it.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.190
So I would suggest
for you is to continue

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:01.120
to buy great investments
and hold them and compound.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.750
Don't pay taxes by selling them.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.739
And don't look for fashion
when you make them.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:12.760
So with that I would
be pleased to take

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.155
any questions if there are any.

00:34:15.155 --> 00:34:18.487
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.710
PRANESH SRINIVASA: Thank you.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.780
Thank you, Bruce, for
that wonderful, wonderful

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.780
presentation.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.062
So I had a few people email
me in questions who are

00:34:30.062 --> 00:34:31.270
in different parts of Google.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.270
And I thought we could
run through some of these

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.159
and then take questions
from the audience.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.650
The first one is really
about your journey.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.340
I think we've heard Mr. Bruce
Flatt, CEO of Brookfield

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.900
but what about Mr.
Bruce Flatt the person?

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.040
So you started off as an
accountant from Manitoba.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.370
And "Forbes" recently called
you the toll collector

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.969
of the 21st century.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.940
So from your personal
viewpoint, what

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.980
are some events that have
shaped your career, first

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.730
at Brascan and then
later at Brookfield?

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:11.510
BRUCE FLATT: Look, I would
just say you either get lucky

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.480
or you make your own
luck during your life.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:21.560
I got lucky in that I met
some people at the predecessor

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.970
to Brookfield.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.020
We had a small company.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.520
We started the business.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.070
And 30 years later, we've
been doing exactly what

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.050
we started 30 years ago.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.690
And so I think if you can find--

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.090
I think the greatest
success with people

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:48.320
is if you can find
something that you

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.660
do which you're passionate
about, you will be successful.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.970
And I was passionate about
building the business

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.950
we had at Brookfield.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.380
And therefore, we've been
relatively successful

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.110
over the 30 years, and we've
had a lot of fun doing it.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.190
So I would just--

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:15.470
this is to talk
about how you invest

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.140
in the strategy for investing,
and I think probably the number

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.350
one is just do things that
you're passionate about

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.280
and find businesses
you're passionate about.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.022
And so that's really
been my story.

00:36:27.022 --> 00:36:28.730
PRANESH SRINIVASA: So
if we could go back

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.700
from when you joined
Brookfield, say in 1990

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.190
as Brascan, and
with what you know

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.640
today what is one
mistake, just one,

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.760
that you wish you could go
back and correct or fix,

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.437
if there is one?

00:36:42.437 --> 00:36:43.520
BRUCE FLATT: There's many.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.510
There isn't just one.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:52.460
I would say, look, we are
sitting here at Google

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.410
and after having spent
the morning with you

00:36:54.410 --> 00:37:00.480
and your colleagues, I
think 25, 30 years ago,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.950
we probably should have
paid more attention to what

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.350
was going on in technology.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.790
And not because we're--

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.640
look, we think the business
we have is phenomenal.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.900
But I think we could
have been more aware

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.110
and built other things
within the business

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.600
if we were more
aware of technology.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.375
If we would had more
businesses in San Francisco--

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:26.000
probably, you know,
our office business

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.820
is very broad across
the United States--

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.220
we would have been here and
we would have done more.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.710
And we're doing it today
and we're learning.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.850
But I'd say that's the one thing
we probably should have been

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.740
more aware of 30 years ago.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.450
Now, maybe lots of
people say that.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:47.407
But we had the capacity
to do it and didn't do it.

00:37:47.407 --> 00:37:49.490
PRANESH SRINIVASA: So I
think in your presentation

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.440
there were three
themes that shown.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.630
One was value and buying value.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.360
The other was incentives.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.530
And the last was patience.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.750
And I think I want to just focus
on that last part a little bit.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.320
Your investment team
is over 1,000 people.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.300
And you've had
offices in countries

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.550
where you've not done a
single deal for over a decade.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.890
How do you inculcate
and incentivize

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.790
patients in your investment
managers across the world?

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:18.140
And how do you think
about it personally?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.880
BRUCE FLATT: Yes, so,
look, it's difficult.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.240
The most difficult thing about
all businesses is people.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.310
And the second thing
is about people.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.120
And getting compensation
and incentives right

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.477
are a very important
thing out of all of that.

00:38:36.477 --> 00:38:37.810
And it doesn't mean, everything.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.930
In fact, it's not everything.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.320
If you don't have a
great company to work at

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.690
and people aren't passionate
about what they do

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.110
and where the company is
going, compensation generally

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.190
doesn't matter.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:52.650
Having said that, if you
get compensation not done

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:57.760
correctly, then it
can be a problem.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.770
And so we try to
make sure that if we

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:06.510
have new regions that people
are compensated across a broader

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.180
organization so that they're
not forced to do transactions.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.580
And in general, that's how we
operate our whole business.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.750
And we have four main sectors;
property, infrastructure,

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.980
renewables, private equity.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.850
But there are 10
businesses or 15 businesses

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.570
within those entities.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.070
And we're in 30
different countries.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.322
So you can move capital
different places.

00:39:31.322 --> 00:39:33.030
And you have to make
we have to make sure

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.790
that people aren't
incented to do dumb things,

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.180
because they were
compensated that way.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.570
So we spent a lot
of time to make

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.247
sure we get the
alignment correctly.

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:44.080
PRANESH SRINIVASA:
Another write-in question

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.090
that I had from a few
people was about what advice

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.200
you would have for them in
residential or multi-family

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.120
or small real
estate, real estate

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.790
that individuals could go
purchase, maybe with some debt.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.750
And broadly, the
questions are all along

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.020
themes of where are places
you would recommend currently

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.620
in the US?

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.350
What kind of debt
financing would you

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.780
be looking at if you're
doing this individually?

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.280
And the third is, what
does forever mean?

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.460
BRUCE FLATT: OK, those
are tough questions.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.210
So here's what I would say.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.600
There's one thing-- and I'll
make just a broad observation--

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.440
the one thing that we see
everywhere in the world,

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:36.430
and it covers most of the
things you just mentioned--

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.845
is that there's a massive
50-year urbanization going on

00:40:41.845 --> 00:40:42.920
in the planet.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.570
And we're seeing it everywhere.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.470
And this is not just
happening in China and India.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.710
It's happening
everywhere in the world.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:56.420
Vacancy in downtown
Sydney is 1% today.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:02.080
And the reason it's 1% is
because any tertiary class

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:08.680
b bad hotel or office
building is being torn down

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.780
and being built as residential.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.500
So the vacancy is
1% in office space

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.380
because people are
coming downtown.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.830
Young people don't want
to live in the suburbs.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.510
They want to live downtown.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.170
So what's happening is there's
this massive urbanization going

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.110
on.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:31.840
So I would just say
that for people buying

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.350
residential real estate,
go back to the principles

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.910
of real asset investing.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:40.240
Buy great real estate
in cities which

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.490
are going to be part of the
21st century, 22nd century,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.280
and will grow over
time and where

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.940
young people want to live.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.679
And if you do that, over
the fullness of time,

00:41:53.679 --> 00:41:54.970
I don't think you can go wrong.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:05.200
To your question on
patience, often people

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.690
are buying and selling things.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.300
And the problem with real
estate and the problem

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.340
with real assets is that these
things don't go like this.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.660
They go like this.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.840
And often when it's
time to buy and people

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.350
get excited about buying,
it's the wrong time to buy.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.230
It will be fine in
the fullness of time,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.400
because if you're in
downtown San Francisco,

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.440
I'm quite positive
that 10 years from now,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.310
20 years from now, 30 years from
now, those values are going up.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:37.190
But there may be periods of
time where you have to sell.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.250
And on the financing
point, I'd just

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:45.940
say make sure that whatever
financing you put in place

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.100
can be serviced so
that you're never

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.120
forced to be able to sell
that property at the time

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.980
when you don't want to sell it.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.290
Other than that,
leverage, debt financing

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.770
is a phenomenal thing.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.430
And leverage is these type
of assets and leverages

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:06.070
it prudently.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.986
There are very few assets
you can go to a bank

00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:10.000
and get 2/3 financed on.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.520
It's not easily done with
many other things, especially

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.500
individuals.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.920
Just make sure that people
don't get themselves

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.500
into trouble that way.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.250
PRANESH SRINIVASA: And
before I open it up

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.749
for the audience,
one final question

00:43:22.749 --> 00:43:25.180
that we ask all our guests,
what advice would you

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.690
give the young person
who is probably listening

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.970
to this right here today
in the room or on YouTube

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.082
across the world to get
the magic of compounding

00:43:34.082 --> 00:43:34.790
working for them?

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.740
BRUCE FLATT: Brookfield's
ticker symbol is a BAM.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:48.970
Look, I would just say that
the miracle of compounding

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.540
can be found almost in any--

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.480
it can be found in index funds.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.450
You're not going to compound
to the highest return

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.590
if you buy an index fund.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.090
But if you buy an
index fund, you're

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.490
just buying the stock
market of America.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.650
You will earn 7%
over the longer term.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:07.630
The problem is most
people invest this month.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.850
And then they decide, well,
it went down, I should sell.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.990
And if it went up, normally
they say, wow, this is exciting.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.030
I made some money.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.470
And they keep it.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.750
And they sell at
the wrong times.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:24.220
So the miracle of compounding
is just sticking with it.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.690
It's almost like
anything in life.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:26.740
It's like business.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.040
It's like your
individual relationships.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.809
It's like anything.

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:33.100
You just have to stick with it.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:38.620
And it's patience and
sticking with things.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.180
So I would just--
you know, I really

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.790
think that's probably the
most important thing of making

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.230
sure compounding works.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.350
PRANESH SRINIVASA: Thank
you so much, Mr. Flatt.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.574
Questions from the audience?

00:44:48.574 --> 00:44:50.365
You can line up in
front of the yellow mic.

00:44:50.365 --> 00:44:54.430
AUDIENCE: I have a question
on buying properties.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.260
I mean, when you
buy a property, you

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.020
intend to operate in
a manner that's better

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.240
than the original owner, right?

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.500
So if you're buying property
from a mom and pop shop,

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.960
then obviously you can bring
a lot of expertise in there.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.280
But if you buy something from--
let's say you acquire GGP,

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.340
what kind of value can you
bring to the properties that GGP

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:19.110
cannot do it today?

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:24.210
BRUCE FLATT: So our
general strategy

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:29.640
is to either buy for value
when other people aren't

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.150
going to that investment.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.170
And I'd say the number one
thing today with respect

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.020
to retail is that retail
is one of the more

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.960
heated sectors in investing
today in the world.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.310
Everyone thinks that
everything will be sold online

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:48.330
and street retail
won't be the place.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.470
So one of the reasons
we're buying it is that.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:57.810
Second, we often try to operate
things better than others.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.780
With respect to GGP, I'm
not sure that's the case.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.450
They have a first class
operating platform.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.350
In fact, we'll be
adopting that platform.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.020
But the real value
that we see in that

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.680
is something that can't be done
within a retail real estate

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.030
company.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.550
And that's that these are--

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.630
what it owns is a
125 100-acre parcels

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:26.550
of land in the middle of each
of the cities in the United

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.520
States, in major cities
in the United States.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.160
And those acreages
can be developed

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.430
into many, many other things.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.760
And we have the skills
to be able to add

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.790
multi-family apartments and
condominiums and storage

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.120
and industrial and other
uses to those sites, which

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.500
couldn't be done within GGP.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.159
And we do all
those other things.

00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:49.950
So that's really with
a value add that will

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.892
bring to this acquisition.

00:46:55.356 --> 00:46:56.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Bruce.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.240
Thanks for the insightful
discussion today.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.580
I work for Google's
data centers.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:06.170
And I wanted to congratulate
you for the AT&amp;T data center

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.960
deal a few weeks back.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.070
My question is, over the past
two years, what we have seen

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:17.380
is data centers have really
become an asset class in itself

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.760
within the TMD space.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.840
But Brookfield is a little
late to the party, I believe.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.340
What do you think is the
hypothesis for data centers

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.440
being an asset class in itself?

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.990
And what would be
some of the risks

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.860
that you think in acquiring a
data center like an AT&amp;T data

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.380
center.

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.720
BRUCE FLATT: OK,
so first, this is

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.110
an amateur talking to an
expert about data centers.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.900
So I'm not sure what
advice I can give you.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.130
But I would say back to the
question on what mistakes

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.710
did we have over the years,
not getting into technology.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:59.850
We're the largest real
estate owner in the planet.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.170
We don't own data centers.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.550
And we probably should have
been in data centers before.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.110
And if we had focused
more on technology,

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.200
we would have been there.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.180
Look, I guess what
I would say broadly

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:15.780
is we think the sector of
delivery of data infrastructure

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.140
to people is we're not late.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.490
This is going to be-- the growth
of the data infrastructure

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.730
sector over the next 15,
20 years as more and more

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.230
data is delivered is going
to be very significant.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:35.010
And between fiber to
the home, data centers,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.600
and all of that,
that whole sector,

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.930
we think there's enormous
amounts of capital that

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.170
need to be deployed in there.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:46.245
And so we're just we're getting
smarter within those sectors.

00:48:50.519 --> 00:48:51.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.040
I'm Nata.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.440
Thank you for the talk.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.170
What are your views on
investing in Bitcoin?

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:05.990
BRUCE FLATT: So I don't really
have any comments on it.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.600
I don't understand it.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.850
And we would never invest in it.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:14.330
And I actually don't
think it's an investment.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.160
I think it's a product
that delivers money

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.470
from one place to another.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.420
It's an alternative to cash.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.040
Some people may want to use it.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.940
It doesn't fit in our
realm of investing.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.560
It wouldn't be considered
an investable asset.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.780
But good luck to those
who are investing into it.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.974
Thank you.

00:49:43.974 --> 00:49:45.360
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.540
What's are thesis with
regards to active management

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.776
of your acquisitions, be it
real estate or businesses?

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.550
BRUCE FLATT: To the
asset management of it?

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.140
AUDIENCE: Yes, so like when
you purchase general growth

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.150
or build a mall,
are you coming in

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.670
and kind of taking a very active
approach to the management

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.250
of those assets?

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:12.170
What's your thought
process within that?

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:16.590
BRUCE FLATT: Yes, so
our businesses, we

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:19.950
have 1,500 investment people.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.590
But then there's 75,000,
80,000 people down

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.200
below that operate the assets.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.340
So most of the things we
do we actively operate.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:33.660
And we're doing things
with all those people

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.830
once we buy an asset.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.470
Sometimes we adopt the people,
and we're integrating them

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.360
into our business.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.050
Once in a while we're
just a financial investor

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.120
into something because
somebody brought us in

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.820
and the reason for us to come in
was that we could provide them

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.750
capital.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:51.240
But most things we
do are quite active.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.810
And we think the lion's
share of the return we get

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.460
isn't from a
financial return, it's

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:02.860
from an asset intensive return
by operating assets better.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my question
is regarding the real estate

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.660
opportunities here in
the Silicon Valley area

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.900
where are we have a huge
demand of residential

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.330
and not as much
investment I think.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.930
What do you see as
future opportunities?

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:23.730
BRUCE FLATT: Going back to my
comment on general residential,

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:29.880
I would say this is the center
of technology, Silicon Valley.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.750
And as a result of
that, this market,

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:39.790
I think in the longer term,
will be extremely good.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:42.060
There may be times--

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.980
2009 would have
been the better time

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.200
to buy a house in
California than it is today.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.480
That's not to say that values
won't be a lot higher 10 years

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:50.980
from now.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.060
Now, there are
always ups and downs.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.750
And this time, I don't
think real estate is going

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.010
to cause the next recession.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:00.510
Therefore, I don't
think we're going

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.480
to see the same mess
in housing in America

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.220
that we saw last
cycle, 2008-2009.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.700
That's not to say that housing
can't go down in every market.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.470
What this micro market
has going for it

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:21.360
is a lot of
well-paying jobs, which

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.727
will be an underpinning
of the residential market

00:52:23.727 --> 00:52:24.810
for a long period of time.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.890
And I don't think
they're going anywhere.

00:52:30.057 --> 00:52:31.890
PRANESH SRINIVASA: What
a delightful talking

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:32.560
presentation.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.930
Thank you so much, Mr. Flatt.

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:34.530
Thank you.

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:37.880
[APPLAUSE]
