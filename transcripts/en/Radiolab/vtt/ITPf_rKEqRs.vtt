00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.930
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, and today

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.630
we're going to begin in a place. Robert, come in here. Oh,

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.890
oh my God. A place full of wonderful things.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.970
This is the actual lead that Hinton and Perry used to first go to the North

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.440
Pole. These are Napoleon's books and his conquest to Egypt.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.960
Look at the antlers over there. So wait, where?

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.240
Where are you exactly before I tell you that, let me just explain something.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.930
My wife and I, Hey, tame. I have been having an argument for roughly,

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.610
it's going on now 40 years.

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.770
And it's always about a things like objects, like objects. Yeah. So as you know,

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.130
you have a thing about things you give me like an autograph,

12
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.370
like an Abraham Lincoln autograph, I think. Okay. Yeah.

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
Blink and stood in front of this very piece of paper in order to write his

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.210
signature in this very way,

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.340
he had to be standing exactly where I'm standing and therefore he and I share

16
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.000
this space.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.440
I literally believe that I am standing in Abraham Lincoln Shadow.

18
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:04.250
So to touch an Abraham Lincoln autograph is a form of time travel,

19
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:08.780
a form of love. It's all those things, and I can do that without even blinking,

20
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.210
right? Tamar, not at all,

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.010
but also Robert Sense of the magic of it extends to, we have a really,

22
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:19.550
really ugly floor lamp from a long time ago,

23
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.120
and every time I would say enough already, let's get rid of,

24
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.360
if you think it's older than me, I've had it all my life,

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.790
which makes it beautiful. Now you don't have that at all.

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.380
I don't have that at all. So in honor of our topic today,

27
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.470
I decided that we're going to settle this argument once and for all.

28
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.140
I took Tamar to the explorers club right here in Manhattan. Oh wait,

29
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:41.920
what's the explorers club?

30
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a a little a private club where explorers deposit things that they

31
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.630
collected.

32
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.980
Everything in this building has some historical significance in some sense.

33
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.920
That's real. Roseman their executive director, he gave us a tour.

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.810
This is the actual bell from the SS Roosevelt when Pairing Hanson first went to

35
00:01:58.811 --> 00:01:59.644
the North Pole.

36
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
<v 0>Very cool. But not matching. Doesn't cut it.</v>

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.630
The chair over there belonged to the emperor storage of China. The last emperor,

39
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.190
his wife at cheer there. He points to it looks like a little desk chair.

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.460
The embers tower. China sat in it. Yeah,

41
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:20.270
that was her chair is make you want to sit in it. Yes, yes, yes. I wouldn't.

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.430
You shouldn't at first she sits nothing.

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You feel nothing but just close your eyes and imagine that you are the last

44
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.750
emperor skinny,

45
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:36.610
hugely long line of Chinese Enbridge's going back probably a thousand years.

46
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
I would order them to make more comfortable chairs. Wait, not, don't,

47
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.180
don't get up yet. Just give it a chance.

48
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.430
There's nothing that's going to seep into me. There is.

49
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.970
There isn't a, I dunno man. Look, look, this was never going to be easy.

50
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.260
Tamar is a New York Times reporter. Very reasonable, very sensible. After all,

51
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:59.080
it was just the chairs. It was just the beginning. I they have things in this.

52
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.660
I was going to break her step by step.

53
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.620
We'll walk us to the next room where they had pieces of fabric that would frame

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.150
on display racks of, you know,

55
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:15.151
early planes were made out of canvas and these are actual pieces of those early

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.100
planes. Here's the Wright brothers plane. What do you mean?

57
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.020
You mean this is the fabric from the actual first? Absolutely. Oh Man.

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.750
There was a small brown piece of fabric.

59
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.751
Not much larger than your fist was cut from the wheat of their first airplane.

60
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.350
So the wind, the wind

61
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.060
rushed over that little piece of fabric for the first time. Yeah.

62
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.110
Very cool. Very interesting.

63
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.820
Happy to see you when you're standing next to the fabric that lifted into the

64
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:47.660
sky for the first time in America,

65
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.560
you don't feel just a touch closer to over and over, right.

66
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.220
Not even a time I feel. What a wonderful collection. How interesting.

67
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.020
It's amazing. I mean, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. It's amazing. And Tamar,

68
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.220
do I feel that? No. So, okay.

69
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.150
I wasn't trying to pick it. Something that quite incorrect.

70
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.680
He's trying to pull out the big guns.

71
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.020
I don't see how you can get bigger than what you already offered. Well,

72
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.110
there's more there, right? Yeah.

73
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.040
Maybe this will convince you.

74
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
This is an actual flag and explorers club flag that accompanied Buzz Aldrin.

75
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.670
Neil Armstrong,

76
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.810
when they first landed on the moon in 1969 oh,

77
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.060
so this is one of these

78
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830
that that piece of cloth right there it is. Yeah. It was on the moon.

79
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.491
Absolutely.

80
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:41.350
It was carried by Neil Armstrong when he first landed on the moon in 1969 oh my

81
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.340
God. It was in a little glass box.

82
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:49.860
You could see it was a royal blue explorers club flag.

83
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.610
Very small. Probably made of silk that let her touch it. Yeah, I can.

84
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.610
You know what I, I, I'll have hit that. Let's have her touch the flag.

85
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.000
That was the first flag I were ever on the day that humans got onto the moon.

86
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.490
Let you think. I will shoot every nation with all the way sparks yes.

87
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.280
In my body. And so you a special, yes. Yes.

88
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.400
Okay. We opened up the cabinet. You've now got it in your hands.

89
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.020
Okay, go ahead. All right.

90
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.690
It feels very nice. It feels like it's a little fun. This was on the moon? Yes.

91
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.690
This was on the moon. Brought there by the people who from our planet.

92
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:33.510
The first people ever to land on the moon and they brought this with them. Yes.

93
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.510
That's it again. Okay. You had it. Well, I'm going to touch it. Okay. Alright,

94
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:42.720
here I go. Do you need right? Oh Man.

95
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.620
<v 2>[inaudible] coming down the ladder now.</v>

96
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.700
<v 0>I see. Okay.</v>

97
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.330
<v 2>A form of spare per man,</v>

98
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.440
<v 0>Andy Red attach it. I mean, I'm pretty pumped to it.</v>

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 3>I'm fine about, or Tim or you don't</v>

100
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.920
<v 0>get any of this smell? I don't get a swoon. How could you make it?</v>

101
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.440
There's room for me. I don't get as far as the first trip to the moon.

102
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.300
I know they send shivers up my spine. I mean, I don't have it.

103
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.140
I just, I don't have it, so I got to go to work, so, okay.

104
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.780
Total tree. That was our pleasure. Thanks so much for counting you.

105
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.330
You lose.

106
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.520
Maybe she's just open to the future.

107
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.340
She doesn't want to have to carry all that baggage. Then you came right.

108
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.760
You know you, that's what you're going into. A swoon about a lamp.

109
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:40.650
That's clearly an ugly ass lamps throughout the website. Give me an old lamp.

110
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.110
Let's let, let's be available to the new labs of the world.

111
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.070
I'm not cheating to admit or even consider anything you just said,

112
00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:50.730
except that you're probably right about the future. I inpatient.

113
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.970
Do you know what else I'm right about what?

114
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.040
Every story that we have in this hours.

115
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.500
Basically that argument you just had with your wife in story form. Yeah, object.

116
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.980
In each of these stories there is a thing and the thing beckons or not

117
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.800
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

118
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.740
<v 3>today on radio lab things.</v>

119
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.620
Everybody say something. Hello? Oh, hello. Hello. All right,

120
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:21.650
so where are we doing? Well, um, we're talking about objects, I believe. Yeah.

121
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.270
And I understand you guys are kicking around some ideas,

122
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.410
but it seems my ideas are in a bit of a different orbit than yours are.

123
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.980
Maybe there's a connection. Yeah. I don't know that we have an orbit yet.

124
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:34.900
I think we've launched, you're just sort of like, okay.

125
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:38.710
So our first story comes from a TV producer, Vin Liotta,

126
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.040
longtime DV Guy who um,

127
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.030
connected up with us because it turns out he is making a documentary about this

128
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:46.864
very thing.

129
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.960
People's connection to objects by my interest in objects is things that sort of

130
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:57.560
have accidentally gotten meaning for even even if you have a little scrap of

131
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.050
something that's gone to the moon and back,

132
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.130
it's nothing compared to Rick Rollins, sugar egg,

133
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.600
Rick Rollins sugar and Rick Rollins. Rick Sugar Egg. Yes.

134
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.680
Actually the story he wants to tell us has three parts. It's about a candy egg,

135
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.300
a box, and a tree. A candy egg box.

136
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.310
And the tree. Yeah. So this is what I would suggest is I have some clips,

137
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.570
some short clips, and I'd like to sort of weave the clips together, sort of get,

138
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:29.630
maybe throw it out that way rather than telling you about them. Uh,

139
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.550
why don't we, why don't we try? I see we're dealing with a storyteller. Yeah,

140
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.470
let's, we'll wait until you hear the clips. So, okay. Let me just play a clip.

141
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:43.000
This is like a short clip. This is just an intro to Rick. I love this box.

142
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.150
Wow. It's beautiful that the size of a shirt box it's made out of maple.

143
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.490
Very light in color. Very delicate.

144
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.310
And he keeps his most treasured objects in it. One of them is this sugar

145
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.040
<v 5>egg that we were talking about. Not a real egg. No,</v>

146
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.530
it's a molded sugar.

147
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:06.210
It's hollow in a center light yellow something someone might eat.

148
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.370
Um, someone might eat it. I, I have not eaten it. I um,

149
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.940
I've saved it since 1970 when I was given the sake

150
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.950
<v 3>since 1970. What? He saved it. This is an editable egg.</v>

151
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:23.450
This is an editable egg. Yes. They edible. If you kept it from 1970,

152
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.370
it looks remarkably good for dissolved and under the weight of time.

153
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:32.810
And it's, and I know apparently it's a, well, it's pristine.

154
00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:35.690
I've seen it as a sugar egg. What is that?

155
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.460
Apparently it's a half of an egg. It's hollow. It's made out of sugar.

156
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.980
And you would put things like jelly beans in it.

157
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.750
You seal the edges with frosting and then you decorate the outside of it.

158
00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:51.410
So there must've been some, a reason why he,

159
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.280
he has memorialized this. Oh, I'm glad you mentioned it.

160
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:57.570
I just happened to have another clip to play.

161
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.090
Imagine my surprise the day that we were to leave. Oh wait.

162
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.970
Can we stop for a second? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. You know what,

163
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.480
I didn't set it up because, um,

164
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.560
one of the things I have to say about Rick was when he was a kid,

165
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.290
his family moved around a lot.

166
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.680
Apparently Rick's dad did a lot of work for the government.

167
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:17.770
So almost every year he would find himself in a totally different town.

168
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.660
And to make things worse, he was a very shy kid, kept to himself a lot.

169
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.160
So for Rick, friendship just often seemed impossible,

170
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.650
but then says there was this one moment when he was eight, they,

171
00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:33.970
they lived in Washington state only for a year.

172
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And he found himself in a dilemma because he had finally made a friend and his

173
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:44.650
friend David invited him to a birthday party.

174
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.420
<v 5>But it happened to be that, uh,</v>

175
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.450
his birthday party was scheduled the very day that we were to move again.

176
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.320
So my father was once,

177
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:58.370
once again transferred this time from Washington back to Idaho.

178
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.880
And my parents had decided that I couldn't attend the birthday party because

179
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:05.390
there wasn't time. So the moving van was sitting there,

180
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:09.020
everybody was ready to go. And I don't think I, I even asked my parents,

181
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:10.940
I don't think they know that I left,

182
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.380
but I took off and I ran up the street to David's house.

183
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.850
I still can picture this moment. I,

184
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.870
his house was a brick house and he had a large porch that was completely empty.

185
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:28.730
And I know that I paused there even though I was only eight,

186
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.970
I must've known that our friendship really wasn't at the point where it demanded

187
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:38.090
a good buy, especially if that meant that I had to interrupt his birthday party.

188
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.090
But I rang the doorbell and his mother answered the door and I remember seeing

189
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.860
basically from her knees down and beyond her into the back of the house,

190
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:52.040
which was bright and loud where the party was going on.

191
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.670
And a few later David showed up.

192
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:59.620
He was kind of behind her and I don't remember seeing a word

193
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.720
you were just standing. I was just frozen in standing there,

194
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:07.830
completely embarrassed and not knowing why I had done this. And uh,

195
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.520
I was about to leave when David's mom apparently asked him to go get something

196
00:12:14.071 --> 00:12:16.980
and he left and a few seconds later returned and,

197
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.060
and handed me this yellow sugar egg.

198
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.420
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

199
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.040
<v 5>the very same thing here in your box. Yes.</v>

200
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.810
I walked back to my parents' house.

201
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:38.650
We were loaded into the back of their station wagon and we drove from there to

202
00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:43.220
Idaho. And I know that I held this in my hand the entire way.

203
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.560
Didn't let go of it.

204
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.230
I put it in a drawer and it is lived in various places for all these years.

205
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.960
Why? Yes. It begs the question, doesn't it?

206
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.101
You know,

207
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:06.020
the truth is I knew its importance immediately and it hasn't changed.

208
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.800
I looked at this egg and it was proof,

209
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.340
physical proof that I had been invited to a birthday party and that there was a

210
00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:21.551
hope of making a friendship and I held onto it because I needed that proof.

211
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:31.750
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

212
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.740
<v 5>that's actually very wonderful. Yeah. Yeah, but, but we, there's the tree,</v>

213
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:40.420
the tree. We did the box, we did the egg, but then there's the tree. Do we need,

214
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.270
do we need the tree of the egg? I'm all of, I'm, I'm, I'm,

215
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.420
I'm swept into the egg. No, I'm bring it together.

216
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.400
I'll bring the narrative threads together. I will more egg vid.

217
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.670
Give me more egg. We need to play the, the tree. So yeah. My,

218
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.620
my parents bought a home in Idaho. This is right after the egg incident.

219
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.360
Yeah. This is in the Snake River valley in Idaho. It's very flat.

220
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.440
It's very wide. Their new backyard was a barren landscape. So my family,

221
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.450
they started planting all kinds of things in the yard.

222
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:13.120
They planted apple trees and pine trees,

223
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.990
Cherry and amongst them was a,

224
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.160
a maple tree that was Rick's favorite.

225
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:23.190
It grew very quickly and it envelop the house in a certain way in the breeze.

226
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.100
It sounded like suede rubbed together just

227
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.730
amplified by hundreds of thousands of leads.

228
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:34.590
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.450
<v 5>it was beautiful. Rick lived there with his family for 10 years until college.</v>

230
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.480
I moved to Boston and I learned that my father had decided that the tree was

231
00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:49.710
planted too close to the house and that was, it would damage the foundation.

232
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.110
And he, he

233
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.443
<v 3>chopped it down.</v>

234
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.210
<v 5>It was a massacre. It was brutal. And, uh,</v>

235
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.110
I was very upset. And so my mother,

236
00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:07.111
knowing that she mailed me a package and I opened it to find that she had placed

237
00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:12.370
in it, some small sprouted seedlings from the original maple tree.

238
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.290
Rick dug a hole in the backyard and plopped it in the ground behind the garage

239
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.460
and it thrived. It grew really well. And within a number of years,

240
00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:25.330
it had grown to be a 30 foot tree. Reminded me,

241
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:29.650
obviously of the tree that I had loved and lost in Idaho.

242
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.360
And, uh, it became so large, unfortunately,

243
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:37.790
that it also caught the attention of my landlord who, uh,

244
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.783
tragically,

245
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.180
one night I got back from work to discover that he had chopped down the maple

246
00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:49.900
tree, the son of the son of the tree. Same Grizzly n well,

247
00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:54.901
you would think so I went out into the yard that night and I salvaged these

248
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:57.670
sections of the tree.

249
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.900
Rick gave the wood to a friend of furniture maker in Gloucester,

250
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:05.290
Massachusetts who turned it into a box. This box,

251
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.640
the one right here made from the maple. That grew from, you know the story.

252
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.020
Yeah. Wow. There's this continuity. I find such comfort from that.

253
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.850
So it in turn holds all these objects that have their own individual stories and

254
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:23.050
their own meaning to me. One of them is this yellow sugar egg,

255
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.940
<v 3>the egg, the tree in the box. That's nice. That's really nice, man. Very nice.</v>

256
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.320
Although, pardon me, it doesn't, it doesn't,

257
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.230
part of you want to smack Rick a little bit and be like, well no, you know,

258
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:38.040
I totally, okay. Is it a dream you're living in the past? No. God,

259
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.450
no. I actually don't, not me. Yeah.

260
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.900
We could put the box in a house weight made from the teeth of his dog with the

261
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:47.480
thing I would say. Okay. Yeah. Just keep loving like that.

262
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.680
Oh, how I wish we left it there. You know, some sort of the,

263
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.490
the thing about objects is that like you can't really experience them unless you

264
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.380
touch them and interact with them.

265
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:05.030
Like that's how you get the essence of what's in there. But at a certain point,

266
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:06.200
our producer, Lynn Levy,

267
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:10.040
who really produced the show had this great idea for an experiment that we could

268
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:14.210
do where we would make three d printed versions of the objects and the stories

269
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.620
and then public an exhibit where people can come and see them while they listen

270
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:19.341
to the audio.

271
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:23.090
Or even if they have access to a three d printer or they could just print a

272
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.540
version wherever they are. So we asked Rick if we could scan his egg.

273
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.450
I'm not sure what will happen, but I thought it was an intriguing idea.

274
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.390
He was game. So Lyndon found a place that does that near him.

275
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.580
We asked him to bring his, the egg in technician, put it into the scanner.

276
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.820
It's a machine that takes like 360 degree images,

277
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.530
which you can then use to print a replica.

278
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.600
Just a little bit of melted plastic and Voila. There it is.

279
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.790
And here's what happened. Rick, drop the egg off for a scan.

280
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:53.400
This egg that he had been cherishing for over 40 years.

281
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.060
I had to leave it for a couple of hours. Shortly after he does,

282
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:02.061
he gets a call from the scanning technician who tells him something happened,

283
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
you know, she said

284
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.250
<v 0>the bottom line is the, um, I,</v>

285
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.740
the egg is broken. She said,

286
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.660
I hope it wasn't a family heirloom fin.

287
00:18:19.661 --> 00:18:23.080
Met Up with Rick as he was just getting back from the print shop with his bag of

288
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.050
egg pieces. I close this up at the store.

289
00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:29.140
I didn't really even look too much.

290
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.010
Oh my God.

291
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.700
Looks like it's in about seven pieces and this plastic bag.

292
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.383
Here it is.

293
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.133
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

294
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.180
<v 3>Yes. Hi, is this Rick? It is Rick. How are you? This is Jad from Radiolab.</v>

295
00:18:56.181 --> 00:18:58.790
Chad. Hi. How are you doing? Yeah, I f I,

296
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.320
I just need to say that we are so, so, so,

297
00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:06.200
so sorry about what happened.

298
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.500
I never had my heart sink in that way from any email I've ever opened.

299
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.280
<v 5>Well I thank you. Thank you. It was such,</v>

300
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.680
it was such a strange clash to walk into this store that is devoted to the

301
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:28.371
future and all these machines sitting around that are turning out almost

302
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:31.470
magically these new things.

303
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.500
And I on the other hand and standing there to collect the shards of a sugar egg

304
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:42.891
that I've held on to for 40 plus years and wow.

305
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.390
It just felt a dullness kind of heavy.

306
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.480
Like everything was just a little bit muddied for

307
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.293
awhile.

308
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.930
It took a little while for that to wear off and,

309
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.830
and it did with an amazing clarity.

310
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.180
<v 3>Hey Max. Hey, one morning,</v>

311
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.460
I think it was two days after the egg had been broken.

312
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.330
He says he woke up and an idea came to me, so I should call him

313
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.750
Max Egg Max is the son of a friend of his who lives down [inaudible]

314
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.130
<v 5>the street. So we do one and a half tablespoons and he,</v>

315
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.830
he's eight, exactly the same age that I was when I got the first day.

316
00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.853
<v 0>Okay.</v>

317
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:37.620
<v 3>Coviello Sea.</v>

318
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.620
And so I asked him if he would help me recreate the sugar egg go away right

319
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.660
here. Kind of smiled and said sure. Yes.

320
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.820
Maybe two. Now that you've got some in there already.

321
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.080
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

322
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.690
<v 0>oh, Vlo Sayer. Nice speech scoop.</v>

323
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.040
Go ahead. Right here already finishing a egg.

324
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.930
Oh, the one I was exactly your age,

325
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.380
so exactly. Exactly. You're sort of Nan,

326
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.270
I was invited to a friend's birthday party and I couldn't go.

327
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:27.310
[inaudible]

328
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.400
<v 3>special thanks to Vin Liotta who provided us with much of the tape.</v>

329
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.300
You just heard of Rick and, and uh, we'll pretty much the whole thing.

330
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.920
He is doing the documentary,

331
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:39.430
which is why he's got all that stuff about people who attach to everyday things.

332
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.810
Oh. And, and, uh, in terms of the, the egg breaking,

333
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.900
uh, we, we actually, we have,

334
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.090
we found somebody who does like restoration for movie stuff and we've offered

335
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.200
Rick to,

336
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.520
to have that person fixed the egg with epoxy or whatever and offer he agreed to

337
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.600
accept, happy to say, and also interestingly enough, um,

338
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.480
mid scan, you know the scan that broke the egg? Yeah.

339
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.490
Actually we have that scan cause the skin scanning machine was actually running

340
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.770
the very moment when the egg broke.

341
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.820
So we actually have a scan of the millisecond when it fell apart.

342
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.420
It's at radiolab.org.
