1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,580
How do you detach without
seeming completely cold?

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,510
Okay, important question. Yeah.
I say this all time. You know,

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,430
you got to detach.
I also say all the time,

4
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:14,170
if you detach from all of your emotions,

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,630
that means your robot and people don't
fall robots. I say it all the time.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,960
So when you do detach,

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,320
you can't,
you can't completely step away.

8
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:30,160
But if you do,
you have to.

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,500
You have to act. You have
to do a little acting. Now,

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,680
first of all, we already
talked about this, right?

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,710
We already talked about these red flags
that that show that you're going to lose

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,880
your temper, that you're going
to get emotional about something.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,300
You know your clenched fist and your
raised voice and you're heavy breathing in

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,850
your flared nostrils and all that stuff,
right?

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,490
So you know what those things mean.
Those things mean those things are your,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,850
your signal. That mean detach. Okay,
so you got to work on that. Yeah.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,291
Now,

18
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:07,291
here's the dichotomy of it is once you
are there and once you have detached,

19
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:13,771
you actually have to now go back and do
one or some of those things that you are

20
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,810
trying not to do. You have to go
and get the doom a little bit. Hmm.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,530
In a nice little controlled manner,
right?

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,600
Maybe you raise your voice a little bit,

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,160
maybe you just kind of clench your jaw
and you remember I said to you like,

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,360
like nodding your head in a positive
way. And that's a, that's a s when you,

25
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:41,530
if you're coming to me with an issue
and I nod my head to the affirmative,

26
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,360
you know, up and down saying,
yes, I understand. Yes,

27
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,650
I understand that's a soothing thing to
your team, right? They see that you're,

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,573
you're okay with it.

29
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,750
The opposite of that is when you
shake your head too in the negative.

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,270
Like if you're telling me some problem
and I'm shaking my head, it's like,

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,800
now I'm me going, Tim, I can't
believe this is going on. Right? So,

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,950
so maybe that's another thing that
you, you, you Clint, your drawing,

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,810
you shake your head to just
show the person like, look,
I know we're in a bad way.

34
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,000
I get it. I'm not sitting back
here like it's no big deal.

35
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,590
I know it's going to be a tough, I know
we just lost a sale or I know we just,

36
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,950
you know, I'm going to have to plan
another mission that we just got back.

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,290
I understand that it's hard.
You care. I care. You know I'm,

38
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,380
I'm with you.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,280
You want to give that maybe you let
out that little sigh of frustration,

40
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,890
you know, like a little like
something like that, right?

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,780
Just going to do that little thing.
Just do that.

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,520
Just self showing that you do got some
emotions and you are invested in all that

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,670
stuff. And, and then once,

44
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,810
once you see that you've
achieved your goal here,

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,540
that you can see that,

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,050
that they see that you have some
emotions on the situation, then you,

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,590
you quickly get yourself
to recover from that.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,170
You get yourself composed and you've
shown them and they, and they've seen,

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,910
it's almost like a little see, like
a little weakness and they go, okay,

50
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,790
you don't Trocco's are human related.
Yeah, I can relate, but he's mad.

51
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,170
But you know, I actually want him to calm
down. I actually am glad he's so good.

52
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,190
Yardi I'm using to be like, I'm glad
he's calming down. That's good. Okay,

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,450
so the new recover, you go back to
your calm, cool, collected self.

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,070
Right. That's what we're going to
do now. Like I said, this is the,

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
we call this acting.
I guess maybe we could call it acting,

56
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,720
but at the same time acting means you're
trying to pretend to be somebody, right.

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,030
You're not trying to pretend to
be anybody else. You're being you.

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,260
That's all you're doing. You're being
you. You're just acting like yourself.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,690
Just showing a little bit
more of the emotion. And

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,010
then you would be,
if you were just completely detached.

61
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:49,210
So it's not like you're trying
to act like some, you know,

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,050
all this junior. Yeah. You're not
trying to play a role of someone else.

63
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,240
You're just being you so,

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,210
and you already know what you do because
you've learned how what the signals are.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,090
So when you know that you raise your
voice and that means you're okay.

66
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,280
You just raise your voice a little bit.
If you know that you,

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,780
you just give a little sides
as those careful things.

68
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,710
And so yeah,
I guess it is acting in a way,

69
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:16,260
but it's not full on anybody
can do it, I think. Yeah.

70
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,350
Yeah, you did. I think that's
great. This is my opinion.

71
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,880
You do it with your kids, you
know? I mean, I'm like, yeah,

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,680
you got to pretend to act. Yeah. You know
you're mad or, or whatever. Any good.

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,520
Even happy, even pretend to act happy. Oh

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,080
No, it's okay. We'll say excited.
Look, hey, I got something for you.

75
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:42,700
It's a drawing of the happy face.
Same as she did yesterday. You know?

76
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,890
It's like I'm not, the honest truth
is I'm excited about other things.

77
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:48,810
We'll just say that

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,660
I haven't done all those. I not love
all that love you got for crying about

79
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,110
that letter. You're going
to, you're going to know.

80
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,090
And it's all going backwards now.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,660
People are going to hate you now
talking about your daughter Jaws,

82
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:09,310
you a beautiful picture and you don't
care about it. It's cold blooded.

83
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,740
What am I going to give
her is a lot of excitement.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,290
I'm going to metric excitement,
maybe even go one level higher.

85
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,740
That's what I'm going to give her.
So I'm, what am I asking? Acting.

86
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,490
I'm excited about a lot of
things. A little bit though.
It's the same. Same thing.

87
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,900
Same thing. Yeah. Uh, that was messed
up by the way. Same thing. Yeah,

88
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,290
I know. I know. Is it
a form of manipulation?

89
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,260
It might be a little bit of
form of emulation, but again,

90
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,290
if you're doing it to help the individual
and you're doing it to help the team,

91
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,460
then isn't manipulation or
is it leadership? I say,
of course it's leadership.

92
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,440
You're not manip manipulation is,

93
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,180
I'm trying to fool you so you do things
that I want you to do that are to hurt

94
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:48,800
you. We're not doing that. That's
not what we're running here. Shit.
