00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.530
The overall layout of your page should look fine right now,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.390
but it doesn't quite look right.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.070
For starters, we don't actually have images here.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.870
Of course, you could use the images that are in the design mock up.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
But that doesn't make much sense because those aren't images of

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110
your actual projects.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.850
In situations like this, it makes sense to have some type of place holder image.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.270
Right here, we have place holder images that simply show how large they are.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.550
Right now, I'm using placehold.it,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.750
which is an awesome website that makes really fast and easy placeholder images.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.570
Each image simply has its dimensions printed inside it.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.590
To use images from placehold.it, simply follow the pattern here.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.230
It's just an image that starts with placehold.it/ and then the dimensions.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.110
Inside the source code for

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.030
the website, we can see a lot of links using placehold.it.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.210
Let's see if it works.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.310
I'm going to change this image from 960 by 350 to 1,000 by 350,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.640
and I will save it.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.380
So when I refresh the page, we should see that this turns into 1,000 by 350.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.060
And there we go, the image is a little bit larger.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.410
Of course, these are pretty boring and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.180
it's important to have fun while you're working.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.745
So, instead of using placehold.it there are other services.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:10.940
Placepuppy.it is an even more fun way of including placeholder images.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.610
Look at those cute dogs.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.150
Oh my god.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.207
They're so cute.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:20.510
[LAUGH] Oh, yeah, anyways you can use placepuppy.it/ the dimensions here and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.160
you could also include these in the page.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.070
Let's give one a shot.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.940
We'll come back to here.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.753
And instead of placehold.it, let's make it placepuppy.it and

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:34.620
1000 by 350 and we'll save it and let's come back to our demo.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.905
And when we hit refresh,

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:40.200
[LAUGH] we, we have the top of a dachshund staring at us and it's adorable.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.830
So, that's another way of making your life a little bit more fun.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.990
But for those of you who aren't dog lovers, there's also kittens.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.520
Adding cats to the website is as easy as using placekitten.com.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.850
And it follows pretty similar syntax to, placepuppy.it.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.927
Cats make me allergic.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.200
So I'm not going to use them.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.784
But, all right, you know, you know what?

00:01:56.784 --> 00:01:58.570
Tell you what, let's try one out.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.263
All right.

00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:02.050
So placekitten.com/ the dimensions.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.647
So let's, instead of placepuppy let's make it placekitten.com.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:09.270
So we have placekitten.com instead of placepuppy.it.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.960
And we have the same dimensions.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.500
And when we refresh the page, now we have an adorable cat staring at us.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.760
So, you've got options for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.320
making your life a lot more fun when you're building websites.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.730
Which of the following placeholder images do you prefer using?

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.240
None.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.110
Because using the real images is probably the best strategy.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.550
Or do you like using placehold.it, because seeing dimensions is really helpful?

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.240
Do you like placepuppy.it because seeing dogs just makes your day better?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.660
Or do you think that kittens with placekitten.com is the way to go?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.880
If none of these type your answer in here and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.080
let us know which one you like using.
