00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.180
Let’s talk about sex.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.009
I know that’s the last thing most of you
wanted to hear me say, but I have big science-related

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.009
news about it!

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:13.710
Right now clinical trials are underway for
a new form of birth-control for men.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.590
Currently if you’re a man and you want to
be the responsible one while doinking, there’s

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.800
really only two options - a vasectomy, which
is not convenient or always reversible; or

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.410
a condom, which is convenient, cheap, and
effective at stopping both pregnancies and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.210
STDs when used correctly.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.230
But some men don’t like the way a condom
affects the sensation of sex and would rather

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.300
do without it.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.410
Or so I’ve heard.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.500
So the two methods of male birth control rely
on physical barriers to stop sperm from reaching

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
an egg.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.920
By contrast, there are a lot of female birth
control options, and most of them use hormones

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.820
to prevent an egg from being around in the
first place.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.739
So what’s stopping men from using some kind
of hormonal birth control too?

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.931
Well in theory, nothing really, and male hormonal
birth control has been tested before, though

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.050
so far none have been successful.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.830
This new clinical trial is aiming giving it
another shot, testing the drug on men in 7

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.180
countries around the world.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210
The new drug uses two hormones.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.140
One is progestin, a synthetic form of the
steroid/hormone progesterone that women’s

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.840
bodies use to regulate ovulation and pregnancies.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
The purpose of the progestin in the experimental
new male birth control is to lower sperm count.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.729
But to prevent the progestin from negatively
impacting the men’s sex drive or causing

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.280
other changes like increased acne or weight
gain, the second hormone present is testosterone.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.409
That may sound counterproductive since testosterone
plays a role in sperm production, but actually

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.810
when a man’s body gets testosterone from
an outside source, the testes stop producing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.970
it and sperm count drops as well.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.689
Perhaps best of all is the form this birth
control comes in.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.280
It’s a gel that’s intended to be rubbed
on the arms and shoulders, so guys there’s

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.150
no excuse not to use it because it doesn’t
feel good.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.490
Heck you play your cards right and you can
literally get a massage out of it.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.159
A rub-on gel is a lot kinder of a delivery
system than say a pill, or a vaginal ring,

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.360
or an IUD, or an implant, or a shot, or basically
any method women currently have for hormonal

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360
birth control.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.829
But it’s not something that a man can slap
on, give himself a quick rub, and get right

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.629
to the business of no-baby-making.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.760
Men make 1,000 sperm a second, they are just
churning out DNA bullets all the time.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.579
To be sure all those little meiosis tadpoles
are culled to safe levels, the trial is having

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.840
men rely on other contraceptives while they
apply the gel daily for almost 20 weeks.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.290
After sperm counts drop to sufficient levels,
the men will use the gel exclusively for a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.290
year.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.140
Fingers crossed they don’t accidentally
have children to whom they’ll one day have

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.359
to explain they were the result of a science
experiment gone wrong.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.909
Once a year has passed they’ll stop using
the gel and researchers will track them for

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.090
six months to make sure there are no long
term side effects.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.389
The trial should wrap up by 2022, and if all
goes well it will be ready… for more testing.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.569
More studies involving thousands of men will
be necessary before regulators like the U.S.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.329
Food and Drug Administration give it the all
clear, so it’s not hitting shelves anytime

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.329
soon.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.819
Another birth control option for men is a
good thing, choice always is unless you’re

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.120
Chidi from The Good Place.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.329
But what does this mean for women?

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.230
All the birth control options I mentioned
for them are much more invasive than a rub

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.859
on gel, and each has their own drawbacks,
like side effects from changes in hormone

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.159
levels, scarring from implants, or pain when
an IUD falls out of place.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.319
If this trial goes well could they have a
gel too?

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.870
As it happens the same company developing
this gel is working on a progestin and estradiol

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.949
gel for women.

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.499
So a more convenient birth control could be
on the horizon for women too.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.040
Or this gel could eliminate the need for female
birth control all together.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.309
Maybe if the man in the relationship uses
this gel for birth control, then his partner

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.989
can stop taking birth control all together
if she so chooses.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.680
Whatever happens, just stay safe out there.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.859
Would y’all use this?

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.120
I know I would… if there was a need.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.109
I have a condom at home in a glass case that
says “break glass in case of miracle.”

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.430
