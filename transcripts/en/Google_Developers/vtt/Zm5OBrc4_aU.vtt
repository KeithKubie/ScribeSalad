00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.630
MALE SPEAKER: The Golden Gate
Bridge 75th anniversary,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.940
wanted everyone in the world
to be able to participate.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.410
So the mass API is such a
great platform now that

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.460
everyone uses, almost
on a daily basis.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.530
So it made total sense to do
something based on this API.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.860
MALE SPEAKER: It was definitely
a challenge

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.635
figuring out how we were going
to get all of these

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.130
bridges to line up.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.040
We prototyped it using
just paper, at first.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.270
MALE SPEAKER: One hurdle that we
had was figuring out how we

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.960
could legally use the images
from Google Maps itself.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.950
MALE SPEAKER: Being able to
speak with someone like Josh

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.960
at Google was critical for us
to get past certain hurdles.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: We wanted it to
be something that was easy

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.360
for people to find a bridge
without having to use too many

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.120
brain cells.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.284
And we seem to be having,
for example, a

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:05.440
burst now in Russia.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.170
And we've had bursts
in Southeast Asia.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.610
We started with a giant
burst in Brazil.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.770
It's just been really
interesting to see how it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.210
traveled around the world, and
grown organically on its own.
