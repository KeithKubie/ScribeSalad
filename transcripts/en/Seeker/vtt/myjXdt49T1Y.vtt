Mmm, IPAs. That bold, flavorful beer style
that picks you up, calms you down, and gives

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.070
you moobs. Wait, what?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.040
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews. In
the not too distant past, IPAs were all but

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.310
unheard of. Suddenly within the last 5 years
though, they’ve been revived in a major

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.730
way by craft beer enthusiasts in the States.
My local bars that used to have mostly lighter

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.650
lagers and pilsners now only seem to serve
one or two, and the rest of the taps are dominated

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.430
by hops-heavy beers.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.140
Which is a shame, because I really hate the
flavor and my friends made fun of me for not

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.620
liking more manly drinks. Oh boy, turns out
the joke’s on them. First though, a history

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.280
lesson.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.720
In case you weren’t aware, IPA stands for
India Pale Ale, so named because they were

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040
shipped to British officers and civil servants
in India back when it was part of the british

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.100
empire. It was too hot to brew beer on the
subcontinent, but the trip from England took

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.420
6 months and a normal beer would spoil in
that time.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.760
The solution was to add more hops. Hops help
the brewers yeast ferment more of the sugars

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.720
in the wort, leaving less behind for other
microorganisms to use. The result is a bitter,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.950
flavorful beer with higher alcohol content
and a longer shelf life.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.220
Now here’s the kicker: hops are the female
flower of a plant. As such, they have phytoestrogens,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.150
which are molecules made by plants that mimic
estrogen in humans. Hops actually have the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.030
best estrogen imitator known to science, called
8-prenylnaringenin

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.000
this thing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.700
Now men and women both have testosterone and
estrogen, but too much estrogen for either

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.490
sex is a bad thing. For women it can cause
bloating, swollen and tender breasts, decreased

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.790
sex drive, headaches, the list goes on. For
men it can cause gynecomastia, which is a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.810
fancy word for man boobs, or in this case,
IPA Cups. It can also cause erectile dysfunction,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.229
which is apparently common enough among heavy
beer drinkers that it’s sometimes referred

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:10.749
to as “Brewer’s Droop.”

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:15.299
So if you’re like me and tired of your buddies
mocking your aversion to IPAs, keep this tidbit

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.260
in your back pocket.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.079
IPAs affects your estrogen levels but if you
like spicy food you may be just fine. Trace

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:40.739
and I explain the connection between spice
and testosterone here.
