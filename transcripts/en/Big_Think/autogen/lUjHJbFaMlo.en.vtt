radical new approach to building and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
radical new approach to building and
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.360
radical new approach to building and
construction on which they've developed

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
construction on which they've developed
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.440
construction on which they've developed
intellectual properties so that's an

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
intellectual properties so that's an
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420
intellectual properties so that's an
important part to cover as well it's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
important part to cover as well it's
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.760
important part to cover as well it's
interesting to note thinking about our

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770
interesting to note thinking about our
 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.350
interesting to note thinking about our
previous discussion and integrated

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360
previous discussion and integrated
 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.230

integrated report so there's a clear

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060
integrated report so there's a clear

an even bigger opportunity it would be
 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.020
an even bigger opportunity it would be

used in existing urban environments as
well as it is in in new cities so the
