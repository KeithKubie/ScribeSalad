MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.990
to one more Authors
at Google talk.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.250
Today with us is
Ian Hodder, who is

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.690
going to talk about
the original origins of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.380
settled life in the
Middle East, specifically

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.780
Gobekli and Catalhoyuk,
two archaeological sites

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.390
from the early Neolithic.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.380
Ian Hodder was trained at
the Institute of Archaeology,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.670
University College, London and
at Cambridge University, where

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.430
he obtained his Ph.D. In 1975.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.540
After a brief period
teaching at Leeds,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.460
he returned to Cambridge,
where he taught until 1999.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630
During that time, he became
Professor of Archaeology,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.450
and elected a fellow
of the British Academy.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.320
In 1999, he moved to teach
at Stanford University

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.960
as the Family Professor in
the Department of Anthropology

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.480
and Director of the Stanford
Archaeologist Center.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.890
His main large scale
excavation projects

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.150
have been at [? Heatherhem ?]
in the east of England

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.980
and Catalhoyuk in Turkey,
where he has worked since 1993.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.040
He has been awarded the
Oscar Montelius Medal

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.280
by the Swedish Society of
Antiquaries, the Huxley

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.520
Memorial Medal by the Royal
Anthropological Institute,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.360
has been a Guggenheim Fellow,
and has honorary doctorates

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.320
from Bristol and
Leidon Universities.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.550
His main books include "Spatial
Analysis in Archaeology,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.260
Symbols in Action," "Reading
the Past, the Domestication

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.690
of Europe," "The Archaeological
Process," "The Leopard's Tale,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.224
Revealing the Mysteries
of Catalhoyuk,"

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:45.090
and "Tangled, An Archaeology
of the Relationship

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.080
Between Humans and Things."

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.110
Please join me in welcoming
Ian Hodder to Google.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.240
IAN HODDER: So I wanted to start
by thanking Boris and Talks

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.370
at Google for inviting
me to come and talk

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.080
to you about the topic of
ritual origins in the Middle

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.360
East, which must be a rather
long way from your usual sets

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
of interests.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.030
And so I look forward
to your comments

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.580
on what I'm going to say.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.970
I'm going to be talking about
the origins of settled life

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.790
in the Middle East, and arguing
that the new findings suggest

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.830
that ritual and social
symbolism of various sorts

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.980
turns out to be very key to
the origins of settled life.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.580
And I'm going to be using the
new excavations at Gobekli

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.210
as an example, but also
using the excavations

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.220
that I've been carrying
at Catalhoyuk in Turkey

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.720
as an example.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.510
So the problem is a very
straightforward one, really,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.730
which is that for
the vast majority

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.940
of human life on Earth, we
have been hunter-gatherers.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.950
And so for hundreds
of thousands of years,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.620
modern humans moved
around the landscape

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.590
in very small groups,
small settlements,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.870
short-term settlements,
as hunters and gatherers,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.250
leading these sorts of
traces, scatters of bones,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.100
and stone tools, and
reconstructed in the way

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.020
that you see down there.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.040
So for a long time
then, people were

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.110
living in this sort of low
density, scattered, mobile way.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.200
And then between
10,000 and 7,000 BC,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.960
things changed, and
we ended up living

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.070
in things like this, large
agglomerations-- this

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.110
is Catalhoyuk that we'll come
back to later-- of maybe 8,000

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.240
people living cluster together
over long periods of time.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.230
So the question is,
why did that happen?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.782
Why aren't we still
hunters and gatherers?

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.490
Why did this change
occur, and why did it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.570
occur at this particular moment?

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.250
One of the contributory
factors is undoubtedly climate,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.480
because it's clear that
during the last ice age,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.160
one has a cold climate that
warms up around 10,000 BC.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.340
And so you have the
modern warmer climate.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.230
This graph doesn't show
the contemporary warming.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.100
But you see this fairly stable
period from about 10,000 BC.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.960
And the emergence
of settled life

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.370
occurs all around the world
at about this sort of Holocene

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.440
period, in the early Holocene.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.980
So it's undoubtedly the case
that climate has something

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.710
to do with this shift.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.880
But most people feel that
climate isn't the sole factor.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.490
But maybe not even
the main factor,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.900
because there are
earlier warmer periods

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.460
way back in the ice
age in the Pleistocene,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.870
which did not lead
to the same response.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.530
So there are clearly
other factors

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.340
that have to be involved.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.160
And by far, the sort of dominant
theories, the dominant view

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.080
of why settled life
began, why urbanism,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.740
if you like, the
origins of urbanism

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.930
began, the main theories
derived from column Karl Marx,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.410
and derived from Karl
Marx in pre-history,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.800
is the figure of V.
Gordon Chide, who

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.930
coined the term, the
Neolithic Revolution.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.840
And so following Marx, he saw
this as a revolutionary event

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.790
that created settled
life, and he saw it

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:03.570
as primarily the result of
an intensification of use

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.070
of the environment,
use of resources,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.620
particularly the domestication
of plants and animals.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.310
So the idea was
the domestication

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.930
of plants and animals meant that
you could get more resources

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.080
out of a given
area of land, which

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.110
meant that people could stay
there longer and collect,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.940
and larger numbers of
people could be supported.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.040
There were other
ancillary ideas, such

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.230
that the collection of the
domestication of plants

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.440
and animals led to the
creation of a surplus, which

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.300
would allow people to store
and build up property and have

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.390
ownership.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.440
And that that was also seen
as an important development

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.550
at this time, linked
ultimately to the development

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.030
of ranking and social hierarchy.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.250
But the key idea was
that the domestication

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.390
of plants and animals was the
trigger that allowed people

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.450
to live in the same place
over a long period of time

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.210
and aggregate.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.540
Now the idea of a revolution
has been largely discredited.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.230
It's clear that the
process of settling down

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.880
was a very, very long slow
one that took thousands

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.480
and thousands of years.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.060
But the idea that
the domestication

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.520
of plants and animals
was key to settled life

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.960
has remained a very,
very important idea.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.920
That basically, the
economy is what did it.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.910
And that's why the site at
Gobekli is very important.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.660
Because Gobekli basically
turns this on its head.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.590
Because Gobekli is a
very remarkable site

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.990
that disproves that basic idea.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.450
So Gobekli itself has been
excavated by the German

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.330
Archaeological Institute.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.800
The excavator there
for a long time

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.440
was Klaus Schmidt, who
sadly died recently.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.500
And the excavations are
continuing nevertheless,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.870
and I'm very grateful to
[INAUDIBLE] for allowing

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.280
me access to some of
these images and results

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.100
that I'm going to
be talking about.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.340
So Gobekli Tepe in
Southeast Turkey.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.940
And you can see that
it's a set of mounds

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.710
on a very high
hill that overlooks

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.169
a really impressive landscape
out there in Southeast Turkey.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.200
So it's a very, very
dominant prominent location.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.390
And if we look at
the excavations that

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.310
are taking place
on this hill, we

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.530
find that we see these
very remarkable circles

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.150
of upright stones, these
sort of megalithic circles,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.710
with two interior
stones as well.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.840
These upright monoliths
creating these circles, a number

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.980
of them, on this mound.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.710
And this is all beginning
around 9,000 BC.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.570
So very, very early.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:22.905
And these upright pillars,
or monoliths, or stele,

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.690
are yet more remarkable,
because they have all

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.630
this really wonderful imagery
on that I'll come back to later.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.610
Many of these stones
are enormous in size,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.700
some up to six meters high.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.280
Enormous skill to produce them.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.510
Very thin.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.250
Often talked of as
t-shaped pillars,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.550
because they have that
sort of overall T shape.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.740
Clearly to construct
these sorts of monuments

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.520
involves a lot of labor
by a lot of people.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.140
And so one of the
most striking things

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.295
is that there must been a lot
of collective organization

00:10:03.295 --> 00:10:06.790
in order to produce
these monuments.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.960
The quarrying is
done fairly locally,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.665
but simply the carving
out, the construction

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:13.720
of them, the putting
them upright,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.740
and the construction of
these walls around them,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.200
involves a huge amount of labor.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.550
Now the very important
aspect about this

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.370
is that this is a society
which does not yet

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.190
have full plants and
animal domestication.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.760
So these are really
still hunter-gatherers.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.130
There's a beginning to being
moved towards the domestication

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.210
of plants and animals, but
that hasn't yet occurred here

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.900
at around 9,000 BC.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.690
So these are basically
hunter-gatherer societies

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.830
who are coming
together to create

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.610
these large monuments in which
a lot of collective labor

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.220
is needed.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.390
And that seems somehow to then
generate occupation around it.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:09.030
So here is a photograph of these
circular stone constructions,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.030
and there's a plan here.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.110
And this is the earliest phase.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.730
And then you can see around it
these sort of very simple round

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.490
or roundish houses that emerge.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.200
And then through time, you
begin to get rectangular houses.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.420
And in fact, the temples, the
equivalents of those things,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.660
become rectangular.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.930
So the sequence that
one can reconstruct here

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.410
is that people originally
come together, perhaps

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.540
from a very large landscape,
they come together in order

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.920
to construct these monuments,
these rituals, circles

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.810
themselves, and then
gradually people

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.870
live and live there longer
and longer until you

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.440
have a settlement that
grows up around them.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.510
So this is very much saying
that at a very early date,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.680
hunter-gatherers
are coming together

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.540
to create community
out of reasons

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.970
that are social and ritual.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:09.180
And it's not the economy that
is the driving force here.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.900
Indeed, Gobekli has a
lot of these circles.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.300
This is the area
that we've just been

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.280
looking at where excavation
has been taking place.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.850
They've done ground
penetrating radar

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:26.940
in the other parts of this set
of mounds on this high hilltop.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.630
And you can see that the
ground penetrating radar

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.330
is picking up lots
of these circles.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.690
In fact, there
seem to be about 18

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.445
of these circles on the site.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.640
If we look at the
stones themselves,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.720
it's been argued that they
represent people in some way.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.290
That they're representations
of mythical people or ancestors

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.480
in some way.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.827
And you can see that they've
got the arms coming down

00:12:55.827 --> 00:12:57.910
on the side there, and
then the hand, if you like,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.080
on the front.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.450
And there's the belt,
it's interpreted

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.880
as a belt, going
around, and this

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.950
is a loin cloth at the front.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.300
And as I said before,
the T shape at the top

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.760
suggests to many people that
these are anthropomorphic,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.520
and that they somehow
maybe represent ancestors,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.785
or important mythical beings.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:29.100
And then on these ancestors,
or on these stele,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.410
there's a whole sort
of carving, lots

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.010
of carving of various types
of imagery, much of it

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:46.170
to do with violence, and
sex, and sometimes death.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:55.890
So for example, you see lions
here, bulls, and wild boar

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.730
here.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.980
Also, some bird type forms.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.470
At the top in the
middle, there's

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.310
an image of a woman either being
penetrated or menstruating.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.920
It's not exactly how
to interpret that.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.844
But on the whole, the
imagery is very male.

00:14:13.844 --> 00:14:16.260
And I don't know if you can
see from where you're sitting,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.530
but most of the wild animals
have the male genitalia

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.815
clearly shown.

00:14:22.815 --> 00:14:25.620
A lot of the imagery
is associated

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.980
with violence in various ways.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.800
Here's another one of
these T-shaped pillars

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:38.250
with a wild boar and this sort
of monstrous figure crawling

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.410
up and down it.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.070
And here's one of
these walls going

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.480
'round these enclosures
with a serpent type figure

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.340
coming out of it.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.270
You see another
image of that there,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.015
and these sort of
bared teeth and fangs

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:59.110
of these sort of
mythical creatures,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.490
and snakes, and so on.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.480
Here's another of these
T-shaped forms over here,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.450
with a wild boar
and perhaps a fox

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.220
there, and these
ducky type things.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:25.290
Over here, there's a
very fascinating stone.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.210
Again, you see the
t-shaped generally.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.790
Just one point to make is
that I'm talking about these

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.200
as if it's all one phase.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.000
In fact, the [INAUDIBLE] is
much more complex than that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.370
And you can see how
this pillar here

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.940
has had this wall built up
against it at a later date,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.430
and there's lots
of use and reuse

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.230
of these things over time.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:51.610
But this particular image is,
I think, a fascinating one.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.790
I won't go through all
the different parts of it.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.570
But you can even see sort of
wild and dangerous animals

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.270
again.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.190
There's some sort of a scorpion.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.490
There, we often gets spiders.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.770
You can see a scorpion
tail again here,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.790
and a wild boar or something
coming out the side there.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.900
But perhaps most
fascinating are these sort

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.670
of birds here that
look vaguely humanoid,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.090
and there's some sort of human
bird mixing going on here.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.780
And this bird here seems
to be doing something

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.036
with a spherical object.

00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:32.980
Perhaps playing with
a ball or something.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.660
And then down here, you have
this bird with, on its back,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.260
is a human with an erect
penis and without a head.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.050
And we'll talk later about
sort of headlessness,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.390
how that's such an important
part of this symbolism.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.670
But it's very tempting,
as someone has done here,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.130
to suggest that that is actually
the head that the bird has

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:04.109
taken, and is somehow taking off
or playing with from that body.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.615
And here, you got
a close-up of that.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:23.760
So Gobekli is right
in the middle here.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.640
Get this to work.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.880
So just in here.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.490
And it's a larger version of a
series of sites that gradually

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.370
emerged that are shown
by these T-shaped symbols

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.395
in upper Mesopotamia.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.810
And through time, a whole
series of other sites

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.230
emerged, shown by these circles,
that are similar in the sense

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.330
that they start in
hunter-gatherer context,

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.280
with big ritual structures
of various sort,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.310
and then you have a set
of houses around them.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.430
So one can talk then about,
throughout this region,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.360
about a sort of settling
down, and a focus

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.770
on these important ritual
buildings and centers.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:21.360
And what's fascinating is that
recent genetic work on wheat

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.250
has shown that the first
domestication of Einkorn wheat

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.590
probably began at
[INAUDIBLE], which

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.070
is right in the center
of all this stuff.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.470
And so it's possible
very much to turn

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.950
the sort of Marx-Childean
theory on its head,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.680
and to argue that it was
the settling down that

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.820
led to the need for more
intensive production,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.810
and then ultimately to the
domestication of wheat,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.640
and of course, sheep, and
goat, and the full range

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.810
of domesticates that we know
come from the Middle East

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.105
during the Neolithic.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.240
Just to point out, there
are a number of other sites,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.230
as I've just shown you, but
just to show how widespread they

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.260
are, here's in Jordan a site
called Wadi Faynan, which again

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.720
has some sort of big complex
ritual structure up there,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.260
and a whole series of small
houses that cluster around it.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.960
Another site that you will
all have heard of is Jericho.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.060
And Jericho has very
important Neolithic levels.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:33.570
Very important concentration
of early settled life.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.030
And as part of, that there is
this very remarkable tower,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.770
a monumental tower, that
has a stairway that goes up

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.330
and would have
gone up to the top,

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.650
but there is also
burials, human burials,

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.200
that are placed in this.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.980
So again, we have some
sort of large ritual

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.020
collective structure around
which settlement occurs.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:07.050
So this new story about
the origin of settled life

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.830
is a fascinating one, and we
can step forward a little bit

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.540
of few thousand years.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.510
We've just been
looking at Gobekli,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.370
which starts around 9,000
BC, and moving on now

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.300
to Catalhoyuk, which is
about 7,000 BC, where

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.020
we'll see lots of parallels,
but also contrasts with Gobekli.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.540
And what we're
finding at Catalhoyuk

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.830
adds a lot to the story.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.920
So this is the
mound at Catalhoyuk

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.920
that is Neolithic in date.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.050
And you can see it's in the
Konya Plain, which is about--

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:49.050
so the site is about three
to four hours south of Ankara

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.550
by car.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.690
And this is how we
reconstruct Catalhoyuk.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.840
We already saw earlier an image
of how we see it in detail.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.940
But this is in its landscape.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.130
So this is, as I said before, a
large concentration of people.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.980
We think up to 8,000
people were living here.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.660
So we've moved on from
Gobekli in the sense

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:20.150
that these are much larger
agglomerations of people.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.950
There's also a big difference
from Gobekli in that now we

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.640
have agriculture.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.760
So this is a site that
has domesticated sheep,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.050
and it has domesticated plants.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.260
A lot of the resources
are still wild.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.640
And as we'll see later,
the cattle in particular

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.820
are still wild.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:43.440
But this is a society that
has just started agriculture.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.590
And the other thing that
we see is that there

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.130
is no ritual center here.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.990
That there's no ceremonial
center and no circles

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.880
of stones of any sort.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.880
There are no public buildings.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.730
This is just a very,
very large number

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:05.180
of people in relative
terms living in one place.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.260
Another very
important part of this

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.310
is that they lived
there for a long time.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.930
This has become very
stable societies.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.980
Quite the opposite of those
Upper Paleolithic Pleistocene

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.110
societies.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.660
At Catalhoyuk,
this is where we're

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.510
excavating in the south part
of the site in a small area.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:33.620
And we have about 21 meters of
occupation, about 18 levels.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.430
So people lived on
houses, knocked them down,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.140
built other houses on top,
and so on and so forth

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.000
over a thousand years.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.090
So this incredibly stable
society doing the same thing

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.000
repetitively over a very,
very long period of time.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.970
So by this time, people
have really got the answer.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:57.525
They really know how to be
stable long-term settlements.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.460
In the north part
of the site, we're

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.530
excavating in order
to find not so

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.730
much the depth of occupation,
but to understand what it looks

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.870
like at any one moment in time.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.660
And this gives you a sense
of how all the houses are

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.420
tightly packed together.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.610
In fact, they're so
tightly packed together,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.180
there is no room for streets.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.940
And although you might think
that these alleyways and so on,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.660
these actually were used
just for rubbish deposition,

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.000
and they're not streets.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.430
People moved around
on the surface,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:38.650
on the roofs of the houses,
and then went down a ladder

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.810
into the interior.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:48.070
So one of the
questions is, how is it

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.610
possible for people to live,
large numbers of people

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.370
to live together, in this
sort of collective way?

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.360
How was that organized?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.120
And in order to understand
how it was organized,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.410
it's important to
look inside the houses

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.680
and try to make sense of the
elaborate symbolism and ritual

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.170
that we find there.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.130
These are pictures
taken from the work

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.040
that James Mellaart did at
Catalhoyuk in the 1960s.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.820
And as you can see
here the latter

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.360
that people would move to
come down from the roof,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.070
and they come down into the
south part of the house,

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:36.347
where there was lots of evidence
of food and food preparation.

00:24:36.347 --> 00:24:38.930
And then you see all the other
types of symbolism, a lot of it

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.440
to do with bulls
in various ways.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.140
But you also see
at the top of there

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.680
something that should be
reminiscent to you, which

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.290
is headless bodies and birds.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.250
So this is a link to Gobekli.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.350
We also saw lots of
boars at Gobekli.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.420
So there are lots of parallels
in the symbolism of the two

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.850
sites.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.716
Here is a pair of
bull horns that

00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:10.560
are set around--
these are wild bull

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.230
horns that are set
around a platform in one

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.190
of these houses.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:22.950
And I'm just going to play you
a little reconstruction done

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:27.160
by a group called
Corinth on what it looked

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.770
like inside these houses.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.460
So this is turning
around and looking

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.020
at the south part of the house,
where you would come down

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.840
the ladder, and where you
have the concentration

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.910
of domestic activities,
particularly around the hearth

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.410
and around the oven.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.120
And in our excavations,
we find large amounts

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.360
of a dense concentrations of
everyday activity in this area.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.736
There also entrances
into side rooms.

00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:59.610
And then as you move
northwards in the house,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.830
there's lots of other types
of elaborate symbolism

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.175
around these various platforms.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.370
The roof is often flat.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.220
But in this case, it seems
to have been modified

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.480
in order to allow for this
particular image, which

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.320
I'll explain later, we think
is a bear, a wild bear.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.220
There are other
types of animals.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:27.330
But particularly, the
skulls of wild bulls

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.010
play a very important
part in the imagery

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.330
inside these houses.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.340
And one of the most
fascinating things

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.650
about this focus
on wild bulls is

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.500
this at this time at
Catalhoyuk, the cattle

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.370
are not domesticated.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.130
But in the later levels,
they are domesticated.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.840
And so it seems that
one can argue again

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.910
that initially, people
are interested in animals

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.680
for ritual or social
symbolic reasons,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.030
and that itself then leads to
the domestication of cattle

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.280
later on.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.920
So again, it seems like
ritual and social functions

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.810
are important, and
that leaves as sort

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:12.030
of as an accidental
byproduct to them

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.760
the actual domestication
of animals.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.760
Of cattle in this case.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.500
We've already seen
this type of figure

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.770
with upraised arms in
that last reconstruction.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.270
This is one of the
aversions of that.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.410
And we think that these
are probably bears,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.560
and we've done that because
we find these stamps seals

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.380
that we think are
clearly bears they

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:46.120
have the same sort of upraised
arms and legs type of form.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.620
And we also find traces
of the bear claws,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.110
so we think bear claws
were stuck in the walls

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.500
here, and then removed when
the thing is abandoned.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.550
So there are bear
claws, and we also

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:03.430
find the tusks of a wild
boar stuck into walls.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:08.590
Pairs of leopards are another
important theme in Catalhoyuk.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:17.950
And we also find the claws
of leopards in the site.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.820
So there seems to be a real
fascination with wild animals,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.220
and with bringing in the
horns, the teeth, the tusks,

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.376
the claws, and so on
of them into the house

00:28:26.376 --> 00:28:27.750
and sticking them
into the walls.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.010
Some of the houses have
these wonderful paintings

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.570
that seem to show--
initially, you might think,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.750
are these people
hunting wild animals?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.270
But in fact, they're not.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.930
They're teasing
and baiting them.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.380
And so what you see is
in case of bearded men

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.635
wearing these spotted things
around their waist, which

00:28:52.635 --> 00:28:56.450
we interpret as Leopard skins,
and they are pulling the tail,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.050
and pulling the
snout, and pulling

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.290
the tongue of this
deer, of this stag,

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.670
again with an erect penis.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.370
And remember that relates
to the type of symbolism

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.150
we saw at Gobekli.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.170
And this is-- you can't see this
so well, but this a bull, again

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.110
with lots of people around
wearing leopard skins,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.995
teasing and baiting the bull.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.690
And I'm just going to show
you another little video

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.640
reconstruction.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:36.490
This is incorrectly called
the shrine of the hunters.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.330
But we don't see these
as shrines anymore.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.470
We see them as houses.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.330
And as I said, they're
not ready hunting.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.520
They're teasing and baiting.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.570
But then what this
reconstruction

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.240
by a team at Southampton
does very well

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.610
is to give you a sense of
how these paintings are

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.240
arranged in a house.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.340
You see people jumping on,
teasing this bear here,

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.680
wild bear, and
dancing, and running

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.160
towards that particular
set of activities there.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.810
Here's that image of a bull
with lots of people around it,

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:17.800
and teasing him, baiting other
types of animals over there.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.770
So the important
thing is lots and lots

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.020
of people involved
in these images.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.890
And again, this is in the
context of domestic house,

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.400
coming down the
ladder with the oven

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.890
beneath the ladder in the
south part of the house.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:39.270
And the way we interpret
this is that we think

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:44.170
these teasing and baiting
rituals took place,

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.600
and then the
animals were killed.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.410
And then we have evidence
on the site of feasting,

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:56.140
so large amounts of people
feasting on these wild animals.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.560
And then, taking the
various tokens or symbols

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.100
of those animals
and putting them

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.520
in the house as
memories or mementos

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.380
of these important
social events when

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.730
people gathered and
came together in killing

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.360
and eating these animals.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.850
So we have, then, this
evidence of collective action

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:27.240
at Catalhoyuk associated
with wild animals.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.735
But you might have
thought that all

00:31:29.735 --> 00:31:33.250
of this organization, this
large number of people living

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.040
together, would have
within necessitated

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.650
some sort of central hierarchy.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.710
But that is not what
we find at Catalhoyuk.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.610
We think Catalhoyuk is an
aggressively egalitarian

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.340
society, where showing
difference was not

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.230
really allowed.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.080
So what we've done here, for
example, is on this line,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:00.070
is we've just ordered all the
houses from the less elaborate

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.190
to the more elaborate,
where more elaborate means

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.970
they have more of
that type of symbolism

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.600
I've just been showing you.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.070
And if we try and correlate
that with, for example,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.163
this other line, is the number
of figurines that are found

00:32:14.163 --> 00:32:16.880
in the house, you might have
thought that the more elaborate

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.840
houses, the higher
status houses,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.410
would have more
figurines, but they don't.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.400
There's no correlation.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.390
And we can't find any
correlation at all

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.640
with anything that relates to
the elaborateness of the house.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.020
So the more elaborate houses
with more symbolism and bulls

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.350
horns and things in them do not
have more storage, for example.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.530
They have the same or less
storage as other buildings.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.470
They don't have more evidence
of production in anyway.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.047
So this seems to be a
society in which you

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.880
could have a lot of
symbolism in your house,

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.010
but that doesn't mean that you
have higher status in some way.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.680
In fact, we can find no
chiefly house, or chiefly

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.010
center, or high status house.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.972
Everybody seems to
be about the same.

00:32:58.972 --> 00:33:00.680
Everybody has the same
amount of storage,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.240
the same amount of productive
facility, and so on.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.820
So as I said, this is a
very egalitarian society.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.950
So that again raises even
more strongly the issue of,

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.550
how do you hold people
together, 8,000 people together,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.409
living day to day?

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.450
How do you hold all that
together and organize it

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:20.062
all without any
central authority?

00:33:20.062 --> 00:33:21.520
And we've seen that
one of the ways

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.910
you do that is by having
collective rituals associated

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.267
with wild animals.

00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:29.850
But I want to show
you some other ways

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.410
in which I think it was done.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:39.137
So this is a model of part
of the excavation area.

00:33:39.137 --> 00:33:40.720
And you can see these
different houses

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.210
that we've been excavating.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:48.740
But I want to focus on that
particular, Building 80.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.100
And this is looking
down into Building 80.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.490
The West wall here
has been removed.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.070
We're looking at the
north and the east wall.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.160
And here in the south part
of this main room, again

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.410
we have the oven,
and the hearth.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.540
It's just you can't
see it down in here.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.480
And this is the platform
where the ladder comes down

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.500
from the roof, so you'd walk
down into this building here

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.960
above the oven, come
into the building,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.330
and move northwards where
you have all these platforms.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.420
These scars on the wall
are where originally, you

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:29.190
would have had upright posts
that help to hold the house up.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.929
But when we were working
on this bit of wall here,

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.800
we found painting.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.560
And as we gradually took off
the hundreds and hundreds

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.480
of very fine layers of
plaster that were probably

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.820
put on monthly
during the Neolithic

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.050
in order to keep the
house white and clean,

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.860
as we took off these
hundreds of layers,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.250
we came down to
this painting that

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.920
has a very sort of simple
and distinctive form,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.360
has these uprights, and then
these triangles on the side,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.105
and then this sort of
brick-shaped pattern.

00:35:06.105 --> 00:35:09.592
And again, you see it here,
upright in the triangle

00:35:09.592 --> 00:35:10.800
and the brick-shaped pattern.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.770
And this is it again.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.660
And this is in
this building here.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.220
There's another painting,
right on the other side

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.150
of the excavated
area, which again

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.370
has these uprights,
and the triangles,

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.120
and the brick-shaped
design in between.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.130
So it's very, very
difficult to imagine

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:37.500
the people who made these
two paintings didn't

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.660
see each other's painting.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.997
I mean, this is clearly
a sign of a connection.

00:35:41.997 --> 00:35:44.330
There are no other paintings
like this through the area.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.630
So this is a very
particular link

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.260
between these two buildings,
suggests a particular part

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.470
of a network there.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.530
And if we do this for
all the other symbols,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.910
we end up with this very,
very complicated set

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.080
of links between houses.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.220
I've linked here houses
that have leopard

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.220
relies, or have these
bear-splayed figures, or horn

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.540
benches, or painted
hands, or something.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.640
So these different ways
in which these symbols

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.620
connect different parts
of the settlement.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:22.800
Another very important way
that buildings were connected

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.500
is through burial.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.720
And I haven't talked so far
about how people were buried.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.637
But Catalhoyuk is
as much an acropolis

00:36:30.637 --> 00:36:33.300
as it is a settlement.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.670
And the size of
these circles here

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.590
is an indicator
of how many people

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.980
are buried beneath the
floors of the houses.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.450
And you can see that some
houses have no burials,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.110
whereas some have quite a lot.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:55.530
So beneath the house
floors, people are buried.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:01.760
And you can have up to 62 people
buried beneath one house floor.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.360
And 62 is many too
many people to be

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.590
produced by one small family
living in one of these houses.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.060
So this suggests that people are
being buried into these houses

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.870
from other houses, and that's
why some houses have lots

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.810
of burials, and some have none.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.600
So we see that houses
are connected by the fact

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.740
that they bury together.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.970
So there's a community
of houses that

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.360
bury their dead in a
central burial house.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.860
And as I said before,
that central burial house

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.730
is no different from
any other house.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.620
It doesn't have
any special status.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.070
It is just a burial house.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:48.430
But we also find that the
people buried in these houses

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.680
ate together.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.020
And we know that because
we can study the isotopes,

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.500
the bone isotopes.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.290
And so here, we've got
carbon and nitrogen isotopes,

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.590
and we're looking at individuals
from these different houses.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.970
And where you have the
same symbol of use,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.240
that's because they are
buried in the same house.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.740
So you can see that
there's actually

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.909
a lot of clustering in this.

00:38:10.909 --> 00:38:12.700
But you can see that
some clustering that's

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.880
been marked out, the
result of clustering

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.950
are the overlaps here.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.950
And particularly this
group of squares over here

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.980
suggests some sort
of clustering.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.490
So this suggests that people
ate together as well as

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.220
buried together.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.100
So the group of houses
that buried together also

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:28.890
ate together.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.770
And you might think, oh
well, that's obvious.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.190
These are somehow
extended nuclear families.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.620
But it becomes more
complicated than that.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.200
So we haven't been able-- I
can't show you yet ancient DNA

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.900
results that we've been doing.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.780
We had great difficulty getting
ancient DNA out of Catalhoyuk,

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.650
and we're now in
a new program that

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.640
seems to be more successful.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.450
So I can't show you results
from the ancient DNA work.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:02.610
But what we have been
doing is use teeth

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:08.650
as a proxy for
genetic proximity.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.170
So what has happened
here is that we've

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.470
taken teeth from the
individuals in the houses

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.390
and measured 53 different
dimensions of teeth, which

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.490
are thought to be
aspects of teeth which

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.880
are genetically transmitted.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.850
And so it should be the case
that if you find clusters

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.400
of individuals
with similar teeth,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.730
that they should be closely
related genetically.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.300
So we do find these clusters,
but they're not in the houses.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.480
They're all spread around
all over the place.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.430
It's not the case
that people who

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:49.090
are buried in the same house
are any more closely related

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.590
to each other than people
in the community at large.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.260
So how do you explain that?

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.630
Well, the way we
explain it, and there

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.800
are ethnographic
parallels for this,

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.410
is that soon after
birth, children

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.240
are distributed
around the settlement.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.450
So you don't grow up with
your mother and father,

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.500
your genetic mother and father.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.040
You grow up with other
members of the community

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.830
in other buildings,
in other houses.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.560
So cross-cutting all
of this, cross-cutting

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.360
the groups of people who bury
and have all these symbols,

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.340
you also have all the
genetic cross-cutting things,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.210
where people are
linked to each other

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:34.210
through their genetic histories.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.390
In a way, the whole of
Catalhoyuk, because of this way

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.550
children are treated,
the whole of Catalhoyuk

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:45.760
is one family that's
all tied together.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.900
And so this is a very,
very dense network.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.240
It means that any
individual house

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.440
can call on lots and lots of
different types of relationship

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.740
if they run out of food,
or if they have a bad year,

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.930
or if they have
difficulties in some sort.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:06.000
So why do people come
together at Catalhoyuk?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.550
In my view, they
mainly come together,

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.270
not only at this
site, at other sites,

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.270
because they can link
into these very, very

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.400
dense, complex networks
that supports them

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.870
when there are times of
hardship, or they need support.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.420
By coming together,
one can become involved

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.210
in this very dense network.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.880
And it's this dense
network, and the sets

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.120
of beliefs that go along with
it, that create the conformity,

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:40.340
and that create the
set of social rules

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.460
that organize and run
the society as a whole.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.210
I just want to add another
way in which this happens.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:56.100
So at Catalhoyuk,
when you were buried,

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.940
you sometimes had your head
removed after a period of time.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:06.000
So maybe a year later, somebody
went down and took off the head

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.380
from that individual, and then
reburied the bones and so on.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.760
So the head was taken out.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.910
And these heads, we know, were
kept for a long period of time.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.130
So they were often painted.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.320
Sometimes, the facial
features were plastered back

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.025
onto the skull.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.600
They were circulated for
a long period of time.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.630
And then ultimately, they were
deposited in various ways.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.710
Sometimes they were deposited
at the base of the posts that

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.210
hold up the house.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.060
So the ancestor, if you
like, was holding up a house.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.030
In this particular case,
there's a plastered skull here.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.530
You can't probably
see it very well,

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.700
but there's skull in
here with the nose

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.700
and the facial
features plastered on,

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.100
and this is a reconstruction
here, the plastered face.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.600
And this is a woman's skull.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.390
And this is a woman.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:08.070
So this skull was kept in
society for quite a long period

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.890
of time before being
deposited with this woman when

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.300
she was buried.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.520
So if you came to Catalhoyuk, as
you moved around the site, you

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.420
what you would find
in the Neolithic

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.650
that there were body
parts, human body parts,

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.540
that were being circulated
in the community as a whole.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.100
These are mainly
skulls, but we also

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.760
have evidence that arms and
legs and other parts of the body

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.570
were kept and circulated.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.872
So again, you see how
this creates a network.

00:43:36.872 --> 00:43:39.080
All the people who are
associated with the skull, who

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.370
are related to the skull, all
the people who were related

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.880
to the individual from
whom the skull was obtained

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.260
and so on, again it
creates is very, very sort

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.790
of dense network of people.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.560
So what I've tried to
argue is that at one level,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.360
there are a lot of similarities
between Gobekli and Catalhoyuk.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.390
Very similar sets of symbolism.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.900
But the big difference is
that at Catalhoyuk, this

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.910
has become a domestic
cult, and has

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.300
integrated into everyday life.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.490
And Gobekli, it's very much
part of a ritual center.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.270
And in concluding,
what I've been trying

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:27.630
to argue is that these types
of collective ritual action

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.560
occur in both places
associated with the killing,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.440
teasing, baiting, and
feasting on wild animals

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.440
and creating memories
around those events,

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.440
but as well as this focus on
the collective of that type,

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.880
we also get the focus on
death and ancestry, which

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.080
not only, again, create
linkages and relationships

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.530
between people, but also very
crucially create time depth.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.520
So it's not enough
to have a network.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.820
You need to have that
network that has time depth.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:09.260
And that's because of the nature
of intensive use of resources

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.630
and agriculture.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.300
In agriculture, there
is a delayed return

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.310
for your labor input.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:20.520
As a hunter-gatherer, we
go of and kill an animal,

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.270
and we share it, and then
we can just disperse.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.780
There's nothing to
hold us together.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.700
But with farming, we
clear the land together,

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:37.550
and we invest in plows, or
in other types of equipment.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:41.420
So we've invested, and we have
to hold the community together

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.280
before we get to
return for that labor.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.310
And so the crucial
distinction about farmers

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.630
is that they have time depth.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.370
And the important thing
is that time debt focus

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.940
emerged very early,
even before farming,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.850
and before settled life.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:02.170
The focus on history making
happens very, very early,

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.310
as hunter-gatherers
become more intensive

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.210
and start investing in
more and more things.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.160
And that takes me
into another topic,

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.590
which the a topic of my book,
which is "Entanglement,"

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.610
because I think a very
important key thing here,

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.660
which I haven't talked about,
is how humans just get entangled

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.150
in more and more stuff.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.580
And that entanglement leads
to longer term relationships

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.290
of various sorts.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.270
But the domestication
of plants and animals

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.750
is an example of entanglement.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.550
But one could extend that to
all the other types of things

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.260
like houses, and
pottery, and so on that

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.260
people are beginning
to make at this time.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.467
So thank you very much, and I
look forward to your comments.

00:46:41.467 --> 00:46:46.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.480
MALE SPEAKER: Questions.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.720
AUDIENCE: How far is
Catalhoyuk from Gobekli?

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.430
IAN HODDER: Quite a long way.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.650
So Gobekli is the right in
the southeast of Turkey,

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:00.412
and Catalhoyuk is
right in the middle.

00:47:00.412 --> 00:47:02.620
I figured I actually don't
know what the numbers are,

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.280
but it must be 600,
700, 800 kilometers.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.460
Something like that.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.450
AUDIENCE: How does the
kind of observations

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:13.200
of ritual and
culture in this area

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.270
compare to other areas
of the ancient world?

00:47:18.265 --> 00:47:20.890
IAN HODDER: Well, I should say,
when you say the ancient world,

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.600
there are lots and
lots of locations

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.362
for the origins of agriculture.

00:47:26.362 --> 00:47:28.320
It used to be thought
that there were very few,

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.840
but now we recognize that
you have independent origins,

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.490
obviously in China, in New
Guinea, in the Americas,

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.980
in Africa, and so on.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.140
So there are lots and
lots of independent,

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.690
with different crops,
and different processes,

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.240
and different sequences.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.570
So on the whole, the modern view
is that very different things

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.270
happen in different places.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.451
And I'm not trying to make
an argument, generally.

00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:56.450
I'm just trying to make
an argument for this one

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:57.670
particular case.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.952
Which is often seen
as a sort of key case,

00:47:59.952 --> 00:48:01.410
because it's probably
the earliest.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:06.440
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
I forgot the name,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.740
but there's a site in Jordan
that's supposed to be--

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.849
IAN HODDER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:11.390
AUDIENCE: No.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.040
Before that.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.170
IAN HODDER: Gobekli?

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.961
AUDIENCE: It was in
Steve [INAUDIBLE] book.

00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:14.850
No, in Jordan.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:19.710
It was Ain-something or other
that he, according to his book,

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.730
it's been populated
since 10,000 BC,

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.350
and they also
developed agriculture

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.750
while they were living there.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.010
So they were first
just collecting,

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.860
and then started planting
later, and stuff like that.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.277
I think it's about
the same time--

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:34.318
IAN HODDER: That's right.

00:48:34.318 --> 00:48:35.375
It's probably Ain Ghazal.

00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:35.875
Yes.

00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:36.660
Yeah.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.830
AUDIENCE: So how-- I
mean, from what I read,

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.510
they don't have the
same amount of ritual

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.270
as you described in Catalhoyuk.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.030
And how would you
compare the two?

00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:52.800
IAN HODDER: Ain Ghazal does have
a lot of very elaborate ritual.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.390
I mean, particularly ancestral
cults of various sorts.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.280
There are quite
remarkable collections

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:03.380
of these plastered figures
that were found in a big pit.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.375
And do you know--

00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:07.250
AUDIENCE: They look
like-- not the leopards--

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:08.020
IAN HODDER: No, no, no.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.560
And so--

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.850
AUDIENCE: And all
the animal parts.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.160
IAN HODDER: No, that's right.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.190
AUDIENCE: And neither
the type of structure

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:16.770
where they use the
roofs for access,

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.400
and just throw out stuff.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.992
They seem to be more easygoing.

00:49:22.992 --> 00:49:25.818
IAN HODDER: [LAUGHING]

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.700
I mean, Gobekli and Catalhoyuk
are really distinctive,

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.100
in that for various
reasons, they

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.330
have this enormous concentration
of stuff that survived.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.440
And you do get little
bits and pieces of it

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.360
in nearly all these other sites.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.540
You get, for
example, a depiction

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.715
of a headless body, or a
vulture, or a bucranium,

00:49:45.715 --> 00:49:47.440
which is a bull's head.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.160
So there are lots of bits and
pieces all over the place.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.440
But in general terms, all of
it is about either wild animals

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.610
or about ancestry.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.990
And I imagine that you
have similar amounts stuff,

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.800
but a lot of it will be on
things that haven't survived.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.530
And Catalhoyuk and Gobekli, it's
just lucky for various reasons

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.080
that their stuff
was preserved there.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.970
AUDIENCE: So do you find
any evidence of conflict

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.580
with outsiders?

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:20.112
Do find any evidence of
protection structures

00:50:20.112 --> 00:50:21.070
or something like that?

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.400
Or is this just a settlement,
and you know, like everybody

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.054
was living peacefully?

00:50:26.054 --> 00:50:26.720
IAN HODDER: Yes.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:31.060
So the dominant
view of my project

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.380
so far has been
that it's a society

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.250
with very little violence.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:41.010
There are not being defensive
structures of any sort.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.140
And there is no evidence
of lots of violent attack.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.240
So in many archaeological
sites around the world

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.230
of a later time period,
you find skeletons

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.120
with arrowheads stuck
through the spine,

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.970
or stuck through the skull.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:58.160
We haven't found anything
like that at all.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.210
So in my view, this was a
very, very well-ordered,

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:07.305
structured, peaceful society.

00:51:07.305 --> 00:51:11.730
Catalhoyuk is very much on its
own in a very large landscape,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.940
so there's not a lot of
competition from outside.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.220
But that has been
recent work that

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.140
is starting to
challenge a bit of that,

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.100
because more careful
study is showing

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.880
a lot of depressed fractures
on skulls on Catalhoyuk people.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.330
And these seem to be
healed structures.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.960
It's not the people were
dying as a result of this.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.130
And so it may be more that there
was a sort of ritual conflict

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.960
warfare process
going on, which is

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.450
very common in these types of
societies, where people would

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.250
fight some battles,
and they would hit

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.060
each other over the
head, not to kill them,

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.270
but as part of these
ritual practices.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:55.699
So probably, it wasn't as
peaceful as one imagines.

00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:57.990
But we're doing more work on
trying to understand that.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.990
But certainly, there
wasn't large-scale warfare,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.209
or anything like that.

00:52:02.209 --> 00:52:03.750
MALE SPEAKER: Well
with that, join me

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:07.440
in thanking Ian for sharing
the Neolithic story.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.990
[APPLAUSE]
