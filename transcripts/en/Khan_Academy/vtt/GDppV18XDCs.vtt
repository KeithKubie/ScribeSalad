00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.940
Lisa owns a "Random
Candy" vending machine,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.030
which is a machine
that picks a candy out

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.910
of an assortment in
a random fashion.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.750
Lisa controls the probability
in which each candy is picked.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.160
She is running out
of "Honey Bunny,"

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.700
so she wants to
program its probability

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.000
so that the probability of
getting a different candy twice

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.390
in a row is greater than 2
and 1/4 times the probability

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.415
of getting "Honey
Bunny" in one try.

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:28.940
So let me read that again.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.080
She wants to program
its probability

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.670
so that the probability of
getting a different candy twice

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.170
in a row, or really any
other candy twice in a row,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.450
is greater than 2 and 1/4 times
the probability of getting

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.510
"Honey Bunny" in one try.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.430
Write an inequality that
models the situation.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.730
Use p to represent
the probability

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.210
of getting "Honey
Bunny" in one try.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.994
Solve the inequality, and
complete the sentence.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:57.410
Remember that the
probability must

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.140
be a number between 0 and 1.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.020
So we want to write
the inequality

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.701
that models the problem here.

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.450
And then we want to
complete the sentence,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.574
the probability of getting
"Honey Bunny" in one try

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:08.800
must be-- so they give
us a bunch of options.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.300
Greater than, greater than or
equal to, less than, less than

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.110
or equal to, and then we
have to put some number here.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.900
So to work through this, I've
copy and pasted this problem

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.640
onto my little scratch
pad right over here.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.010
And so let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.780
So they tell us,
use p to represent

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.530
the probability of getting
"Honey Bunny" in one try.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.200
And they also say she wants
to program its probability so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.060
that the probability of
getting a different candy twice

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.760
in a row is greater than 2 and
1/4 the probability of getting

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.300
"Honey Bunny" in one try.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.800
So if p is the probability of
getting "Honey Bunny," what's

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.980
the probability of getting
any other candy at once?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.569
Well, that's going
to be 1 minus p.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.860
If you have a probability of
p of getting "Honey Bunny,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.289
well, then it's 1 minus p of
anything but "Honey Bunny."

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.330
Now, what's the probability
of getting this twice

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.990
in a row, of getting
anything else twice in a row?

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.610
Well, you're just
going to multiply

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.280
this probability times itself.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.290
It's going to be 1
minus p times 1 minus p,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.560
or we could just write
that as 1 minus p squared.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.790
So this right over
here is the probability

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.320
of getting a different
candy, any other candy,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.670
twice in a row.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:34.840
So prob of any other non-"Honey
Bunny" candy, any other candy,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.730
twice in a row.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.170
Now, they tell us
that this probability

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.800
needs to be greater than 2
and 1/4 times the probability

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.780
of getting "Honey
Bunny" in one try.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.312
So is greater than
2 and 1/4 times

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:02.270
the probability of getting
"Honey Bunny" in one

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.610
try, well, that is p-- times p.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.860
So we have just set
up the first part.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.710
We have written an inequality
that models the situation.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.440
Now let's actually
solve this inequality.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.200
And so to do that, I will just
expand 1 minus p squared out.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.307
1 minus p squared is the
same thing as-- well,

00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:25.390
I'll just multiply it out.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:34.600
So this is going to be 1
squared minus 2p plus p squared.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.010
And that's going to be
greater than 2 and 1/4 p.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.320
Now let's see.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.900
If we subtract 2 and
1/4 p from both sides,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.840
we're going to be left with--
and I'm going to reorder this.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.650
We're going to get p squared.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.280
So you have minus 2p
minus 2 and 1/4 p,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.190
so that's going to get
us minus 4 and 1/4 p.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.350
Or let me just write
that as 17/4 p plus 1 is

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.880
greater than 0.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.160
And so let's think about solving
this quadratic right over here.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.350
And under which circumstances
is this greater than 0?

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.354
To think about it,
let's factor it.

00:04:26.354 --> 00:04:27.770
And actually,
before we factor it,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.410
let's simplify it a little bit.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.050
I don't like having this
17/4 right over here,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.850
so let's multiply
both sides times 4.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.530
And since 4 is a
positive number,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.650
it's not going to
change the sign,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.830
the direction of
this inequality.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.870
So we could rewrite
this as 4p squared

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.165
minus 17p plus 4
is greater than 0.

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:55.930
And let's see.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.147
What are the roots of this?

00:04:57.147 --> 00:04:58.730
And we could use the
quadratic formula

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.188
if we wanted to do
it really quick.

00:05:00.188 --> 00:05:02.160
We could probably
do it other ways.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.240
But negative b-- so it's
going to be 17 plus or minus

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:16.810
the square root of negative 17
squared-- b squared-- so that's

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.910
289 minus 4 times a times c.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.280
Well a times c is 16
times 4, so minus 64.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.170
All of that over 2 times
a-- all of that over 8.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.040
So that's 17 plus
or minus-- let's

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.780
see, this is the square
root of 225 over 8,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.440
which is equal to 17
plus or minus 15 over 8,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.370
which is equal to-- let's
see, 17 minus 15 over 8

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.250
is 2/8-- which is
equal to 2/8 or 1/4.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.750
So that's one of them.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.520
That's when we take the minus.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.290
And if we add 17 plus 15, that
gets us to 32 divided by 8

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.600
is 4.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.990
So there's two situations
right over here.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.670
Let's factor this out.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:22.130
We could write this as p
minus 1/4 times p minus 4

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.650
is greater than 0.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.070
So under what circumstances
is this going to be true?

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.280
What constraints are
this going to be true?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.630
Well if you're taking
the product of two terms

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.840
and they are going
to be greater than 0,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.800
that means that these two
things have to be the same sign.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.230
Or actually, in particular,
they both have to be positive,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.870
or they both have
to be negative.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.990
So let's look at
those two situations.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.660
And I'll switch colors
here just for fun--

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.530
so both positive
or both negative.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.200
So if they are both
positive-- let me do it here.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.120
That means that p minus 1/4
has to be greater than 0,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.630
and p minus 4 is greater than 0.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.110
Add 1/4 on both sides
right over here.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:30.770
You get p is greater than
1/4, and p is greater than 4.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.650
So that's the situation
where they are both positive.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.000
Now, what about if
they are both negative?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.380
Well then you have p minus 1/4
is less than 0, and p minus 4

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.580
is less than 0.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.240
Add 1/4 here.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:08:01.690
So p needs to be less than 1/4,
and p needs to be less than 4.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:07.320
Now, what does this
constraint simplify to?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.160
p has to be greater than 1/4,
and p has to be greater than 4.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.680
Well, if p is
greater than 4, it's

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.610
definitely going to
be greater than 1/4.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:22.140
So all of this collapses into
p needs to be greater than 4.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.230
That's the situation
where both are positive.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.430
p must be greater than 4.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.230
Now what about here?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.140
Well if p is less than
1/4, it's definitely

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.740
going to be less than four.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.580
And this is an and right over
here, so this collapses to p

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.140
is a less than 1/4.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.260
So which one do we go with--
p needs to be greater than 4,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.406
or p needs to be less than 1/4?

00:08:47.406 --> 00:08:48.780
Well, we need to
remind ourselves

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.290
that we're talking
about a probability.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.748
To go back to the
original problem,

00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:53.650
we're talking about a
probability of someone

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.025
getting "Honey
Bunny" in one try.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:57.990
A probability must
be between 0 and 1,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.150
so the probability having
to be greater than 4,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.120
well that just doesn't
make any sense.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.310
That doesn't make any sense in
the context of this question.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.140
So we have to go with the
probability of getting

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.510
"Honey Bunny" needs to be less
than 1/4, or less than 0.25,

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.200
which makes complete sense.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.540
So let's fill in
this information.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.840
This was the inequality
that modeled the problem.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.010
And we got p has to
be less than 1/4.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.670
So let's go back to
the original problem.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:38.030
The inequality was 1
minus p squared needs

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.750
to be greater than 2 and 1/4.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.370
So we could write
that multiple times.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.792
I could write that
as 2.25 times p.

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:49.250
And then the
probability of getting

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:57.750
"Honey Bunny" in one try
must be less than 0.25.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.640
And we're done.
