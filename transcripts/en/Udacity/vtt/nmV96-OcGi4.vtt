00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.740
Here are the answers. So, for the first question,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.268
we had 12 modulo three and 12 is equal to

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:10.205
three times four. So, that means, if we divide

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:14.424
12 by three we get four with no remainder. So,

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.608
that means, the result of 12 modulo three is

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:20.390
zero. For the second question, we could solve this by

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.180
figuring out what ord of a is. But we don't

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.912
actually need to. We know that the value of ord

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:28.020
for 'a' is always going to be the same every

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.790
time we do it. So this is saying, the same value

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.820
modular the same value, the result is always going to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.970
be zero. Because anything is divisible by itself with no remainder.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.610
So that answer's also zero. For part C, well now

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.800
we've added three. In order to know what the result is

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.850
here, we've got to know whether ord of 'z' is greater

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.030
than or less than three. As long as ord of z

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.950
is greater than three, well that would mean ord of

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.480
z plus three modulo ord of z must be three,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.780
because the remainder will be what we added to ord

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.690
of z, since ord of z by itself is always divisible

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.319
by ord of z. And we do know that ord

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.160
of z is greater than threeSo that means the result will

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.340
be 3, so let's try that last one in the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.690
Python interpreter. We're going to print the value of ord of z,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.190
plus three, modulo ord of z, and when we run that, we see the result is three,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.530
and I want to point out that the parentheses

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.110
here are actually important, if we didn't have them

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.610
We tried the order z, plus three order z,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.700
then we get the result 125. And the reason

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.320
for that is, the grouping here is going to

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.060
group three mod ord z and add that towards ord z,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.290
so it's a different value, and the reason we get 125 is the value

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.410
of ord z by it's self. Is 122. So it's 122, which is ord

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.746
of z, plus three mod ord of z, which is three mod 122, which is

00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:02.810
three, which is why we got 125 when we evaluated this without the parentheses.
