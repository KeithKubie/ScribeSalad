00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:02.453
- [Instructor] We are now
going to cover the famous

00:00:02.453 --> 00:00:04.666
or perhaps infamous potato problem

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.249
from the 2017 AP Calculus exam.

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:09.921
At time t equals zero,

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.348
a boiled potato is taken
from a pot on a stove

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:15.429
and left to cool in a kitchen.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.755
The internal temperature of the potato

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.422
is 91 degrees Celsius
at time t equals zero,

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:25.980
and the internal temperature
of the potato is greater than

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.776
27 degrees for all times
t greater than zero.

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:31.863
I would guess that the
ambient room temperature

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:33.673
is 27 degrees Celsius.

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:36.129
And so that's why the
temperature would approach this,

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.851
but it would always stay a
little bit greater than that,

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.149
as t gets larger and larger.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.305
The internal temperature of the potato

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.706
at time t minutes can be
modeled by the function H

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:51.225
that satisfies the
differential equation dH/dt,

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.027
the derivative of our internal temperature

00:00:53.027 --> 00:00:57.339
with respect to time, is equal
to negative 1/4 times our,

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.235
the difference between
our internal temperature

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:01.076
and the ambient room temperature,

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:04.193
where H of t is measured
in degrees Celsius

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:07.132
and H of zero is equal to 91.

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:11.226
So before I even read part
(a), let's just make sense

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:13.352
of what this differential
equation is telling us,

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:16.548
and let's see if it's
consistent with our intuition.

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:19.565
So let me draw some axes here.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:21.315
So this is my y-axis.

00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:25.021
So that is my y-axis.

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.930
And this right over here is my t-axis.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.780
Now the ambient room temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.504
so I'll just draw there.

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.709
That's what the room temperature is doing.

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.383
And so we know at t equals zero,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:42.311
our potato is at 91 degrees.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:46.332
So let's see, that's 27, 91
might be right over there.

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:49.119
91, this is all in degrees Celsius.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.019
And what you would expect
intuitively is that it would start

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.477
to cool and when its temperature,

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:56.260
when there's a big difference between

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.612
the potato and the room,

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:59.995
maybe its rate of change is steeper

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.574
than when there's a little difference.

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:06.223
So you would expect the graph
to look something like this.

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:08.069
So you would expect it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.651
to look something like
this and then asymptote

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.318
towards a temperature
of 27 degrees Celsius.

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:17.828
So this is what you would expect to see,

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:21.619
and this differential equation
is consistent with that,

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.196
where the rate of change,

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:25.052
notice this is for all
t greater than zero,

00:02:25.052 --> 00:02:26.773
this is going to be a negative value

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:29.847
because our potato is greater than 27

00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:30.858
for t greater than zero.

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.623
So this part here is going to be positive,

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:36.132
but then you multiply
positive times negative 1/4.

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:38.371
You're constantly going to
have a negative rate of change,

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:39.361
which makes sense.

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.527
The potato is cooling down.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.525
And it also makes sense
that your rate of change

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:47.607
is proportional to the difference
between the temperature

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:50.177
of the potato and the
ambient room temperature.

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:51.504
When there's a big difference,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.835
you expect a steeper rate of change.

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:55.558
But then when there's
less of a difference,

00:02:55.558 --> 00:02:57.124
the rate of change, you could imagine,

00:02:57.124 --> 00:02:59.256
becomes less and less and less negative,

00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:02.854
as we asymptote towards
the ambient temperature.

00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:06.923
So with this out of the way,
now let's tackle part (a).

00:03:06.923 --> 00:03:11.226
Write an equation for the
line tangent to the graph

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:13.059
of H at t equals zero.

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:17.750
Use this equation to approximate
the internal temperature

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.755
of the potato at time t equals three.

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:22.282
So what are we going to do?

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:23.764
Well, we're gonna think about

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:27.462
what's going on at time t equal zero,

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:28.775
right over here.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.433
We want the equation of the tangent line,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:35.880
which might look something like this,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.297
at t equals zero.

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:42.418
So this thing would be
of the form y is equal to

00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:45.297
the slope of the equation
of the tangent line.

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:48.316
Well, it would be the
derivative of our function

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:50.857
at that point, so dH/dt,

00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:52.371
times t,

00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:54.585
plus our y-intercept.

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:57.232
Where does it intersect the y-axis here?

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:59.755
Well, when t is equal to zero,

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:02.375
the value of this
equation is going to be 91

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.660
because it intersects our
graph right at that point,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.058
that point zero comma 91,

00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:07.891
plus 91.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.261
So what is our derivative
of H with respect to t

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:16.481
at time t equals zero, right
at this point right over here?

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.349
Well, we just have to look at this.

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.256
You could also write this as
H prime of t right over here.

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:26.256
So if we want to think about H prime

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:28.806
of zero,

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:32.326
that's going to be equal to negative 1/4

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:33.576
times H of zero

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:36.128
minus 27.

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:38.427
What is our initial temperature minus 27?

00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:40.408
This is, of course, 91 degrees.

00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:41.721
They tell us that multiple times.

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.657
We've even drawn it a few times.

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:44.824
91 minus 27 is

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:48.241
64.

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:52.890
64 times negative 1/4
is equal to negative 16.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.207
So this is negative 16 right over here.

00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:57.195
So just like that, we have the equation

00:04:57.195 --> 00:04:59.246
for the line tangent to the graph

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.031
of H at t is equal to zero.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.668
I'll write it one more time.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:05.128
It is, do a mini drum roll here,

00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:08.128
y is equal to negative 16 t plus 91.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:12.089
That's the equation of that
tangent line right over there.

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.506
And then they say we
want to use this equation

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:16.824
to approximate the internal
temperature of the potato

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.771
at time t equals three.

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:20.541
So let's say that this is time

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:23.222
t equals three right over here.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.264
We want to approximate the temperature

00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:27.400
that this model describes,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.473
right over here, but we're
gonna do it using the line.

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:32.609
So we're gonna evaluate
the line at t equals three.

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.581
So then we would get, let's see,

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.172
negative 16 times three

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.005
plus 91

00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:42.512
is equal to, this is negative 48

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:45.921
plus 91 is equal to, what is that?

00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:46.754
43,

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:50.894
so this is equal to 43 degrees Celsius.

00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:54.466
So this right over here is the equation

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:56.527
for the line tangent to the graph of H

00:05:56.527 --> 00:05:58.764
at t is equal to zero,

00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:00.779
and this right over here
is our approximation

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.155
using that equation of the tangent line

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:06.050
of the internal temperature
of the potato at time

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.429
t is equal to three.
