00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
optimize your pages for different screen

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.503
sizes, including the difference between
CSS and device-independent pixels,

00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:14.300
and how to choose the right sizes for
your elements.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.580
&gt;&gt; And at the end of the lesson,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.470
you'll build the mobile
version of the hometown site.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.990
Now, when I'm working on my sites,
sometimes I notice that content seems to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
flow off the page or I have to pinch and
zoom to see anything.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410
What's going on here?

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.930
&gt;&gt; Well besides your CSS which
could use a little bit of work,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.760
the biggest problem is that you don't
have the viewport set properly.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.430
The viewport defines the area of
the screen that the browser can

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.250
render content to.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.190
Here, let me show you an example.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.970
In my laptop, I've sized the browser
window to 800 pixels wide,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.880
which makes my view port 800 pixels.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.640
If I expand the width,
the view port size changes, and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
now I have a view port
width of 1000 pixels.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.180
&gt;&gt; All right,
well that seems simple enough.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.000
But not all displays have
the same pixel density right.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.500
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.180
&gt;&gt; Like what about something like
your Chromebook pixel display.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.258
Well the Chromebook pixel display,

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:14.290
tells me that it's got a width
of 2,560 pixels by 1,700 pixels.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.150
But when I make the browser
window the full width.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.900
And ask for the view port width.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020
It tells me its only 1280 pixels wide.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.752
&gt;&gt; Wait.
Not the full 2560.

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.355
&gt;&gt; Nope.
Not at all.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:29.012
&gt;&gt; Hm.
Well not all pixels were created equal.

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:30.139
Were they?
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.950
A pixel isn't always a pixel.
