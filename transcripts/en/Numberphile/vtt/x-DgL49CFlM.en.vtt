00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
So we're going to talk about space-filling curves.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.200
So... already that sounds sort of, counter-intuitive, like a curve,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.960
is like a one, like its a very skinny one-dimensional thing but space is like...

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.340
...two-dimensional or something so how can you have a curve?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.620
That fills up everything in space? So...

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.360
We're going to build a curve starting with something very simple and then we're going to sort of change it.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.340
Uh, so, lets start with, this curve here.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.820
So this is three sides of square.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.720
So at the moment this is really not very, space-filling, right?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.600
Its just three lines, so we need to kind of make it more squiggly and we'll get there.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.280
So lets draw a grid, on this, so...

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.100
Like, four squares, and so my curve is like going through the centers of those squares.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.600
So what we're going to do to make this, uh, red curve more squiggly...

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.120
...is...

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.560
...divide each of these squares into four.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.000
So I can chop it up...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.280
We wanna make a more squiggly version of this but we're going to use this same shape.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.260
So here's how you do it; you sort of have to rotate it a little bit to make it work so...

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.620
There's the same shape but I've rotated it.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.740
And then we'll do one like that,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.560
another one like that,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.540
and one like this.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.120
And then, we need to connect them up, so let's,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.340
connect up like this,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.020
like this, like this.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.880
And you can see this is, maybe slightly more space-filling?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.540
Like, its getting more places than this one was,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.900
And its sort of made of the same stuff.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.620
So, well, lets do another one, why not?

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.540
And then in each one of these squares I need to put this thing here, so let me...

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.580
...make a...

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.820
...a grid.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.440
And then I just have to turn things the right way again.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.480
So I wanna take this thing,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.340
and rotate it and put it here.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.140
So its gonna start like that...

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.060
...and its gonna end like that.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.320
And in the middle its going to do this...

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.260
And its gonna do this...

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.280
And let's connect them up with red, 'cos...

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.360
OK so we got that shape,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.020
and then this one over here,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.300
let's do this one next 'cos its easy 'cos its just, its just the reflection of this one...

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.720
OK so connect them up, boop, boop, boop.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.000
And then these, I'm gonna go to this now, so this is gonna be like that...

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.060
(whispered) Connect up, connect up, connect up.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.240
OK, and then again, we, connect up in the same way,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.480
we do across like that,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.600
and like that,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.760
and like that.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.820
And, we've got something that's...

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.920
more squiggly, more, sort of, space-filling.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.440
And you can see how you would just, like, continue doing this.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.600
So, so this is the Hilbert curve.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.520
So this was invented by, or discovered,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.040
by David Hilbert in 1891.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.680
Really these are like steps in the construction of it.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.480
The Hilbert Curve is when you do this infinitely many times.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.780
(Brady, off camera) You're using a sharpie which has thickness to it,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.280
Right.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.980
(Brady) but surely a theoretical line has no thickness...

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.400
Yeah, zero thickness.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.140
(Brady) ...So if something has zero thickness how can it fill any space?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.360
Well, right, every step...

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.480
...the thing that you have has no thickness, its filling nothing,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.740
but somehow when you go infinitely far...

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.660
...well actually what happens is that...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.800
...in a, rigorous way which, I'm not going to get into,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.620
but, actually what happens when you go infinitely far,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.300
this, curve,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.200
hits every point of the square.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.540
So somehow, at the limit, when you get infinitely far,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.820
boom, you've got everything.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.580
This construction is not just used for this sort of infinite thing, this is also...

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.960
...um, you know, a, uh, way to, sort of pack,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.460
sort of two-dimensional data, in a one-dimensional order, right?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.760
So, s'pose you have, a bunch of two-dimensional data,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460
that you need to store for some reason,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.780
and you need to store it in some linear order,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.120
but you also want this bit of data,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.500
and this bit of data,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.200
they're quite close to each other in two dimensions and you would like them to be close to each other in the ordering.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.700
And the Hilbert Curve kind of gives you a way of,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.080
uh, often two points that are close together in two dimensions are also close together in the linear order.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.720
Right, whereas if you did, like,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.260
you know, just sort of, if you just ordered it by rows,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.560
then that's sort of, less likely to be true.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.960
Anyway, so its important in, um, computer science...

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.020
I think there's even some theories that the way DNA is packed up when its wrapped up in a chromosome is sort of like this.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.840
But anyway, so what I was interested in was,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.980
this, sequence of curves, like the sequence of polygons, how you get there.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.540
And so you can think of this, like as an animation,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.960
going from one to the next, to the next, and so on through time,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.920
or, you could think of this, as,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.420
space rather than time, so, well...

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.680
So there we go, this is a, 3D-printed sculpture that shows this construction.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.520
At the very top,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.440
you've got the original curve,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.620
and then...

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.600
Well so you can see there's like a band here, that's just a sort of, intermediate band but then the next band down,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.740
So two down,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.500
is the next step of the sequence.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.760
It's probably a little hard to see, but

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.040
it starts here, and then it goes across, and then up,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.100
and then back,  and then it goes up...

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.560
It does that curve that we had before.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.180
And then, it just keeps going down,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.200
so another two steps, and another two steps.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.240
So there's the bottom, that's, that's quite far along,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.640
in the, let's see how many, so the first step, second step,  third step, this is the fifth step,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.180
of that sequence.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.420
And...

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.500
I mean,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.000
in principle I could just keep going, right?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.840
But, it gets very thin, and difficult to print.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.240
So this is one of many space-filling curves, or fractal curves, so...

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.500
Uh, so there's one called the, the Dragon Curve.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.620
(Brady) Oh I like that one.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.300
Yeah, oh right you did one on this.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.080
(Inset video) Lots of them, way more than you can fold a bit of paper,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.300
you get this, rather stunning, pattern...

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.800
 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.660
(Inset video) And it keeps going, but in the middle it gets very intricate.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.000
So how does the Dragon Curve one? So here's the first one you just have a straight line...

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.120
...and then, the next level down, there's,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.940
just a, like a, right angle corner.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.200
And then the next one down, this, this one, every band is another step of the, the Dragon Curve sequence.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.060
And then at the bottom you've got your, Dragon Curve.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.220
So this is like...

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.780
Nine? I think this is nine iterations of the Dragon Curve.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.260
But right, when you ex-, sort of extrude it through space,  you get this, this, cool, uh, this cool shape.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.900
Somebody, somebody once described this to me as a sky-scraper going for a walk.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.100
It's sort of a nice image.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.520
Recognize this shape? That would be the, uh, Sierpinski Triangle,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.620
except there's a curve called the Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.400
Let's turn it around...

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.500
So it starts with, again this is smoothed off a little bit,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.600
but it starts with three sides of a hexagon...

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.880
...and then...

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.620
... well it gets more squiggly, um, but yeah you end up with...

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.140
... the, uh, something that looks like the Sierpinksi Triangle.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.240
I wanted to show you the Clone Troopers.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.100
Uh, [laughs], so,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.120
Right, so, you make all of this,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.240
like this is just math, right, I mean this is just a simple sequence.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.720
But then, once you've made it, and you see the faces...

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.180
The eyes and the noses, and the, and the, mouth here of...

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.160
...um, at least, I don't know, may-maybe you've blacked all...

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.520
...blanked your mind of all references of the prequels, but,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.180
Clone Troopers is what this said to me.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.980
So in the other room there's one based on something called the Terdragon Curve.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.380
It's like the Dragon Curve but there's a three in it,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.220
and there's a slightly different process that does it,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.780
and yeah, this is a, really big one, that we...

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.700
...dyed, in a very large, trash can.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.200
So, final things. This is sort of a three-dimensional version,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.860
of, the two-dimensional Hilbert Curves.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.040
So there's sort of, three-dimensional versions of a lot of these...

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.300
This is the third step, right, so rather than,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.560
showing the whole sequence, sort of as an extruded animation,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.360
this is just the third step, of that sequence.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.960
And you get this very squiggly curve that is filling three-dimensional space.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.380
Or a three-dimensional cube.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.720
So one of the, sort of, really interesting things about this, is like,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.180
so I, I, I'd seen this thing for like, I dunno,

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.480
a year or two, sitting on my computer screen as this,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.200
rigid, perfect mathematical object.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.780
And then, so, you know I order it and I take it out of the box,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.840
And it's springy! I had no idea it was gonna do that.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.540
It's, it's incredibly springy, like you can use, you can even...

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.500
...wear it as a kind of uncomfortable bracelet.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.160
Um, but yeah...

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.580
This one you can see that it's a curve, right, its just a single loop in space, that forms itself back into a cube.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.500
(Brady) And you were surprised by that?

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.960
Yeah! Like, I mean, I guess I could have predicted it maybe?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.780
That, 'cos its just, you know there's no interconnections?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.920
So its just this sort of, like,  single loop, it should be flexible.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.940
But I just never thought of it that way.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.660
And then it was, you know, having the physical thing,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.540
there's, I mean, well, you can not notice that it's all springy.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:41.440
(Brady, voice over) If you enjoy Henry's videos here on Numberphile then you're really going to love his new book,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.600
about visualising mathematics with 3D printing.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.200
I'll put some information about it in the video description.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.640
