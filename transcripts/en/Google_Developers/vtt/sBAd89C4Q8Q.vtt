00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.760
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Okay.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.109
Today we talk about the future of Google Maps.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.660
In this session, we're going to show you a
few more things of the demo you just saw in

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.460
the keynote and then we'll go into the new
API things that Mano and Ken are going to

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
talk about.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.529
Do you like the demo?

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.189
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Okay.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.189
Great.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.880
So my name is Berni, and this is Yatin.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.150
He was the engineering lead on the project
and he's going to show you few things.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Thanks.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.750
So I thought we could start and look at three
things that we couldn't show at the keynote.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.270
So one of the things is the related places.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.640
You saw that I clicked on the museum and then
other museums showed up on the map and then

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.510
you could go around and explore and explore.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.940
So one cool thing is that we can turn it,
actually, into a map on the entire world.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.629
So there's a place here nearby called Monk's
Kettle.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.830
People from San Francisco might know it.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.290
It's known for a great beer selection.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.350
It's a really great pub.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.870
It has a great beer selection.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.200
And you see now that I've searched for it,
all other places show up that are -- like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.439
Gestalt is a bar nearby that also has a great
beer selection.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.030
And if I zoom out, I'll get more places like
that: Seven Hills, Daily Grill.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.340
They're all great.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.830
But one cool thing is I can go further and
further, and then I can, for example, go and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.960
zoom into Austin.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.079
Anyone here from Austin?

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.079
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.079
Right here.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.259
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Okay.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.090
So we'll see whether this actually works,
but you're verifying that those places are

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.070
good.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:51.429
So now we see that the Eastside Showroom shows
up, and the Contigo, and before, I got some

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.270
-- the Flying Saucer Draught Emporium.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.369
That sounds pretty -- is that right?

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.369
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.520
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: So we generated a whole
map for the entire world that is now about

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.170
bars with great beer.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.740
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.680
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Isn't that great?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
So Yatin is going to show you another one
of those photo tours.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.050
&gt;&gt;Yatin Chawathe: Berni showed you a photo
tour of the inside of the Vatican.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.720
What I'm going to show you is another photo
tour that takes us to an even larger scale,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.190
so you can see that we can sort of make this
thing work not just at -- for a single landmark

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.410
like the St. Peter's Basilica but even an
entire city's worth of information.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.050
So this here is a view of the Houses of Parliament
in the center of London, and I am going to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.220
start the photo tour and just watch how it
sort of shows you a little bit of the Houses

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.590
of Parliament, and now it's just you turn
around and you see Big Ben right in the corner

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.080
over there, and it's going a little further
away, showing you a little bit more -- actually,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080
that wasn't Big Ben.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.280
That was the other tower at the other end.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.730
There now you start to see the Big Ben.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.000
These are views of the Big Ben and the Houses
of Parliament taken from the London Eye by

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.890
users just like you uploaded to Google, and
here's the entire city of London seamlessly

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.090
stitched together into a very, very compelling
3D experience.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.150
And Jonah Jones, who was helping Berni with
the demo live at the keynote, and I are going

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.790
to have a full session on how some of the
technical and design details of the new Google

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.120
Maps work.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.260
This will be on Friday, I believe, at 9:00
a.m., so come join us there if you have more

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.260
questions.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.380
And I'll hand it back to Berni to show you
just one other tidbit from the new Google

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.380
Maps.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.380
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Okay.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.380
Thanks.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.950
So we use actually cinematic principles to
steer the camera.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.190
The algorithm knows the dramatic effects that
are required to get to this stage, so very

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.190
cool.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.190
So you should definitely go.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.190
So I have a question.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.880
Does anybody know what happened last Thursday
afternoon?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.640
Anyone from Australia here?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.380
You cheated.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.070
Nobody?

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.070
Yell it out.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.880
&gt;&gt; (Speaker is off microphone - Eclipse)
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Very well.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.020
So what we're going to do now is go and change
the system time to last Thursday.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.230
A little bit later.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.170
I think like 5:00 p.m. would be good.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.170
Okay.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.740
So we go back here.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.690
What is happening?

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:53.930
So let's go to Earth and start zooming out.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.910
Let's see the world.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:14.090
And so now that we look here at the sun, you
see that there is a little black spot here.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.540
So that's the moon.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.850
And then we turn around.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.120
So the -- I told you that the stars and the
Milky Way and the sun were in the correct

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.250
position, so is the moon, and it's actual
like a simulation of the sunlight going to

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.210
Earth and the moon is in the middle, so we
saw this solar eclipse.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.270
And actually we were just practicing the keynote
last Thursday and we looked at this screen

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.650
and we're like, "Shit!"

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.990
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: "Why do we have a black

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.510
spot on Earth?"

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.520
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Then we just turned around.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.710
We're like, "Why is there a black spot?

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.710
Ohhhh!"

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.520
Then we went online and there was indeed a
solar eclipse, so it was kind of funny.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520
All right.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.400
So this is -- well, I wouldn't suggest you
should change your system time all the time

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.680
but it's like one of the neat things.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.870
So wait for the next eclipse and then just
go on line.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.740
So okay, with that, I'll go back to the slides.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:27.260
I think I just pressed the wrong...

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:36.610
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: The laptop might have turned
off.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.740
&gt;&gt;Bernhard Seefeld: Okay.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740
Thanks.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.410
And so here's the agenda that I should have
told you before.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.090
I guess these were the three interesting things
about the new Google Maps and then you'll

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.160
get an update on the new Google Maps APIs
and the next million maps.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.169
And before I hand it over, I'd like to recommend
you sign up or recommend to your friends our

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.740
online courses, and they go through how to
use the new Google Maps, Maps Engine Lite,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.860
and Google Earth.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.930
Just go to g.co/mapping course and there will
be online courses, massive online courses

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.120
that you can take and help you learn a lot.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.669
Thanks.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:18.880
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: All right.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.919
So my name is Ken.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.770
I'm a product manager for the Google Maps
APIs based in Sydney and I'm going to talk

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.000
to you a bit about some new things we have
coming up in Google Maps APIs.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.389
So as I do that, I'm just going to tackle
the obvious question -- I've seen it asked

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.541
on Twitter a number of times already -- and
just not beat around the bush and tackle it

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:43.919
straight up, which is: Are you going to announce
a new Google Maps API right now?

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.020
And the answer I have to give you, unfortunately,
is: No.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.710
Remember that the new Google Maps that was
just demo'd in the keynote and that Berni

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.980
and Yatin have demo'd now is a preview.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.960
That's not to say that we won't at some point
announce a new API based on the New Google

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.680
Maps, but we need to remember that this technology
is actually quite nascent and we still have

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.650
a lot to do with the product before we can
think about giving it to third parties.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.680
So that's the bad news.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.610
The good thing is, I do have an announcement
and I think it's an announcement you're find

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.420
very compelling and it may just be sort of
the largest visible change that we've introduced

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.860
to Google Maps APIs in the last eight years
that we've been around.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.690
To do that, I'm going to set up by taking
a look at what the Google Maps API Version

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.450
2 looked like circa 2006.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:38.760
Now, you can see on this map the familiar
pieces of the Google Maps API: the red pin,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:46.000
the info window, the same kinds of familiar
yellow and blues of the Google Map base map.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.240
The info window, as you can see, circa 2006
had nice rounded corners as all good Web 2.0

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.860
products did at that time, as well as we had
an incredibly large shadow, which was also

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.770
popular in Web 2.0 in the 2006 era.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:06.470
If you flip forward to Google Maps API circa
2013, can anyone spot the difference?

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.280
I'll flip back, flip forward.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.640
We squared off the corners on the info window,
certainly.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.250
So Web 2.0 is over.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.390
We still have the same pin.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.890
We still essentially have the same info window.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.110
We still have the same design and base map.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.440
We introduced Street View, of course, in 2007
and that came into the API.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.840
When we relaunched Version 3 of the JavaScript
Maps API we actually added support for mobile.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.580
But essentially what you're seeing between
these two -- 2006 and 2013 -- in seven years

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.560
is essentially the same product.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.940
Loads of new features but essentially the
same look.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.620
Now, when you compare this to the new Google
Maps, which we've been talking about a lot

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.930
already today, you see a completely new experience
in the new Google Maps.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:57.000
The base maps are a completely different design
and set of colors.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.960
The marker is different.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.180
There are no info windows, really, anymore.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.580
Everything is sort of pulled to cards onto
the -- onto the left-hand side of the screen.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.899
And the control experience is completely different
as well.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:13.270
We have a carousel down at the bottom of the
map, rather than the zoom slider that you've

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.860
come to get used to on the left-hand side
of the map.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.500
And when you look at the mobile applications
that were discussed in the keynote today as

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.050
well, they've also undergone a redesign that
aligns more closely with new Google Maps we

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.380
were talking about earlier.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.230
Again, then you flip over to the Google Maps
API and I think I've kind of beat the dead

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.930
horse here long enough, but it's time for
a new look.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.100
We're stuck in 2006 on Nokia 95s, waiting
for Wiis.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.190
This is what was happening in 2006 while the
rest of Google Maps has moved along ahead

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.680
of us.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.070
So here's what we're going to introduce.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.520
It's called: google.maps.visualrefresh = true.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.310
This is one line of code which is a global
property which you can add to your JavaScript

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.399
on your page and what it will do is it will
change the look and feel of the JavaScript

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.600
Maps API.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.970
To illustrate, I'll just pull up the picture
that I was showing you earlier, and when I

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.440
applygGoogle.maps.visualrefresh = true, this
is what you get.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.470
It's the same Google Maps API that you've
come to get used to and that's on now a million

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.660
sites we announced earlier, but it's been
refreshed with a brand-new more beautiful

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.621
design inspired by the work that's been done
in the mobile applications and now the new

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.621
Google Maps.

00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:34.390
So these are the same base tiles that are
used in the new Google Maps, but rendered

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.240
as images not rendered as vector tiles in
the browser.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.590
So we've taken the same design for the base
maps that's been used in the new Google Maps

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.870
and the mobile applications and brought it
into the JavaScript Maps API.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.540
That's what I was going to talk about here,
one of the four major changes.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.270
The second major change that we've introduced
is a new default marker.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.441
So you would have seen on that screen that
we've removed the shadow from the marker that

00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:05.830
you've come to know and love, and we've brought
in the marker that's now the default in the

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.570
new Google Maps.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.820
The info windows, which I had commented on
a number of times earlier, have also undergone

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.820
a change.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.209
The new info window is a much fresher, lighter
look and feel.

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:21.720
The shadow is gone on the info window as well.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.790
And finally, the controls have undergone slight
change, just a fresh coat of CSS to bring

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.330
them into 2013.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.850
Now, it's important to note that this is a
seamless transition and has been carefully

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.529
designed to be so.

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:41.899
So it's just one line of code that you add
to any Maps API application and it will just

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:43.760
enable the new look and feel.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.080
Any custom markers, custom info windows, custom
tile overlays, custom -- custom map types,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.700
anything that you've done to customize your
map will stay the same and will work as intended.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.709
So this is just a transition of the UI elements.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:04.630
And to illustrate that, I've just thrown up
a picture of the -- of the More Than a Map

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.450
showcase site that we have which I'll demo
in a second that we've upgraded to the new

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.260
look and feel just in the last half hour.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.040
And of course we have another API, the static
maps API, which we've added the refresh to

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.110
as well.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.680
It's a simple URL parameter and visual_refresh=true.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.220
So with that, let's flip to the demo.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:43.380
So here what I've got -- if you can see -- is
a side-by-side view of the classic Google

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:52.960
Maps API, if I can get this control to work.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:03.529
Let's see if I can remember my URL.

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:04.529
Apparently that works.

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:09.180
So I've got side-by-side on the left the classic
version of the Google Maps JavaScript API

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.400
and on the right a refreshed version, and
these are running exactly the same code except

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.280
for the global property has been set on the
right.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.850
So you can see the -- the older tiles on the
left a lot more yellow than on the right,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.700
and this is the new design that's been introduced
in the new Google Maps.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:31.839
If I zoom in, you'll see the same style of
maps as Berni was -- was showing earlier with

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.780
the same icons, et cetera.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.260
We don't have the luxury of rendering vectors
in the browser and creating a new map for

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.080
every place, but we do have the same look
and feel that we can bring into the API.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.019
If I open the info window, you can see side
by side the difference of the info windows.

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:54.612
In satellite mode, we've also changed the
labels in the hybrid view so that they're

00:14:54.612 --> 00:14:59.269
freshened up with the new Google Maps look
and feel.

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:02.130
And everything else you can see remains the
same.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.000
So peg man can still be dragged onto the map.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.270
That works.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.230
And everything is as expected.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.990
If you flip over to a couple other different
places, here London -- and I show you on the

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.810
map -- you can see how the new look and feel
of the base maps actually really does change

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.110
the look of the maps API application.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.580
In this case, it's a much fresher look.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:31.910
So what I'm going to do now, to prove to you
that this is actually available now, you can

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:39.769
go change your site now, is go to MoreThanaMap.com,
which is our showcase case for the maps API,

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:44.900
flip over to demos, to base maps, and there
it is.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.900
So it works.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.980
Now, if I click on styled maps, styled maps
also still work the way they did before, and

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.360
I guess the point I'm getting at here is that
in some ways this is a non-announcement.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.160
It's one line of code that changes the important
things but doesn't change all the customizations

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.290
that you've created.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.910
Routing here as well works, going up to elevation
in San Francisco.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:10.519
Again, it all looks as you would expect, but
we have a much brighter, fresher look to the

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:11.519
API.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:18.000
I'll step back to my deck over here.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.090
Great.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:26.430
Now, I'll just talk a little bit about availability.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.089
As I mentioned in the demo with MoreThanaMap.com,
this is available now.

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:36.610
It's available in both our experimental and
release branches for you to opt into.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.649
And we're going to take this new look and
feel by default to the rest of the million

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:42.690
maps API sites on the web.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.810
And the way that works is it will become default
on the experimental branch in three weeks

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.620
-- or in three months' time, in August, and
then three months later on the release branch,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.690
which is the default branch for our enterprise
customers, in November.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.690
Okay.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.020
That's it for the announcement of the refresh.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:07.139
The other thing I wanted to talk about was
to expand a bit on the numbers that Brian

00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:08.209
announced in the keynote.

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:14.620
And the numbers he announced were that we
now have 1 million maps API sites and apps,

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:20.519
and the other is that these million API sites
maps are viewed by 1 billion unique visitors

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.519
a week.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:27.359
Just sort of wrap your head around that one
while I do the little spinning animation.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:32.779
To help you contextualize how big these numbers
are and why we think this is so important

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:38.679
to us is, you know, sometimes we don't think
about the scale and reach of the Maps API.

00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:42.539
Keir Clark, I don't know if he's in the audience
but he generally reviews around three sites

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:44.980
or apps per day on the Google Maps Mania blog.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.820
If he were to continue to do that at that
rate, it would take him 1,000 years to review

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.609
all of the Maps API sites in the world.

00:17:53.609 --> 00:17:56.139
We now have Google Maps in 200 countries.

00:17:56.139 --> 00:18:01.200
If you do simple math, 1 million divided by
200, you get 5,000, which means there are

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.970
roughly 5,000 of Maps API sites in every country
in the world.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:11.340
And the last stat here that I want to throw
up there, because I think it's -- it's the

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.029
most interesting, especially given, you know,
what Larry was talking about today in the

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:20.050
keynote about bringing the Internet to the
rest of the world and a number of people have

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:26.119
talked about today, if we -- if we take that
there are roughly 2 1/2 billion people on

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:31.899
the Internet and we know that we get a billion
unique visitors to Maps API sites every week,

00:18:31.899 --> 00:18:36.960
we can't exactly correlate unique visitors
to people because global networks sometimes

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.120
mean that multiple people hide behind the
same IP address and perhaps a number of us

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.790
in the -- in the audience here and myself
use multiple devices in a day, so it's really

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.700
hard to kind of work that out, but we do know
if we look at our numbers across a month,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.049
we can very, very confidently say that half
the Internet sees a Google Maps API map every

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:56.049
month.

00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:58.220
This is a quite an incredible distribution.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:04.299
As we talk about that, it is interesting to
think about what kind of maps are these maps

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:06.110
that make up the million, right?

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.919
We have used hotel booking sites.

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.950
We used real estate sites.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.820
But they don't make up the 1 million.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:20.999
The 1 million has typically been made up of
really kind of local, innovative, inspirational

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:26.559
maps that developers have created themselves
because they had an idea or they saw a need

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.880
in a local community.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.730
That's how you get a million around the world.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.999
You do that in every country of the world
and you will get a million sites.

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.350
And so I just threw up an example here.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.279
This is a transit simulator from Brasov, which
is a city in Romania.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.409
How many of you have heard of Brasov?

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:46.380
I see one hand.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.549
Brasov is a city of about 350,000 people in
Romania.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:56.909
Somebody in the city released transit data
and then somebody else in the development

00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:01.940
community created a map and an interactive
simulator of that transit data.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.090
This kind of thing has been happening around
the world 1 million times.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.700
Here is another interesting map.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:14.229
This is an aid map from Haiti by an organization
that's a coalition of NGOs who are providing

00:20:14.229 --> 00:20:17.039
aid after the earthquake in 2010 in Haiti.

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:23.299
What they do is they use this map to collaborate
on sharing information about the projects

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:25.580
they're doing so they can work more effectively
together.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.389
In this case, this is an example of how people
have used maps and the ability to overlay

00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:38.409
their own content on the maps for their specific
use case in a way that saves lives.

00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:44.509
This is an application, planefinder, which
if you remember the opening video in the keynote,

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:46.330
it was actually featured there.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.619
It is a data visualization.

00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:53.789
Developers have been creating data visualizations
since the Maps API came out.

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:54.809
This one is fascinating.

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:59.929
You click on any airport in the world and
it creates this firework explosion in your

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:02.409
browser, showing you where all the planes
go.

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:03.539
It is fascinating.

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:05.489
This is another one here.

00:21:05.489 --> 00:21:12.200
We talk about ways people have used the Google
Maps API with mashing it with other bits of

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.279
data to create really compelling and important
visualizations.

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:24.600
This is a map of articles in Wikipedia that
reference a place or articles of a place.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.340
And the points on the map are colored based
on how many words have been written about

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.340
that place.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.809
And what you get effectively is a population
density map.

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:36.690
It's fascinating.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.029
Here's another one, just to illustrate the
ways the Maps API has been enabling communities.

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:44.799
There is loads of typography on buildings
in London.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:49.609
Now I'm not a typography specialist or generally
a person who spends a lot of time looking

00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:50.619
at it.

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:52.830
There are a lot of people in London who do,
it turns out.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.129
And important for them is to document this
and share it.

00:21:55.129 --> 00:21:59.559
Well, of course, they've used Google Maps
API Map.

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:03.269
Instant Street View is an interesting application
we saw show up.

00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:09.479
This is where people have started to take
the maps API beyond just a basic map.

00:22:09.479 --> 00:22:12.179
And Instant Street View here works like Google
Instant.

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:15.990
You start typing in and it takes you to different
places in the world with Street View.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.600
Finally, GeoGuessr, how many of you have played
GeoGuessr?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.759
See loads of hands.

00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:22.769
Loads of hands.

00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:23.769
Fascinating.

00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:28.149
This is -- this is the latest viral site we've
seen created with the Maps API.

00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:33.649
Very simple concept as they show you a bit
of Street View from somewhere in the world.

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:38.549
And your job is to click on the map where
you think the Street View was taken.

00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:42.830
And you get points based on how close you
were to the right location.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.559
It is incredibly educational and insanely
addictive.

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.940
So if you haven't played it, go try it out.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.450
Now, it has been these kinds of applications
that have really inspired us.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:57.059
So what we decided to do is to put together
a little video tribute which I'm going to

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:12.949
roll now and set up Mano Marks who will come
and talk about the next million maps.

00:23:12.949 --> 00:23:47.729
[ Video playing ]
[ Music ]

00:23:47.729 --> 00:24:45.700
[ Video ends ]
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Wow.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:25:10.520
Sorry, I prestaged my slide.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.830
Wow.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:20.619
So, I have been on the Maps team, the Maps
and Earth team since about -- since 2006,

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.710
so about seven years now.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.970
And I get teary when I see that video.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:36.629
I get moved by the incredible changes that
we've made in the developers world but also

00:25:36.629 --> 00:25:40.460
in the world of the Internet.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:51.190
In 2005, 2006, the mashup revolution was born
and it started with people developing apps

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.960
with the Google Maps API.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.399
That was the first monster mashup.

00:25:55.399 --> 00:26:01.590
People realized that they could take services
that is a major corporation was providing

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.399
for free and mash them up with their own data.

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:11.559
We have moved a long way since then as you
have seen from the samples that Ken has shown.

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:15.909
But basically it's taking the power of maps
and putting them in the hands of developers

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:20.499
and putting them in the hands of people in
the world.

00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:28.090
I didn't do a little spinny thing on the "wow"
like Ken did.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.690
That's because I'm just spinning in my heart.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.750
Okay.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.629
[ Laughter ]
So what I want to talk to you about now is

00:26:34.629 --> 00:26:41.119
the next million apps, the next million maps
and how we are taking maps to new platforms.

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:48.049
You saw the new -- you saw the new Google
Maps in the keynote, the preview and you saw

00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:50.869
it in Berni's talk here.

00:26:50.869 --> 00:27:00.690
And what has become pretty clear to us -- and
also to pretty much everyone is that mobile

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.950
is the future, except it's not the future.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.849
Mobile is not the future anymore; mobile is
the present.

00:27:07.849 --> 00:27:16.450
And when Google Maps started, it was enough
to serve map tiles to a browser, and that

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.659
was pretty revolutionary at the time.

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:22.360
But we've looked beyond that.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.349
And since the launch of Android, we've been
putting maps into the hands of mobile users.

00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:36.070
But what we really want to do is put the same
mapping experience in the same map data into

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:42.549
the hands of every major -- every user on
a major platform.

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:49.619
You see here we have Web, mobile, Android
and iOS SDKs.

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:55.219
So we are really exciting that these are our
major platforms.

00:27:55.219 --> 00:28:08.039
These are what you can see right now and what
you can develop on right now.

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:14.639
And the reason for that is that mobile data
is about 13% of global Internet traffic, according

00:28:14.639 --> 00:28:17.559
to Mary Meeker's Internet trends report.

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:22.720
13%, but that's up considerably just from
last year.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.940
And in some places in the world, it is the
majority of Internet traffic.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:33.940
So we want to put powerful mapping experiences
and powerful map data that Google has and

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.629
that Google scale into your hands.

00:28:37.629 --> 00:28:44.889
So when I say "On-Location," what I'm really
talking about is this concept of on location,

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:50.840
that your app is about more than just identifying
where somebody is, but it is about giving

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.190
them the entire context in which they -- in
which they are right now.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.440
It's about giving them data.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.059
It's about giving them, as you've seen, this
idea of what -- where are they going?

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:07.869
Not just knowing -- when you are building
an app, you don't to just want to know where

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:12.149
somebody is and you don't want to just ask
them where they're going, know where they

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:13.149
are going.

00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:22.340
Get contextual information from your users
and build that into your applications.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:30.669
Now, we see on the Maps team that there are
actually, we believe, three components to

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:31.669
this.

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:40.220
Now, there's the powerful visualization technologies
in the browser and on Android and iOS.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.460
There's also our On-Location services.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:49.799
So we've talked a lot for years about our
places API, our directions API, our geocoding

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:55.269
API, all of which can be used on a Google
Maps application.

00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:58.769
And we've started recently talking about this
data platform.

00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:05.570
I'm going to talk a little bit more about
that in a minute because I want to talk -- I

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:10.429
want to update you on the visualization platform.

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:20.950
Now, as I mentioned before, maps have been
about serving map tiles to a client application

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.909
that then just simply renders those map tiles.

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:26.580
That's what maps have been in the browser.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.740
That's what maps have been on mobile devices.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.590
In 2011, we released vector mapping on Android.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:41.109
And in 2012, we released it on the -- on iOS.

00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:48.380
So mobile actually took this idea of vector
mapping, took this technology, and the first

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.820
place we were able to start using it.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.679
Awfully creaky stage.

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:03.419
This is the first place that you were actually
able to get vector mapping.

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:06.279
And why is vector mapping important?

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:10.779
Because it can do all those interesting things
that you saw Berni demonstrate.

00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:18.080
You can render data on the fly and respond
to user inputs without having to worry about

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.770
roundtripping once again to the server to
get data back in and shove it back into your

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.409
application.

00:31:26.409 --> 00:31:30.889
So that gives you really interesting things
like camera animation, and I want to actually

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:39.519
give a quick demo of that.

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:58.830
If I can find my 

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.830
demo now.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.389
Oh, the demo was loaded into the other machine.

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:03.389
Nevermind.

00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:07.200
I'm going to move on.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.070
But basically allowing you to do -- many of
the kinds of animations that you've seen both

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.580
in the video and live.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.509
We've shown you these kind of animations where
you can zoom in, see these 3D buildings tilt

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:25.969
and pan the map in a very smooth way.

00:32:25.969 --> 00:32:31.249
And we're going to be talking a lot about
those in the two mobile sessions -- the two

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.710
dedicated mobile sessions.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.360
Ken?

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.720
I don't know why that happened.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:46.309
So the two dedicated mobile sessions on iOS
and Android today and tomorrow as well as

00:32:46.309 --> 00:32:52.450
throughout many of our different sessions
the next couple of days.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:59.629
So we have 17 -- 17 sessions and one codelab
that will be taking place in the next few

00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:04.759
days.

00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:12.649
So I want to announce today that we're making
updates to both the Android and iOS APIs.

00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:14.179
So the Android API got pushed.

00:33:14.179 --> 00:33:21.479
It was announced actually in the keynote with
the new Google Play services update.

00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:31.779
You will get a new version of the Android
API -- the Google Maps Android API V2.

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:37.299
And we're also announcing that today we're
releasing Version 1.3 of the Google Maps SDK

00:33:37.299 --> 00:33:41.379
for iOS.

00:33:41.379 --> 00:33:47.739
So the Android API, as you know, is built
into Google Play Services, which means that

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:51.739
any device that has Google Play services automatically
gets updated.

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:55.259
You get -- without you having to do any work.

00:33:55.259 --> 00:34:03.259
So any updates, any improvements, bug fixes,
performance management that we can add automatically

00:34:03.259 --> 00:34:06.389
updated in the app.

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:15.760
And it brings the power of the consumer, Google
Maps' vector rendering engine into your applications.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:22.520
When we released in 2011, Google Maps for
Android, the first thing that developers asked

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.650
is: How can I use this in my applications?

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.140
Now starting last November, you can.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:38.080
And the Google Maps SDK for iOS is a static
library that you can download and incorporate

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.679
into your applications.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:48.390
And it brings in the power of the Google Maps
application for iPhone and it is available

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:52.140
on both iPhone and iPad devices.

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:58.300
And it allows for very easy integration with
Google Maps and also allows you, therefore,

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:03.900
to use Google's services on your Google Maps.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:10.820
And we also launched an URL scheme that allows
you to launch the Google Maps application

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:18.840
for iPhone directly from your application
if you don't want to use the SDK.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.470
Let's talk a moment about this data platform.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:26.520
There's a couple of things I want to highlight.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.630
The first is the tracks API.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:40.510
So imagine you have an application that does
tracking of your users or some asset or something.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:48.830
An application that, say, is a social application
so you can track where your friends are located.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:55.540
Now, imagine you wanted to send -- you wanted
to know minute by minute where somebody using

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.990
your application is.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:02.840
Think about how many queries one person would
be sending to your server in a day.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.840
Say they're using it for ten hours.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.120
That's an easy calculation.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:15.080
Once a minute for -- for an hour times ten.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.450
That's a lot of pings per person.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:23.100
Imagine your application is used by 5,000
or 10,000 people.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.650
To track where their friends are in any moment.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:32.590
You want to know at a frequency more frequent
than once per minute.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:38.600
That's a lot of queries hitting your server
just to collect location information for individuals.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.190
We've set up the tracks API that allows you
to do just that.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.010
It allows you to present information about
-- to collect information about your users

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:54.300
in Google's Cloud anonymously and then be
able to track those users as they go.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:00.700
So pulling down location information for each
individual from Google's Cloud without straining

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.700
your resources.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.730
Because we've figured out how to do these
sorts of things.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.070
The other data platform that I'd like to mention
is Google Maps engine.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.350
Brian called this out in the keynote.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.130
We're really excited about the Google Maps
Engine platform.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:26.290
Now, Maps Engine is a platform for uploading
your Geo data to our Cloud services and then

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:34.150
serving that data out in the same infrastructure
and the same way that we serve out data.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:42.020
So if you want to collaboratively work on
an application on a set of data with a bunch

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:50.619
of other people across the globe and you want
to use high end GIS data and you don't necessarily

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:56.120
-- not all your users are necessarily going
to be developers, they might simply be users.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:03.600
You can then load those up and build those
out to scale so that you can serve out your

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.840
data to a large number of users.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.170
One of the reasons why this is important is
because, again, we get into these queries

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.110
per second.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:23.020
So if you have an application -- I'm going
to say, say you are a local government officer

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.610
and you have a GIS shop for, say, the city
of New York.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.260
And a hurricane or some other kind of disaster
comes, a bunch of people might be hitting

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:40.080
your site to find out information about where
to find shelters, where to evacuate, all that

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.230
sort of thing.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:46.990
If all that is running off of Google's data
centers, which are replicated around the world,

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.040
you don't have to worry that your servers
are going to go down.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.260
It's served over the same infrastructure that
we use to serve out Google Earth and Google

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.650
Maps, and then we allow you to communicate
that to your users.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.810
You choose how many and who.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:07.250
You can -- it's basically like Google Docs,
you can choose to share it with only a few

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.250
people.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.250
You can share it broadly.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.240
You can share it with just an URL.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:19.260
And then you can -- you can serve that out
to as many -- as many people as you want.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:27.510
You can serve it out on whatever devices you
want people to reach as well.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:33.560
And we announced last week that we also added
a new API for it.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:39.580
This allows you to programatically interact
with the Google Maps platform so you can upload

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:45.650
data and you can edit data.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:52.710
You can interact with your data dynamically
in the Google Maps platform.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:40:01.310
We have traditionally sold this to large enterprises
but we wanted to -- we frequently get asked

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.280
at Google I/O, how can I play with it?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.330
And the great news is that you can play with
it today.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.640
Go to the -- if you're here at Google I/O,
go to the Google Maps sandbox and ask them

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.690
to sign you up for an account for Google Maps
Engine and we will give you a test account

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:27.300
that will allow you to develop using the Google
Maps Engine platform.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:34.570
And then it will have API access and you can
also serve out those -- that data on top of

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.810
the Google Maps JavaScript API using a Maps
Data Layer.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:45.840
So we're really excited that you are going
to get a chance to play with the newest, latest

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.620
and greatest data platforms that we have on
-- at Google.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:57.250
I should also mention that the tracks API
is free to play with as well for a limited

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:02.020
number of assets that you're tracking.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.020
So if you want to get started, if you want
to get started with the developer experience

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.860
at Google Maps, go to developers.google.com/maps.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:16.540
Also, some of us will be in the sandbox for
the next three days.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.870
We're excited to talk to you about ow new
platforms and how you're going to get started

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.660
using our APIs.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.750
Thank you.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:43.450
[ Applause ]
I'm not going to take questions, sorry.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.210
We have seven minutes left.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.640
Do you want to take questions?

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.950
Ken will take questions and I will take questions,
too.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.080
Apparently we are taking questions.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.980
We have seven minutes' time, so, before it
runs out.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.320
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: If you want to ask a question.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:05.450
Please come to one of the mics here and ask.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:12.160
If you have a question, come to the mic.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.080
&gt;&gt;&gt; With the new Google Maps API and the ability
to visualize the buildings in 3D, are you

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:24.270
going to provide rendering solutions for people
who want to render stereoscopically.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.590
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: I think something might have
got lost in the translation.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:35.210
The update to the Google Maps API is an update
to the base map tiles.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.590
We are not introducing any 3D functionality
at this time.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:44.849
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: In the mobile APIs we have 3D
buildings built in.

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:55.640
We don't currently have a solution on mobile
for rendering things stereoscopically.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:02.470
&gt;&gt;&gt; On Apple maps for iOS you're allowed to
inject your own map layer on top but it doesn't

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:07.830
seem that we're able to do that in the iOS
Google Maps app or anything like that whereas

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.380
Google --
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Are you talking about a tile

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.810
layer of some kind.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:12.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:19.400
Where Google has allowed you to inject the
Google map into your own effect.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.660
I'm wondering if that will be allowed in the
future.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.910
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: It's built into the Apple maps
application.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:34.160
We a comment on future features for Google
Maps.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.380
We're really excited that people can build
this, though, into their own applications.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.380
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.550
How's it going?

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.140
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's good.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:54.520
I have a question about the tracks API, how
different the API is from the Latitude API.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:00.540
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: How different is the tracks
API.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.910
&gt;&gt;&gt; How different latitude API from tracks
API?

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.690
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Latitude.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:16.650
So the tracks API is designed specifically
for developers who want to not be tied to

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.050
other Google Apps like latitude or coordinate.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:24.030
They want to build out their own.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:30.720
It's simply you assign an ID and you give
a location and then you upload bunches of

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.750
crumbs of that.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.690
Then you build out your own visualization.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.340
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: The simplest difference.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.490
Latitude was about tracking people.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.810
Tracks API is about tracking anything that
moves.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:49.190
You can put a GPS sensor on anything and call
it an asset and track it in the tracks API.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.870
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:54.230
Thank you.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:45:03.330
&gt;&gt;&gt; I notice -- sounds kind of crazy, but
can Google Maps API be extended to Lord of

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:14.440
the Rings or make a searchable map using,
like, I don't know -- make a searchable middle

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.440
earth.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:21.560
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Yes, people have done that using
tile overlays to lay them on top of Google

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.560
Maps.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.560
So, yeah, in fact, you can.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.030
And if you can get GPS to work, you can do
it on a mobile device.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.750
If you get GPS to work in middle earth.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:34.880
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: Google Maps API has been based
on an assumption that it's got the earth underneath

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880
it.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.880
That assumption doesn't need to hold.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.640
You can create, effectively, the same patch
work of tiles for some other world.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.950
Which we used to have in the API for Mars
and moon.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.510
If you can create that and find that map for
middle earth, you can definitely use the maps

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.780
API for it.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:55.580
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: You would create a custom map
type and you basically provide a mapping between

00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:00.810
what your world coordinates are and latitude
and longitude so the maps API knows how to

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.720
interact with it.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:11.520
And, yeah, it's -- check out GTA4.net/map.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:19.430
You'll see the grand theft auto map rendered
in using the maps API with custom street view.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.590
Very cool.

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:23.750
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.750
Of course.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.790
You can use GME, Google Maps engine, to do
it as well.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.330
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a little bit bigger picture, I
suppose.

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:35.990
You talked about the progression from tiles
to vectors and then to today's announcements

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:41.270
of all search and intent and what you're going
to be next as part of maps.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.260
Where did that come from?

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.460
Was it always kind of, you know, something
that was being developed in maps?

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.050
The kind of new direction for maps as a contextual
and intent-based tool.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:54.440
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Do you want to answer that?

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.040
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: We have the map here.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.390
&gt;&gt;Brian McClendon: I think the intent overall
is what we've discovered is maps data are

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:01.910
kind of the center of so many of your walk
around carry the phone.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:36.390
So many of them -- about what the data, I
think I think the maps, you do start to -- geo

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.180
fences, motion models, there are things that
we will be able to do in your application.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.360
&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is about Google Earth.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.210
So I've seen there's a lot of innovation with
Google Maps.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:50.230
You mentioned features and zoom out to space
reminded me of Google Earth.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.680
Can you comment on what the role between Google
Maps and Google Earth is going to be.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:01.430
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: It's basically the same team
of people working on both applications.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:08.350
We're in pretty early stages now with the
new Google Maps and we're seeing a lot of

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.970
evolution of the base platforms, the web,
and earth.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:19.850
We can't announce it right now any changes
to any other platforms that we haven't already

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:20.850
announced.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:27.160
But, yeah, we're excited about the possibilities
that WebGL will bring us but also we have

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.609
over a billion installs of Google Earth around
the world and a very active user base.

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.890
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.550
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a higher level question that I
don't know is fair to ask you guys but I'm

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.030
going to anyway.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.230
You're delivering the new maps APIs through
the Google Play Services rather than through

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.630
sort of platform level changes?

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:51.910
I got the sense that that was coming out at
a broader level for not just maps APIs but

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:52.910
other stuff as well.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:58.360
I'm assuming that this is driven by platform
update by OEMs and operators.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.030
Is this kind of a broader strategy that Google
is looking at in terms of keeping the Android

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:07.720
platform fresh for developers but not being
bound to the OEMs and operators?

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:17.300
&gt;&gt;Brian McClendon: The simple answer is yes.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:28.640
The advantage of Google Play services, and
the advantage of any dyanmic library is bug

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.480
fixes, updates and the like.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.570
And with the Services going all the way back
to Froyo, it gives developers the opportunity

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.090
to reach a wider audience.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:40.000
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you guys see that extending further
beyond what was announced today?

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.970
Is that a broader endemic like API strategy?

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:48.250
&gt;&gt;Brian McClendon: I think the first version
came out a few months ago.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.400
I think it is an ongoing process.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.280
&gt;&gt;Ken Hoetmer: Take this as the last question
as we are a minute over.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.500
&gt;&gt;&gt; So one of the nice features is to take
our own KML file and have it integrated onto

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.550
Google Maps rather than just integrating Google
Maps into our own website.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:09.040
Do you have additional features with the latest
Google Maps version which allows for more

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:14.110
context specific retrieval of data and KML
or is there anything sort of back and forth

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.860
that we can do that will allow for that interaction
to be more intelligent?

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:23.400
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: We don't have anything to announce
at this point around KML rendering and the

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.520
new Google Maps.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:34.370
So certainly KML is a standard that we helped
pioneer through Keyhole and then Google Earth

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:43.850
and we gave away to the world and we're still
committed it and it is very exciting.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.070
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Thanks a lot everyone.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.070
See you in the sandbox.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:48.071
