00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.580
Exercise, exercise, exercise, that's all you
hear!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.019
Get off the couch, Trace!

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.450
Come run a race with me, TRACE!!

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.259
Here's what I say, "Nope.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.920
Science says it's gonna kill you."

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.290
Hey there avid runners and couch potatoes,
according to science, you're basically the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.290
same!

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.290
I'm Trace, thanks for watching DNews.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.960
In 1976, the number of marathon finishers
was 25,000; in 2013, it was 541,000 people.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.000
We sure seem to be running more than ever!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.899
With the number of races exploding -- there
were only 300 marathons nationwide in 2000

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.649
-- now there are over 1,100!

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.789
So, is all this running an indicator of our
nation's awesome health?

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.249
Not… really…

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.780
We're ALL told some exercise is better than
no exercise, and in general that is true,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.269
but according to new research published in
the Journal of the American College of Cardiology,

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.949
too much of a good thing, can often be too
much to bear.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.890
According to the study, people who run at
a "fast pace" more than four hours in a week,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.310
spread over three sessions or more; had the
same risk of death as those who were sedentary

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.320
and hardly exercised at all.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.090
Basically, sitting on your couch and doing
nothing is unhealthy.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.200
Sedentary people risk heart disease, obesity
and other health problems, but running 240

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.390
minutes per week -- or almost 35 minutes per
day -- carries the SAME RISK.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.170
Shocking, I know.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.600
Yogging came on to the scene in the 70s, It's
not a soft J…

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.770
Okay, Jogging, then.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.870
That sounds weird, but whatever.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.630
But this avid running increased the mortality
rate.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.380
According to this same study though, it's
easy to fix: JUST RUN LESS and SLOWER.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.990
See, those who ran more than 2.5 hours in
a week, over three or more sessions; at a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.130
fast pace had a mortality rate of 66%.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.340
But those who ran 1 to 2.4 hours a week, in
LESS than three sessions; at a "slow to moderate

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.480
pace," had a significant reduction in that
mortality.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.610
In fact, "light jogging" has been shown to
increase lifespan by 6.2 years for men and

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.409
5.6 for women.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.640
Before you freak out, scientists controlled
for sex, age, medical history, and lifestyle

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.320
factors like smoking and alcohol consumption.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.700
They followed almost 20,000 people for 40
years and used this massive dataset to learn

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.680
about a variety of diseases -- including connecting
JOGGING with health, and now "avid running"

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680
with, well, not health.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.840
According to their results, the graph is sort
of an inverted U shape, with inactive, and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.390
overactive at the bottom.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.330
I immediately think of the benefits of coffee
or wine -- one 8 ounce cup or glass is fine

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.530
-- but more than that and benefits decrease
precipitously and you head into unhealthy

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.580
behaviorland.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.440
But as a runner, I wonder what a "slow to
moderate pace" is?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440
Right?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.630
According to one of the researchers, the pace
of "slow joggers corresponds to vigorous exercise,"

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.780
while the faster pace is "very vigorous exercise."

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.900
A doctor from UCLA who wasn't part of the
research said we weren't meant to mountain

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.319
bike or marathon run every day -- and this
research shows, if we want to live longer,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.910
we probably shouldn't.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.900
Other research states long-term strenuous
exercise, like marathons and triathlons might

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.020
harm the heart.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.380
But the risk is really low, heart attacks
among marathoners is lower or equal to athletes

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.810
in other sports -- but there's very little
to gain by simply exercising MORE and MORE.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.650
This is in no way an attempt to dissuade people
from marathons or vigorous exercise.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
The benefits are there, we've reported on
them, but everything in moderation, as they

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
say.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.400
And definitely never just sit on the couch.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.590
No way, José.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.910
People who are physically active have a 30%
lower risk of death, as opposed to those who

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.910
aren't.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:45.140
So get off your butt a few times a week and
walk, jog or whatever.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:55.090
Just do something.
