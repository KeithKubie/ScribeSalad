hundred and ten percent proficient and
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270
hundred and ten percent proficient and
some more basic ones and then it moves

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
some more basic ones and then it moves
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310
some more basic ones and then it moves
him on and he gets data and he gets

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
him on and he gets data and he gets
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929
