progressed the most story-wise and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290
progressed the most story-wise and
 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.539

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.640
because I know my you know issues with
the show occasionally were just either

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
the show occasionally were just either
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.100
