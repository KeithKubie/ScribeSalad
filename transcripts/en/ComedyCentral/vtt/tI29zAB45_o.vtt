00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.538
Welcome back.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.007
Now, while the glass ceiling
may have been shattered

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.243
last night,
hearts are still shattering

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.245
over Michelle Obama's
speech from Monday.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:17.884 line:0%
I wake up every morning in a
house that was built by slaves.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.387 line:0%
And I watch my daughters,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.023 line:0%
two beautiful, intelligent,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.859 line:0%
black young women,
playing with their dogs

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.094 line:0%
on the White House lawn.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.730
(sniffling)

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:31.798
I'm not crying.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.767
I'm just allergic.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.002
Well, this speech wasn't just

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.804
a reflection of her time
as first lady.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.439
It spoke to how far
we've come as a nation,

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.375
but Bill O'Reilly thought
he should make a clarification

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.444
on a key racial issue.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.514 line:0%
Michelle Obama is essentially
correct in citing slaves

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.349 line:0%
as builders of the White House,

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.518 line:0%
but there were others working
as well.

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:56.756 line:0%
Slaves that worked there were
well fed and had decent lodgings

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.157 line:0%
provided by the government.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.326
(sputters)

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.561
Wh...?

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.529
Your takeaway about slavery

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.598
is that they were well fed?

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.866
Ooh.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.401
(in Southern accent):
Thank you, Massa O'Reilly,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:12.839
for-for-for clarifying me
about slavery.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.874
-(applause, cheering)
-I appreciate that.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.976
Oh, oh, you know what, sir?

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.846
If'n I could read,
I sure would wants to read

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.914
your book about killing Lincoln.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:25.518
Course I ain't allowed to read,
seeing as I'm a slave and all,

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.253
but sounds to me like he did

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.621
the wrong thing
by freeing them slaves.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:29.722
How you gonna free...

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.290
(laughing):
how you gonna free people

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.493
with a full belly?

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.230
See, my slave bit is starting
to wear off already.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.166
Now, I don't know what's worse,
that Bill O'Reilly Fox-splained

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.869
slavery or that people all over
the Internet needed him to.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.303
For more, we turn
to nightly show contributor

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.338
Franchesca Ramsey

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.906
with another installment
of #HashItOut.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.911 line:0%
(cheering and applause)

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.646 line:0%
Thanks, Larry.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.582 line:0%
So, apparently, some people
are upset that black people

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.918 line:0%
are in the White House
and that some black people

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.153 line:0%
built the White House.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.954 line:0%
Check out some of these Tweets.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:05.158 line:0%
"Fact check: The White House
was not built by slaves.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.294 line:0%
Only one third of the workers
were slaves."

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.630 line:0%
Fact check: Putting "fact check"

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.533 line:0%
in front of a bull(bleep) quote,
doesn't make it a fact.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.502 line:0%
(whooping and applause)

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:22.275
And if only one-third
of the workers were slaves,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:26.512
that means the White House
was built by slaves.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.481
(cheers and applause)

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.586
That just means only two-thirds
of the workers

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.588
got to go home at night.

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.456
That's how fractions work.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.459
But maybe you stopped paying
attention to fractions

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.996
after the three-fifths
compromise.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.965
(applause, cheering)

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.571
"Slaves didn't build
the White House,

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.507
carpenters did."

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.576
This is going to blow your mind.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.047
Some of the slaves
were also carpenters.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.083
Just like Bill O'Reilly
can be a TV personality

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.419
and a condescending asshole.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.388
(cheers and applause)

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.326
"The White House
was not built solely,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.063
or even primarily by slaves
who were paid for work."

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.032
First of all,
is that a Dr. Evil meme?

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:23.569
This meme is old enough to vote.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.271
Not solely built by slaves?

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.572
Can please get out of here

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:29.642
with this #AllJobsMatter
(bleep)?

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:30.710
But I get it.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.478
You do these mental gymnastics

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.647
because it's uncomfortable
to acknowledge this country

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.082
was built in part by slaves,

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.017
and that we benefit
from their work.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.353
But what else do you think
they were doing?

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.755
"We Shall Overcome" isn't a song
about how hard it is

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.724
to play the banjo.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.425
And the worst part,

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.128
if you hadn't been so caught up
on the word "slavery,"

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.763
you would have realized
that Michelle Obama

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.698
was saying something positive.

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:55.167
Yes, the White House
was built by slaves,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.702
which is why it's such
a big deal

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.704
that we have a black president.

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.506
If you have a problem with this,

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.643
then I'm going to guess it only
is because of who is saying it,

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.545
so let me try and put this into
words that you can understand.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:09.348
(with accent):
"I wake up every morning...

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:11.317
(cheers and applause)

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:18.858
...in a house that
was built by slaves."

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.293
Is that better?

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.594
No, it's not better!

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:22.795
Franchesca Ramsey, everybody!

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:24.161
We'll be right back.
