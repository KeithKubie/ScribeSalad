00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.924
I will never forget the first time
I visited a client in jail.

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:19.281
The heavy, metal door slammed behind me,

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.550
and I heard the key turn in the lock.

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:25.453
The cement floor underneath me
had a sticky film on it

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.019
that made a ripping sound,

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.657
like tape being pulled off a box,

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.340
every time I moved my foot.

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:36.731
The only connection to the outside world
was a small window placed too high to see.

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.496
There was a small, square table
bolted to the floor

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.972
and two metal chairs,

00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:43.524
one on either side.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:47.822
That was the first time
I understood viscerally --

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:50.243
just for a fleeting moment --

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:52.235
what incarceration might feel like.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.887
And I promised myself all those years ago
as a young, public defender

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.529
that I would never,
ever forget that feeling.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:01.659
And I never have.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:05.975
It inspired me to fight for each
and every one of my clients' freedom

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.131
as if it was my own.

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:10.468
Freedom.

00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:14.175
A concept so fundamental
to the American psyche

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.823
that it is enshrined in our constitution.

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:22.339
And yet, America is addicted
to imprisonment.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.510
From slavery through mass incarceration,

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:26.867
it always has been.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:30.632
Look, we all know the shocking numbers.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.308
The United States incarcerates
more people per capita

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:36.084
than almost any nation on the planet.

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:41.148
But what you may not know
is that on any given night in America,

00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:45.363
almost half a million people go to sleep
in those concrete jail cells

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:48.837
who have not been convicted of anything.

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:53.538
These mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:57.257
are there for one reason
and one reason only:

00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:00.428
they cannot afford to pay
the price of their freedom.

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:04.248
And that price is called bail.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:09.030
Now, bail was actually created
as a form of conditional release.

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:10.376
The theory was simple:

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.115
set bail at an amount
that somebody could afford to pay --

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.296
they would pay it --

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.844
it would give them an incentive
to come back to court;

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.836
it would give them some skin in the game.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.836
Bail was never intended
to be used as punishment.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.834
Bail was never intended
to hold people in jail cells.

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:32.830
And bail was never, ever intended
to create a two-tier system of justice:

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.081
one for the rich
and one for everybody else.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:38.995
But that is precisely what it has done.

00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:42.899
Seventy-five percent of people
in American local jails

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:45.226
are there because they cannot pay bail.

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:47.775
People like Ramel.

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.114
On a chilly October afternoon,

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:52.980
Ramel was riding his bicycle
in his South Bronx neighborhood

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.382
on his way to a market
to pick up a quart of milk.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.430
He was stopped by the police.

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:00.022
And when he demanded to know
why he was being stopped,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.372
an argument ensued,
and the next thing he knew,

00:03:02.396 --> 00:03:04.017
he was on the ground in handcuffs,

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:07.039
being charged with "riding
your bicycle on the sidewalk

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:08.335
and resisting arrest."

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:09.994
He was taken to court,

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:12.912
where a judge set 500 dollars bail.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:16.008
But Ramel -- he didn't have 500 dollars.

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:19.884
So this 32-year-old father
was sent to "The Boat" --

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.612
a floating jail barge
that sits on the East River

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.307
between a sewage plant and a fish market.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:29.463
That's right, you heard me.

00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:32.265
In New York City, in 2018,

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.785
we have a floating prison barge
that sits out there

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.216
and houses primarily black and brown men

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.387
who cannot pay their bail.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.235
Let's talk for a moment

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.927
about what it means to be in jail
even for a few days.

00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:52.345
Well, it can mean losing your job,

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:53.702
losing your home,

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:55.793
jeopardizing your immigration status.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.943
It may even mean
losing custody of your children.

00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:02.281
A third of sexual
victimization by jail staff

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:05.076
happens in the first three days in jail,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.335
and almost half of all jail deaths,
including suicides,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.166
happen in that first week.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:14.907
What's more,
if you're held in jail on bail,

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:17.542
you're four times more likely
to get a jail sentence

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.176
than if you had been free,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.183
and that jail sentence
will be three times longer.

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:27.305
And if you are black or Latino
and cash bail has been set,

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:31.540
you are two times more likely
to remain stuck in that jail cell

00:04:31.564 --> 00:04:33.105
than if you were white.

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:40.347
Jail in America is a terrifying,
dehumanizing and violent experience.

00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:46.948
Now imagine for just one moment
that it's you stuck in that jail cell,

00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:49.656
and you don't have
the 500 dollars to get out.

00:04:51.072 --> 00:04:55.128
And someone comes along
and offers you a way out.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.993
"Just plead guilty," they say.

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.655
"You can go home back to your job.

00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:02.612
Just plead guilty.

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.143
You can kiss your kids goodnight tonight."

00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:08.679
So you do what anybody
would do in that situation.

00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:12.241
You plead guilty
whether you did it or not.

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:15.650
But now you have a criminal record

00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:18.411
that's going to follow you
for the rest of your life.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.772
Jailing people because they don't have
enough money to pay bail

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:26.649
is one of the most unfair,
immoral things we do as a society.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.409
But it is also expensive
and counterproductive.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.759
American taxpayers --

00:05:32.783 --> 00:05:37.425
they spend 14 billion dollars annually
holding people in jail cells

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.338
who haven't been convicted of anything.

00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:41.675
That's 40 million dollars a day.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.311
What's perhaps more confounding
is it doesn't make us any safer.

00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:49.417
Research is clear
that holding somebody in jail

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:53.414
makes you significantly more likely
to commit a crime when you get out

00:05:53.438 --> 00:05:57.096
than if you had been free all along.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.771
Freedom makes all the difference.

00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:04.805
Low-income communities

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.171
and communities of color
have known that for generations.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.686
Together, they have pooled their resources
to buy their loved ones freedom

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.230
for as long as bondage
and jail cells existed.

00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:21.003
But the reach of the criminal legal system
has grown too enormous,

00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:23.120
and the numbers have just too large.

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.444
Ninety-nine percent of jail growth
in America has been the result --

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:30.334
over the last 20 years --

00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:32.373
of pre-trial incarceration.

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:37.143
I have been a public defender
for over half my life,

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:40.833
and I have stood by and watched
thousands of clients

00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:42.997
as they were dragged into those jail cells

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.373
because they didn't have
enough money to pay bail.

00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:49.952
I have watched as questions of justice
were subsumed by questions of money,

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:54.145
calling into question the legitimacy
of the entire American legal system.

00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:58.444
I am here to say something simple --

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:00.146
something obvious,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.759
but something urgent.

00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:06.181
Freedom makes all the difference,

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:09.895
and freedom should be free.

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:16.919
(Applause)

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.157
But how are we going to make that happen?

00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:23.182
Well, that's the question
I was wrestling with over a decade ago

00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:26.064
when I was sitting at a kitchen table
with my husband, David,

00:07:26.088 --> 00:07:27.517
who is also a public defender.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:31.206
We were eating our Chinese takeout
and venting about the injustice of it all

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.642
when David looked up and said,

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:35.550
"Why don't we just start a bail fund,

00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:37.864
and just start bailing
our clients out of jail?"

00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:41.296
And in that unexpected moment,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.185
the idea for the Bronx
Freedom Fund was born.

00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:47.073
Look, we didn't know what to expect.

00:07:47.097 --> 00:07:49.713
There were plenty of people
that told us we were crazy

00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:51.737
and we were going
to lose all of the money.

00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.904
People wouldn't come back
because they didn't have any stake in it.

00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:56.983
But what if clients did come back?

00:07:57.952 --> 00:08:01.723
We knew that bail money comes back
at the end of a criminal case,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.995
so it could come back into the fund,

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:08.503
and we could use it over and over again
for more and more bail.

00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:09.837
That was our big bet,

00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:11.765
and that bet paid off.

00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:13.584
Over the past 10 years,

00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:17.280
we have been paying bails for low-income
residents of New York City,

00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:21.205
and what we have learned
has exploded our ideas

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:23.043
of why people come back to court

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:25.755
and how the criminal
legal system itself is operated.

00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:30.413
Turns out money isn't what makes
people come back to court.

00:08:30.437 --> 00:08:33.374
We know this because when
the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail,

00:08:33.398 --> 00:08:37.567
96 percent of clients
return for every court appearance,

00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:41.179
laying waste to the myth
that it's money that mattered.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:46.091
It's powerful evidence
that we don't need cash

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:47.375
or ankle bracelets

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.834
or unnecessary systems
of surveillance and supervision.

00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:53.603
We simply need court reminders --

00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:56.615
simple court reminders
about when to come back to court.

00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:01.648
Next, we learned that if you're held
in jail on a misdemeanor,

00:09:01.672 --> 00:09:03.983
90 percent of people will plead guilty.

00:09:04.603 --> 00:09:06.502
But when the fund pays bail,

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:09.326
over half the cases are dismissed.

00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:14.459
And in the entire history
of the Bronx Freedom Fund,

00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:19.180
fewer than two percent of our clients
have ever received a jail sentence

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:20.519
of any kind.

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:27.519
(Applause)

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:31.104
Ramel, a week later --

00:09:31.128 --> 00:09:34.457
he was still on the boat,
locked in that jail cell.

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:36.966
He was on the cusp of losing everything,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.933
and he was about to plead guilty,

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:42.155
and the Bronx Freedom Fund
intervened and paid his bail.

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:44.116
Now, reunited with his daughter,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.948
he was able to fight
his case from outside.

00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:48.275
Look, it took some time --

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:50.363
two years, to be exact --

00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:51.617
but at the end of that,

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.966
his case was dismissed in its entirety.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.079
For Ramel --

00:09:56.103 --> 00:10:01.340
(Applause)

00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:06.007
For Ramel, the Bronx
Freedom Fund was a lifeline,

00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:08.832
but for countless other Americans
locked in jail cells,

00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:10.924
there is no freedom fund coming.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.595
It's time to do something about that.

00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:16.504
It's time to do something big.

00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:18.567
It's time to do something bold.

00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:22.394
It's time to do something,
maybe, audacious?

00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:23.645
(Laughter)

00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:26.939
We want to take our proven,
revolving bail-fund model

00:10:26.963 --> 00:10:28.329
that we built in the Bronx

00:10:28.353 --> 00:10:30.177
and spread it across America,

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:32.398
attacking the front end
of the legal system

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:34.288
before incarceration begins.

00:10:34.312 --> 00:10:36.290
(Applause)

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:39.626
(Cheers)

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:45.708
(Applause)

00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:46.914
Here's the plan.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:47.990
(Applause)

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.253
We're going to bail out
as many people as we can

00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:51.511
as quickly as we can.

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:52.767
Over the next five years,

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:55.934
partnering with public defenders
and local community organizations,

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.708
we're going to set up 40 sites
in high-need jurisdictions.

00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:01.965
The goal is to bail out 160,000 people.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.065
Our strategy leverages the fact

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:06.597
that bail money comes back
at the end of a case.

00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:07.841
Data from the Bronx

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:12.676
shows that a dollar can be used
two or three times a year,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.013
creating a massive force multiplier.

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:20.666
So a dollar donated today can be used
to pay bail for up to 15 people

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.699
over the next five years.

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:28.552
Our strategy also relies on the experience
and the wisdom and the leadership

00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:32.450
of those who have experienced
this injustice firsthand.

00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:34.323
(Applause)

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:38.378
Each bail project site will be staffed
by a team of bail disrupters.

00:11:38.903 --> 00:11:42.904
These are passionate, dedicated
advocates from local communities,

00:11:42.928 --> 00:11:45.537
many of whom were formerly
incarcerated themselves,

00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:47.910
who will pay bails and support clients

00:11:47.934 --> 00:11:50.411
while their cases are going
through the legal system,

00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:53.628
providing them with whatever
resources and support they may need.

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:56.850
Our first two sites are up and running.

00:11:56.874 --> 00:11:58.627
One in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.437
and one in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.270
And Ramel?

00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:06.158
He's training right now to be a bail
disrupter in Queens County, New York.

00:12:06.182 --> 00:12:11.623
(Applause)

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.973
Our next three sites are ready to launch

00:12:13.997 --> 00:12:16.977
in Dallas, Detroit
and Louisville, Kentucky.

00:12:17.878 --> 00:12:20.807
The Bail Project will attack
the money bail system

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.664
on an unprecedented scale.

00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:27.854
We will also listen, collect and elevate

00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:30.243
and honor the stories of our clients

00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:32.722
so that we can change hearts and minds,

00:12:32.746 --> 00:12:36.390
and we will collect
critical, national data

00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:40.054
that we need so we can chart
a better path forward

00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:44.808
so that we do not recreate this system
of oppression in just another form.

00:12:45.434 --> 00:12:46.595
The Bail Project,

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:50.228
by bailing out 160,000 people
over the next five years,

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:53.690
will become one of the largest
non-governmental decarcerations

00:12:53.714 --> 00:12:55.367
of Americans in history.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.051
So look --

00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:59.535
(Applause)

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:02.139
the criminal legal system, as it exists --

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:04.066
it needs to be dismantled.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.671
But here's the thing I know
from decades in the system:

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:09.410
real, systemic change takes time,

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:11.236
and it takes a variety of strategies.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.416
So it's going to take all of us.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.693
It's going to take
the civil rights litigators,

00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:20.146
the community organizers, the academics,
the media, the philanthropists,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.240
the students, the singers, the poets,

00:13:22.264 --> 00:13:26.634
and, of course, the voices and efforts
of those who are impacted by this system.

00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:30.365
But here's what I also know:

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:33.766
together, I believe we can end
mass incarceration.

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:37.077
But one last thing:

00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:40.641
those people, sitting in America,
in those jail cells,

00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:42.966
in every corner of the country,

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.296
who are held in jail
on bail bondage, right now --

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.484
they need a lifeline today.

00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:51.348
That's where The Bail Project comes in.

00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:55.402
We have a proven model, a plan of action,

00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:57.546
and a growing network of bail disrupters

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.390
who are audacious enough
to dream big and fight hard,

00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:04.388
one bail at a time, for as long it takes,

00:14:04.412 --> 00:14:09.162
until true freedom and equal justice
are a reality in America.

00:14:09.589 --> 00:14:10.739
Thank you.

00:14:10.763 --> 00:14:17.763
(Applause)
