00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.630
To better understand what genetic factors might

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.740
be influencing bipolar disorder. A large genome-wide

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.480
association study has been conducted using hundreds

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.680
of thousands of SNVs. In 3,000 control individuals

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.550
who don't have bipolar disorder And 2,000

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.750
individuals that have been diagnosed with bipolar

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.670
disorder. Although some alleles or variants were

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.230
found more often in patients than in controls.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.980
None were convincingly different than would be

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.860
expected by chance. So which of the following

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.940
is most likely to be true? Now there are multiple answers to this question. So I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.730
want you to check all that you think apply. This could be a little bit tricky

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.550
so try to take each answer individually to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.660
critically think about which options are actually viable.
