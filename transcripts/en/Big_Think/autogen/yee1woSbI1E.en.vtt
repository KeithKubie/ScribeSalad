was going blind and that meant that
there were lots of questions that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
there were lots of questions that
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.349
there were lots of questions that
constantly kept arising about how much

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359

you put your mind and heart to it and
yet at the same time I was also getting

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
yet at the same time I was also getting
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.710

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660
you study math can you go to a normal
 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.180
you study math can you go to a normal
school do you need to go to a special

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
school do you need to go to a special
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.490

be able to get married
so it was constantly thinking about both

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
so it was constantly thinking about both
 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.730
so it was constantly thinking about both
both choice in terms of possibilities I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740
both choice in terms of possibilities I
 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.170
both choice in terms of possibilities I
mean because choice is the thing that's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
mean because choice is the thing that's
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.730
mean because choice is the thing that's
supposed to I'll enable you to be

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
supposed to I'll enable you to be
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.350
supposed to I'll enable you to be
whatever it is you want to be and yet at

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
whatever it is you want to be and yet at
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.930
whatever it is you want to be and yet at
the same time you have to think about

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940
the same time you have to think about
 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.870
the same time you have to think about
choice in terms of its limitations and I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880
choice in terms of its limitations and I
 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.780
choice in terms of its limitations and I
think that too ended up affecting a lot

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
think that too ended up affecting a lot
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.490
think that too ended up affecting a lot
of the different research questions that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
of the different research questions that
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.340
of the different research questions that
I later asked was really was about well

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350
I later asked was really was about well
 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.660
I later asked was really was about well
to what extent how do we balance choice

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670
to what extent how do we balance choice
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.740
to what extent how do we balance choice
as possibility and choice as limitations

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
 
 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.360
 
I don't know if I approached choice any

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
I don't know if I approached choice any
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.100
I don't know if I approached choice any
differently than the sighted people do

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110
differently than the sighted people do
 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.800
differently than the sighted people do
but I what I am very cognizant of is

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810
but I what I am very cognizant of is
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.360
but I what I am very cognizant of is
that choice does have limits and because

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370
that choice does have limits and because
 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.860
that choice does have limits and because
of that I really try to take advantage

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870
of that I really try to take advantage
 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.199
of that I really try to take advantage
of the domains in which I do have choice

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
of the domains in which I do have choice
 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.070
of the domains in which I do have choice
and when I do have choice I try to be

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080
and when I do have choice I try to be
 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.640
and when I do have choice I try to be
very picky about or shall I say choosy

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650
very picky about or shall I say choosy
 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.620
very picky about or shall I say choosy
about when I choose I don't

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630
about when I choose I don't
 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.370
about when I choose I don't
automatically decide that I must be the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
automatically decide that I must be the
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.949
automatically decide that I must be the
one to choose or that it's important for

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
one to choose or that it's important for
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.590
one to choose or that it's important for
me to make every choice in my life I

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600
me to make every choice in my life I
 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.760
me to make every choice in my life I
pick what are my priorities and I limit

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770
pick what are my priorities and I limit
 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.790
pick what are my priorities and I limit
those priorities to less than five in my

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800
those priorities to less than five in my
 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.130
those priorities to less than five in my
life and really in those particular

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140
life and really in those particular
 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.710
life and really in those particular
areas put in the energy to try to make

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
areas put in the energy to try to make
 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.530
areas put in the energy to try to make
good choices so I think of choosing is a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540
good choices so I think of choosing is a
 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.400
good choices so I think of choosing is a
both a fun and an effortful activity and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410

let me do a little experiment where we

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530
let me do a little experiment where we
 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.830
let me do a little experiment where we
put out a little tasting booth next to

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840
put out a little tasting booth next to
 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.290
put out a little tasting booth next to
the entry we either put out six

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300
the entry we either put out six
 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.780
the entry we either put out six
different flavors of jam or 24 different

different flavors of jam or 24 different
 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.290
different flavors of jam or 24 different
flavors of jam and we looked at two

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300
flavors of jam and we looked at two
 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.370
flavors of jam and we looked at two
things first

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380
things first
 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.260
things first
in what case were people more likely to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270
in what case were people more likely to
 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.330
in what case were people more likely to
be attracted to the jar of jam so in

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340
be attracted to the jar of jam so in
 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.710
be attracted to the jar of jam so in
which case are people more likely to

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720
which case are people more likely to
 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.640
which case are people more likely to
stop when they saw the display of jams

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650
stop when they saw the display of jams
 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.170
stop when they saw the display of jams
and what we felt was that more people

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180
and what we felt was that more people
 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.719
and what we felt was that more people
stopped when there were 24 jams about

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729
stopped when there were 24 jams about
 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.690
stopped when there were 24 jams about
60% of the people stopped when we had 24

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700
60% of the people stopped when we had 24
 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.719
60% of the people stopped when we had 24
jams on display and then at the times

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729
jams on display and then at the times
 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.909
jams on display and then at the times
when we had six different flavors of jam

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919
when we had six different flavors of jam
 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.190
when we had six different flavors of jam
out on display only 40 percent of the

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200
out on display only 40 percent of the
 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.710
out on display only 40 percent of the
people

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720
people
 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.350
people
I stopped so more people were clearly

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360
I stopped so more people were clearly
 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.750
I stopped so more people were clearly
attracted to the larger varieties of

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760
attracted to the larger varieties of
 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.060
attracted to the larger varieties of
options but then when it came down to

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070
options but then when it came down to
 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.070
options but then when it came down to
buying so the second thing we looked at

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080
buying so the second thing we looked at
 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.750
buying so the second thing we looked at
is in what case were people more likely

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760
is in what case were people more likely
 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.870
is in what case were people more likely
to buy a jar of jam what we found was

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880
to buy a jar of jam what we found was
 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.060
to buy a jar of jam what we found was
that of the people who stopped when

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070
that of the people who stopped when
 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.890
that of the people who stopped when
there were 24 different flavors of jam

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900
there were 24 different flavors of jam
 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.070
there were 24 different flavors of jam
out on display only 3 percent of them

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080
out on display only 3 percent of them
 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.630
out on display only 3 percent of them
actually bought a jar of jam

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640
actually bought a jar of jam
 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.610
actually bought a jar of jam
whereas over the people who stopped when

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620
whereas over the people who stopped when
 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.820
whereas over the people who stopped when
there were six different flavors of jam

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830
there were six different flavors of jam
 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.560
there were six different flavors of jam
30 percent of them actually bought a jar

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570
30 percent of them actually bought a jar
 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.860
30 percent of them actually bought a jar
of jam so if you do the math people were

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870
of jam so if you do the math people were
 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.960
of jam so if you do the math people were
actually 6 times more likely to buy a

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970
actually 6 times more likely to buy a
 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.430
actually 6 times more likely to buy a
jar of jam if they had encountered 6

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440
jar of jam if they had encountered 6
 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.610
jar of jam if they had encountered 6
then if they encountered 24 so what we

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620
then if they encountered 24 so what we
 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.770
then if they encountered 24 so what we
learned from this study was that well

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780
learned from this study was that well
 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.840
learned from this study was that well
people were more attracted to having

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850
people were more attracted to having
 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.610
people were more attracted to having
more options that's what sort of got

more options that's what sort of got
 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.560
more options that's what sort of got
them in the door or got them to think

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570
them in the door or got them to think
 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.440
them in the door or got them to think
about jam when it came to choosing time

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450
about jam when it came to choosing time
 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.990
about jam when it came to choosing time
they were actually less likely to make a

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
they were actually less likely to make a
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.450
they were actually less likely to make a
choice if they had more to choose from

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
choice if they had more to choose from
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.760
choice if they had more to choose from
than if they had a fewer to choose from

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770
than if they had a fewer to choose from
 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.610
than if they had a fewer to choose from
and that really ended up starting an

and that really ended up starting an
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.220
and that really ended up starting an

to look at well why is that and a large

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
to look at well why is that and a large
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.110
to look at well why is that and a large
part of that has to do with the fact

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120
part of that has to do with the fact
 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.909
part of that has to do with the fact
that when people have a lot of options

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919
that when people have a lot of options
 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.010
that when people have a lot of options
to choose from they don't know how to

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020
to choose from they don't know how to

to choose from they don't know how to
tell them apart they don't know how to

tell them apart they don't know how to
 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.469
tell them apart they don't know how to
keep track of them then they start

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479
keep track of them then they start
 

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.420
keep track of them then they start
asking them so as well which one's the

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:02.430
asking them so as well which one's the
 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.659
asking them so as well which one's the
best which one would be good for me and

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:05.669
best which one would be good for me and
 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:07.219
best which one would be good for me and
that all those questions are much easier

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:07.229
that all those questions are much easier

we have a lot more than 24 of things to
