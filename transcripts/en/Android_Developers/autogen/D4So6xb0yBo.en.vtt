asked today on the AMIA show about the
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250
asked today on the AMIA show about the
issue tracker focusing on the most

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
issue tracker focusing on the most
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170

starred issues may make sense for

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
starred issues may make sense for
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479
starred issues may make sense for
enhancements but for defects and doesn't

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
enhancements but for defects and doesn't
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099
enhancements but for defects and doesn't
that seem that doesn't seem effective

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
that seem that doesn't seem effective
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.740
that seem that doesn't seem effective
how about setting up a triage team from

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
how about setting up a triage team from
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389
how about setting up a triage team from
the community all right

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
the community all right
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160
the community all right
so for those of you who were not

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
so for those of you who were not
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.039
so for those of you who were not
watching the AMIA office hours the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
watching the AMIA office hours the
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469
watching the AMIA office hours the
question was basically how are bugs in

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
question was basically how are bugs in
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.300
question was basically how are bugs in
the android issue tracker which by the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
the android issue tracker which by the
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179
the android issue tracker which by the
way is located at be Android comm so you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
way is located at be Android comm so you
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640
way is located at be Android comm so you
know like bugs betta Android calm and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
know like bugs betta Android calm and
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.690
know like bugs betta Android calm and
the answer was that we look at them

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
the answer was that we look at them
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.640
the answer was that we look at them
there are a lot of issues there and we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
there are a lot of issues there and we
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770
there are a lot of issues there and we
look at them primarily by number of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
look at them primarily by number of
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330
look at them primarily by number of
stars which is what we use as our voting

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
stars which is what we use as our voting
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429
stars which is what we use as our voting
mechanism so if issues get a lot of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
mechanism so if issues get a lot of
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.990
mechanism so if issues get a lot of
stars they bubble up to the top and they

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
stars they bubble up to the top and they
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969
stars they bubble up to the top and they
get the most attention of course you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
get the most attention of course you
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440
get the most attention of course you
know we do try and take a look at all

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
know we do try and take a look at all
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450
know we do try and take a look at all
bugs but you know some get of course

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
bugs but you know some get of course
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210
bugs but you know some get of course
some more attention than others so and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
some more attention than others so and
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340
some more attention than others so and
the ESO as far as you know does that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
the ESO as far as you know does that
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.190
the ESO as far as you know does that
make sense for defects I think sometimes

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
make sense for defects I think sometimes
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.010
make sense for defects I think sometimes
it does there certainly are some really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
it does there certainly are some really
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319
it does there certainly are some really
annoying defects that impact a lot of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
annoying defects that impact a lot of
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.690
annoying defects that impact a lot of
people and it's good to go and make sure

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
people and it's good to go and make sure
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.980
people and it's good to go and make sure
there's a way to go and get you know

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
there's a way to go and get you know
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.389
there's a way to go and get you know
yeah you have a way to voice that you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
yeah you have a way to voice that you
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399
yeah you have a way to voice that you
need those fixed and so I think stars

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
need those fixed and so I think stars
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469
need those fixed and so I think stars
work really well for that that being

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
work really well for that that being
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569
work really well for that that being
said you know sometimes there are some

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
said you know sometimes there are some
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300
said you know sometimes there are some
bugs that don't impact a lot of people

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
bugs that don't impact a lot of people
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.950
bugs that don't impact a lot of people
but the few people that impacts there is

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960
but the few people that impacts there is
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.930
but the few people that impacts there is
you know it's still worth fixing because

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
you know it's still worth fixing because
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609
you know it's still worth fixing because
it's annoyance to that's small number of

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
it's annoyance to that's small number of
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500
it's annoyance to that's small number of
people right if if it's a blocking bug

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
people right if if it's a blocking bug
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.030
people right if if it's a blocking bug
you know that if it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
you know that if it
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.740
you know that if it
prevents you from building something

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
prevents you from building something
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.990
prevents you from building something
right if you can't you know stream media

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
right if you can't you know stream media
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.069
right if you can't you know stream media
if you can't you're just for an example

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079
if you can't you're just for an example
 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.580
if you can't you're just for an example
yeah that should be fixed probably a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
yeah that should be fixed probably a
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.750
yeah that should be fixed probably a
little bit quicker than something that's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
little bit quicker than something that's
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.750
little bit quicker than something that's
more of a cosmetic change so in those

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
more of a cosmetic change so in those
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520
more of a cosmetic change so in those
cases I mean we still do take a look at

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
cases I mean we still do take a look at
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.830
cases I mean we still do take a look at
pretty much every bug when it comes in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
pretty much every bug when it comes in
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.199
pretty much every bug when it comes in
we need to go we assign them we do do

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
we need to go we assign them we do do
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.399
we need to go we assign them we do do
initial triage so yes even though we do

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409
initial triage so yes even though we do
 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.899
initial triage so yes even though we do
look at the start issues first we do

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909
look at the start issues first we do
 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.069
look at the start issues first we do
look at all the bugs so I'm not sure

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079
look at all the bugs so I'm not sure
 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.280
look at all the bugs so I'm not sure
that we really need to add another level

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
that we really need to add another level
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990
that we really need to add another level
of trajan triage on there since we're

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
of trajan triage on there since we're
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.280
of trajan triage on there since we're
already doing another level internally

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
already doing another level internally
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.559
already doing another level internally
but that being said I'll certainly go

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
but that being said I'll certainly go
 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.879
but that being said I'll certainly go
ahead and pass this along to the rest of

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889
ahead and pass this along to the rest of
 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.020
ahead and pass this along to the rest of
the team and see if management likes

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
the team and see if management likes
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.300
the team and see if management likes
that idea and you know it's possible to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
that idea and you know it's possible to
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.780
that idea and you know it's possible to
go somewhere we'll see so feature

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
go somewhere we'll see so feature
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.649

to help avoid these problems deep specs

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310

on the internal behavior would help

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030
on the internal behavior would help
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.909

that's a good question a little bit out

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919
that's a good question a little bit out
 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.219
that's a good question a little bit out
of my league about you yeah I can I can

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229
of my league about you yeah I can I can
 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.110
of my league about you yeah I can I can
speak a little bit on that one so we

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
speak a little bit on that one so we
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.920
speak a little bit on that one so we
added low latency audio paths in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930
added low latency audio paths in
 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.170
added low latency audio paths in
jellybean but this is primarily for

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
jellybean but this is primarily for
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.119
jellybean but this is primarily for
playback for recording there's not

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129
playback for recording there's not
 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.309
playback for recording there's not
really a really good low latency path

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319
really a really good low latency path
 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.099
really a really good low latency path
yet audio record is the best one

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109
yet audio record is the best one
 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.099
yet audio record is the best one
available and it does work but you just

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109
available and it does work but you just
 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.270
available and it does work but you just
have to be super careful when you use it

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280
have to be super careful when you use it
 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.920
have to be super careful when you use it
the most important thing is to make sure

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
the most important thing is to make sure
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.509
the most important thing is to make sure
that you pick your buffer sizes

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519
that you pick your buffer sizes
 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.030
that you pick your buffer sizes
carefully and keep in mind those buffer

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
carefully and keep in mind those buffer
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.890
carefully and keep in mind those buffer
sizes will change on a device by device

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
sizes will change on a device by device
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.229
sizes will change on a device by device
basis so there are some methods in you

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239
basis so there are some methods in you
 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.550
basis so there are some methods in you
there you can go and use to try and

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
there you can go and use to try and
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.869
there you can go and use to try and
figure out what size buffer is

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879
figure out what size buffer is
 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.849
figure out what size buffer is
appropriate for the device you're on and

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859
appropriate for the device you're on and
 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.800
appropriate for the device you're on and
that will help go and avoid some of

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
that will help go and avoid some of
 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.330
that will help go and avoid some of
those stuttering issues that you're

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
those stuttering issues that you're
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729
those stuttering issues that you're
running into and hopefully it's oh it's

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
running into and hopefully it's oh it's
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.499
running into and hopefully it's oh it's
some point in the future we'll go and

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509
some point in the future we'll go and
 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.450
some point in the future we'll go and
add some more API is or improve the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
add some more API is or improve the
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.900

a buffer problem so check your buffer

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730
a buffer problem so check your buffer
 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.450
a buffer problem so check your buffer
sizes now that's it

approach is to go and call get codex and
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.310
approach is to go and call get codex and
check which codex are present and that

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320
check which codex are present and that
 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.130
check which codex are present and that
at least gets you as far as AMR and

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140
at least gets you as far as AMR and
 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.870
at least gets you as far as AMR and
we'll try and find some information

myself this is probably a good question
 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.610
myself this is probably a good question
for our guests when he finally arrives

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620
for our guests when he finally arrives
 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.570
for our guests when he finally arrives
so let's go let's come back to this one

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580
so let's go let's come back to this one
 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.420
so let's go let's come back to this one
in a bit okay let's move up here alright

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.430
in a bit okay let's move up here alright
 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.030
in a bit okay let's move up here alright
Alex asks I would love to see more

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.040
Alex asks I would love to see more
 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.410
Alex asks I would love to see more
working code samples in the

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.420
working code samples in the
 

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.840
working code samples in the
documentation yes you and many other

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850
documentation yes you and many other
 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.830
documentation yes you and many other
people actually more specifically if we

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840
people actually more specifically if we
 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.630
people actually more specifically if we
take a good look at the code that was

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:56.640
take a good look at the code that was
 

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.330
take a good look at the code that was
presented at Google 2012 we can see that

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340
presented at Google 2012 we can see that
 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.460
presented at Google 2012 we can see that
it was had a lot of mistakes and all of

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.470
it was had a lot of mistakes and all of
 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.080
it was had a lot of mistakes and all of
them were copy pasted to the developer

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090
them were copy pasted to the developer
 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.690
them were copy pasted to the developer
documentation I'm not sure that that's

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.700
documentation I'm not sure that that's
 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.570
documentation I'm not sure that that's
actually true it may seem like the stuff

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580
actually true it may seem like the stuff
 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.600
actually true it may seem like the stuff
that you're working on was copy pasted

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.610
that you're working on was copy pasted
 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.240
that you're working on was copy pasted
from the developers documentation we do

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.250
from the developers documentation we do
 

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.400
from the developers documentation we do
use our documentation extensively to

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.410
use our documentation extensively to
 

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.840
use our documentation extensively to
build our samples and code samples and

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:19.850
build our samples and code samples and
 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.650
build our samples and code samples and
unfortunately when we write them

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660
unfortunately when we write them
 

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.850
unfortunately when we write them
sometimes we make mistakes so definitely

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860
sometimes we make mistakes so definitely
 

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.480
sometimes we make mistakes so definitely
appreciate the the feedback on that but

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.490
appreciate the the feedback on that but
 

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.160
appreciate the the feedback on that but
more helpful would be pointing out some

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.170
more helpful would be pointing out some
 

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.230
more helpful would be pointing out some
of those issues certainly you can go to

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240
of those issues certainly you can go to
 

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.310
of those issues certainly you can go to
be Android calm and file some bugs on

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320
be Android calm and file some bugs on
 

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.080
be Android calm and file some bugs on
that one we definitely look at that for

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.090
that one we definitely look at that for
 

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.199
that one we definitely look at that for
documentation errors

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:42.209
documentation errors
 

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:43.720
documentation errors
coding errors and all that stuff so

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:43.730
coding errors and all that stuff so
 

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.730
coding errors and all that stuff so
appreciate the feedback yeah and if

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740
appreciate the feedback yeah and if
 

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.900
appreciate the feedback yeah and if
you're feeling a bit more adventurous

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:47.910
you're feeling a bit more adventurous
 

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.489
you're feeling a bit more adventurous
too I'll point out you actually can go

00:08:49.489 --> 00:08:49.499
too I'll point out you actually can go
 

00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:51.439
too I'll point out you actually can go
and modify all the docs yourself we

00:08:51.439 --> 00:08:51.449
and modify all the docs yourself we
 

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:53.689
and modify all the docs yourself we
don't normally point it out too heavily

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:53.699
don't normally point it out too heavily
 

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.299
don't normally point it out too heavily
because our documentation system could

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:56.309
because our documentation system could
 

00:08:56.309 --> 00:08:58.100
because our documentation system could
be a little nicer but if you look in the

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.110
be a little nicer but if you look in the
 

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.679
be a little nicer but if you look in the
source tree under framework space Docs

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:00.689
source tree under framework space Docs
 

00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:03.019

for you we want to go and get that
 

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.799
for you we want to go and get that

feeling more adventurous like it's
Trevor said you can go ahead and

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:38.610
Trevor said you can go ahead and
 

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.249
Trevor said you can go ahead and
actually make it change and file a patch

00:09:40.249 --> 00:09:40.259
actually make it change and file a patch
 

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.009
actually make it change and file a patch
and we'll take a look at that but you

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019
and we'll take a look at that but you
 

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.509
and we'll take a look at that but you
know please do tell us about the stuff

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519
know please do tell us about the stuff
 

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.389
know please do tell us about the stuff
that is missing or incorrect we're

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399
that is missing or incorrect we're
 

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.249
that is missing or incorrect we're
always working on improvements to the

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:49.259
always working on improvements to the
 

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:50.869
always working on improvements to the
documentation so you know we do

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:50.879
documentation so you know we do
 

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.299
documentation so you know we do
appreciate that feedback and we

definitely take a look at that when
 

00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:57.410
definitely take a look at that when
folks file bugs so please give us more

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420
folks file bugs so please give us more
 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.780
folks file bugs so please give us more
feedback we appreciate it all right

00:09:59.780 --> 00:09:59.790
feedback we appreciate it all right
 

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.169
feedback we appreciate it all right
let's move on to Markus is very popular

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:03.179
let's move on to Markus is very popular
 

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:05.809
let's move on to Markus is very popular
with the questions today again from

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:05.819
with the questions today again from
 

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:09.019
with the questions today again from
European kin of new video recordings

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:09.029
European kin of new video recordings
 

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:11.119
European kin of new video recordings
start exactly where our previous one

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:11.129
start exactly where our previous one
 

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:14.840
start exactly where our previous one
ends I want to say not likely because

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:14.850
ends I want to say not likely because
 

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.340
ends I want to say not likely because
just you're gonna have to stop the video

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.350
just you're gonna have to stop the video
 

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.710
just you're gonna have to stop the video
recording start the video recording and

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720
recording start the video recording and
 

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.679
recording start the video recording and
in between that time yeah some number of

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:21.689
in between that time yeah some number of
 

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:23.090
in between that time yeah some number of
milliseconds will pass while you're

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100
milliseconds will pass while you're
 

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.939
milliseconds will pass while you're
performing operations I think the best

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:25.949
performing operations I think the best
 

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:27.619
performing operations I think the best
option would be to go and have a single

00:10:27.619 --> 00:10:27.629
option would be to go and have a single
 

00:10:27.629 --> 00:10:29.629
option would be to go and have a single
continuous recording and then trim it up

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:29.639
continuous recording and then trim it up
 

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:32.600
continuous recording and then trim it up
afterwards alternatively recording to

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:32.610
afterwards alternatively recording to
 

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.369
afterwards alternatively recording to
some in-memory store and then just go in

00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:34.379
some in-memory store and then just go in
 

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:36.410
some in-memory store and then just go in
to splice it in memory I think if you're

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420
to splice it in memory I think if you're
 

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.600
to splice it in memory I think if you're
just going and writing out to a file and

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.610
just going and writing out to a file and
 

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.189
just going and writing out to a file and
you're trying to switch files there's

00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:40.199
you're trying to switch files there's
 

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:41.210
you're trying to switch files there's
gonna be overhead there and it's not

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220
gonna be overhead there and it's not
 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.069
gonna be overhead there and it's not
going to start and stop exactly where

00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079
going to start and stop exactly where
 

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:44.960
going to start and stop exactly where
you left off on top of that I think when

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
you left off on top of that I think when
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.249
you left off on top of that I think when
you stop recording the videos and it

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:46.259
you stop recording the videos and it
 

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:47.449
you stop recording the videos and it
closed the camera connection as well

00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459
closed the camera connection as well
 

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:49.249
closed the camera connection as well
which is going to add additional lag

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:49.259
which is going to add additional lag
 

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.090
which is going to add additional lag
when the camera needs to be

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100
when the camera needs to be
 

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.639
when the camera needs to be
reinitialized yeah probably you want to

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:52.649
reinitialized yeah probably you want to
 

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:53.330
reinitialized yeah probably you want to
do a different

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:53.340
do a different
 

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.470
do a different
approach there maybe you're putting

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480
approach there maybe you're putting
 

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.640
approach there maybe you're putting
bookmarks or noting particular tags in

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:58.650
bookmarks or noting particular tags in
 

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.090
bookmarks or noting particular tags in
the file just for example a time stamp

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100
the file just for example a time stamp
 

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.830
the file just for example a time stamp
that says alright there's the beginning

stopping the video recording as Trevor
 

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.800
stopping the video recording as Trevor
says that's going to have that

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:12.810
says that's going to have that
 

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.590
says that's going to have that
start/stop problem has a lot of lag to

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600
start/stop problem has a lot of lag to
 

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.420
start/stop problem has a lot of lag to
it and there's some overhead that you're

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:17.430
it and there's some overhead that you're
 

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.310
it and there's some overhead that you're
going to incur as soon as you stop and

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320
going to incur as soon as you stop and
 

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.900
going to incur as soon as you stop and
start something alright so another good

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:23.910
start something alright so another good
 

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.880

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.050
 
we're okay so we're added into widgets

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060
we're okay so we're added into widgets
 

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.140
we're okay so we're added into widgets
in 4.0 was an intentional that they

in 4.0 was an intentional that they
 

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.760
in 4.0 was an intentional that they

design guidelines are we phasing them

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920
design guidelines are we phasing them
 

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.680
design guidelines are we phasing them
out discouraging their use since they

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:03.690
out discouraging their use since they
 

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.120
out discouraging their use since they
don't get mentioned in the new dev site

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.130

either so yeah the shortcuts are

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820
either so yeah the shortcuts are
 

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.640
either so yeah the shortcuts are
definitely something that we're not

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:10.650
definitely something that we're not
 

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.670
definitely something that we're not
heavily promoting right now and in favor

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680
heavily promoting right now and in favor
 

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.360
heavily promoting right now and in favor
of widgets so I mean I'd say there is

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.370
of widgets so I mean I'd say there is
 

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.710
of widgets so I mean I'd say there is
definitely a reason why they're not

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720
definitely a reason why they're not
 

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.780
definitely a reason why they're not
mentioned in our in the new design

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:23.790

well your so yeah we pretty much in all

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:32.550
well your so yeah we pretty much in all

well your so yeah we pretty much in all
pieces we're recommending you go with a

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:33.750
pieces we're recommending you go with a
 

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.120
pieces we're recommending you go with a
widget where you'd previously used a

widget where you'd previously used a
 

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:42.380
widget where you'd previously used a
shortcut alright thanks for that one

again asks why does the camera need to

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:47.520
again asks why does the camera need to
 

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.700
again asks why does the camera need to
be visible on the screen to be recorded

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:49.710
be visible on the screen to be recorded
 

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.220
be visible on the screen to be recorded
I wasn't aware that that's actually

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:52.230
I wasn't aware that that's actually
 

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.350
I wasn't aware that that's actually
requirement although I know that for the

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360
requirement although I know that for the
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.480
requirement although I know that for the
camera anyway that's usually the

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:56.490
camera anyway that's usually the
 

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.060
camera anyway that's usually the
behavior that we thing and that's yeah

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.070
behavior that we thing and that's yeah
 

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.720
behavior that we thing and that's yeah
it's probably one of two things either

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:02.730
it's probably one of two things either
 

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.520
it's probably one of two things either
age was a conscious decision by the

age was a conscious decision by the
 

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.320
age was a conscious decision by the
media team to make sure that the user

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:06.330
media team to make sure that the user
 

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.770
media team to make sure that the user
knows something is being recorded or

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:08.780
knows something is being recorded or
 

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.640
knows something is being recorded or
alternatively was just an oversight in

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:10.650
alternatively was just an oversight in
 

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.400
alternatively was just an oversight in
our design and hasn't been addressed yet

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.410
our design and hasn't been addressed yet
 

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.330

without having somebody in the room who

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:14.340
without having somebody in the room who
 

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.250
without having somebody in the room who
actually wrote the camera API I can't

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260
actually wrote the camera API I can't
 

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.100
actually wrote the camera API I can't
tell you for sure but either one sounds

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:19.110
tell you for sure but either one sounds
 

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.230
tell you for sure but either one sounds
possible to me so sorry I don't have an

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240
possible to me so sorry I don't have an
 

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.630
possible to me so sorry I don't have an
authority on sir for you there yeah my

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:23.640
authority on sir for you there yeah my
 

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.670

having talked to a few of the guys on

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680
having talked to a few of the guys on
 

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.220
having talked to a few of the guys on
the guys who work on the camera team I'm

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.230
the guys who work on the camera team I'm
 

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.410
the guys who work on the camera team I'm
guessing that that was a design choice

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420
guessing that that was a design choice
 

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.410
guessing that that was a design choice
initially since we do want folks to be

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420
initially since we do want folks to be
 

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.280
initially since we do want folks to be
able to see what they're actually

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.290
able to see what they're actually
 

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.110
able to see what they're actually
recording as they're looking as they're

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120
recording as they're looking as they're

got the camera on I have seen apps at

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:40.890
got the camera on I have seen apps at
 

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.670
got the camera on I have seen apps at
least one app that I've used myself for

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680
least one app that I've used myself for
 

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.220
least one app that I've used myself for
doing something like a camera

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.230
doing something like a camera
 

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.580
doing something like a camera
surveillance that you can't turn off the

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.590
surveillance that you can't turn off the
 

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.650
surveillance that you can't turn off the
thing although I believe what's going on

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660
thing although I believe what's going on
 

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.100
thing although I believe what's going on
is that the video preview is just not

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.110
is that the video preview is just not
 

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.570
is that the video preview is just not
being shown on screen it's actually

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.580
being shown on screen it's actually
 

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.050
being shown on screen it's actually
still playing in the background so

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060
still playing in the background so
 

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.210
still playing in the background so
believe that's a design issue but again

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220
believe that's a design issue but again
 

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.890
believe that's a design issue but again
since we don't have the media team with

hey guys I've actually got a question

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.030
hey guys I've actually got a question
 

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.570
hey guys I've actually got a question
from someone on the Hangout I'm gonna

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:14.580
from someone on the Hangout I'm gonna
 

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.680
from someone on the Hangout I'm gonna
put them on for you right now

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:15.690
put them on for you right now
 

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:23.750
put them on for you right now
all right yes please oh go ahead he

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760
all right yes please oh go ahead he
 

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.750
all right yes please oh go ahead he
actually has no videos okay yeah yeah

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760
actually has no videos okay yeah yeah
 

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.910
actually has no videos okay yeah yeah
yeah hi everybody hi honey I had the

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920
yeah hi everybody hi honey I had the
 

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.310
yeah hi everybody hi honey I had the
question about encoding capabilities

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320
question about encoding capabilities
 

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.620
question about encoding capabilities
with the new media API and I tried it

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:42.630
with the new media API and I tried it
 

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.930
with the new media API and I tried it
already and the decoder stuff works

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940
already and the decoder stuff works
 

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.740
already and the decoder stuff works
great so I put videos to the

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:49.750
great so I put videos to the
 

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.940
great so I put videos to the

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:53.950
and project and it's decoded visual
 

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.610
and project and it's decoded visual
problems and it's rendered in the

come create and further so probably I'm

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120
come create and further so probably I'm
 

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.240
come create and further so probably I'm
doing something wrong but there is

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.250
doing something wrong but there is
 

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.240
doing something wrong but there is
nothing about it in documentation and

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.250
nothing about it in documentation and
 

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.160
nothing about it in documentation and
I'm just this is a problem here so I can

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.170
I'm just this is a problem here so I can
 

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:39.050
I'm just this is a problem here so I can
decode video but I cannot control so

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060
decode video but I cannot control so
 

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.690
decode video but I cannot control so
this is main problem yeah I say that the

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:42.700
this is main problem yeah I say that the
 

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.040
this is main problem yeah I say that the
first step to debugging that to be to

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.050
first step to debugging that to be to
 

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.080
first step to debugging that to be to
try and figure out what a code 38 error

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.090
try and figure out what a code 38 error
 

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.000
try and figure out what a code 38 error
is I know there are a number of numeric

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.010
is I know there are a number of numeric
 

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.890
is I know there are a number of numeric
errors like that can happen when you

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:49.900
errors like that can happen when you
 

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.040
errors like that can happen when you
work with the mediate media api's and as

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.050
work with the mediate media api's and as
 

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.450
work with the mediate media api's and as
much as I hate time people look at the

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:54.460
much as I hate time people look at the
 

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.030
much as I hate time people look at the
source it is actually the best way to

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040
source it is actually the best way to
 

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.890
source it is actually the best way to
figure out what's causing that so if you

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:58.900
figure out what's causing that so if you
 

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.300
figure out what's causing that so if you
take a look in the invert source code

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.310
take a look in the invert source code
 

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.430
take a look in the invert source code
and search for that error you can

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440
and search for that error you can
 

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.140
and search for that error you can
actually find out what the condition is

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.150
actually find out what the condition is
 

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.810
actually find out what the condition is
that causes it and that'll tell you

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:06.820
that causes it and that'll tell you
 

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.329
that causes it and that'll tell you
where to go and look my guess is

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:09.339
where to go and look my guess is
 

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:10.530
where to go and look my guess is
probably something to do with your

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:10.540
probably something to do with your
 

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.630
probably something to do with your
encoding settings possibly you know

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:12.640
encoding settings possibly you know
 

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.070
encoding settings possibly you know
maybe some unsupported codec on that

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.080
maybe some unsupported codec on that
 

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.700
maybe some unsupported codec on that
device something like that

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:16.710
device something like that
 

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.720
device something like that
yeah our documentation probably should

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.730
yeah our documentation probably should
 

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.130
yeah our documentation probably should
be a bit better there so I apologize for

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:20.140
be a bit better there so I apologize for
 

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.400
be a bit better there so I apologize for
that

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.410
that
 

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.590
that
but yeah that's usually where you wind

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600
but yeah that's usually where you wind
 

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.540
but yeah that's usually where you wind
up doing when I run into those have you

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:24.550
up doing when I run into those have you
 

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.700
up doing when I run into those have you
tried this on multiple devices or the

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.710
tried this on multiple devices or the
 

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.060
tried this on multiple devices or the
same error or just on one specific yes

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.070
same error or just on one specific yes
 

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.810
same error or just on one specific yes
multiple devices and the same error and

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:33.820
multiple devices and the same error and
 

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.500
multiple devices and the same error and
I tried to create it with different

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:36.510
I tried to create it with different
 

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.470
I tried to create it with different
codecs from my which were available in

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480
codecs from my which were available in
 

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.660
codecs from my which were available in
the system and the 3-3 GP or AVC impact

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:45.670
the system and the 3-3 GP or AVC impact
 

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.200
the system and the 3-3 GP or AVC impact
for so the same error and nothing else

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.210
for so the same error and nothing else
 

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.050
for so the same error and nothing else
so and I also supplied different sets of

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.060
so and I also supplied different sets of
 

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.530
so and I also supplied different sets of
parameters or product and it did not

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:55.540
parameters or product and it did not
 

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.160
parameters or product and it did not
help either

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.170
help either
 

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:02.130
help either
so okay then I will take a look into and

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:02.140
so okay then I will take a look into and
 

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.630
so okay then I will take a look into and
I'm decay with

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640
I'm decay with
 

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.810
I'm decay with
the open maxium and probably there is a

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:06.820
the open maxium and probably there is a
 

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.430
the open maxium and probably there is a
some description of it yeah and then you

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:11.440
some description of it yeah and then you
 

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.300
some description of it yeah and then you
can put a post something on Stack

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:15.310
can put a post something on Stack
 

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.770
can put a post something on Stack
Overflow so we can get a little bit more

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:16.780
Overflow so we can get a little bit more
 

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.340
Overflow so we can get a little bit more
detail on that having worked with you

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:20.350
detail on that having worked with you
 

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.960
detail on that having worked with you
know some of the media stuff myself I

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:21.970
know some of the media stuff myself I
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.199
know some of the media stuff myself I
know it's very finicky you run into some

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:25.209
know it's very finicky you run into some
 

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.480
know it's very finicky you run into some
issues myself not even using the more

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:27.490
issues myself not even using the more
 

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.480
issues myself not even using the more
the more recent API so if you can give

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.490
the more recent API so if you can give
 

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.920
the more recent API so if you can give
us a little bit more detail on that we

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:31.930
us a little bit more detail on that we
 

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.780
us a little bit more detail on that we
can hopefully follow up and talk to the

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:33.790
can hopefully follow up and talk to the
 

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.450
can hopefully follow up and talk to the
media team and see what's going on there

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460
media team and see what's going on there
 

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.070
media team and see what's going on there
their markets probably there might be

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080
their markets probably there might be
 

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.660
their markets probably there might be
just a bit you're not flipping that

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:39.670
just a bit you're not flipping that
 

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.890
just a bit you're not flipping that
isn't obvious to to you or us so so we

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:43.900
isn't obvious to to you or us so so we
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.620
isn't obvious to to you or us so so we
can follow up with you on that one too

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.630
can follow up with you on that one too
 

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.680
can follow up with you on that one too
mm-hmm and I have also one question I

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:49.690
mm-hmm and I have also one question I
 

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:55.140
mm-hmm and I have also one question I
was trying to create some filters for

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.150
was trying to create some filters for
 

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.960
was trying to create some filters for
the camera and I looked into the source

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:57.970
the camera and I looked into the source
 

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.710
the camera and I looked into the source
code and as you know for sure we have

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720
code and as you know for sure we have
 

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.990
code and as you know for sure we have
several possible filters for the camera

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000
several possible filters for the camera
 

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.010
several possible filters for the camera
and they depends on the manufacturer and

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020
and they depends on the manufacturer and
 

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.870
and they depends on the manufacturer and
so different devices have different sets

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880
so different devices have different sets
 

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.480
so different devices have different sets
of the filters that we can apply to the

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.490
of the filters that we can apply to the
 

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:18.090
of the filters that we can apply to the
camera and I was browsing the source

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:18.100
camera and I was browsing the source
 

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.220
camera and I was browsing the source
code and actually I did not find any

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.230
code and actually I did not find any
 

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.440
code and actually I did not find any
implementation of the filters so I could

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.450
implementation of the filters so I could
 

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.460
implementation of the filters so I could
find the constants same kind of sepia or

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.470
find the constants same kind of sepia or
 

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.610
find the constants same kind of sepia or
like invite etcetera etc but I could not

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:32.620
like invite etcetera etc but I could not
 

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.250
like invite etcetera etc but I could not
find the implementation of this filter

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:35.260
find the implementation of this filter
 

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.470
find the implementation of this filter
filters itself in the native code

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480
filters itself in the native code
 

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:46.890
filters itself in the native code
anywhere so can you but I think we

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:46.900
anywhere so can you but I think we
 

00:18:46.900 --> 00:19:03.500
anywhere so can you but I think we
missed the end of your question there

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:03.510
 
 

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.370
 
well if you happen to get back on or if

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380
well if you happen to get back on or if
 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.570
well if you happen to get back on or if
you just won't leave a comment on the

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580
you just won't leave a comment on the
 

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.060
you just won't leave a comment on the
the Google+ post as well would work too

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.070
the Google+ post as well would work too
 

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.830
the Google+ post as well would work too
so that way we can actually note your

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840
so that way we can actually note your
 

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.960
so that way we can actually note your
question was there yeah sadly we've

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:14.970
question was there yeah sadly we've
 

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.280
question was there yeah sadly we've
missed the very end and so we're not

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:16.290
missed the very end and so we're not
 

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.240
missed the very end and so we're not
sure what you're actually trying to ask

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.250
sure what you're actually trying to ask
 

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.610
sure what you're actually trying to ask
so it sounded to me like what he was

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620
so it sounded to me like what he was
 

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.680
so it sounded to me like what he was
finding is that the the filters so the

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:24.690
finding is that the the filters so the
 

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.750
finding is that the the filters so the
different camera filters that you can

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760
different camera filters that you can
 

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.290
different camera filters that you can
apply to the camera so like sepia is one

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:30.300
apply to the camera so like sepia is one
 

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.530
apply to the camera so like sepia is one
of them I think there's like poster eyes

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:33.540
of them I think there's like poster eyes
 

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.330
of them I think there's like poster eyes
and some other things that are kind of

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340
and some other things that are kind of
 

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.770
and some other things that are kind of
like standard image filters there that

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780
like standard image filters there that
 

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.299
like standard image filters there that
there was an actually source code for

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:41.309
there was an actually source code for
 

00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:44.120
there was an actually source code for
that when I was looking at the one who's

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.130
that when I was looking at the one who's
 

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.390
that when I was looking at the one who's
looking at the platform my guess is that

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400
looking at the platform my guess is that
 

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.640
looking at the platform my guess is that
that's as expected that the camera

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:51.650
that's as expected that the camera
 

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.960
that's as expected that the camera
operations and the different filters are

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:53.970
operations and the different filters are
 

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.950
operations and the different filters are
actually implemented by the

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960
actually implemented by the
 

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.770
actually implemented by the
manufacturers that that source code that

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780
manufacturers that that source code that
 

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.169
manufacturers that that source code that
sets the custom source code didn't

00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179
sets the custom source code didn't
 

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.290
sets the custom source code didn't
develop by the the folks who actually

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:03.300
develop by the the folks who actually
 

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.760
develop by the the folks who actually
built the camera and put the device

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:04.770
built the camera and put the device
 

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.780
built the camera and put the device
together so probably what you're looking

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:08.790
together so probably what you're looking
 

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.720
together so probably what you're looking
at is having to do if you're I think the

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:11.730
at is having to do if you're I think the
 

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.340
at is having to do if you're I think the
goal was I'm guessing that the goal was

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:13.350
goal was I'm guessing that the goal was
 

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.440
goal was I'm guessing that the goal was
to make his own filters and try to do

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:15.450
to make his own filters and try to do
 

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.690
to make his own filters and try to do
that stuff I know that that's possible

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700
that stuff I know that that's possible
 

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.340
that stuff I know that that's possible
because I've seen a couple different

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:19.350
because I've seen a couple different
 

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.280
because I've seen a couple different
camera apps that do something like that

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.290
camera apps that do something like that
 

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.380
camera apps that do something like that
though being able to take the

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.390
though being able to take the
 

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.760
though being able to take the
manufacturer source code I don't think

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:25.770
manufacturer source code I don't think
 

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.440
manufacturer source code I don't think
they're gonna be lookin to do that right

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.450
they're gonna be lookin to do that right
 

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.260
they're gonna be lookin to do that right
now so anyway if we can

suppose our EO Pissarro asks I wanted to

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.620
suppose our EO Pissarro asks I wanted to

suppose our EO Pissarro asks I wanted to
choose a photo from the gallery no

00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:23.059
choose a photo from the gallery no
 

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.610
choose a photo from the gallery no
problems if a local image is chosen

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:24.620
problems if a local image is chosen
 

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.010
problems if a local image is chosen
however a Picasa photo returns a URI

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.020
however a Picasa photo returns a URI
 

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.110
however a Picasa photo returns a URI
instead of a location is there an

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120
instead of a location is there an
 

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.090
instead of a location is there an
approved way of handling this can I

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.100
approved way of handling this can I
 

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.460
approved way of handling this can I
modify my intent to only show local

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.470
modify my intent to only show local
 

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.160
modify my intent to only show local
images so I would recommend against

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.170
images so I would recommend against
 

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.919
images so I would recommend against
doing that because photos coming from

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:38.929
doing that because photos coming from
 

00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:40.750
doing that because photos coming from
Picasa are still photos that belong to

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760
Picasa are still photos that belong to
 

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.070
Picasa are still photos that belong to
the user and is something you might want

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080
the user and is something you might want
 

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.710
the user and is something you might want
to pick and you should still have them

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720
to pick and you should still have them
 

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.560
to pick and you should still have them
so the answer here is just make sure

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:47.570
so the answer here is just make sure
 

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.419
so the answer here is just make sure
that you know whatever URL you get back

00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:49.429
that you know whatever URL you get back
 

00:21:49.429 --> 00:21:52.299
that you know whatever URL you get back
with a lot of content URL or file URL or

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:52.309
with a lot of content URL or file URL or
 

00:21:52.309 --> 00:21:56.890
with a lot of content URL or file URL or
an HTTP URL treat it as a URL and decode

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:56.900
an HTTP URL treat it as a URL and decode
 

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.200
an HTTP URL treat it as a URL and decode
it properly right if it's nation URL you

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.210
it properly right if it's nation URL you
 

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.940
it properly right if it's nation URL you
should go and fetch the image from the

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:00.950
should go and fetch the image from the
 

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:05.230
should go and fetch the image from the
network and display it and yeah that's

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240
network and display it and yeah that's
 

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.870
network and display it and yeah that's
the the proper way to do it so I don't

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880
the the proper way to do it so I don't
 

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.820
the the proper way to do it so I don't
think there's a really good way to go

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:09.830
think there's a really good way to go
 

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.770
think there's a really good way to go
and say you don't want those images from

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:11.780
and say you don't want those images from
 

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.710
and say you don't want those images from
other sources because they are there for

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720
other sources because they are there for
 

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.230
other sources because they are there for
a reason it is something user can select

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240
a reason it is something user can select
 

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.049
a reason it is something user can select
right yeah so I think the answer is yeah

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:20.059
right yeah so I think the answer is yeah
 

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:22.720
right yeah so I think the answer is yeah
you probably could do that but we prefer

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:22.730
you probably could do that but we prefer
 

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.430
you probably could do that but we prefer
that you make your app more awesome and

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440
that you make your app more awesome and
 

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.080
that you make your app more awesome and
actually handle all the images at the

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.090
actually handle all the images at the
 

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.320
actually handle all the images at the
user has access to because that will

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.330
user has access to because that will
 

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.000
user has access to because that will
give them all the choices that they want

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.010
give them all the choices that they want
 

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.860
give them all the choices that they want
so a good question

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:34.870
so a good question
 

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.600
so a good question
it'll take a little slightly different

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:36.610
it'll take a little slightly different
 

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.320
it'll take a little slightly different
tack on that one all right so moving on

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.330
tack on that one all right so moving on
 

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.240
tack on that one all right so moving on
to our next question

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.250
to our next question
 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.510

interesting question yeah I'm sure it's

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840
interesting question yeah I'm sure it's
 

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.150
interesting question yeah I'm sure it's
got to be a way to do it

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:09.160
got to be a way to do it

Fredo you know you've asked a tough

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.610
Fredo you know you've asked a tough
 

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:51.840
Fredo you know you've asked a tough
question another question from anon Dave

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:51.850
question another question from anon Dave
 

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.970
question another question from anon Dave
who's Dave we're not thinking for you

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:53.980
who's Dave we're not thinking for you
 

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.130
who's Dave we're not thinking for you
Dave Dave Burke who was supposed to join

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.140
Dave Dave Burke who was supposed to join
 

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.300
Dave Dave Burke who was supposed to join
us today but unfortunately had a

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:57.310
us today but unfortunately had a
 

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.180
us today but unfortunately had a
conflict so we do have other member of

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:00.190
conflict so we do have other member of
 

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.440
conflict so we do have other member of
the media team who are supposed to join

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.450
the media team who are supposed to join
 

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.970
the media team who are supposed to join
us at some point during the show so this

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:02.980
us at some point during the show so this
 

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.990
us at some point during the show so this
is another question that we can do and

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000
is another question that we can do and
 

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.910
is another question that we can do and
revisit once we have somebody here there

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:05.920
revisit once we have somebody here there
 

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.370
revisit once we have somebody here there
you go all right so Dave who is not here

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:08.380
you go all right so Dave who is not here
 

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.370
you go all right so Dave who is not here
what would you say are the most exciting

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:11.380
what would you say are the most exciting
 

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.200
what would you say are the most exciting
capabilities use cases for enabled by

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.210
capabilities use cases for enabled by
 

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.630
capabilities use cases for enabled by
the new corporate one Audio API is that

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640
the new corporate one Audio API is that
 

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.320
the new corporate one Audio API is that
weren't possible beforehand I think this

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.330
weren't possible beforehand I think this
 

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.210
weren't possible beforehand I think this
is a question for the media team so

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:21.220
is a question for the media team so
 

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.650
is a question for the media team so
let's revisit this one I think unless

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:22.660
let's revisit this one I think unless
 

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.360
let's revisit this one I think unless
you know unless you know well I mean I

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.370
you know unless you know well I mean I
 

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.520
you know unless you know well I mean I
think the most important features that I

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:26.530
think the most important features that I
 

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.110
think the most important features that I
added with 4.1 were the low latency

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120
added with 4.1 were the low latency
 

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.370
added with 4.1 were the low latency
api's so being able to play the audio

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:35.380
api's so being able to play the audio
 

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.830
api's so being able to play the audio
very quickly versus having a little bit

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840
very quickly versus having a little bit
 

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.330
very quickly versus having a little bit
of a delay actually in the previous

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:39.340
of a delay actually in the previous
 

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.580
of a delay actually in the previous
versions I think it's like probably the

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:41.590
versions I think it's like probably the
 

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.770
versions I think it's like probably the
most important improvement that they put

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:43.780
most important improvement that they put
 

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.560
most important improvement that they put
in there there are some other ones as

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.570
in there there are some other ones as
 

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.080
in there there are some other ones as
well but it's again I feel like I'm not

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.090
well but it's again I feel like I'm not
 

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.930
well but it's again I feel like I'm not
not the right question for me so there's

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:51.940
not the right question for me so there's
 

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.920
not the right question for me so there's
a piece of an answer there anyway

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:54.930
a piece of an answer there anyway
 

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.540
a piece of an answer there anyway
there's some other interesting stuff if

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:57.550
there's some other interesting stuff if
 

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.280
there's some other interesting stuff if
you look at the developer site and look

00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.290
you look at the developer site and look
 

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.500
you look at the developer site and look
at their release notes for 4.1 we do

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.510
at their release notes for 4.1 we do
 

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.840
at their release notes for 4.1 we do
have a section on the MIDI API s and

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:03.850
have a section on the MIDI API s and
 

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.240
have a section on the MIDI API s and
some of the changes there so it's a way

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:06.250
some of the changes there so it's a way
 

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.340
some of the changes there so it's a way
to go get some of that information and

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:08.350
to go get some of that information and
 

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.350
to go get some of that information and
if Dave shows up we'll definitely come

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360
if Dave shows up we'll definitely come
 

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.850
if Dave shows up we'll definitely come
back and ask the ask that question BAM

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:11.860
back and ask the ask that question BAM
 

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.890
back and ask the ask that question BAM
oh well for that matter anyone from your

oh well for that matter anyone from your
 

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.870
oh well for that matter anyone from your
team or anyone for the media team yes

team or anyone for the media team yes
 

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.330
team or anyone for the media team yes
media team please come and see us

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:18.340
media team please come and see us
 

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.780
media team please come and see us
let's see moving on we've got another

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:21.790
let's see moving on we've got another
 

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.850
let's see moving on we've got another
question I have a question from mark in

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:23.860
question I have a question from mark in

can you speak to using the DRM API in

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360
can you speak to using the DRM API in
 

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.180
can you speak to using the DRM API in
conjunction with the media api's to

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:30.190
conjunction with the media api's to
 

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.430
conjunction with the media api's to
first apply DRM to a video and then

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440
first apply DRM to a video and then
 

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.340
first apply DRM to a video and then
verify it and play it back this might be

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:35.350
verify it and play it back this might be
 

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.590
verify it and play it back this might be
too complex a topic for the Hangout yeah

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600
too complex a topic for the Hangout yeah
 

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.750
too complex a topic for the Hangout yeah
you might be correct in that but maybe a

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760
you might be correct in that but maybe a
 

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.580
you might be correct in that but maybe a
blog post our pointers to example code

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:41.590
blog post our pointers to example code
 

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.490
blog post our pointers to example code
yeah so the DRM API is really designed

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:44.500
yeah so the DRM API is really designed
 

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.300
yeah so the DRM API is really designed
more for DRM schemes that are included

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.310
more for DRM schemes that are included
 

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.790
more for DRM schemes that are included
as part of the device so if you're

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:50.800
as part of the device so if you're
 

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.110
as part of the device so if you're
writing your own DRM scheme from scratch

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120
writing your own DRM scheme from scratch
 

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.920
writing your own DRM scheme from scratch
honestly I don't think you're gonna find

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:55.930
honestly I don't think you're gonna find
 

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.840
honestly I don't think you're gonna find
the built in DRM API is very useful for

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:57.850
the built in DRM API is very useful for
 

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.760
the built in DRM API is very useful for
that that's just been my experience it's

00:25:59.760 --> 00:25:59.770
that that's just been my experience it's
 

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.590
that that's just been my experience it's
possible there's a better way to the use

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600
possible there's a better way to the use
 

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.530
possible there's a better way to the use
of them that I've never heard about but

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:03.540
of them that I've never heard about but
 

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.690
of them that I've never heard about but
usually when you do use that the DRM

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:06.700
usually when you do use that the DRM
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.920
usually when you do use that the DRM
provider has to be part of the system

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:07.930
provider has to be part of the system
 

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:13.650
provider has to be part of the system
image yeah yeah so I think that's all

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:13.660
image yeah yeah so I think that's all
 

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.300
image yeah yeah so I think that's all
we've got to say about that one for

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.310
we've got to say about that one for
 

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.230
we've got to say about that one for
today another question for Dave who's

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240
today another question for Dave who's
 

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.230
today another question for Dave who's
not here from anonymous Dave what kind

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240
not here from anonymous Dave what kind
 

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.090
not here from anonymous Dave what kind
of hardware disqualifies a four point

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.100

one Plus device from being able to

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720
one Plus device from being able to
 

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.640
one Plus device from being able to
support the new audio effects api's ie

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:29.650
support the new audio effects api's ie
 

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.140
support the new audio effects api's ie
would it be possible to preemptively

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.150
would it be possible to preemptively
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.120
would it be possible to preemptively
predict whether a device supports it or

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.130
predict whether a device supports it or
 

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.450
predict whether a device supports it or
not just from it's just figure out from

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:36.460
not just from it's just figure out from
 

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.230
not just from it's just figure out from
its hardware specs essentially

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240
its hardware specs essentially
 

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.420
its hardware specs essentially
hmm another good question support the

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.430
hmm another good question support the
 

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:47.100
hmm another good question support the
new audio fix yeah is it sort of sounds

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.110
new audio fix yeah is it sort of sounds
 

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.650
new audio fix yeah is it sort of sounds
like there's a hardware limitation based

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:49.660
like there's a hardware limitation based
 

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.780
like there's a hardware limitation based
on what's been implemented by the

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:51.790
on what's been implemented by the
 

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.060
on what's been implemented by the
manufacturer in terms of audio alright

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:54.070
manufacturer in terms of audio alright
 

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.920
manufacturer in terms of audio alright
somehow I doubt it's gonna be just a

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:55.930
somehow I doubt it's gonna be just a
 

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.300
somehow I doubt it's gonna be just a
matter of looking at the hardware specs

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.310
matter of looking at the hardware specs
 

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.180
matter of looking at the hardware specs
I imagine there's some driver issues

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.190
I imagine there's some driver issues
 

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.190
I imagine there's some driver issues
involved as well too right so I'm not

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200
involved as well too right so I'm not
 

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.170
involved as well too right so I'm not
sure that just looking at the hardware

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.180
sure that just looking at the hardware
 

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.460
sure that just looking at the hardware
specs would give you enough information

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:05.470
specs would give you enough information
 

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.320
specs would give you enough information
to determine whether or not audio

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.330
to determine whether or not audio
 

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:15.320
to determine whether or not audio
effects are possible or not all right

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:15.330
effects are possible or not all right
 

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:21.450

some level given that whenever you
select the codec there's a certain

that's reading off directions to you and
 

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.210
that's reading off directions to you and
it's very much a you know just take my

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:10.220
it's very much a you know just take my
 

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.890
it's very much a you know just take my
text and read it and I want to be done

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:11.900
text and read it and I want to be done
 

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.010
text and read it and I want to be done
so it I don't think there's much in the

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.020
so it I don't think there's much in the
 

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.300
so it I don't think there's much in the
way of the API therefore things like

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:16.310
way of the API therefore things like
 

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.010
way of the API therefore things like
getting the link things like that

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.020

display an HDMI output how is that done
I could not find any API for this is it

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:36.950
I could not find any API for this is it
 

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.580
I could not find any API for this is it
Hardware dependent okay I actually do

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.590
Hardware dependent okay I actually do
 

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.530
Hardware dependent okay I actually do
know that for this one all right looks

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:41.540
know that for this one all right looks
 

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.850
know that for this one all right looks
like it came up a couple weeks ago so

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:42.860
like it came up a couple weeks ago so
 

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.050
like it came up a couple weeks ago so
the answer is there is support in the

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.060
the answer is there is support in the
 

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.740
the answer is there is support in the
system specifically for video services

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:50.750
system specifically for video services
 

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:56.380
system specifically for video services
and HDMI output so it is a manufacturer

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.390
and HDMI output so it is a manufacturer
 

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.390
and HDMI output so it is a manufacturer
specific setting so not all Android

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:58.400
specific setting so not all Android
 

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.130

devices are guaranteed to do this even
 

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:00.970
devices are guaranteed to do this even
if they're running the latest version

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:00.980
if they're running the latest version
 

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.160
if they're running the latest version
but at least on the versions that

of that video service will be used as
 

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.140
of that video service will be used as
the HDMI output so it's not an API

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.150
the HDMI output so it's not an API
 

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.640
the HDMI output so it's not an API
that's available for developers organs

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:15.650
that's available for developers organs
 

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:18.700
that's available for developers organs
you just use the system media API and if

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:18.710
you just use the system media API and if
 

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.080
you just use the system media API and if
you do that whenever you have video

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.090
you do that whenever you have video
 

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.670
you do that whenever you have video
on-screen it should be mirrored over

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:21.680
on-screen it should be mirrored over
 

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.450
on-screen it should be mirrored over
HDMI all right so it's specifically

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:25.460
HDMI all right so it's specifically
 

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.220
HDMI all right so it's specifically
keyed to the video service that's

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.230
keyed to the video service that's
 

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.670
keyed to the video service that's
correct

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:27.680
correct
 

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.520
correct
got it but only on certain devices only

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.530
got it but only on certain devices only
 

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.230
got it but only on certain devices only
on certain devices other devices can

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240
on certain devices other devices can
 

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.640
on certain devices other devices can
handle it differently they might choose

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:33.650
handle it differently they might choose
 

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.100
handle it differently they might choose
to you know provide their own private

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:36.110
to you know provide their own private
 

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.320
to you know provide their own private
API is they could go and just use

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.330
API is they could go and just use
 

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.530
API is they could go and just use
mirroring all the time yeah it really

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:41.540
mirroring all the time yeah it really
 

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.820
mirroring all the time yeah it really
does depend on what the manufacturer

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:42.830
does depend on what the manufacturer
 

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.110
does depend on what the manufacturer
wants further or HDMI output

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120
wants further or HDMI output
 

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.750
wants further or HDMI output
all right great good question Thank You

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760
all right great good question Thank You
 

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.830

his questions
when will the camera service ever auto

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:58.630
when will the camera service ever auto
 

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.620
when will the camera service ever auto
unlock or how will unlock when it can't

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:01.630
unlock or how will unlock when it can't
 

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.930
unlock or how will unlock when it can't
I will unlock it when it crash it

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:03.940
I will unlock it when it crash it
 

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.980
I will unlock it when it crash it
crashes the app crash still holds the

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:07.990
crashes the app crash still holds the
 

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.510
crashes the app crash still holds the
lock and blocks all other apps from

using the camera until the phone reboots
 

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.490
using the camera until the phone reboots
yes this is a problem so for those of

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:14.500
yes this is a problem so for those of
 

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.990
yes this is a problem so for those of
you who have done some development and

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000
you who have done some development and
 

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.750
you who have done some development and

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760
camera with the with the camera as I
 

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.400

have if you write bad code and you have

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:23.410
have if you write bad code and you have
 

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.410
have if you write bad code and you have
errors in your code and your camera

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:25.420
errors in your code and your camera
 

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.930
errors in your code and your camera
crashes without you actually unlocking

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:27.940
crashes without you actually unlocking
 

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.680
crashes without you actually unlocking
the camera app our access to the camera

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:31.690
the camera app our access to the camera
 

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.570
the camera app our access to the camera
yes you will walk out not only yourself

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:33.580
yes you will walk out not only yourself
 

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.520
yes you will walk out not only yourself
but anybody else and any other apps that

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:35.530
but anybody else and any other apps that
 

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.950
but anybody else and any other apps that
actually try to use the camera because

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960
actually try to use the camera because
 

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.220
actually try to use the camera because
that lock has not been undone barely

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.230
that lock has not been undone barely
 

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:46.070
that lock has not been undone barely
released probably the first answer is

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080
released probably the first answer is
 

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.450
released probably the first answer is
make sure your app doesn't crash in the

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:48.460
make sure your app doesn't crash in the
 

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.260
make sure your app doesn't crash in the
middle of using the camera you know test

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:52.270
middle of using the camera you know test
 

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.730
middle of using the camera you know test
your code thoroughly to make sure that

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:53.740
your code thoroughly to make sure that
 

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.560
your code thoroughly to make sure that
this doesn't happen because that is in

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:55.570
this doesn't happen because that is in
 

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.060
this doesn't happen because that is in
fact I think the only way you can really

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:57.070
fact I think the only way you can really
 

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.700
fact I think the only way you can really
unlock it if that kind of inherit occurs

00:33:59.700 --> 00:33:59.710
unlock it if that kind of inherit occurs
 

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:05.640
unlock it if that kind of inherit occurs
I think even if you put in it's probably

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:05.650
I think even if you put in it's probably
 

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.560
I think even if you put in it's probably
a good idea to have in your code and one

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:07.570
a good idea to have in your code and one
 

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:12.690
a good idea to have in your code and one
of your your on pause or what's the

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:12.700
of your your on pause or what's the
 

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.750
of your your on pause or what's the
other the final run destroying to make

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760
other the final run destroying to make
 

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.350
other the final run destroying to make
sure that to check that you've done a

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:18.360
sure that to check that you've done a
 

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.050
sure that to check that you've done a
release of the camera object before your

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.060
release of the camera object before your
 

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.840
release of the camera object before your
app actually exits so make sure that

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:24.850
app actually exits so make sure that
 

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.820
app actually exits so make sure that
that codes in there in fact you can see

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:26.830
that codes in there in fact you can see
 

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.470
that codes in there in fact you can see
an example of that code when you look at

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480
an example of that code when you look at
 

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.490
an example of that code when you look at
the developer guide for a camera so make

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:32.500
the developer guide for a camera so make
 

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.190
the developer guide for a camera so make
sure you put that into your code but the

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200
sure you put that into your code but the
 

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.869
sure you put that into your code but the
really the only other answer is if your

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879
really the only other answer is if your
 

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:38.610
really the only other answer is if your
app is crashing and misbehaving then

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:38.620
app is crashing and misbehaving then
 

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.840
app is crashing and misbehaving then
yeah you're gonna cause that kind of a

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:39.850
yeah you're gonna cause that kind of a
 

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.490
yeah you're gonna cause that kind of a
problem and you're gonna upset your

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:41.500
problem and you're gonna upset your
 

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.860
problem and you're gonna upset your
users so make sure you test it's that

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:43.870
users so make sure you test it's that
 

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.210
users so make sure you test it's that
kind of an app thoroughly and make sure

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:45.220
kind of an app thoroughly and make sure
 

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.450
kind of an app thoroughly and make sure
that that doesn't happen

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:46.460
that that doesn't happen
 

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.610
that that doesn't happen
any other thoughts I think that

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:49.620
any other thoughts I think that
 

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.230
any other thoughts I think that
explained it pretty thoroughly I don't

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240
explained it pretty thoroughly I don't
 

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.420
explained it pretty thoroughly I don't
have anything else to add to that okay

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:52.430
have anything else to add to that okay
 

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.030
have anything else to add to that okay
all right good question thank you sir

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040
all right good question thank you sir

know if we want to process the video as
a picture from the camera in leaf we

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:37.860
a picture from the camera in leaf we
 

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.620
a picture from the camera in leaf we
have a really small

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:39.630
have a really small
 

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:44.210
have a really small
FPS coming back from camera and this is

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220
FPS coming back from camera and this is
 

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.440
FPS coming back from camera and this is
really frustrating because if we want to

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:47.450
really frustrating because if we want to
 

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.660
really frustrating because if we want to
make some possession some filters etc

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:50.670
make some possession some filters etc
 

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.930
make some possession some filters etc
etc who would really like to have a kind

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940
etc who would really like to have a kind
 

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.120
etc who would really like to have a kind
of real-time stream and do you guys plan

00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.130
of real-time stream and do you guys plan
 

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.180
of real-time stream and do you guys plan
to provide us with such I don't know a

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:02.190
to provide us with such I don't know a
 

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.280
to provide us with such I don't know a
civilities SDK too but says the stuff in

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.290
civilities SDK too but says the stuff in
 

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.280
civilities SDK too but says the stuff in
native code just to gain more affairs

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:10.290
native code just to gain more affairs
 

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.690
native code just to gain more affairs
and Tetra etcetera so yeah so that's

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700
and Tetra etcetera so yeah so that's
 

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.820
and Tetra etcetera so yeah so that's
that's a good question there's actually

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:16.830
that's a good question there's actually
 

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.950
that's a good question there's actually
three different ways that I know of that

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960
three different ways that I know of that
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.770
three different ways that I know of that
you can get the different images coming

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780
you can get the different images coming
 

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.410
you can get the different images coming
through the camera device whatever that

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420
through the camera device whatever that
 

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:30.020
through the camera device whatever that
camera hardware is we only and the first

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:30.030
camera hardware is we only and the first
 

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.610
camera hardware is we only and the first
one is free is pretty obvious but

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:31.620
one is free is pretty obvious but
 

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.010
one is free is pretty obvious but
there's a two additional ones that I at

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020
there's a two additional ones that I at
 

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.980
there's a two additional ones that I at
least I know of that you can use to to

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:36.990
least I know of that you can use to to
 

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.470
least I know of that you can use to to
get the frame the different frames from

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480
get the frame the different frames from
 

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.890
get the frame the different frames from
the camera at an escalating levels of

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900
the camera at an escalating levels of
 

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.770
the camera at an escalating levels of
the complexity actually if you would

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780
the complexity actually if you would
 

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.680
the complexity actually if you would
actually and actually I'd have to go

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:48.690
actually and actually I'd have to go
 

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.940
actually and actually I'd have to go
back and look at my nose to kind of

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:49.950
back and look at my nose to kind of
 

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.190
back and look at my nose to kind of
explain some of this unless James who's

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200
explain some of this unless James who's
 

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.770
explain some of this unless James who's
come and joined us recently can to talk

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780
come and joined us recently can to talk
 

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.310
come and joined us recently can to talk
about this stuff

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320
about this stuff
 

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.390
about this stuff
James we wanted to talk about the

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400
James we wanted to talk about the
 

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.150
James we wanted to talk about the
different ways that you could get the

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160
different ways that you could get the
 

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.310
different ways that you could get the
different frames from the camera I know

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:03.320
different frames from the camera I know
 

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.750
different frames from the camera I know
there's a couple of different approaches

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760
there's a couple of different approaches
 

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.930
there's a couple of different approaches
that you can take well this is James I

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:09.940
that you can take well this is James I
 

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.240
that you can take well this is James I
think that in order to get the frames

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.250
think that in order to get the frames
 

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.920
think that in order to get the frames
are from camera there are a couple of

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:14.930
are from camera there are a couple of
 

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.430
are from camera there are a couple of
ways one is you can use the preview

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440
ways one is you can use the preview
 

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.180
ways one is you can use the preview
callback

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:19.190
callback
 

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.580
callback
basically the Java API we published

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:23.590
basically the Java API we published
 

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.890
basically the Java API we published
mandate the two colors format must be

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:26.900
mandate the two colors format must be
 

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.930
mandate the two colors format must be
supported one is why we 12

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:28.940
supported one is why we 12
 

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.380
supported one is why we 12
the other one is MB 21 so if you use a

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:32.390
the other one is MB 21 so if you use a
 

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.950
the other one is MB 21 so if you use a
preview frame callback you can you know

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960
preview frame callback you can you know
 

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.410
preview frame callback you can you know
have access to the frame data that way I

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:40.420
have access to the frame data that way I
 

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.620
have access to the frame data that way I
think

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:41.630
think
 

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:46.420
think
that's currently if you use a Java API

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:46.430
that's currently if you use a Java API
 

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:49.300
that's currently if you use a Java API
that's probably the only way and native

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:49.310
that's probably the only way and native
 

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:55.480
that's probably the only way and native
layer basically we have the recording

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:55.490
layer basically we have the recording
 

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.940
layer basically we have the recording
for him callback also you can you can

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:57.950
for him callback also you can you can
 

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:02.500
for him callback also you can you can
gain access to the camera how recording

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:02.510
gain access to the camera how recording
 

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:07.090
gain access to the camera how recording
frames also does this answer your

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.100
frames also does this answer your
 

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.280
frames also does this answer your
question can I get to this callback so

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:12.290
question can I get to this callback so
 

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.070
question can I get to this callback so
I'm not sure that it's documented so I

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.080
I'm not sure that it's documented so I
 

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.510
I'm not sure that it's documented so I
use their way I can find it and put the

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520
use their way I can find it and put the
 

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.670
use their way I can find it and put the
listener on it yeah there's no steps

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680
listener on it yeah there's no steps
 

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.670
listener on it yeah there's no steps
involved basically you just need to a

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680
involved basically you just need to a
 

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.270
involved basically you just need to a
set a register a callback the callback

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280
set a register a callback the callback
 

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.270
set a register a callback the callback
is a preview frame callback on the

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280
is a preview frame callback on the
 

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.370
is a preview frame callback on the
camera java class and then the

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:39.380
camera java class and then the
 

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.050
camera java class and then the
application shooter receive callbacks

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.060
application shooter receive callbacks
 

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:47.230
application shooter receive callbacks
from the camera but it's the if s is

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240
from the camera but it's the if s is
 

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.650
from the camera but it's the if s is
really low there so it's maximum 10 15

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:53.660
really low there so it's maximum 10 15
 

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.500
really low there so it's maximum 10 15
FPS frames per seconds I can get from

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:56.510
FPS frames per seconds I can get from
 

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.370
FPS frames per seconds I can get from
there and if I need to amend the data

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:00.380
there and if I need to amend the data
 

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.880
there and if I need to amend the data
from it it becomes even slower so I'm

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:05.890
from it it becomes even slower so I'm
 

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.860
from it it becomes even slower so I'm
really eager to find the way to make it

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:08.870
really eager to find the way to make it
 

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:09.560
really eager to find the way to make it
fast

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:09.570
fast
 

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.240
fast
so I understand that we can use native

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.250
so I understand that we can use native
 

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:17.060
so I understand that we can use native
stuff and for example if we look to the

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:17.070
stuff and for example if we look to the
 

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.460
stuff and for example if we look to the
OpenCV project as a work with camera and

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.470
OpenCV project as a work with camera and
 

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:26.000
OpenCV project as a work with camera and
it's written purely and see as I

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.010
it's written purely and see as I
 

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:30.100
it's written purely and see as I
understand so I really hope you guys

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.110
understand so I really hope you guys
 

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.370
understand so I really hope you guys
someday decide to open such capabilities

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380
someday decide to open such capabilities
 

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.570
someday decide to open such capabilities
for us developers so we could use at

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:38.580
for us developers so we could use at
 

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.500
for us developers so we could use at
least certainly fps for the camera yes

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:42.510
least certainly fps for the camera yes
 

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.380
least certainly fps for the camera yes
III think you are right when you use

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:45.390
III think you are right when you use
 

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.320
III think you are right when you use
this preview Copic the frame rate is is

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:48.330
this preview Copic the frame rate is is
 

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.290
this preview Copic the frame rate is is
low the reason like the frame rate is

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300
low the reason like the frame rate is
 

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.680
low the reason like the frame rate is
low is because the the frame data has to

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:54.690
low is because the the frame data has to
 

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:58.490
low is because the the frame data has to
be copied out so there is a mem copy

00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500
be copied out so there is a mem copy
 

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.330
be copied out so there is a mem copy
involved we are working on some like

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:02.340
involved we are working on some like
 

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.970
involved we are working on some like
enhancement to the whole camera

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980
enhancement to the whole camera
 

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.380
enhancement to the whole camera
framework I cannot say for sure like

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:09.390
framework I cannot say for sure like
 

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.680
framework I cannot say for sure like
when new API will be available but

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:12.690
when new API will be available but
 

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.780
when new API will be available but
definitely we are working on something

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:14.790
definitely we are working on something
 

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.070
definitely we are working on something
to improve in this regard for future API

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:19.080
to improve in this regard for future API
 

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:26.960
to improve in this regard for future API
release but not anytime soon okay thank

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:26.970
release but not anytime soon okay thank
 

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:30.230
release but not anytime soon okay thank
you sure great and if you could post a

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240
you sure great and if you could post a
 

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.630
you sure great and if you could post a
question on this for on Stack Overflow

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640
question on this for on Stack Overflow
 

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.700
question on this for on Stack Overflow
and I'll see if I can get you a little

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:34.710
and I'll see if I can get you a little
 

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.620
and I'll see if I can get you a little
bit more information I believe there's

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:36.630
bit more information I believe there's
 

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.630
bit more information I believe there's
some other way other approaches that you

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640
some other way other approaches that you
 

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.410
some other way other approaches that you
can take with this but I can't talk

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420
can take with this but I can't talk
 

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.850
can take with this but I can't talk

so while you guys look those up I've got

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.210
so while you guys look those up I've got
 

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.800
so while you guys look those up I've got
one from Tom on the live stream he'd

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:40.810
one from Tom on the live stream he'd
 

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.930
one from Tom on the live stream he'd
like to apply arbitrary effects to the

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:42.940
like to apply arbitrary effects to the
 

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.760
like to apply arbitrary effects to the
system media stream so things like

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:44.770
system media stream so things like
 

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.430
system media stream so things like
creating the equalizer etc he can do

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440
creating the equalizer etc he can do
 

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.900
creating the equalizer etc he can do
this too he writes his own media player

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:48.910
this too he writes his own media player
 

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.730
this too he writes his own media player
but he'd really like to be able to just

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:50.740
but he'd really like to be able to just
 

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.590
but he'd really like to be able to just
create the effects and let users use

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:52.600
create the effects and let users use
 

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.870
create the effects and let users use
whatever media player they would usually

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880
whatever media player they would usually
 

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.640
whatever media player they would usually
use to apply this effect is that

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:56.650
use to apply this effect is that
 

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:02.730
use to apply this effect is that
possible the effect you want to apply it

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:02.740
possible the effect you want to apply it
 

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:07.500
possible the effect you want to apply it
depends on how you get the frame in the

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:07.510
depends on how you get the frame in the
 

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:12.390
depends on how you get the frame in the
first place I if you want to apply

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400
first place I if you want to apply
 

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.990
first place I if you want to apply
effects to the decoder output that's

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000
effects to the decoder output that's
 

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.040
effects to the decoder output that's
possible we just published a new media

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.050
possible we just published a new media
 

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.890
possible we just published a new media
API called the media codec dot Java cast

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:22.900
API called the media codec dot Java cast
 

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.580
API called the media codec dot Java cast
which allows you to gain access to the

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:26.590
which allows you to gain access to the
 

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.820
which allows you to gain access to the
decoder output directly and then you can

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:29.830
decoder output directly and then you can
 

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.710
decoder output directly and then you can
do image processing on the decoder

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720
do image processing on the decoder
 

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.510
do image processing on the decoder
output I think that what this really

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520
output I think that what this really
 

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.610
output I think that what this really
depends on the context like how you want

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:38.620
depends on the context like how you want
 

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:43.430
depends on the context like how you want
to apply the effects so that's one way

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440
to apply the effects so that's one way
 

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.509
to apply the effects so that's one way
thank you

00:42:45.509 --> 00:42:45.519
thank you

how to detect if those formats are
 

00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:31.279
how to detect if those formats are
supported that's a great question

00:43:31.279 --> 00:43:31.289

on a specific device Android device the
 

00:43:51.219 --> 00:43:55.079
on a specific device Android device the
class name is a code media codec list

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:55.089
class name is a code media codec list
 

00:43:55.089 --> 00:43:59.909
class name is a code media codec list
and media codec lists the info so using

00:43:59.909 --> 00:43:59.919
and media codec lists the info so using
 

00:43:59.919 --> 00:44:02.609
and media codec lists the info so using
these two classes you can basically walk

00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:02.619
these two classes you can basically walk
 

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:05.399
these two classes you can basically walk
through all the media codecs available

set of an API we just published and it
 

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.170
set of an API we just published and it
is very useful I think to you guys

great thanks for that
let's see scrolling back to our some

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520
let's see scrolling back to our some
 

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.390
let's see scrolling back to our some
previous questions we had is it possible

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400
previous questions we had is it possible
 

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.040
previous questions we had is it possible
to use the mediacodec classic in

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:53.050
to use the mediacodec classic in
 

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:55.290
to use the mediacodec classic in
conjunction with audio record right no

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:55.300
conjunction with audio record right no
 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.420
conjunction with audio record right no
we had a a second question which is very

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:57.430
we had a a second question which is very
 

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.180
we had a a second question which is very
similar is it is it possible to do

00:44:59.180 --> 00:44:59.190
similar is it is it possible to do
 

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.140
similar is it is it possible to do
compression when you're using media

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:01.150
compression when you're using media
 

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:06.750
compression when you're using media
record I think media product is designed

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760
record I think media product is designed
 

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.060
record I think media product is designed
in a way that is generic so it's

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.070
in a way that is generic so it's
 

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:11.910
in a way that is generic so it's
basically the same set of API message

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920
basically the same set of API message
 

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.390
basically the same set of API message
can be up applicable to both encoder and

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400
can be up applicable to both encoder and
 

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.220
can be up applicable to both encoder and
decoder so you should be able to use for

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:19.230
decoder so you should be able to use for
 

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:25.589
decoder so you should be able to use for
encoding purpose also okay great let's

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.549
yeah just to check did you try
refreshing this DK manager because I

00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559
refreshing this DK manager because I
 

00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:44.039
refreshing this DK manager because I
know it does do some caching I did I

00:47:44.039 --> 00:47:44.049
know it does do some caching I did I
 

00:47:44.049 --> 00:47:45.839
know it does do some caching I did I
turned off cache a while ago because it

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:45.849
turned off cache a while ago because it
 

00:47:45.849 --> 00:47:47.880
turned off cache a while ago because it
I had problems the caching and I think

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:47.890
I had problems the caching and I think
 

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.710
I had problems the caching and I think
the newest update the 24 points were you

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720
the newest update the 24 points were you
 

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.690
the newest update the 24 points were you
supposed to fix a caching problem I did

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:54.700
supposed to fix a caching problem I did
 

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.519
supposed to fix a caching problem I did
I did a clear clear download cache and

00:47:56.519 --> 00:47:56.529
I did a clear clear download cache and
 

00:47:56.529 --> 00:48:01.230
I did a clear clear download cache and
every turned it off off and on and right

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240
every turned it off off and on and right
 

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.210
every turned it off off and on and right
so what a clue take me I'd have to check

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:03.220
so what a clue take me I'd have to check
 

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.710
so what a clue take me I'd have to check
the version numbers but is it possible

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720
the version numbers but is it possible
 

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.880
the version numbers but is it possible
that the reason you can't see the

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:05.890
that the reason you can't see the
 

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.620
that the reason you can't see the
preview is because the final version got

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:07.630

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.690

trying to do too many things at once
 

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.239
trying to do too many things at once
they're probably ok thanks sure thanks

00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:28.249
they're probably ok thanks sure thanks
 

00:49:28.249 --> 00:49:33.339
they're probably ok thanks sure thanks
for the question all right let's see

00:49:33.339 --> 00:49:33.349
for the question all right let's see
 

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:37.029
for the question all right let's see
we've got a few more minutes to do

00:49:37.029 --> 00:49:37.039
we've got a few more minutes to do

questions and Nick from Chicago asks is

00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:40.279
questions and Nick from Chicago asks is
 

00:49:40.279 --> 00:49:44.140
questions and Nick from Chicago asks is
it possible to play audio backward wow

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:44.150
it possible to play audio backward wow
 

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:52.450
it possible to play audio backward wow
it's very tempting question oh geez you

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:52.460
it's very tempting question oh geez you
 

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.799
it's very tempting question oh geez you
want to tackle that one do we have an

00:49:53.799 --> 00:49:53.809
want to tackle that one do we have an
 

00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:57.099
want to tackle that one do we have an
idea of that one or we're gonna have to

00:49:57.099 --> 00:49:57.109
idea of that one or we're gonna have to
 

00:49:57.109 --> 00:50:02.979
idea of that one or we're gonna have to
punt on this partially so you can play

00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:02.989
punt on this partially so you can play
 

00:50:02.989 --> 00:50:04.900
punt on this partially so you can play
audio backwards of you using the audio

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:04.910
audio backwards of you using the audio
 

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:07.630
audio backwards of you using the audio
record and audio play mechanisms I don't

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640
record and audio play mechanisms I don't
 

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.769
record and audio play mechanisms I don't
think you can do it using the media

00:50:08.769 --> 00:50:08.779
think you can do it using the media
 

00:50:08.779 --> 00:50:11.589
think you can do it using the media
recorder but if using the raw wav files

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599
recorder but if using the raw wav files
 

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:14.559
recorder but if using the raw wav files
then you can just flip the bits and play

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:14.569
then you can just flip the bits and play
 

00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:15.779
then you can just flip the bits and play
everything in reverse order

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:15.789
everything in reverse order
 

00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:19.210
everything in reverse order
alright Ritter says it is possible so I

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:19.220
alright Ritter says it is possible so I
 

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.150
alright Ritter says it is possible so I
believe him but only with which

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160
believe him but only with which
 

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.039
believe him but only with which
particularly the audio recording audio

00:50:24.039 --> 00:50:24.049
particularly the audio recording audio
 

00:50:24.049 --> 00:50:26.589
particularly the audio recording audio
playback so that's for raw WAV audio

00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599
playback so that's for raw WAV audio
 

00:50:26.599 --> 00:50:28.479
playback so that's for raw WAV audio
effectively so you can't just play an

00:50:28.479 --> 00:50:28.489
effectively so you can't just play an
 

00:50:28.489 --> 00:50:30.400
effectively so you can't just play an
arbitrary song it needs to effectively

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:30.410
arbitrary song it needs to effectively
 

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.920
arbitrary song it needs to effectively
be something you have recorded with no

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:32.930
be something you have recorded with no
 

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.009
be something you have recorded with no
encoding got it was so unencoded audio

00:50:36.009 --> 00:50:36.019
encoding got it was so unencoded audio
 

00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:38.739
encoding got it was so unencoded audio
probably the encoded audio you're gonna

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:38.749
probably the encoded audio you're gonna
 

00:50:38.749 --> 00:50:40.059
probably the encoded audio you're gonna
be out of luck you have to decode it

00:50:40.059 --> 00:50:40.069
be out of luck you have to decode it
 

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:43.210
be out of luck you have to decode it
first probably alright great nice

definitely you can leverage the GPU to

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:51.849
definitely you can leverage the GPU to
 

00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:54.720
definitely you can leverage the GPU to
do some image processing so that you can

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:54.730
do some image processing so that you can
 

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.770

things like - better buffering in terms

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:10.690
things like - better buffering in terms
 

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.950
things like - better buffering in terms
of using the default buffering mechanism

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960
of using the default buffering mechanism
 

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.140
of using the default buffering mechanism
from the media framework so that you can

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:18.150
from the media framework so that you can
 

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:23.359
from the media framework so that you can
for example turn off the radio for

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:23.369
for example turn off the radio for
 

00:52:23.369 --> 00:52:26.940
for example turn off the radio for
better radio usage and so that you can

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:26.950
better radio usage and so that you can
 

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.579
better radio usage and so that you can
save some time because for streaming

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:29.589
save some time because for streaming
 

00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:32.970
save some time because for streaming
application see if you try to get as

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:32.980
application see if you try to get as
 

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.020
application see if you try to get as
much as theta as much as possible at

once and then shut down the radio and

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:39.490
once and then shut down the radio and
 

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.180
once and then shut down the radio and
then after

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:42.190
then after
 

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.640
then after
sometimes your turn on radio and then do

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:44.650
sometimes your turn on radio and then do
 

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:45.210
sometimes your turn on radio and then do
it again

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:45.220
it again
 

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.870
it again
this can save power so this is like

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880
this can save power so this is like
 

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.079
this can save power so this is like
advantage using a low level media ap is

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:52.089
advantage using a low level media ap is
 

00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:56.039
advantage using a low level media ap is
on the other hand this low level media

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:56.049
on the other hand this low level media
 

00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:58.079
on the other hand this low level media
API because it introduced some like

00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:58.089
API because it introduced some like
 

00:52:58.089 --> 00:53:01.799
API because it introduced some like
traffic between the j'ni layer and the

00:53:01.799 --> 00:53:01.809
traffic between the j'ni layer and the
 

00:53:01.809 --> 00:53:04.579
traffic between the j'ni layer and the
Java layer so you have some additional

00:53:04.579 --> 00:53:04.589
Java layer so you have some additional
 

00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:08.910
Java layer so you have some additional
overhead compared to the previous high

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920
overhead compared to the previous high
 

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.210
overhead compared to the previous high
level API so it's it's kind of trade-off

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:12.220
level API so it's it's kind of trade-off
 

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:22.319
level API so it's it's kind of trade-off
if you write a application like you know

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:22.329
if you write a application like you know
 

00:53:22.329 --> 00:53:25.200
if you write a application like you know
a better or smarter way then probably

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.210
a better or smarter way then probably
 

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:29.180
a better or smarter way then probably
you can gain in terms of battery

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:29.190
you can gain in terms of battery
 

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:36.359
you can gain in terms of battery
consumption okay great thanks any more

00:55:10.029 --> 00:55:10.039
pretty wide support if amber correctly
 

00:55:10.039 --> 00:55:13.630
pretty wide support if amber correctly
so both of those are a safe bet and then
