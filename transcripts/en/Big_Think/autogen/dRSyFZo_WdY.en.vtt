so it's basically a method by which you

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
so it's basically a method by which you
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.710
so it's basically a method by which you
can look in the human genome and let it

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
can look in the human genome and let it
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990
can look in the human genome and let it
it's a discovery tool right you look in

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
it's a discovery tool right you look in
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.379
it's a discovery tool right you look in
the human genome and you see what what

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
the human genome and you see what what
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.850
the human genome and you see what what
is emerge what's been become really

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
is emerge what's been become really
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.220
is emerge what's been become really
common and prevalent and therefore must

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
common and prevalent and therefore must
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.960
common and prevalent and therefore must
be important for our survival and the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
be important for our survival and the
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.060
be important for our survival and the
things that you find our interesting

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
things that you find our interesting
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.410
things that you find our interesting
emil a lot of them we like to say are

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
emil a lot of them we like to say are
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750
emil a lot of them we like to say are
very its skin deep so a lot of them is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
very its skin deep so a lot of them is
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.040
very its skin deep so a lot of them is
to do with pigment when you look in

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
to do with pigment when you look in
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109
to do with pigment when you look in
Europe and Asia is the lighter skin

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
Europe and Asia is the lighter skin
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.099
Europe and Asia is the lighter skin
those are things that have become very

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
those are things that have become very
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.669
those are things that have become very
common it looks like hair in Asia so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
common it looks like hair in Asia so
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.220
common it looks like hair in Asia so
like hair and sweat glands in the Asian

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
like hair and sweat glands in the Asian
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600
like hair and sweat glands in the Asian
population have been under evolutionary

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
population have been under evolutionary
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.100
population have been under evolutionary
pressure so a lot of things that just

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
pressure so a lot of things that just
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.430
pressure so a lot of things that just
allow you to interact with the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
allow you to interact with the
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.720
allow you to interact with the
environment this seemed to be under

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
environment this seemed to be under
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540
environment this seemed to be under
potential pressure and then lactose

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
potential pressure and then lactose
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190
potential pressure and then lactose
tolerance is another big one so the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
tolerance is another big one so the
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380
tolerance is another big one so the
ability to drink milk again it's an

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
ability to drink milk again it's an
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410
ability to drink milk again it's an
effect as our nutrition as our sources

how we how we use those resources so
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.849
how we how we use those resources so
those are the kinds of things that we

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
those are the kinds of things that we
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189
those are the kinds of things that we
find but the one of them to me the most

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
find but the one of them to me the most
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349
find but the one of them to me the most
interesting with my background in my

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
interesting with my background in my
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.899
interesting with my background in my
sort of clinical background and MD is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
sort of clinical background and MD is
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219

that the other thing that's very

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
that the other thing that's very
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350
that the other thing that's very
strongly under selection is things that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
strongly under selection is things that
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840
strongly under selection is things that
are known to protect from malaria and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
are known to protect from malaria and
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149
are known to protect from malaria and
things that seem to be involved with

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
things that seem to be involved with
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830
things that seem to be involved with
infectious disease so it makes sense

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
infectious disease so it makes sense
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539
infectious disease so it makes sense
that you know as we're moving to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
that you know as we're moving to
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.890
that you know as we're moving to
different environments and climates

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
different environments and climates
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050
different environments and climates
we're changing our sort of skin and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
we're changing our sort of skin and
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.580
we're changing our sort of skin and
they're sweating patterns to deal with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
they're sweating patterns to deal with
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.920
they're sweating patterns to deal with
to thermoregulate and deal with the sort

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
to thermoregulate and deal with the sort
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649
to thermoregulate and deal with the sort
of sunlight pressure as we change our

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
of sunlight pressure as we change our
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600
of sunlight pressure as we change our
you know domesticate plants and animals

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
you know domesticate plants and animals
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550
you know domesticate plants and animals
we're changing our metabolism and what

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
we're changing our metabolism and what
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440
we're changing our metabolism and what
we're using as nutrient resources and as

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
we're using as nutrient resources and as
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690
we're using as nutrient resources and as
we deal with lots of infections so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
we deal with lots of infections so
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760
we deal with lots of infections so
parasites bacteria viruses that are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
parasites bacteria viruses that are
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230
parasites bacteria viruses that are
interacting with us all the time we need

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
interacting with us all the time we need
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660
interacting with us all the time we need
to survive and so when I was looking

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
to survive and so when I was looking
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520
to survive and so when I was looking
through the genome you know I kind of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
through the genome you know I kind of
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039
through the genome you know I kind of
honed in on originally I thought I was

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
honed in on originally I thought I was
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.330
honed in on originally I thought I was
developing the test looking at jeans

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
developing the test looking at jeans
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219
developing the test looking at jeans
that were protected from malaria seeing

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
that were protected from malaria seeing
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870
that were protected from malaria seeing
these kinds of patterns and I need you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
these kinds of patterns and I need you
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609
these kinds of patterns and I need you
look through the whole genome the the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
look through the whole genome the the
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410
look through the whole genome the the
things that protect from malaria seem to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
things that protect from malaria seem to
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.789
things that protect from malaria seem to
be evolving and then more recently this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
be evolving and then more recently this
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679
be evolving and then more recently this
is all very preliminary but it looks

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
is all very preliminary but it looks
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810
is all very preliminary but it looks
like a bunch of genes that are involved

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
like a bunch of genes that are involved
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.630
like a bunch of genes that are involved
with lasa hemorrhagic fever which is a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
with lasa hemorrhagic fever which is a
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760
with lasa hemorrhagic fever which is a
hemorrhaging fever that people get also

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
hemorrhaging fever that people get also
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440
hemorrhaging fever that people get also
seemed to be an evolutionary pressure so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
seemed to be an evolutionary pressure so
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.690
seemed to be an evolutionary pressure so
it's kind of pointing me to pathogens

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
it's kind of pointing me to pathogens
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.980
it's kind of pointing me to pathogens
are very important

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990
are very important
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.750
are very important
evolutionary pressure to humans and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
evolutionary pressure to humans and
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610
evolutionary pressure to humans and
what's very interesting is that what's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
what's very interesting is that what's
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710
what's very interesting is that what's
so interesting about pathogens is you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
so interesting about pathogens is you
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.360
so interesting about pathogens is you
know they're themselves changing so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
know they're themselves changing so
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.430
know they're themselves changing so
rapidly so we see how we evolve and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
rapidly so we see how we evolve and
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.050
rapidly so we see how we evolve and
adapt to them that they're also

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
adapt to them that they're also
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940
adapt to them that they're also
continuing to evolve and adapt to us so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
continuing to evolve and adapt to us so
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.040
continuing to evolve and adapt to us so
it's this moving target and their

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
it's this moving target and their
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510
it's this moving target and their
genomes are much like ours and we can

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520
genomes are much like ours and we can
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.130
genomes are much like ours and we can
study them in the same way and see how

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
study them in the same way and see how
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.000
study them in the same way and see how
they survive as we look in the human

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
they survive as we look in the human
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.470
they survive as we look in the human
genome when we look to see what's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
genome when we look to see what's
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.140
genome when we look to see what's
evolving what's protective from you know

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
evolving what's protective from you know
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.820
evolving what's protective from you know
and and the things so far that we've

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
and and the things so far that we've
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.410
and and the things so far that we've
identified important and infectious

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
identified important and infectious
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.350
identified important and infectious
disease we like malaria's when we

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
disease we like malaria's when we
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940
disease we like malaria's when we
understand a lot so we can see where

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950
understand a lot so we can see where
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920
understand a lot so we can see where
those genes that protect from malaria

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
those genes that protect from malaria
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.510
those genes that protect from malaria
seem to be under strong evolutionary

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
seem to be under strong evolutionary
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520
seem to be under strong evolutionary
pressure and the kinds of things that we

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
pressure and the kinds of things that we
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.950
pressure and the kinds of things that we
see is in the gene hemoglobin the sickle

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960
see is in the gene hemoglobin the sickle
 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.720
see is in the gene hemoglobin the sickle
cell mutation g6pd deficiency you see a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
cell mutation g6pd deficiency you see a
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.830
cell mutation g6pd deficiency you see a
lot of things that are involved in

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
lot of things that are involved in
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.170
lot of things that are involved in
immune response or t-cell response and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
immune response or t-cell response and
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180
immune response or t-cell response and
so you see both red blood cell because

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
so you see both red blood cell because
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.670
so you see both red blood cell because
mullerian invades the red blood cells so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
mullerian invades the red blood cells so
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.530
mullerian invades the red blood cells so
both receptors on the red blood cell and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
both receptors on the red blood cell and
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.960
both receptors on the red blood cell and
things are important in the constitution

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
things are important in the constitution
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.370
things are important in the constitution
of the red blood cell under strong

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
of the red blood cell under strong
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.110
of the red blood cell under strong
evolutionary pressure and also things

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
evolutionary pressure and also things
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.990
evolutionary pressure and also things
important in the immune system so and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
important in the immune system so and
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.330
important in the immune system so and
one of the other genes is cd36 which is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
one of the other genes is cd36 which is
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.760
one of the other genes is cd36 which is
a receptor on endothelial cells so we

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770
a receptor on endothelial cells so we
 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.160
a receptor on endothelial cells so we
see how both the immune system and the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170
see how both the immune system and the
 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780
see how both the immune system and the
red blood cell are very important in

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
red blood cell are very important in
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.600
red blood cell are very important in
malaria pathogenesis and that genes that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610
malaria pathogenesis and that genes that
 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.110
malaria pathogenesis and that genes that
are within those sort of within the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
are within those sort of within the
 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.690
are within those sort of within the
immune system and red blood cells are

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700
immune system and red blood cells are
 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.740
immune system and red blood cells are
often under natural selection for

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750
often under natural selection for
 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.550
often under natural selection for
protection from malaria what's nice is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560
protection from malaria what's nice is
 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.320
protection from malaria what's nice is
that we have a lot of candidates that we

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
that we have a lot of candidates that we
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.930
that we have a lot of candidates that we
already know to be functionally

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
already know to be functionally
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.850
already know to be functionally
important right so we can look around

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860
important right so we can look around
 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.230
important right so we can look around
those and that's originally when I was

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240
those and that's originally when I was
 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.910
those and that's originally when I was
developing the test i was i was looking

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920
developing the test i was i was looking
 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.620
developing the test i was i was looking
around genes had already knew that were

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630
around genes had already knew that were
 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.480
around genes had already knew that were
protected from malaria that we'd have an

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490
protected from malaria that we'd have an
 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.950
protected from malaria that we'd have an
expectation that they would be under

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960
expectation that they would be under
 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.020
expectation that they would be under
natural selection right so they cause

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030
natural selection right so they cause
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.520
natural selection right so they cause
resistance to malaria malaria been

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
resistance to malaria malaria been
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.140
resistance to malaria malaria been
around for a long time and that you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
around for a long time and that you
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.910
around for a long time and that you
might expect to see them rise to the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920
might expect to see them rise to the
 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640
might expect to see them rise to the
population so that's basically the test

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
population so that's basically the test
 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.610
population so that's basically the test
that I was working on is about that it's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620
that I was working on is about that it's
 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.890
that I was working on is about that it's
about distinguishing just a random event

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900
about distinguishing just a random event
 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.020
about distinguishing just a random event
and a random mutation that's common in

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030
and a random mutation that's common in
 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.000
and a random mutation that's common in
the population versus something that was

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010
the population versus something that was
 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.460
the population versus something that was
sort of become became prevalent to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470
sort of become became prevalent to
 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.460
sort of become became prevalent to
rapidly to happen by chance alone so you

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470
rapidly to happen by chance alone so you
 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.870
rapidly to happen by chance alone so you
know what we do is you go through

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880
know what we do is you go through
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.250
know what we do is you go through
and we look across the genome when we

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260
and we look across the genome when we
 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.390
and we look across the genome when we
look for things that are very prevalent

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400
look for things that are very prevalent
 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.450
look for things that are very prevalent
and things that are very young and we we

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
and things that are very young and we we
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.630
and things that are very young and we we
have a way a threshold of saying this is

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640
have a way a threshold of saying this is
 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.970
have a way a threshold of saying this is
too young to become this prevalent by

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980
too young to become this prevalent by
 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.130
too young to become this prevalent by
chance and so it hasn't been around long

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140
chance and so it hasn't been around long
 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.260
chance and so it hasn't been around long
enough that it just sort of randomly got

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
enough that it just sort of randomly got
 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.040
enough that it just sort of randomly got
to this prevalence well we do this part

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050
to this prevalence well we do this part
 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.110
to this prevalence well we do this part
of we do we know part of the story as to

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120
of we do we know part of the story as to
 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.520
of we do we know part of the story as to
why some people get malaria in living

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
why some people get malaria in living
 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.800
why some people get malaria in living
some people get malaria and die so there

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
some people get malaria and die so there
 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.990
some people get malaria and die so there
are like said malaria's very complex

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000
are like said malaria's very complex
 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.870
are like said malaria's very complex
organism and the way that it invades and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880
organism and the way that it invades and
 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.520
organism and the way that it invades and
effects and it causes lots of different

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530
effects and it causes lots of different
 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.920
effects and it causes lots of different
symptom ologies like cerebral malaria

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930
symptom ologies like cerebral malaria
 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.860
symptom ologies like cerebral malaria
severe malaria nemia there's a lot of

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870
severe malaria nemia there's a lot of
 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.000
severe malaria nemia there's a lot of
interactions that are going on with the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010
interactions that are going on with the
 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.920
interactions that are going on with the
host with a human and so we don't

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930
host with a human and so we don't
 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.690
host with a human and so we don't
understand every aspect of the disease

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700
understand every aspect of the disease
 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.220
understand every aspect of the disease
but we do know some of the mutations

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230
but we do know some of the mutations
 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.680
but we do know some of the mutations
that allow people to survive and we

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
that allow people to survive and we
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.510
that allow people to survive and we
understand partly how that works and

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
understand partly how that works and
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730
understand partly how that works and
again those have to do with things that

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740
again those have to do with things that
 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.140
again those have to do with things that
are expressed in red blood cells or

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
are expressed in red blood cells or
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.760
are expressed in red blood cells or
they're important for red blood cells

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770
they're important for red blood cells
 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.680
they're important for red blood cells
and things important in the immune

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690
and things important in the immune
 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.080
and things important in the immune
system

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090
 
 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.150
