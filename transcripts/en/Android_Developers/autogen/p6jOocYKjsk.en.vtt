com / mobile this is basically where the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390
com / mobile this is basically where the
 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.610
com / mobile this is basically where the
Google+ SDK will be found and it's not

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
Google+ SDK will be found and it's not
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.820
Google+ SDK will be found and it's not
out yet we it's coming soon for Android

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830
out yet we it's coming soon for Android
 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.550
out yet we it's coming soon for Android
as was mentioned and as I said we can't

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560
as was mentioned and as I said we can't
 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.199
as was mentioned and as I said we can't
we can't really speak to the dates and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209
we can't really speak to the dates and
 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.750
we can't really speak to the dates and
the honest truth is annular than I don't

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760
the honest truth is annular than I don't
 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.900
the honest truth is annular than I don't
actually know the dates so we would

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910
actually know the dates so we would
 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.060
actually know the dates so we would
probably be lying if we made something

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070
probably be lying if we made something
 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.830
probably be lying if we made something
up and we can get in trouble for that so

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
up and we can get in trouble for that so
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.830
up and we can get in trouble for that so
we'd rather not basically here you'll

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840
we'd rather not basically here you'll
 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.460
we'd rather not basically here you'll
find that that it's this is where you'll

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
find that that it's this is where you'll
 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.140
find that that it's this is where you'll
find the SDK when it's released and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
find the SDK when it's released and
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.750
find the SDK when it's released and
don't you worry we'll be very vocal

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760
don't you worry we'll be very vocal
 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.100
don't you worry we'll be very vocal
about it so you'll know that it's out

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110
about it so you'll know that it's out
 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.170
about it so you'll know that it's out
but whilst it's is still baking you can

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180
but whilst it's is still baking you can
 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.610
but whilst it's is still baking you can
go and have a look at this page and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
go and have a look at this page and
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.890
go and have a look at this page and
you'll see that it actually describes

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
you'll see that it actually describes
 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.199
you'll see that it actually describes
what api's are going to be available at

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209
what api's are going to be available at
 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.820
what api's are going to be available at
the time of release so I guess I'll just

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
the time of release so I guess I'll just
 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.409
the time of release so I guess I'll just
go through them quickly there'll be a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419
go through them quickly there'll be a
 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.240
go through them quickly there'll be a
sign in with Google+

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250
sign in with Google+
 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.430
sign in with Google+

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
so you can use the identity management
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.860
so you can use the identity management
side of things and you'll be able to

type things you know it is it what

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660
type things you know it is it what
 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.360

you're suggesting sounds like a really

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370
you're suggesting sounds like a really
 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.090
you're suggesting sounds like a really
useful idea and so we don't have

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100
useful idea and so we don't have
 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.350
useful idea and so we don't have
anything to share right now about

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
anything to share right now about
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.100
anything to share right now about
whether such an API exists or is coming

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110
whether such an API exists or is coming
 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.330
whether such an API exists or is coming
in the future it's certainly not

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340
in the future it's certainly not
 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.570
in the future it's certainly not
available now but part of it is and that

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580
available now but part of it is and that
 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.800
available now but part of it is and that
part is the saves on a cloud level

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810
part is the saves on a cloud level
 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.740
part is the saves on a cloud level
right now there's probably two ways that

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750
right now there's probably two ways that
 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.110
right now there's probably two ways that
you could tackle this one is using the

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
you could tackle this one is using the
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.110
you could tackle this one is using the
backup service on Android so basically

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120
backup service on Android so basically
 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.080
backup service on Android so basically
you can your app can back up some

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090
you can your app can back up some
 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.990
you can your app can back up some
information to the cloud and then you

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000
information to the cloud and then you
 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.700
information to the cloud and then you
know when you fire up the app on on

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710
know when you fire up the app on on
 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.700
know when you fire up the app on on
other devices you can restore that data

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710
other devices you can restore that data
 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.990
other devices you can restore that data
keep in mind it's not really designed

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000
keep in mind it's not really designed
 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.390
keep in mind it's not really designed
for real-time seeking but you might find

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400
for real-time seeking but you might find
 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.680
for real-time seeking but you might find
that it's sufficient for what you're

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690
that it's sufficient for what you're
 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.110
that it's sufficient for what you're
trying to do and it really depends on

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120
trying to do and it really depends on
 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.629
trying to do and it really depends on
your situation the other way you could

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639
your situation the other way you could
 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.120
your situation the other way you could
do it is is through things like the the

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130
do it is is through things like the the
 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.360
do it is is through things like the the
Google Drive SDK and use the the google

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370
Google Drive SDK and use the the google
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.659
Google Drive SDK and use the the google
drive the users Google Drive as a way of

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669
drive the users Google Drive as a way of
 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.030
drive the users Google Drive as a way of
you know storing your data and then

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040
you know storing your data and then
 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.379
you know storing your data and then
pulling it down and syncing with the

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389
pulling it down and syncing with the
 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.240
pulling it down and syncing with the
cloud there was a really good

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250

right so all your views are the
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.180
right so all your views are the
container would be a layout like a

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.190
container would be a layout like a
 

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.130

say that also a very broad question in

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880
say that also a very broad question in
 

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.059
say that also a very broad question in
that you know there's no one simple

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:40.069
that you know there's no one simple
 

00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:44.170

we have a ton of best practices around
you know developing for Android to make

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:03.649
you know developing for Android to make
 

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:04.720

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:04.730
sure you're familiar with those
 

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.269
sure you're familiar with those
familiarity with eclipse is also useful

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279
familiarity with eclipse is also useful
 

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:09.370
familiarity with eclipse is also useful

well again there's a ton of best

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:24.740
well again there's a ton of best
 

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.439
well again there's a ton of best
practices around there but some of this

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:26.449
practices around there but some of this
 

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:29.350
practices around there but some of this
sort of the basic ones don't do a lot of

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360
sort of the basic ones don't do a lot of
 

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.620
sort of the basic ones don't do a lot of
work in the

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:30.630
work in the
 

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.780
work in the
in thread because that's also the UI

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:32.790
in thread because that's also the UI
 

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.640
in thread because that's also the UI
thread so if you're doing a lot of

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:34.650
thread so if you're doing a lot of
 

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.950
thread so if you're doing a lot of
processing or you're doing anything

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:36.960
processing or you're doing anything
 

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.740
processing or you're doing anything
across the network make sure that you

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:39.750
across the network make sure that you
 

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.470
across the network make sure that you
are doing that in a background like you

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480
are doing that in a background like you
 

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.420
are doing that in a background like you
can use an ASIC task where you can use

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:44.430
can use an ASIC task where you can use
 

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.370
can use an ASIC task where you can use
threads there's a number of options

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380
threads there's a number of options
 

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.380
threads there's a number of options
there so make sure you utilize those

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.390
there so make sure you utilize those
 

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.170
there so make sure you utilize those
don't reinvent the wheel you know if

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180
don't reinvent the wheel you know if
 

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.060
don't reinvent the wheel you know if
there's some good libraries out there

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.070
there's some good libraries out there
 

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.310
there's some good libraries out there
then utilize those they'll often they're

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320
then utilize those they'll often they're
 

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.840
then utilize those they'll often they're
quite heavily optimized as well you know

00:15:59.840 --> 00:15:59.850
quite heavily optimized as well you know
 

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.550
quite heavily optimized as well you know
again this is a very broad question when

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560
again this is a very broad question when
 

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.610
again this is a very broad question when
it comes to layouts in you I we've seen

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620
it comes to layouts in you I we've seen
 

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.140
it comes to layouts in you I we've seen
developed a sort of make the mistake of

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.150
developed a sort of make the mistake of
 

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.680
developed a sort of make the mistake of
nesting tons and tons of layouts so you

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:09.690
nesting tons and tons of layouts so you
 

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.240
nesting tons and tons of layouts so you
know linear layout within linear layout

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.250
know linear layout within linear layout
 

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.060
know linear layout within linear layout
within linear layer um that's just

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.070
within linear layer um that's just
 

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.400
within linear layer um that's just
really inefficient and and it's quite

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.410
really inefficient and and it's quite
 

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.730
really inefficient and and it's quite
expensive too so you know those are the

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740
expensive too so you know those are the
 

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.010
expensive too so you know those are the
things that will tend to slow down your

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:22.020
things that will tend to slow down your
 

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.640
things that will tend to slow down your
your app I need is there anything you

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:25.650
your app I need is there anything you
 

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.920
your app I need is there anything you
want to add to that one yeah just a

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:27.930
want to add to that one yeah just a
 

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.930
want to add to that one yeah just a
quick things so if also you're working

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940
quick things so if also you're working
 

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.180
quick things so if also you're working
with a lot of data and you for example

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:32.190
with a lot of data and you for example
 

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.250
with a lot of data and you for example
if you have a news reader app and you're

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260
if you have a news reader app and you're
 

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.580
if you have a news reader app and you're
fetching articles do do use the sink a

patch if you if you want to it is an
 

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.730
patch if you if you want to it is an
open source project so yeah I would say

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740
open source project so yeah I would say
 

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:31.430
open source project so yeah I would say
engage in an open-source manner okay

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440
engage in an open-source manner okay

next question for a person that has not

00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799
next question for a person that has not
 

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.510
next question for a person that has not
written a single java application is it

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520
written a single java application is it
 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.799
written a single java application is it
beneficial to use the ndk using native

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:42.809
beneficial to use the ndk using native
 

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:46.820
beneficial to use the ndk using native
see as I believe to write an app can it

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:46.830
see as I believe to write an app can it
 

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.960
see as I believe to write an app can it
be effective as one using the SDK and

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:49.970
be effective as one using the SDK and
 

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.230
be effective as one using the SDK and
writing Java code um interesting

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240
writing Java code um interesting
 

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.080
writing Java code um interesting
question so it's you know I guess one it

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.090
question so it's you know I guess one it
 

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:02.480
question so it's you know I guess one it
depends on your skills using the the NDK

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:02.490
depends on your skills using the the NDK
 

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.510
depends on your skills using the the NDK
it requires a bit more set up the

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520
it requires a bit more set up the
 

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.750
it requires a bit more set up the
developer experiences is well the

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760
developer experiences is well the
 

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.669
developer experiences is well the
learning curve for developers is a bit

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679
learning curve for developers is a bit
 

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:12.950
learning curve for developers is a bit
steeper so knowing the language is one

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960
steeper so knowing the language is one
 

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.659
steeper so knowing the language is one
thing that you still need to understand

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:14.669
thing that you still need to understand
 

00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:16.639
thing that you still need to understand
how the tools integrate how you set up

00:19:16.639 --> 00:19:16.649
how the tools integrate how you set up
 

00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:20.710
how the tools integrate how you set up
build system how you debug those apps

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720
build system how you debug those apps
 

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.210
build system how you debug those apps
you know how you interoperate with

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220
you know how you interoperate with
 

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.419
you know how you interoperate with
between the native app and the sort of

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:26.429
between the native app and the sort of
 

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:29.870
between the native app and the sort of
the framework of Android and in general

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880
the framework of Android and in general
 

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.620
the framework of Android and in general
I think it's it's actually harder to

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:33.630
I think it's it's actually harder to
 

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.149
I think it's it's actually harder to
learn all of that rather than sort of

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159
learn all of that rather than sort of
 

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.820
learn all of that rather than sort of
learn Java again I mean that's a

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:40.830
learn Java again I mean that's a
 

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.710
learn Java again I mean that's a
generalization it depends you might be a

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720
generalization it depends you might be a
 

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.930
generalization it depends you might be a
really awesome see coder and you're

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940
really awesome see coder and you're
 

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.310
really awesome see coder and you're
familiar with all of these sorts of

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
familiar with all of these sorts of
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.860
familiar with all of these sorts of
things and so you might find that more

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:48.870
things and so you might find that more
 

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.049
things and so you might find that more
useful probably the answer is give it a

00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059
useful probably the answer is give it a
 

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:56.450
useful probably the answer is give it a
go and see how how it turns out I think

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460
go and see how how it turns out I think
 

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.340
go and see how how it turns out I think
it'll probably be easier though to start

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:58.350
it'll probably be easier though to start
 

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.020
it'll probably be easier though to start
the Java side of things that the tooling

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.030
the Java side of things that the tooling
 

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.409
the Java side of things that the tooling
is a lot better and there's just fewer

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419
is a lot better and there's just fewer
 

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:07.909
is a lot better and there's just fewer
points of failure yeah put it with the

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919
points of failure yeah put it with the
 

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:12.350
points of failure yeah put it with the
NDK stuff yep and is there is it a lower

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360
NDK stuff yep and is there is it a lower
 

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.380
NDK stuff yep and is there is it a lower
level kind of API than the one that's

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.390
level kind of API than the one that's
 

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.180
level kind of API than the one that's
exposed through java I mean or is it

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:17.190
exposed through java I mean or is it
 

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.630
exposed through java I mean or is it
just a see interface to the existing

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640
just a see interface to the existing
 

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.070
just a see interface to the existing
things like location manager and all

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
things like location manager and all
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.240
things like location manager and all
that kind of stuff or is it kind of more

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.250
that kind of stuff or is it kind of more
 

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.690
that kind of stuff or is it kind of more
low-level than that it's it's a bit of

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700
low-level than that it's it's a bit of
 

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.260
low-level than that it's it's a bit of
bit of both actually and so we expose

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.270
bit of both actually and so we expose
 

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.149
bit of both actually and so we expose
some of the capabilities of the

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159
some of the capabilities of the
 

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:35.390
some of the capabilities of the
framework to the to the NDK suru for you

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400
framework to the to the NDK suru for you
 

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.730
framework to the to the NDK suru for you
see in C++ code but not everything is

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740
see in C++ code but not everything is
 

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.039
see in C++ code but not everything is
there so some of it you end up having to

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:40.049
there so some of it you end up having to
 

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:41.990
there so some of it you end up having to
build J&amp;I wrappers and doing you know

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000
build J&amp;I wrappers and doing you know
 

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.380
build J&amp;I wrappers and doing you know
going back and forth yourself and not

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.390
going back and forth yourself and not
 

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.850
going back and forth yourself and not
only is that a little bit more work but

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860
only is that a little bit more work but
 

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.560
only is that a little bit more work but
then you now have to start considering

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:48.570
then you now have to start considering
 

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.919
then you now have to start considering
the performance cost of going No

00:20:50.919 --> 00:20:50.929
the performance cost of going No
 

00:20:50.929 --> 00:20:53.840
the performance cost of going No
marshalling through that through that

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:53.850
marshalling through that through that
 

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.039
marshalling through that through that
space all the time so yeah it's a bit of

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:58.049
space all the time so yeah it's a bit of
 

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:04.010
space all the time so yeah it's a bit of
both okay um next question I see we've

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020
both okay um next question I see we've
 

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.720
both okay um next question I see we've
had a few more people join us so before

in your adapter you have coded to say

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:24.460
in your adapter you have coded to say
 

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.430
in your adapter you have coded to say
the get will be done based on the index

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440
the get will be done based on the index
 

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.409

of the pager will it run a new instance

of the pager will it run a new instance
yes you could possibly manage it is

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:31.690
yes you could possibly manage it is
 

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.960
yes you could possibly manage it is
registry of the instances and return the

registry of the instances and return the
 

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.389
registry of the instances and return the

that's a part of your adapter

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:37.659
that's a part of your adapter
 

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:40.740
that's a part of your adapter
implementation and yeah so instead of

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:40.750
implementation and yeah so instead of
 

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.139
implementation and yeah so instead of
saying case was solution at this part

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:43.149
saying case was solution at this part
 

00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:45.000

time is that I am painting the kind of
 

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.669
time is that I am painting the kind of
array array list which is keeping up the

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679
array array list which is keeping up the
 

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.500
array array list which is keeping up the
track of fragments that were created and

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:49.510
track of fragments that were created and
 

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.259
track of fragments that were created and
then if the fragment is already created

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:52.269
then if the fragment is already created
 

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:54.389
then if the fragment is already created

particular fragment that seems to be a
 

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.730
particular fragment that seems to be a
fair implementation to me I mean are you

00:22:59.730 --> 00:22:59.740
fair implementation to me I mean are you
 

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.560
fair implementation to me I mean are you

if you so what I would actually suggest

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:40.590
if you so what I would actually suggest
 

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.440
if you so what I would actually suggest
is rather than getting it from view

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.450
is rather than getting it from view
 

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.390
is rather than getting it from view
pager I would actually try to get it

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400
pager I would actually try to get it
 

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.770
pager I would actually try to get it
from the fragment manager so when you

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780
from the fragment manager so when you
 

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.070
from the fragment manager so when you
instantiate it you can you can specify a

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080
instantiate it you can you can specify a
 

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.160
instantiate it you can you can specify a
tag and then I would try and do a find

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.170
tag and then I would try and do a find
 

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.740
tag and then I would try and do a find
fret what is the time frame of my tag or

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:54.750
fret what is the time frame of my tag or
 

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.530
fret what is the time frame of my tag or
aspire dad for this because at the time

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:57.540
aspire dad for this because at the time
 

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.010
aspire dad for this because at the time
of instantiation described meant I just

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020
of instantiation described meant I just
 

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.980
of instantiation described meant I just
at the time you say get item adapter

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:03.990
at the time you say get item adapter
 

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.600
at the time you say get item adapter
itself gives a like what id do it I see

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:08.610
itself gives a like what id do it I see
 

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:14.780
itself gives a like what id do it I see
so the main use of is your fragment a UI

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:14.790
so the main use of is your fragment a UI
 

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.549
so the main use of is your fragment a UI
fragment or is it just a class that

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559
fragment or is it just a class that
 

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.820
fragment or is it just a class that
you're sort of using a you ipad so these

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:19.830
you're sort of using a you ipad so these
 

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.650
you're sort of using a you ipad so these
UI fragments are going to get recycled

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:21.660
UI fragments are going to get recycled
 

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:28.610
UI fragments are going to get recycled
so i would suggest sorry yeah so i would

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620
so i would suggest sorry yeah so i would
 

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.169
so i would suggest sorry yeah so i would
actually suggest if you're trying to get

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179
actually suggest if you're trying to get
 

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:32.810
actually suggest if you're trying to get
something very specific then your

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820
something very specific then your
 

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.250
something very specific then your
solution kind of work it seems like not

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260
solution kind of work it seems like not
 

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.500
solution kind of work it seems like not
the right thing to do because the whole

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:39.510
the right thing to do because the whole
 

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.220
the right thing to do because the whole
idea of a view pager is that it will try

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.230
idea of a view pager is that it will try
 

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.950
idea of a view pager is that it will try
and hold onto you know the page the

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960
and hold onto you know the page the
 

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.260
and hold onto you know the page the
content for the pages only while it

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:48.270
content for the pages only while it
 

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.620
content for the pages only while it
needs them so typically what I've

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:51.630
needs them so typically what I've
 

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.020
needs them so typically what I've
noticed is that if your current page and

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.030
noticed is that if your current page and
 

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.390
noticed is that if your current page and
one on either side it sort of T tends to

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400
one on either side it sort of T tends to
 

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.370
one on either side it sort of T tends to
keep so if you've got things that are

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380
keep so if you've got things that are
 

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.990
keep so if you've got things that are
you know more than two off your your

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000
you know more than two off your your
 

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.419
you know more than two off your your
current page it'll actually try to

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:02.429
current page it'll actually try to
 

00:25:02.429 --> 00:25:04.430
current page it'll actually try to
recycle and reuse those fragments and

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440
recycle and reuse those fragments and
 

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.190
recycle and reuse those fragments and
that's probably why you'll get the

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200
that's probably why you'll get the
 

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.150
that's probably why you'll get the
methods are calling I'm sorry returning

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:11.160
methods are calling I'm sorry returning
 

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.190
methods are calling I'm sorry returning
a new fragment because the existing one

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200
a new fragment because the existing one
 

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.260
a new fragment because the existing one
has been recycled but then how can I use

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:18.270
has been recycled but then how can I use
 

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.870
has been recycled but then how can I use
the same instances if I always get a new

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880
the same instances if I always get a new
 

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.790
the same instances if I always get a new
one so if I've got to modify something

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:22.800
one so if I've got to modify something
 

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.590
one so if I've got to modify something
on that particular fragment so this is

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600
on that particular fragment so this is
 

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.720
on that particular fragment so this is
kind of the difference between sort of

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:29.730
kind of the difference between sort of
 

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.000
kind of the difference between sort of
separating out your UI in your data

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.010
separating out your UI in your data
 

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.779
separating out your UI in your data
layer if you're presenting some

00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:33.789
layer if you're presenting some
 

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:36.299
layer if you're presenting some
thing I mean typically what you're doing

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:36.309
thing I mean typically what you're doing
 

00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:37.440
thing I mean typically what you're doing

yeah because what should be happening is

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:42.700
yeah because what should be happening is
 

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.430
yeah because what should be happening is
you call notify data set change it

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440

even that will not have a good item

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:01.389
even that will not have a good item

00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:03.099
called again but even that was not
 

00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:06.409
called again but even that was not
happening so I was like okay for today

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419
happening so I was like okay for today
 

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:11.190
happening so I was like okay for today
yeah it almost seems like the what

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200
yeah it almost seems like the what
 

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.719
yeah it almost seems like the what
you're wanting is a static set of

00:27:12.719 --> 00:27:12.729
you're wanting is a static set of
 

00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:14.460
you're wanting is a static set of
fragments and you're using the viewpager

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:14.470
fragments and you're using the viewpager
 

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.339
fragments and you're using the viewpager
for that the view pages is is something

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:17.349
for that the view pages is is something
 

00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:19.139
for that the view pages is is something
that typically tends to recycle

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:19.149
that typically tends to recycle
 

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:21.180
that typically tends to recycle
fragments and discard them when they're

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.190
fragments and discard them when they're
 

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.219
fragments and discard them when they're
not being used so it's almost like

00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:23.229
not being used so it's almost like
 

00:27:23.229 --> 00:27:25.320
not being used so it's almost like
that's not a good fit and i would i

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.330
that's not a good fit and i would i
 

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.509
that's not a good fit and i would i
would try and have a layer of

abstraction that sort of says hey this
is this is a statically defined

00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279
is this is a statically defined
 

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:35.999
is this is a statically defined
allocated set of fragments and then try

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:36.009

so bad i just hope that the glue between

so bad i just hope that the glue between
 

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:45.149
so bad i just hope that the glue between
the viewpager and that list is is

00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159
the viewpager and that list is is

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.790
foreground on the servers or acquire a
wakelock on the service and you want to

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:38.800
wakelock on the service and you want to
 

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.520
wakelock on the service and you want to
start with this one honestly I don't

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:41.530
start with this one honestly I don't
 

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.320
start with this one honestly I don't
know the answer to this I have that's

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.330
know the answer to this I have that's
 

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.370
know the answer to this I have that's
all right um so I think one let's see

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:47.380
all right um so I think one let's see
 

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.620
all right um so I think one let's see
it'll be interesting to see why it's

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:49.630
it'll be interesting to see why it's
 

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.810
it'll be interesting to see why it's
it's being your services being stopped

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:51.820
it's being your services being stopped
 

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.990
it's being your services being stopped
if you start your service in a certain

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000
if you start your service in a certain
 

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.760
if you start your service in a certain
way you can it kind of says hey it's

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:56.770
way you can it kind of says hey it's
 

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.580
way you can it kind of says hey it's
bound to this activity or bound to this

00:33:59.580 --> 00:33:59.590
bound to this activity or bound to this
 

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.000
bound to this activity or bound to this
to this particular foreground process

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.010
to this particular foreground process
 

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.590
to this particular foreground process
and so when that foreground process goes

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600
and so when that foreground process goes
 

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.810
and so when that foreground process goes
away your service will also stop so it

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:06.820
away your service will also stop so it
 

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.700
away your service will also stop so it
depends how you are you are binding to

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:08.710
depends how you are you are binding to
 

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:12.050
depends how you are you are binding to
the surface and how you're starting it

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060
the surface and how you're starting it
 

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.820
the surface and how you're starting it
acquiring a wakelock on the service all

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:14.830
acquiring a wakelock on the service all
 

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.040
acquiring a wakelock on the service all
that my understanding of that all that

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.050
that my understanding of that all that
 

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.149
that my understanding of that all that
will do is stop the device from going

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159
will do is stop the device from going
 

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.889
will do is stop the device from going
into standby I don't think that there's

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:22.899
into standby I don't think that there's
 

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:24.990
into standby I don't think that there's
a direct correlation between having a

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000
a direct correlation between having a
 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.270
a direct correlation between having a
wakelock

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280
wakelock
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.020
wakelock
having your service stay running unless

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.030
having your service stay running unless
 

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.500
having your service stay running unless
you're acquiring the wake lock in your

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:32.510
you're acquiring the wake lock in your
 

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.480
you're acquiring the wake lock in your
activity in which case is not getting a

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:35.490
activity in which case is not getting a
 

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:39.440
activity in which case is not getting a
chance to background so it really

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:39.450
chance to background so it really
 

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.090
chance to background so it really
depends how your binding to the service

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:41.100
depends how your binding to the service
 

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.090
depends how your binding to the service
and if you are if you're allowing it to

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.100
and if you are if you're allowing it to
 

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.330
and if you are if you're allowing it to
sort of hang around after the fact

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:47.340
sort of hang around after the fact
 

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.159
sort of hang around after the fact
you're your main activities gone away or

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:49.169
you're your main activities gone away or
 

00:34:49.169 --> 00:34:54.320
you're your main activities gone away or
not so I would look into that and one

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.330
not so I would look into that and one
 

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.899
not so I would look into that and one
way to look into this is just by putting

00:34:56.899 --> 00:34:56.909
way to look into this is just by putting
 

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.330
way to look into this is just by putting
in a bunch of logging statements in

00:34:59.330 --> 00:34:59.340
in a bunch of logging statements in
 

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.280
in a bunch of logging statements in
there see if there's a correlation

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.290
there see if there's a correlation
 

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.970
there see if there's a correlation
between when your activities paused or

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980
between when your activities paused or
 

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.040
between when your activities paused or
stopped or destroyed and when the

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.050
stopped or destroyed and when the
 

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:14.180
stopped or destroyed and when the
service is is going away okay final

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:14.190
service is is going away okay final
 

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.600
service is is going away okay final
question I'll just read this one out I

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:17.610
question I'll just read this one out I
 

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.730
question I'll just read this one out I
don't we've already done this one it was

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740
don't we've already done this one it was
 

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.040
don't we've already done this one it was
the one about native development

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.050
the one about native development

questions on there does anyone on the

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960
questions on there does anyone on the
 

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.240

Hangout have any more questions I just

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:32.250
Hangout have any more questions I just
 

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.160
Hangout have any more questions I just
had one that's maybe not related to

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.170
had one that's maybe not related to
 

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.280
had one that's maybe not related to
Android specifically but you mentioned

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:37.290
Android specifically but you mentioned
 

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.240
Android specifically but you mentioned
earlier about the Google+ SDK will be

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:41.250
earlier about the Google+ SDK will be
 

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.410
earlier about the Google+ SDK will be
coming out at some point in the future

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420
coming out at some point in the future
 

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.740
coming out at some point in the future
for Android there's already kind of a

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:45.750
for Android there's already kind of a
 

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.800
for Android there's already kind of a
Google+ API which is hosted on Google

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:48.810
Google+ API which is hosted on Google
 

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.240
Google+ API which is hosted on Google
code I think it is is that just going to

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.250
code I think it is is that just going to
 

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.770
code I think it is is that just going to
be replaced or is that going to be kind

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780
be replaced or is that going to be kind
 

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.360
be replaced or is that going to be kind
of in parallel or will it be some

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:53.370
of in parallel or will it be some
 

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.450
of in parallel or will it be some
crossover or what are you referring to

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460
crossover or what are you referring to
 

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.850
crossover or what are you referring to
the the Web API that's there yeah there

00:35:58.850 --> 00:35:58.860
the the Web API that's there yeah there
 

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.380
the the Web API that's there yeah there
seems to be a lot of rest services that

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:00.390
seems to be a lot of rest services that
 

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.940
seems to be a lot of rest services that
you can call to get things like comments

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:01.950
you can call to get things like comments
 

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.860
you can call to get things like comments
on various posts and stuff is that going

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:03.870
on various posts and stuff is that going
 

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.410
on various posts and stuff is that going
to go away or so that that Web API will

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420
to go away or so that that Web API will
 

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.420
to go away or so that that Web API will
stay because what we're bringing out is

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.430
stay because what we're bringing out is
 

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.520
stay because what we're bringing out is
an Android API right now you can consume

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:10.530
an Android API right now you can consume
 

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.740
an Android API right now you can consume
you can you know basically consume it

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:12.750
you can you know basically consume it
 

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.140
you can you know basically consume it
like it's a rest service yeah but what

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:15.150
like it's a rest service yeah but what
 

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.510
like it's a rest service yeah but what
we're doing is building an Android API

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520
we're doing is building an Android API
 

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.000
we're doing is building an Android API
which will give you all the niceties of

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.010
which will give you all the niceties of
 

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.340
which will give you all the niceties of
you know just having any like a method

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:22.350
you know just having any like a method
 

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.130
you know just having any like a method
call using the identity manager on the

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140
call using the identity manager on the
 

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.740
call using the identity manager on the
phone or tablet so yeah there's nothing

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:30.750
phone or tablet so yeah there's nothing
 

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.480
phone or tablet so yeah there's nothing
stopping you from using that the rest

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:32.490
stopping you from using that the rest
 

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.030
stopping you from using that the rest
api is probably going to be a bigger

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040
api is probably going to be a bigger
 

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.280
api is probably going to be a bigger
overhead using that then using the

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.290
overhead using that then using the
 

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.259
overhead using that then using the
native sdk when it's available

00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:39.269
native sdk when it's available
