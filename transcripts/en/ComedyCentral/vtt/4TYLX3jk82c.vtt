YESTERDAY WAS THE START OF MARCH
MADNESS -- NCAA SELECTION

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.641 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUNDAY.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.577 line:91%
ACTUALLY, FOR ME, EVERY SUNDAY
IS SELECTION SUNDAY, IN THAT I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.849 align:start position:0% line:91%
"SELECT" TO IGNORE MY LOVED ONES
AND WATCH SPORTS ALL DAY, AND

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start position:0% line:91%
APPARENTLY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
DISTRACTED BY THIS MARCH TO

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.553 align:start position:0% line:85%
MADNESS.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.422 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MARCH MADNESS IS A
PRODUCTIVITY KILLER FOR

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.590 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMPANIES.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.660 line:91%
A REPORT ESTIMATES DISTRACTED
WORKERS COULD COST AT LEAST

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:31.364 line:91%
$1.9 BILLION IN WAGES AS PEOPLE
FILL OUT THEIR BRACKETS IN THE

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:33.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
OFFICE AND MANY GAMES WILL BE ON
DURING THE DAY.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.302 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT EXPERTS SAY EMPLOYERS
SHOULDN'T BAN OFFICE POOLS

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.337 line:85%
BECAUSE IT COULD HURT MORALE.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN!

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN OFFICE
POOL!

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID SOMEBODY SAY OFFICE
POOL?!

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0% line:85%
SWEET!

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:50.249 align:start position:0% line:85%
CANNONBALL!

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:, NO, NO, NO
CANNONBALL!

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:59.659 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF POOL I
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.226 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOO!

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
GO ON!

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:01.394 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET!

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.628 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAMN NEIGHBORS' KIDS.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT BACK TO BASKETBALL.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.566 line:91%
NOTHING SOOTHES MY NERVES LIKE
AMATEUR ATHLETICS, WHERE IT'S

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.301 line:91%
ALL ABOUT THE MOLDING OF YOUNG
MINDS, FAR FROM THE CORRUPTING

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start position:0% line:85%
INFLUENCE OF MONEY.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.873 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NCAA BASKETBALL WHICH
GENERATES ABOUT A BILLION

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR MARCH
MADNESS --

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:22.048 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE
GENERATING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.283 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF MONEY --
&gt;&gt; THIS NEW PLAYOFF STRUCTURE

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.852 line:91%
HAS GENERATED MILLIONS, MAYBE
EVEN BILLIONS IN EXTRA REVENUE

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.653 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR SCHOOLS.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.489 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, SO THERE'S A
LITTLE BIT OF MONEY CHANGING

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.524 align:start position:0% line:85%
HANDS.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.226 size:88% position:44% line:85%
A FEW BILLION HERE OR THERE.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.801 line:91%
BUT THE MONEY IS ALL STAYING
WITHIN THE HALLOWED HALLWAYS OF

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,
RIGHT?

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.306 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE CURRENT CONTRACT FOR
MARCH MADNESS WITH CBS AND

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
TURNER BROADCAST IS FOR HOW MANY
YEARS AND HOW MUCH MONEY?

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.176 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; 14 YEARS AND IT'S
$10.8 BILLION.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.110 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; $10.8 BILLION?

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:51.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAAAAA?!

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:52.812 align:start position:0% line:85%
$10.8 BILLION?

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.780 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN, I COULD REALLY MAKE IT RAIN
WITH THAT!

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.282 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S RAINING?

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.717 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOES THAT MEAN THE POOL'S
CLOSED?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.451 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THERE'S NO POOL!

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
GO ON!

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.220 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET!

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:06.425 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET!

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:13.232 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
THERE'S NO POOL.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:18.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALWAYS KEEP A STICK HANDY IS
WHAT I SAY.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.872 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY JUST TO
AIR THE TOURNEY.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.240 line:91%
THAT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:22.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
CABLE DEALS, TICKET SALES AND
MERCHANDISE.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.610 line:91%
SO WHO GETS THIS PILE OF MONEY
THAT EVEN OPRAH WOULD THINK IS

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:27.446 align:start position:0% line:85%
OBSCENE?

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.782 line:91%
TO HELP US UNDERSTAND, I HAD MY
RESEARCH TEAM MAKE THIS HANDY

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:32.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
PIE CHART.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:35.288 line:85%
HERE WE SEE THE $10.8 BILLION.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:39.592 line:91%
NOW, HERE IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF
THE PIE WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY WHAT

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:48.901 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE PLAYERS ARE PAID.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:49.902 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOW!

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:50.970 align:start position:0% line:85%
ODD?

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.104 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ONLY $10.8 IS LEFT FOR THE
UNIVERSITIES AND THE NCAA

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:52.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
ITSELF.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:53.806 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HOW DO THEY STAY AFLOAT?

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.107 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD WORK, GUYS!

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.210 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR PIE
CHART TEAM TO THE FOLKS AT

00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:00.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
U.S.A. TODAY IF WE'RE NOT
CAREFUL.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.950 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SHINE
THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE AGE-OLD

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
COLLEGE ATHLETES SHOULD BE PAID

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.155 align:start position:0% line:85%
"DOLLARS" FOR PLAYING.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BUT SERIOUSLY, WHY
DO COLLEGE ATHLETES NEED

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.826 align:start position:0% line:85%
"DOLLARS"?!

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE GETTING PAID IN
EDUCATION!

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:21.033 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IT'S MORE LIKE "BRAIN BUCKS"
THAT THEY CAN REDEEM AT THE

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.537 align:start position:0% line:91%
"KNOWLEDGE STORE" TO BUY "WISDOM
POINTS"!

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.839 line:91%
AND THOSE WISDOM POINTS WILL
HELP THEM HAVE PERSPECTIVE WHEN

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:34.580 line:91%
THEY ARE "HOMELESS" BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE ANY "ACTUAL MONEY."

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:39.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SYSTEM WAS

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.687 line:85%
DESIGNED TO KEEP ATHLETES POOR.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.523 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE IDEA OF A STUDENT
ATHLETE WAS DEVELOPED AS A LEGAL

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.193 line:91%
TERM TO PREVENT THE WIDOW OF A
PLAYER FROM COLLECTING WORKERS'

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMPENSATION.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.164 line:91%
THE ARGUMENT BY THE NCAA IS WAIT
A MINUTE, THEY'RE NOT WORKERS,

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.866 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THEY'RE STUDENT ATHLETES.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.868 line:85%
THEREFORE, WE OWE THEM NOTHING.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.305 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY, NCAA?

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS THAT REALLY THE SLOGAN YOU
WANT FOR YOUR COLLEGES?

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:04.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
"WE OWE THEM NOTHING"?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.946 align:start position:0% line:91%
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE STUDENT
ATHLETES ARE BEING TREATED, IT'S

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT STOPPING ANYONE FROM FILLING
OUT THEIR BRACKETS.

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.650 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS BRACKET
FEVER.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:11.751 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD LORD!

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.419 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN WE STOP WITH THE BRACKETS,
ALREADY?

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:14.854 line:91%
NO, WE CAN'T, WHICH IS WHY IT'S
TIME FOR THE COOLEST BRACKET

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAME EVER BRACKETED IN
BRACKET-TOWN.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:26.999 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIT IT.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:30.269 line:91%
&gt;&gt; DARE-Y WILMORE'S MARCH
BADNESS BRACKETSBALL, 

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:33.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
DARE-O-MANIA 2-15! IT'S BONER
TIME!

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.877 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO JOKES.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.980 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'VE ASSIGNED MYSELF A DARE FOR
EVERY TEAM IN THE NCAA

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:41.714 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOURNAMENT.

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.683 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S RIGHT, 68 TEAMS, 68
DARES.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:47.219 line:91%
EVERY TIME A TEAM WINS, THAT
DARE ADVANCES -- ALL THE WAY TO

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:52.024 line:91%
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, WHICHEVER TEAM
WINS IS THE DARE I WILL HAVE TO

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:56.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO ON THIS SHOW.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:57.496 line:85%
NOW, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY REAL.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.630 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WE'RE NOT MAKING THIS UP.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.798 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE SOUTH
REGIONAL DIVISION, IF EASTERN

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.133 align:start position:0% line:91%
WASHINGTON WINS THE TOURNAMENT,
I'LL HAVE TO RIDE A HORSE

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHIRTLESS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:06.839 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'LL DO IT!

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:09.875 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF GEORGETOWN WINS, MY EVIL
TWIN WILL HOST THE SHOW.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.711 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT WILL BE
LIKE.

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.312 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WILL BE FUN.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.047 line:91%
AND, OF COURSE, THE BETTER THE
TEAMS, THE HARDER THE DARES.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.149 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF NUMBER FOUR SEED MARYLAND
GOES ALL THE WAY, I'LL BE FORCED

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:21.253 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO WEAR A BOSTON CELTICS JERSEY
FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW.

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:23.389 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND I HATE THE CELTICS.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:27.693 line:91%
AND IF KENTUCKY TAKES THE CROWN,
I'LL BE BABY BIRDED, WHICH MEANS

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:30.563 line:91%
SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO CHEW UP
SOME FOOD AND FEED IT INTO MY

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:34.367 align:start position:0% line:85%
MOUTH.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH I'D PREFER TO WEARING A
STUPID CELTICS JERSEY.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:44.710 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
THE BRACKET WILL FILL UP WITH

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:46.045 align:start position:0% line:85%
DARES ALL THIS WEEK.

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:50.015 line:91%
THE FIRST 32 ARE UP NOW AT
TheNightlyShow.com/Dares, AND

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:50.949 line:91%
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US FILL IN
THE REST. BE AS DARING AS YOU

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.184 align:start position:0% line:91%
WANT. IF IT MAKES IT THROUGH, I
GOTTA DO IT

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:56.856 line:91%
SO TWEET US YOUR DARES WITH THE
HASHTAG "DARELARRY," AND I'LL

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.158 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING AN ASS OF
MYSELF FOR YOU.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:02.728 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
