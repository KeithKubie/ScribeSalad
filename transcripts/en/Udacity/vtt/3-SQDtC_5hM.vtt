00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.944
Well first we want to find this point,

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:06.270
(-1,2) and
we know the slope is -3 over 5.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.070
So the rise is -3.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.990
One, two, three down because
it's negative, and the run is 5,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.940
one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.810
There are my two points.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.290
And there is the corresponding line.
