00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.910
Okay, let's fill out this concept map and see

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.670
how you did. Let's start with the personal DNA sample,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.080
which can be used for genome sampling and comparison.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.400
We learned how to acquire this personal DNA sample in

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.910
lesson seven, and what we're going to be doing is

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.390
genome sampling and comparing individual SNVs. Now an IBS score

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.690
or Identity By State is a score based on

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.810
individual comparisons of individual SNVs. This indicates a genetic identity

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.320
which we have greater than 70% of for

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.270
all SNV matches in humans. Remember that you

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.550
share at least 70% IBS with even the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.330
most distantly related human on the planet. This

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.610
is a rough approximation. Now another kind of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.470
scoring involves the IBD, or identity by descent,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.070
which scores based on segments of chromosomes sharing

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.870
individual SNVs. And this indicates genetic relatedness, which can

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.180
reduce to about 1% for third cousins and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.030
beyond. Now altogether, the SNVs that we measure are

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.740
located on the Y chromosome, which can be

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.170
used to trace the paternal lineage. The mitochondrial chromosome,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320
which is used to trace the maternal line.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.950
And autosomes and the X chromosome, which altogether, can

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.240
be used to trace close and distant family

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.480
relations. Putting all of this information together, we've learned

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.950
that it indicates a human origin out of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.200
Africa. With each expansion experiencing genetic bottlenecks, specifically

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.350
referred to as a founder effect. But we

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.250
learned about these bottle necks more in lesson six.
