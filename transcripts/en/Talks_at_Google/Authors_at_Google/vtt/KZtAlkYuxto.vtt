00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:48.659
&gt;&gt; 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:49.659
Thank you all for coming this afternoon.
We have a very, very unique privilege of welcoming

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:50.659
Noah Alper, the
founder of Noah's Bagels, to speak with us

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:51.659
today, this afternoon.
Noah has 38 years of experience, and he's

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.659
a six-time entrepreneur.
He works now -- he has 38-years of experience

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.659
in business management
and non-profit management, and recently came

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:54.659
up with a book, Business
Mensch, which he will tell us about.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:55.659
So please join me in welcoming Noah Alper.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:56.659
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.659
NOAH ALPER: Thank you, Charo.
I'd also like to thank Ellen Spurdus for bringing

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:58.659
me onto the Google
campus today.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.659
It's a pleasure to be here -- just the food
offerings alone; it's

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.289
probably the only reason I was chosen as a
food guy.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.859
It's amazing.
But what I'm also reminded of is fast-- going

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.310
backwards 50 years to
when America was involved in a lockdown struggle

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.469
with the Soviet Union
over the -- putting a man onto the moon, and

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.579
what's reminded me of it
and I was just speaking with someone a couple

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.729
of weeks ago about this,
was that if you would go into a NASA facility

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.340
at that point and you
would have talked to the janitor, what would

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.500
he have been saying my job
is?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.049
He wouldn't have been saying my job is to
clean the floors, and to mop

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.700
them spick and span.
What he would say is I'm here to put a man

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.099
on the moon.
And walking around the Google campus and talking

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.310
to people today in the
brief time I've been here, I get that same

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.929
kind of feeling that this
place is all about your mission statement

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.259
of -- of disseminating and
organizing information for the world.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.969
And by all accounts, you're doing a heck of
a great job at it.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.380
I hope that in 50 years -- and this is something
that I was again

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.790
thinking about just today -- watching Toyota,
everybody's read the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.930
papers.
Fantastic company, built on quality, only

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.799
to get arrogant and to forget
where they first started and are running into

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.930
some real bumps in the
road right now.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.130
I don't think that's going to happen here
as long as the -- this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.000
fantastic culture that's been developed perpetuates.
So I wanted to say that before I go into a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.650
little discussion about my
life and my book.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
As Charo said my name is Noah Alper, and I
would have to admit that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.220
I've been a serial entrepreneur for over 35
years.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.320
I've built six enterprises; four of which
were successful.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.289
So I felt that with a .666 batting average,
I had the credibility and

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.669
credentials to write my book, "Business Mensch:
Timeless Wisdom for

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.440
Today's Entrepreneur."
The book is not only about -- excuse me -- the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.049
bottom line but it's
also about the soul and the connection between

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.489
the two.
In these hard times, I've had occasion to

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.639
fly all across the country
and in many cases deliver messages to groups

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.289
that are trying to get
people jobs in networking and in inspirational

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:41.959
meetings.
And I'm reminded of one huge billboard, that

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.870
I saw driving in from JFK
airport into Manhattan and it said, "In New

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.729
York-ese, Recession 101
Self-Worth Beats Net Worth."

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.440
And hopefully that kind of perspective, that
kind of attitude, is

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.091
what's going to pull us out of this mess.
And you folks here are going to be in the

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:04.740
leadership role in doing
that.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:12.420
In 1996, after only six and a half years,
my company, Noah's Bagels,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.660
the largest kosher retailer in the United
States with 38 stores from

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:26.270
Seattle to Los Angeles sold for $100 million.
But 27 years previous to that, I was locked

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.600
up in a psychiatric
hospital for nine months.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.930
It was 1969, I was a college senior at the
University of Wisconsin, the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.680
Vietnam War was raging, and Madison, Wisconsin,
was one of the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.440
epicenters of the anti-war movement.
I was uncertain about my future, and I was

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.310
afraid of being drafted into a war that I
did not believe in.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.910
These factors, combined with a lot of old
personal issues and a steady

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.240
diet of marijuana, sent me barrelling over
the edge.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.750
I was paranoid, I was delusional, and only
after my parents took me

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.820
home did the process of healing slowly begin.
Very, very slowly, I regained my balance.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.300
And after getting out of the hospital, I was
finally able to hold down

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.010
a menial job in my brother-in-law's book warehouse
shelving books and

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.370
filling orders.
Eventually, and again very slowly, I felt

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.910
the confidence and strength
to handle a little bit more challenging job,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.440
which is a retail
cashiering position in his Harvard Square

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.060
store.
So one night during this period while living

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.161
in Cambridge, I fell in
love.

00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:41.970
And it wasn't a typical kind of romantic love
we're used to, it was

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.850
actually the love of a salad bowl.
Now these were rustic, wooden salad bowls

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.650
that my grandmother probably
would have chopped gefilte fish in or liver

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.630
in.
Very, very rustic bowls.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.050
But at that time in the early 70s, rustic
and natural was in and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.370
plastics were definitely out.
When these bowls were rubbed with vegetable

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.440
oil, they glowed.
And they just got me so excited that the next

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.100
day, I got into my VW bus
-- because in 1971, you had to have a VW bus

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.230
 -- went up to Vermont, and
picked up a thousand dollars worth of these

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.860
salad bowls, only to start
off back into a blinding blizzard, and the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.050
VW bus went off the -- off
the road into a guardrail.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.770
I had these thousand dollars of salad bowls.
I didn't know how to get them back to Cambridge,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.230
where I was going to
be hocking them.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.889
So I rented the biggest Lincoln made, and
I stuffed the bowls in the

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.060
trunk and in the glove compartment and under
the seat.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.770
Got them back to Cambridge, took out my Indian
bedspread -- because

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.670
that was kind of standard issue as well, it
kinda went along with the VW bus-- spread

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.620
it out over the back of the rented Lincoln,
put the thousand dollars worth of salad bowls

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.260
on display on the back of the trunk of the
car, and in an hour and half they were all

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.930
gone.
Thus my first business, the Alper Wooden Bowl

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.139
Company, was born.
Beyond selling them off the back of the car,

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.900
my brother-in-law taught
me an early lesson in being a mensch and being

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.820
 -- just to refresh those
of you who might not be familiar with the

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.570
term, mensch is originally a
German word meaning "man."

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.080
The Yiddish word is the same pronunciation,
but it means a man, a

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.740
person, what he, they, she should be in an
ideal world, in God's world.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.960
That's what a -- what a man should be is a
mensch.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.080
So my brother-in-law taught me about being
a mensch when I was out in

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.960
front selling these salad bowls because he
charged me the princely rent

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.919
of $150 a month.
But he didn't take the money.

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.580
He wanted me to donate it to the charity of
his choice.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.560
And I got a really -- a firsthand view of
what it's like to run a

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.960
company from a ethical standpoint and from
a standpoint of involving

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.530
others as well.
So I'm selling the bowls on the sidewalk.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:18.000
I'm also going to gift stores, gourmet stores
in the greater Boston

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.850
area and selling these -- these salad bowls.
And at the same time, my former wife and I

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:33.029
decided to open up a
natural foods store in Brookline, Mass., called

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:36.949
Bread and Circus.
Now this was right in the heart of the brisket

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:41.430
belt, okay?
Kosher butchers one after the other , delis.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.680
Schmaltz or chicken fat was a staple item
in most neighborhood

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.060
refrigerators, but nobody there knew what
organic carrots were in 1973.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:58.650
There were only a handful of such stores nationally.
And if there's one thing I think that I've

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:04.769
been able to do successfully in my business
career, is to spot an emerging trend, and

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:09.990
try to get -- to try to get, if you use the
wave analogy, to try to get there just

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.500
before that wave is crashing but not early
enough that nobody knows

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.180
what the heck you're doing.
This was a borderline.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.199
It took about two, three years until this
store was really something

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:28.860
that the local neighborhood understood.
When we first opened, people said, is this

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.939
a hardware store?
They didn't understand the wood walls, the

00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:38.189
sort of rustic look that was
popular among certain circles.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:41.679
And there were really no such things as natural
food stores.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:47.440
There were health food stores.
There was stores that sold Tiger bars and

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.730
vitamins and distilled water,
but a store that would be, you know, part

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.480
of a whole lifestyle movement
was something that was really in incipiency

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.149
at that time.
Brands like Tom's of Maine, Celestial Seasonings,

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:04.629
Häagen-Dazs -- these
were all brands that we brought in that were

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:07.160
brand new and no one had
ever heard of them.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.449
And we would -- we could not have imagined
that these would have been

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:14.399
mainstream items that you would have seen
at a Safeway or a Lucky's in

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:18.209
those days.
This was, as I mentioned, a part of a lifestyle

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:21.709
movement that grew and
grew and grew.

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:26.079
However, for us being in that -- bringing
in that retail environment

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:29.569
was very difficult.
I'm kind of a guy who has what they refer

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:34.259
to in Yiddish as shpilkes,
and shpilkes is kind of terminal ants in the

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:38.490
pants.
And for me to sort of sit, you know, day-to-day,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.269
week after week in
this one retail location was not really something

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:45.570
that, um, I wanted to
continue with.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:51.329
So, three years after opening the store, we
sold the business to a

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:54.829
young Irish immigrant by the name of Anthony
Harnett.

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:59.589
Now I knew this enterprise at that time, because
three years had

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:03.629
passed, was on the move and I knew that it
was going to be something

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.709
that was going to develop and grow, and indeed
it did.

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:10.820
Bread and Circus became the largest natural
food store in the

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.170
Northeast, and in 1996 it was sold to Whole
Foods Market.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.819
Simultaneously to the development of Bread
and Circus, I continued to

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:26.339
work with the woodenware.
I built that business up, and eventually was

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:32.610
importing from eight
countries and selling to over 2,000 natural

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.730
food stores and cookware
stores and catalog houses and department stores

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.880
across the country.
This was part of yet another emerging trend,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.420
which was the gourmet
industry.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.899
And you only have to go down -- downstairs
to see your lunch offerings

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:52.129
to understand that.
In those days, I mean, we're talking you know

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:56.249
Salisbury steak, Swanson
TV dinners, canned vegetables.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:12:03.569
This was the -- the haute cuisine of the day.
But people had started to go to Europe, young

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:08.230
people in particular,
airfares had come down, people had experienced

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.839
continental cuisine and
they wanted to replicate it in their kitchens.

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:19.129
And they needed serving utensils and implements
and tableware to

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:25.509
reflect that interest in fine dining.
Julia Child was emerging as a very popular

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:30.069
figure on television.
And all of these -- all of these factors combined

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:34.759
to create a brand new
industry called the gourmet industry.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:40.589
And the first ever gourmet show was actually
held just up the line here

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:46.199
a little bit in San Francisco.
As the company developed from these rustic

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:52.189
wooden bowls into this
import business of artisan-made housewares,

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:57.649
the name changed.
Never being accused of being overly humble,

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:01.199
it was a very logical and
easy transition to change the name from the

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:06.319
Alper Wooden Bowl Company
to the Alper International Incorporated Company

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:10.209
which it became in the
late 70s and early 80s.

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:18.209
I ran Alper International until 1984 and after
selling it to a

00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:24.889
colleague, I took a much desired year off.
And this year off coincided with a planned

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:30.459
move to the West Coast.
As a prelude to that year and on a whim, I

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:34.569
decided to go to Israel.
I had never been there before and I was curious

00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:36.679
to see what it was all
about.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:40.089
I immediately fell in love with the land,
with the people, with the

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:43.800
spirit.
And I came back dedicated to trying to strengthen

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.389
the Israeli economy
by connecting my next business to the Jewish

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:51.450
state.
Ronald Reagan was in power, and I heard a

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.339
statistic that one out of
three Americans had admitted to a born-again

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.970
Christian conversion.
So my concept was why wouldn't these same

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.809
people be interested in
buying things from the land of Israel, from

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:10.429
the land where Jesus
walked, "special gifts from a special place"

00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:12.720
was the slogan for the
company.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.649
Evidently, the gifts weren't that special
because that business was a

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:22.399
total and complete failure.
I didn't really know my customers in retrospect.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:25.829
I should have really partnered with a Pat
Boone or some other kind of

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:31.220
Christian minister, and been sort of the expediter,
the middle man, the

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:38.429
backdoor guy who sourced the products.
But I didn't understand that at the time,

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:41.579
and this failure was very
difficult for me.

00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:46.350
But as I explain in a chapter in the book
called Come Back Stronger,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.309
I'm convinced that I would not have been as
successful in my next

00:14:50.309 --> 00:14:56.559
business had I not gone through that experience.
And in the way of an example, our first store

00:14:56.559 --> 00:15:01.220
at College at Alcatraz in
Berkeley was a very, very successful store

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.349
right off the gate.
The landlord told me one year after we opened

00:15:06.349 --> 00:15:09.980
 -- and the store was
going gangbusters -- that she said, you know,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:16.699
Noah, based on your
resume of the Holy Land Gift Company and some

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:19.189
of these other things,
I'm not sure I would have rented you this

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:23.160
space in this high traffic
location, seeing that you had had such a miserable

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.309
failure and you were
sort of looking for a job when I rented you

00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:31.100
the store.
She said, but you had such a fire in your

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.279
belly.
She said that I was convinced that no matter

00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:37.899
what you went into, you
were gonna be a fantastic success.

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:45.009
And on that basis, I rented you that store.
So backtracking, a bit, I'm licking my wounds

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:48.809
and I'm facing the
sobering fact that I had a family to provide

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:53.220
for and I needed either a
job or a new business venture.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.920
Just at that time, my brother Dan had been
to Montreal, and had taken a

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.119
video, which was pretty radical in those days
to begin with.

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:05.939
Camera was about this big, showed me this
video of this sort of Willie

00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:10.910
Wonka of bagel shops in Montreal, where you
would see the bagels going

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.630
through these glass tunnels, and coming out
on the other end.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.080
And it was an amazing show.
And he looked at me and he said, you ought

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.380
to do this in Berkeley.
At which point I looked at him and I said

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.379
if this is such a great idea
Dan, why don't you do it in Berkeley?

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:29.160
He said, no, you're the entrepreneur, you're
the one that's supposed to

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.249
do this.
I said okay.

00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:34.660
It's kind of interesting.
I don't know about four o'clock in the morning.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.480
I got a four on my mechanical aptitude test
out of a hundred.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.189
I'm not sure I'm going to be the one to fix
the ovens in the middle of

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:42.629
the night.
But you know what?

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:47.459
I'll go back East and I'll check it out.
I remembered, as I mentioned, that during

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:52.259
the Alper International days,
as part of my research, this came to me that

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.600
this gourmet show, San
Francisco, the home of every kind of fantastic

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.839
ethnic cuisines of all
descriptions, with one major exception -- there

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.380
weren't any really
fabulous bagels.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.510
So after prowling around the bowels of old
New York and the lowest of

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.250
the Lower Eastside, and thinking a lot about
this and talking about to

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:19.040
my wife, who was a Brooklyn native and would
always tell me whether I was on track, off-track

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.260
in terms of my concepts.
I decided after the end of the year, that

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.809
this was a go.
I had the -- the makings of a winning formula.

00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:35.480
I had a great concept.
I would combine a terrific bagel with what

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.780
was called the New York
appetizing stores, and what these appetizing

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.510
stores are is a place
where you can get great herring and cream

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.750
sauce and all cream cheese
spreads.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.370
It was a dairy deli in Jewish tradition, meat
and milk are kept

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.910
separate.
So this would have been a collection of great

00:17:52.910 --> 00:18:01.510
dairy items, pickles and
cakes and smoked fish and things like that.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.630
So that was the concept.
And from the moment that that first store

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:11.370
opened, one mile from the UC
campus, it was an enormous success.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:17.200
I had never intended to found a large company.
It was all about one store and making it great.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.260
And I am convinced that that, you know, that
that perspective of making

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.720
that one store great is what really kept,
kept that business successful

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:34.420
as we went through.
I can remember my brother Dan at one point

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.130
calling me and said, we were
written up in the San Francisco Chronicle

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.650
as being a chain, very upset.
I said, Dan, we have nine stores.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.810
We are a chain.
Well, I know, but you know I just don't like

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.590
it.
And I think that his comment was emblematic

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.370
of how we ran the business.
It wasn't a chain.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:59.750
It was a collection of local stores.
And again, coming back to, to your enterprise

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.870
here, I hope as you get
larger and larger and larger and instead of

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.560
taking over a quarter of
the world, you may be able to take over half

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.230
of the world, that you --
that you keep this perspective that the -- that

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.860
there's always someone
at your back, and no matter how big you get.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:24.320
And it's always important to retain that humility.
I think, in my case, you know, I was just

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.700
kind of born hungry.
So no matter how successful that store was,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.400
I was always looking over
my back and seeing who was, who was about

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.080
to overtake us.
That's the way I did business.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.060
And that's the way the company did business
as well.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.800
I've discussed some of the steps towards a
winning business concept,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:52.260
but I discuss many other tools in the book.
In particular, our approach to our customers,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.510
our communities, and our
employees.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:02.480
And as an example of how we took care of all
of these constituencies in

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.920
a very substantive way, before we would open
up any of our stores as we

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.230
were expanding, we would do a community service
project.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:17.020
We would go out into the community.
In one case, in Los Angeles, we painted an

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.050
entire house in a rough
section of LA in a day.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:29.330
We had 30, 35 crew members including part-timers.
And we would go down there to the various

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.100
locations, and whatever the
communities involved were interested in, we

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.520
would pitch in and do a
service project.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.580
What these service projects did were not only
telling the community

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.110
we're here to stay, we're -- you're very important
to us, but it helped

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.930
to bind the crew together by working on the
service projects together,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.350
they got to know one another.
Before we opened a store, everybody knew everybody's

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.390
name and knew a
little bit about them and they felt good about

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.160
the company that they
worked for.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.510
So that they were able to deliver a kind of
service that allowed Noah's

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:10.200
to have one half the turnover rate of an average
quick service retailer

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.010
company.
And all of you know that that translates into

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.320
huge advantages in terms
of morale, in terms of cost savings and in

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.070
terms of overall performance
in the business.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:30.600
In 1995, we're expanding very fast -- excuse
me.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.929
[PAUSE]

00:21:32.929 --> 00:21:41.170
-- and looking for a strategic partner.
We had been co-locating with Starbucks often

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.330
as it was a very symbiotic
relationship.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.890
Bagels, coffee.
Our real estate people kept seeing each other

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.260
at various locations that
were opening up.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.940
We eventually formalized that partnership
and Starbucks became a

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:01.140
25 percent owner in Noah's.
One year later, we get a serious threat.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.480
And the threat is from the Einstein Bagel
Company out of Golden,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.300
Colorado.
It was a public company and it was acquiring

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.140
regional bagel chains
across the country.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:17.720
And they -- they gave us basically two options.
And the first option was sell us the business.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.260
And the second option was look for an Einstein
Brothers Bagel

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:27.710
Company --
I told you, I got a four on my mechanical

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.550
aptitude test,
didn't I?

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.470
I was even able to stand here and do nothing
and break the microphone,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:38.900
you know.
So there comes Einstein Brothers.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:46.160
They're threatening to either acquire us or
compete with us in every

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.070
location across the West Coast.
We thought a lot about it.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.390
We didn't like the offer.
It wasn't enough money.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.080
And it was also a stock deal, and it wasn't
all cash.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.730
By then, needless to say, it was not also
just about me.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.590
We had venture capital partner, we had Starbucks,
we had senior

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.570
management.
And by the way, brother Dan, he came into

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.970
the business a year after we
opened the -- opened the first location.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.860
We had store managers.
We had assistant managers.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.660
We had a lot of constituencies.
But as a collective, we decided that that

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.720
offer wasn't substantial
enough for us to sell the business.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.760
A year later, they came back with a new and
improved offer, which was

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.850
an all cash offer.
As I mentioned or was mentioned in the introduction,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.290
it was indeed for
a hundred million dollars.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.930
And we took the offer thus avoiding a bloody
bagel shootout in the Wild

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:47.680
West.
Hopefully, you'll read the book.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.260
And I understand they're on sale for $5, and
as they used to say in the

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.020
Lower Eastside, such a deal.
How could you pass up $5?

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.680
You'll learn that I'm a firm believer in working
hard.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.150
I'm also a firm believer -- and I think this
has been really

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.390
institutionalized in this culture, and I don't
even know if I have to

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.500
say this to you -- but in balance and maintaining
perspective.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.960
I'm still not sure how you guys unleash yourselves
from all of your

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.860
hardware, but I'm also a firm believer that
that's important.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.800
That taking time off, whether it's -- in my
case, I'm Sabbath

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.610
observant.
I don't work on Saturday.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.800
I shut the phones.
It's like what everyone pays thousands of

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.960
dollars for to go to a desert
island for and turn off the phones and not

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.690
be bothered by anyone and do
exactly what they want.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.070
I do that every week.
Not that all of you need to do that, but the

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:45.330
idea of maintaining
perspective and balance in our lives is -- has

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.621
never been more
important.

00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:51.560
And I'm fond in my speeches of talking about
how, you know, what are

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.190
the engineers going to throw at us next to
make us even more leashed

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.060
and connected and wired?
But I realize I'm talking to them right here.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.470
So not that you guys shouldn't invent them,
but very, very important to

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.840
take a walk around the park, to go in the
endless lap pool, and I can

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.220
see that you are doing that already.
I wish that the entire country could really

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.150
understand the importance
of that balance and how indeed it improves

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:24.360
our work performance, as
well as it helps to ensure our personal health,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.890
and the -- and the
health and the unity of our family structure.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:34.220
So after -- after selling Noah's Bagels, I
had a dream.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.310
And my personal dream was to spend a year
in Jerusalem with my family.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.020
Unfortunately, our oldest son was not able
to join us for the year, as

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.620
he was in college, but the younger two boys
and my wife and I did

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.450
indeed spend a year in Jerusalem.
I was at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:59.570
And I learned what I never learned in school
about my own tradition.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.350
Most or many Jewish people have about a 6th
grade education in their

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.240
own traditions, and that didn't -- wasn't
much different than mine.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.080
I was able to get the equivalent of a higher
education in Jewish

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.060
thought.
And it was an absolutely tremendous, tremendous

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.510
year for me personally.
My boys were in Israeli public school, my

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.270
wife was doing some really
interesting volunteer work.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.800
After the end of the year, I came back to
San Francisco.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.670
And almost immediately upon touch down at
the airport was approached to

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:37.070
help found a Jewish community high school
in San Francisco.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:45.380
So in -- on September 1st of 2001, 10 days
before 9/11, we created the

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:52.100
Jewish Community High School of the Bay.
It was an interesting first month of operations.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.400
After a year the school moved to San Francisco,
and I'm proud to say

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:02.910
that the school now has 180 students.
My older son started the organic lunch program,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.380
which was and remains
to be a model for school lunch programs across

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.510
the United States.
It's very similar to going to a Google cafeteria.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.820
Tremendous food, hand crafted, and tremendously
healthy.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.300
After four years of full-time volunteer work
for the high school, I

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.891
again began to have an itch to get back into
the food business.

00:27:26.891 --> 00:27:31.080
If any of you have had familiarity with it,
it's something that you

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.460
can't shed very easily.
So my wife and I opened a kosher, Italian,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.150
vegetarian restaurant in
downtown Berkeley called Ristorante Raphael

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:48.780
in 2003.
Unfortunately, 4 years later, the bottom line

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.500
results weren't there and
the lease was coming due, and we had to call

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.340
it a day.
But we had tons of adoring patrons and great

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.640
memories.
In the beginning of '08, in response to many

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.920
requests, I started my own
business consulting practice to help small

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.770
businesses with concept
creation, marketing, and executive planning.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:14.100
And if any of you, you know, go off to do
your own thing for after

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:21.680
you're leaving Google, I'm the guy to call.
Later on -- later on that year, I decided

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:29.400
to codify or to -- or to
compile a business memoir.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.390
Both the successes, the failures on a personal
level, on a business

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.510
level, lessons I had learned, a lot of stories
from my father who was

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:46.660
the consummate business mensch.
And this was 38 years of -- of really just,

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.040
you know, coming into
industries and seeing them born and grow up

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.540
and mature and a lot of
stuff you learn in 38 years.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:02.160
So I finished the book, "Business Mensch:
Timeless Wisdom for Today's

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:09.680
Entrepreneur," it went out for sale in September.
And while envisioning this book, Jewish thought

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.600
informed my direction.
We are, by some recounts, 5,000-year old tradition,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.630
we have a lot of wisdom,
a lot of accumulated perspectives to share

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.730
with the world.
And so the book is framed through the lens

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.070
of Jewish values and Jewish
wisdom and Jewish pride.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:35.040
But I also wanted to make it clear that, like
there was an old Levy's rye bread ad years

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.960
ago, and it said, "You don't have to be Jewish
to love Levy's."

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.110
Well, it's the same with my book.
You don't have to be Jewish to read the " Business

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.220
Mensch."
And in the book, I talk about being a mensch

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:53.330
or being a highly-principled person, and being
successful in business.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.200
Dispelling the notion that most or all Jewish
business people are like

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:04.290
Bernard Madoff, who I refer to as the anti-mensch.
And in the book, I share wisdom not learned

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.730
from business schools,
because I didn't attend one; nor from MBA

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:14.550
computer models, which I
really can't understand; but more from Jewish

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.530
sources, and more
importantly, from my own trial and error on

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.150
what I like to call the
real streets of life.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.770
So by way of a little bit of preview, I'm
going to read a couple of

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.230
short pieces from the book and I think that
these will give you a

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:35.290
little bit of a flavor as to what's inside.
So this is from a chapter called, "Have a

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.700
Little Chutzpah."
And I think since it's written in the New

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:45.360
York Times without any kind
of translation, probably everybody knows what

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.809
that means.
And if they don't, there's a company called

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:50.700
Google you just go in under
"chutzpah" and I think they'll be able to

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.340
tell you what it is.
My own earliest lesson to chutzpah came when

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.260
I was 10-years old.
The teacher, my cousin Donny, three years

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.110
my senior.
Growing up in suburban Boston, we were both

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.750
hockey fanatics.
And seized on any opportunity to skate, usually

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.130
on a nearby field that
was flooded over and frozen in the winter.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.770
Then we heard about a new country club, where
a winter ice rink had

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.890
been created on the tennis courts, complete
with genuine hockey nets

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.450
and sideboards.
Donny and I couldn't wait to try to out.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.110
So one Wednesday evening, Donny gathered a
group of our friends to go

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.900
to the Sidney Hills Country Club for a hockey
game.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.730
There was just one problem.
None of us were members.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:41.180
Now, that didn't bother Donny.
He led the way and a dozen of us all carrying

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.750
sticks and skates
followed, proceeding to the rink, lacing up

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.820
and starting a game of
hockey.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.020
We were enjoying the smooth ice, the warm
glow of the floodlights, and

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.700
the thrill of sending the puck into a real
net, when another group of

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.700
kids showed up looking to use the ice.
Donny looked them up and down.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.010
"You guys members here?" He asked.
Of course, they said in chorus.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:11.690
Donny shook his head slowly.
"Sorry," he said, "Wednesday is nonmember

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:15.920
night."
They looked at him confused.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.460
"Come back another night," he said.
The kids didn't protest, politely and respectfully,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:26.690
they gathered up their gear, found a pay phone
and called their parents and then disappeared

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.679
into the night.
Donny flashed a huge grin, and the rest of

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:35.160
us played on savoring the
rink until the club shut off the lights late

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:41.010
that night.
Now that was chutzpah.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:48.690
Lastly, from the chapter, "The Power of a
Mensch."

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.590
[PAUSE]

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.820
In the 1950s, long before the government enacted
laws to protect

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.059
employees and prohibit workplace discrimination,
my father, a food

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:06.380
broker in New England, founded the Massachusetts
Commission on Fair

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.130
Employment Practices.
It's name made it sound like a bona fide government

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.610
agency but it
wasn't.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.740
Dad and a friend took it upon themselves to
speak out for workers.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.140
They would investigate reports of discrimination
and write press

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:27.130
releases to bring attention to the issue.
They were bloggers before their time.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.710
Dad always taught me that people are capable
of tremendous things.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.550
An employer's role is to give them a chance,
supply them with the tools

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:41.809
they need, and help them to reach their potential.
I saw the benefits of treating your employees

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:46.410
right firsthand and
developed what I call the 14 piece bucket

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:51.070
rule.
That term came from the college summer I spent

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.400
travelling around the
country working odd jobs.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.580
In Denver, where I worked as a delivery boy
for a chicken place, the

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.420
owner had a policy of not giving the employees
any free food.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.110
I spent long hours inhaling the aroma of freshly
fried chicken.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:12.800
My mouth was watering.
I'm only human after all, but I knew the policy.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.690
It just felt unfair to me.
It felt cruel and inhumane to put a 20-year

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.629
old kid around food all day
and tell him he can't eat.

00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:26.390
So after awhile, let's just say the 16-piece
chicken buckets started

00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:32.000
becoming 14-piece chicken buckets.
Later, when I ran Noah's, I made sure that

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.230
our policy allowed employees
to eat as much as food as they wanted.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:43.349
To me, that simply seems like good sense.
Instead of tempting my employees into sneaking

00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:48.309
a bit, I invited them to
feel like a part of the enterprise.

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:51.819
The heart of my message in Business Mensch
is this: Doing the right

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:57.210
thing not only makes us feel good, but it's
good for business.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:01.599
Thank you very much, Google.
It was a pleasure to be here today.

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:08.210
I'd be happy to take some questions if there
are any.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.609
Yes, sir?

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:19.339
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] I have a couple of questions.
Did you ever write a business plan for any

00:35:19.339 --> 00:35:23.730
of your ventures?
And also which [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:31.890
NOAH ALPER: Okay, good question.
I didn't write a formal business plan but

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.499
 -- and I didn't write any
business plan until I got to Noah's.

00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:44.880
And then Noah's was about a two-page concept
plan with some

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.030
manufactured numbers, which most business
plans are anyway.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:56.009
Based on some research I had done.
And I am a firm believer of -- of some view

00:35:56.009 --> 00:36:01.359
of you who are parents who
say, do as I say and not as I do.

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:04.900
I'm a firm believer that a business plan is
very important, and I've

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:11.599
learned that, you know, later on.
If for no other reason that it helps to clarify

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:14.710
and organize one's
thoughts about starting a business.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.770
And the more information and the more data
that can be collected, the

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.960
better.
I did organize -- I did get a lot of data

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.839
collected, but it was all
here in this computer.

00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:32.890
Your second question had to do with funding.
And -- all except Noah's were boot-strapped

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:39.029
businesses.
In the case of Noah's, it started out with

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:44.269
a small loan from my two
brothers, and a small amount of money that

00:36:44.269 --> 00:36:49.269
was left by my father.
And we were able -- I was able to open that

00:36:49.269 --> 00:36:54.960
first store for roughly
half what the later stores were opening for.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.749
Of course, we had to change out the linoleum
flooring after about three

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:02.410
weeks and replace it with tile because it
had worn out.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.200
But that's what you do, you know, starting
a business.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.700
Eventually however, Noah's, as it developed,
went, you know, the sort

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.890
of obviously more traditional financing routes,
where we started out

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.849
with the debt financing, and then worked into
revolving lines of

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:25.569
credit, SBA loans.
And then as we -- our need for capital increased,

00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:30.660
brought in a venture
capital partner, brought in Starbucks, some

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:46.230
outside people, so it kind
of ratcheted up as the activity and the need

00:37:46.230 --> 00:38:01.410
required.
Thank you.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:06.470
[PAUSE]

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:11.530
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:32.430
NOAH ALPER: Yeah.
I'll repeat the question.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:38.290
The first question is what does it take to
be an entrepreneur?

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:43.680
And the second question is -- did it come
 -- if I'm quoting correctly,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.509
was there a time when values needed to be
compromised for, in the name

00:38:49.509 --> 00:38:50.509
of business success?

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:52.390
&gt;&gt; Ideals.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:59.640
NOAH ALPER: Ideals. Ideals need to be moderated,
altered, in the name

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.609
of business success.
Um, okay.

00:39:02.609 --> 00:39:07.700
I think obviously, well, I like to sort of
strip it down into sort

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:13.259
of -- there's two sort of major components
to being entrepreneur.

00:39:13.259 --> 00:39:19.130
And the first is to have a high tolerance
for risk, that you're willing

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.910
to basically jump off a diving board, knowing
there's about a 90

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:30.039
percent chance that there's water in it.
The second one is that you be willing to work

00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:35.750
about twice as hard as
the average employee, salaried employee, in

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:40.511
a company.
And I would say that, you know, a third component

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:46.030
is that the business,
um, becomes something like an obsession to

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.960
you.
And I think that's why I focus in on the Shabbat,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.140
the Sabbath piece in
my book, because it kind of comes with the

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.980
territory that all-consuming
passion.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.289
And unless you bridle it somehow, it can just
get away from you, until

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:08.720
you -- you're not dimensional anymore, you're
tunnel-visioned.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.490
And unfortunately, it does take some of that
to get a business off the

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:18.779
ground and to keep it successful.
Having said that, and I've talked to other

00:40:18.779 --> 00:40:24.160
groups about this, being
involved in an entrepreneurial venture is

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.700
different than being the sort
of -- there's a Yiddish term called the mashugana.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.550
It's like the crazy person in the middle who
is like stirring it all up and makes everyone

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.579
else crazy.
That was kind of my role.

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:41.230
But there's ways to be involved in entrepreneurial
ventures that don't

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:49.200
require that kind of personality.
So if you're interested in getting involved

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.979
in entrepreneurial ventures
it's important to partner with people that

00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:57.140
have complementary skills so
that someone's -- someone's a crazy guy in

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.089
the middle of it.
But that you be able to bring your expertise

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:07.059
and your capabilities into
the picture to create the total success, because

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:08.460
it's obviously a
package.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.640
And I talk at length in the book in one of
the chapters called, "It

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.849
Takes a Shtetl," instead of a village, it
takes a shtetl, a little

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.799
village in Poland is where the word comes
from.

00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:22.539
But truthfully, to get an enterprise off the
ground, even though

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:27.029
there's one crazy person in the middle with
the idea, it takes a lot

00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:33.809
more than that to become really successful.
To your second question, I would answer it

00:41:33.809 --> 00:41:40.920
as follows -- and I think
that we, in our business careers, we are involved

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.440
in decisions on a
day-to-day basis that test, that test our

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.279
ideals and our values.
And it's very easy to slip over the line.

00:41:51.279 --> 00:41:55.329
And it's hard to sort of say, you know, even
where the line is

00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:57.819
sometimes.
And it comes very fast.

00:41:57.819 --> 00:42:01.290
I was very interested in talking to someone
at lunch about Google and

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.749
China, and about censorship.
And should Google be involved in something

00:42:04.749 --> 00:42:07.080
like that?
And there were policies that were made, and

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.549
I remember reading the
policies and it made some internal, you know,

00:42:10.549 --> 00:42:14.980
some sense to me.
We're going to go with the laws of the land

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.349
and within that confines
we're going to do the most we can, and perhaps

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:21.890
we can -- you know, we
can generate internal change.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.299
And now there's some rethinking of that subject
and so forth.

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:32.029
I think the key is to keep the moral plane
in full view, like you would

00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:35.500
get your tennis gear assembled before you
go out and play tennis, I

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.970
think you need your moral lens to be firmly
in place when you go to the

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:43.979
workplace so that when these decisions come
up, and some of them as I

00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:48.549
mentioned are very fast and very seductive,
okay?

00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:53.849
And I think if the extra time that it takes
to just think that through

00:42:53.849 --> 00:43:00.150
a little bit further is done, then more than
likely, while greed is not

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.319
going to go away and self-interest is not
going to go away, slowly,

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:14.209
incrementally, we can move towards a more
ideal world.

00:43:14.209 --> 00:43:16.660
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:24.670
NOAH ALPER: Well, I think you're in the heart
of it right here.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:30.470
The other trend that unfortunately, I think
is -- is huge and needs to

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:36.499
be addressed is-- is the obesity crisis that
America's in.

00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:41.119
And that we somehow as a nation, as a society,
get our arms around how

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:50.729
to -- how to alleviate this issue.
And I think that as my thesis in the book

00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:55.869
states, that there's a -- going to be a lot
of money to be made at it as well as doing

00:43:55.869 --> 00:44:00.420
a lot of good for the planet.
I think that it's very clear and obvious and

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:07.479
I'm restating the obvious
in saying that we're on a suicide track in

00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:13.880
terms of global warming.
And that if we don't get our arms around sustainable

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.289
lifestyle, we're
going to all fry up.

00:44:16.289 --> 00:44:21.440
And I think, it's on the radar screen.
I'm not sure how loud and clear it is.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.320
Anything to do with that is going to huge
and hopefully some of those

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.150
jobs will wind up in America and not overseas,
if we can get our

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:36.900
entrepreneurial spirit cranked up and the
where with all to tackle

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:47.579
issues as vital as these two that I have mentioned.

00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:51.780
Yes, sir?

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.880
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:09.319
NOAH ALPER: Well, it's an interesting question.
It's like a lot of marketing stuff and I -- you're

00:45:09.319 --> 00:45:10.319
going to say,
marketing?

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:16.759
Wait a minute, this is kosher.
But I want to -- want to give you just -- and

00:45:16.759 --> 00:45:20.599
maybe others would
bear with me for a second.

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:25.359
I was learning with a traditional rabbi at
the time when I was about to

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:28.730
open the first store, and he wasn't going
to eat in the store unless it

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:33.180
was kosher.
So I wanted it to be a place where the whole

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.900
Jewish community could
come, whether they were ultra Orthodox, whether

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.299
they were communist,
whether they were Reform, Conservative, whoever

00:45:41.299 --> 00:45:44.349
they were, they could
feel comfortable about going into a Noah's

00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:52.009
store.
The more I looked into it, you know, it was

00:45:52.009 --> 00:45:56.299
not all that difficult
because most of the products came in already

00:45:56.299 --> 00:46:01.400
kosher certified.
Later on, as I -- as I was in the operation

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.339
phase, I learned that it
was a lot more complicated than I thought.

00:46:05.339 --> 00:46:09.599
We had employees come in with ham and cheese
sandwiches and toast them

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:13.809
up in our ovens, and then what do you do?
So there were a lot of -- there were a lot

00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:21.410
of nuisances.
But what I realized as I had made -- initially

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.900
made the decision to
operate the stores kosher was that it added

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:31.450
yet one more piece of
authenticity to the enterprise that we were

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:35.630
putting together.
That this was a genuine, Lower Eastside, old-timey,

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.420
New York bagel
place.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.180
Well, it should be kosher.
So it was a little bit of an intangible.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.670
But I know that I got enough feedback from
people that said, you know,

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.349
you stand for something here.
There's something that's -- that's more important

00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:53.930
than just making
money and selling bagels.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:59.359
You have somewhat of a higher purpose, that
I think the kosher, you

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:02.430
know, while represented if you will was symbolic
of.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.390
And I know that some of our employees who
were -- who were totally

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:13.910
secular, said to me that -- that the kashrut
or the kosher aspect of

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:19.170
this business is really what bound it altogether.
Now I thought it was an interesting comment,

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:23.720
especially coming from
someone that was really outside the tradition.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.510
I can remember that when we closed for Passover,
I had a lot of people

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:34.720
come over to me later, non-Jews, and say how
it impressed they were

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.599
they we had kept our values and remained closed
during the time when

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:44.150
bread is not allowed to be consumed or sold.
Many of our Jewish customers complained, where's

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:48.299
our bagels?
So you know, you never win it all.

00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:54.229
But I think, in retrospect, the only way I
can answer, was that before

00:47:54.229 --> 00:47:58.900
the Sabbath when I would walk home with the
challah under each arm,

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.989
knowing that this was a kosher challah, just
made me feel good.

00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:09.109
And I think there was a residual feeling amongst
 -- the amongst the

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:14.539
entire workforce and our customer base that
this was a company that

00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:19.979
stood for something.
And in that sense, I think it was huge.

00:48:19.979 --> 00:48:24.299
So I want to thank all of you again for taking
your valuable time today

00:48:24.299 --> 00:48:30.599
and coming to listen to my talk.
And I -- it was my pleasure to be here and

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:32.450
see such an exciting company
at work.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.130
Thank you very much.
