00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 200 years ago it took 12 days to send a letter from New York to London 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.920
 And 150 years ago the first Telegraph cable was connected across the Atlantic from the Queen of England to the President of the United States 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.540
 17 hours. 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.980
 85 years ago, telephones became common household appliances 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.920
 Thirty years ago, the first mobile phone that weighed a kilo was invented 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.600
 It took 10 hours to ship and make a call for 35 minutes and its price was about $ 4,000. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 Twenty years ago, the first text message was sent 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.000
 A "happy birthday" 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 Today, the number of people with mobile phones is greater than the number of chairs 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.840
 With nearly 23 billion text messages sent each day. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.580
 But how do text messages work? 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.720
 When the radio operates a station, it receives information transmitted via electromagnetic waves at a certain frequency 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 In this case radio waves are picked up. These waves often pass through the body without interacting with it at all 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.480
 But it is of the same spectrum that we see as just a difference in the scientific perspective 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.800
 Photons with a wavelength of 400 to 700 nanometers have the perfect energy to pass through the receptors in your eyes 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.240
 The signals are transmitted to your brain and are later interpreted in different colors 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.440
 But radio waves that have a wavelength between 100 nm to 100 km 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.760
 It has much less energy and can not reach your eyes. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 So they are invisible to us 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 Similarly to a radio, your mobile phone picks up signals from similar frequencies 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.260
 But it can also transmit its radio waves again over a network at the same time 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.660
 A network is a system of towers, antennas and transmitters that divide geographical spaces into cells 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 Thus the term 'cellular phone' 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.600
 These cells determine which areas use any tower service, even though they interfere until your phone always stays in the service to connect 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.840
 Do you feel that your phone's battery is running out of power faster than usual? 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.180
 Phones send signals at higher levels indoors because of building materials and in areas with large spaces due to distance between transmitters 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.880
 When moving at high speeds such as cars because of the continuous rapid movement between transmitters 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 Whenever someone sends you a message, their phone sends a radio signal with your phone's ID and phone with the message content 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.120
 That message is picked up by the nearest tower, which turns radio waves into digital electric pulses 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.400
 And transfers them to a network center called the Mobile Switch Center 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.320
 If you are out of service or the phone is switched off, the message is stored in the mobile switch center for a short time until you are found by the network 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.900
 The network then detects the tower closest to you and turns the signal to it 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.040
 When you reach the tower closest to you, electronic pulses turn back into radio waves that the antenna in your phone can pick up 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.820
 This gets all in seconds. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.740
 Interestingly, the traditional SMS rate reached its peak in 2011 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.500
 Currently most people send messages via internet services 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.680
 In fact, last year, Watsp outdid traditional text messaging as the biggest text message connector 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.760
 Connecting 30 billion messages sent every day in the world 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.880
 If you send these messages across the world, they are sent via a huge Internet cable that crosses the ocean floor 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.240
 In fact 99% of all data on the Internet is sent via wires that cross the sea 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.320
 What does the future of text messages look like? 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.480
 We are currently in the fourth generation of mobile networks and are working on the fifth generation 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.920
 It was predicted that body phone technology could be available around 2023 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.460
 While a century ago it could have taken months to deliver a love letter 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.440
 Maybe in a few years we will be able to send these messages as soon as you think about the person and let him know that we care for him 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.160
 We follow the new human communication method in the video of emoji - emoticons - on the bottom 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.100
 How they are often misunderstood and how you can use them appropriately. Check out the video from the link in the description box 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.500
 And participated in the channel, for more scientific videos weekly
