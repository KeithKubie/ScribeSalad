00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.190
One of the things that's
important now to notice,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.040
this these types of
transformations can be combined.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.420
To achieve a transformation we
are taking single image and

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.600
then of course use that to
generate a translated image.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.560
This has been translated.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.000
Then of course I rotate
this image by amount theta.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.310
And then of course I actually
add to it things like shear.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.700
So in essence, this basically shows
that to get these set of parameters here

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.290
which basically now show translation,
this is where this comes in.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.000
This kind of rotates the image
theta that we looked at.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.460
And this of course,
also shears it by a certain amount and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.330
shears it in this amount again
noted by these ratios here.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.320
So of course x y w here can
be combined into this and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.150
we can simplify this by looking at the
basically now there are nine parameters

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.130
here in this matrix and if we knew
these and combinations of these.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.090
Of course, noting here that these
combinations can be done priory and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.120
saved to and applied to imagery one.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.640
Now one thing I may want to talk
about right here is most of the time

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.420
this i value would be 1.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.940
Because remember, the current
condition we had with the ws.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.660
W always wants to come out
to be a w on both sides.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.540
And that would be the case here.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.840
So most of the time,
we're looking for these 8 parameters.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.400
Okay?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.700
So let's look at what that means.
