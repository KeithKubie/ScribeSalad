(techno music)

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:08.208
("Jock Box" by The Skinny Boys)

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.809
- This is a poster.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.445
That's a poster.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.380
- [Jillian] Wow.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.180
- [Adam] Borat holding carrots.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.115
I don't understand.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.049
- That is Montez's Hitler.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.616
What are you talking about?

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.851
- Is it?

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.620
- You need to take
that down right now.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.454
- Didi doesn't get it.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.689
- Handle it.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.557
- Montez wants us all
on a juice cleanse.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:28.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
More like Jews cleanse,
I am right, Didi?

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.829 align:start size:84% position:16%
All the Jewish
people out of here?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.764
You don't want that.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.898
Vote for me, I'll shop for you.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.133
- Wait, what was that?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.834
- I'll shop for you.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:35.935
- I like that.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.437
- I like that.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.705
See what I did?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.672
Threw a little sarcasm
on it, that's something

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.940
that you don't understand.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.641
- So that means he
doesn't like it.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.475
I do like it.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.309
- You do like it?

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.144
- I think it's good.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.311
- Oh, I do, though.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
I guess I don't
understand how it works.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.647
- [Anders] Clearly.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.982
- I saw we take the break room,
and we healthify this bitch.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.217
- We all know I can use it.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.920
Daddy loves his carbs.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.356
(Didi laughing)

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.624
- I'm doing Dick in a Box.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
I might, like, do
all that other stuff

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.659
after we're done having sex, but

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.261
there might not be enough time.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.063
Cause that's how much
sex I'm gonna have.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.564
- [Jillian] Okay.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.498
- I'm just glad I didn't
sell all these suits that

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.067
Jet Set left me in his will.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.102
Rest in peace, Jet Set!

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.603
- Miss you!

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.105
- You can kinda hear him
in the vents or something.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.339
- It's my dick.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.574
It's gonna be mine, all right?

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.576
And you're asking me to
sand blast your cock?

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.777
- You know what, bud?

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:18.812 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you want my dick,
then there are rules and

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.679
this is one of them.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.181
You don't wash it!

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.817
- It looked like somethin
from Castle Graceshott.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:24.784
- No, and that's another thing.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.086
You do not shave it.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.588
- Oh, now you're gonna
tell me how to style it?

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.090
- [Karl] That's right!

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.991
- I noticed it's pierced,
and I'm taking that out.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.793
- No, you're not taking it out.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
No, I got that
piercing when I was 12.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:36.663
- Saw your dick.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.497
It's

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:39.899
horrendous.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.733
Yeah, no.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.568
- Very weird.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.535
- It's very gray.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.003
- Karl, your penis is weird.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.238 align:start position:0%
It's got an elbow, and it
looks like a dried-out catfish.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, yeah, I mean,
it's got a crook.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.507
It's not for everyone.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.275
- Your shaft is hairy as well,

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.577
which is weird.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.546
It's like a stranded
puppy at the pound.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.883
Maybe it was drowned,
saved, bite marks.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.952
- So, like,

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.722
whassup with those
kissing lessons?

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.657
- Are you talking to me?

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.126
- Stop it, dude.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.727 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, he wants to
kiss one of you guys.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.962
(curly-haired woman laughs)

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Guys, I'm trapped
in the closet.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.998
You gotta get me
out of here fast.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.000
- Okay, well, plans
are hard to think of,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.735
so it might take us a minute.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:16.569
(soft electronic music)

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.403
Blake?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.106
If you are trapped in a
closet, and that means

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:21.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you're a gay
dude and you're afraid

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.643 align:start size:94% position:6%
to come out of the
closet, I want you to know

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.078
that I still love you.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.613
- I'm not gay.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.083
- When you say you've been
taking steroids, how many?

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:31.851
58.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.119
58.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.755
- Was feelin so strong
until my heart popped.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.324
You know I had six uncles
that died of heart attacks?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.159
- I did not.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.993
That's not in here.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:40.827
- That's a lie.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:41.661
I think that's a lie.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.896
It might only be two.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.331
- What am I writing
down, two or six?

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.933
- Write down three.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.971
