a larger version of a shortcut if you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
a larger version of a shortcut if you
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.539
a larger version of a shortcut if you
want to be able to not only put

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
want to be able to not only put
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429
want to be able to not only put
information on the screen but also make

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
information on the screen but also make
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.859
information on the screen but also make
it accessible so for instance the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
it accessible so for instance the
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.740

and so over the years the power of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
and so over the years the power of
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.350
and so over the years the power of
widgets has increased as the platform

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
widgets has increased as the platform
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.330
widgets has increased as the platform
has developed to give greater support

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
has developed to give greater support
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040
has developed to give greater support
for how they can be integrated with

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
for how they can be integrated with
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.249
for how they can be integrated with
their

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
their
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.530
their
now this started with support for

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
now this started with support for
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.839
now this started with support for
collection widgets including lists and

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849
collection widgets including lists and
 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.699
collection widgets including lists and
galleries and then we added the ability

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709
galleries and then we added the ability
 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.850
galleries and then we added the ability
to resize widgets which told me God says

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
to resize widgets which told me God says
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.699
to resize widgets which told me God says
my calendar more recently also provided

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
my calendar more recently also provided
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.920
my calendar more recently also provided
support to embed widgets directly into

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
support to embed widgets directly into
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.699
support to embed widgets directly into
the lockscreen

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
the lockscreen
 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.949
the lockscreen
and this is open up a whole new world of

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
and this is open up a whole new world of
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.740
and this is open up a whole new world of
possibilities absolutely yeah

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
possibilities absolutely yeah
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.559
possibilities absolutely yeah
this is extremely powerful it allows you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569
this is extremely powerful it allows you
 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.899
this is extremely powerful it allows you
to users to perform actions or view data

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909
to users to perform actions or view data
 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.640
to users to perform actions or view data
without even having to unlock their

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
without even having to unlock their
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.250
without even having to unlock their
phone now as is typically the case along

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
phone now as is typically the case along
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.630
phone now as is typically the case along
with this great power comes

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
with this great power comes
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.610
with this great power comes
similarly great responsibility so it's

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
similarly great responsibility so it's
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.809
similarly great responsibility so it's
really important to take a few

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
really important to take a few
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.970
really important to take a few
proportions when allowing your widget to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
proportions when allowing your widget to
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.210
proportions when allowing your widget to
be locked screened enabled the first

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
be locked screened enabled the first
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.949
be locked screened enabled the first
thing you want to think about is being

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
thing you want to think about is being
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.160
thing you want to think about is being
careful about exposing information so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
careful about exposing information so
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.649
careful about exposing information so
the thing is your lock screen is what

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659
the thing is your lock screen is what
 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.270
the thing is your lock screen is what
you see when the phone's not lock or

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
you see when the phone's not lock or
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.910
you see when the phone's not lock or
when the phone is long so anyone can you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
when the phone is long so anyone can you
 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.349
when the phone is long so anyone can you
know pick up the phone and see that

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359
know pick up the phone and see that
 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.660
know pick up the phone and see that
information if you're exposing things on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
information if you're exposing things on
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.430
information if you're exposing things on
that lock screen that have to do with

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
that lock screen that have to do with
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.660

minimalistic widgets now one of the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510
minimalistic widgets now one of the
 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.940
minimalistic widgets now one of the
confusing things is that each of the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950
confusing things is that each of the
 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.740
confusing things is that each of the
screenshots has a different wallpaper

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750
screenshots has a different wallpaper
 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270
screenshots has a different wallpaper
and a slightly different layout so it's

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280
and a slightly different layout so it's
 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.219
and a slightly different layout so it's
difficult to tell what's a widget and

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229
difficult to tell what's a widget and
 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.810
difficult to tell what's a widget and
what's a background and when things are

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820
what's a background and when things are
 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.060
what's a background and when things are
changing and how so in any case you can

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070
changing and how so in any case you can
 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.350
changing and how so in any case you can
see what they're trying to achieve here

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360

common challenge for widget developers
 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.730
common challenge for widget developers
and if you're building the app that

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740
and if you're building the app that
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.560
and if you're building the app that
happens to have a widget then there's a

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570
happens to have a widget then there's a
 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.880
happens to have a widget then there's a
variety of things that you can do to

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890
variety of things that you can do to
 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.560
variety of things that you can do to
help encourage your users to check out

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
help encourage your users to check out
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.000
help encourage your users to check out
the widget and even if they never find

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010
the widget and even if they never find
 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.700
the widget and even if they never find
it they can still use the app but what

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710
it they can still use the app but what
 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.490
it they can still use the app but what
if as in this case it's just a widget

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500
if as in this case it's just a widget
 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.650
if as in this case it's just a widget
well a lot of developers will still

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660
well a lot of developers will still
 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.300
well a lot of developers will still
choose to include a launcher activity to

screenshots you'll see just how
 

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.620
screenshots you'll see just how
beautiful it is and so making sure that

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.630
beautiful it is and so making sure that
 

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.199
beautiful it is and so making sure that
that first impression is consistent with

that first impression is consistent with
 

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.120
that first impression is consistent with
the awesome graphics of the app itself I

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.130
the awesome graphics of the app itself I
 

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.280
the awesome graphics of the app itself I
think is you know a really simple but

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.290
think is you know a really simple but
 

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.519
think is you know a really simple but
important first step that you can take

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:26.529
 
 

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:29.260
 
interesting now unlike minimal shortcuts

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.270
interesting now unlike minimal shortcuts
 

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.420
interesting now unlike minimal shortcuts
Terra time is an app as well as a widget

Terra time is an app as well as a widget
 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.490
Terra time is an app as well as a widget
so it has the advantage of being able to

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.500
so it has the advantage of being able to
 

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.370
so it has the advantage of being able to
show this when you launch the app and

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:36.380
show this when you launch the app and
 

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.350
show this when you launch the app and
now this is a pretty stunning UI you've

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360
now this is a pretty stunning UI you've
 

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.320
now this is a pretty stunning UI you've
got the earth semi lit based on the

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.330
got the earth semi lit based on the
 

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.000
got the earth semi lit based on the
current time you've even got the the

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.010
current time you've even got the the
 

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.730

showing on the area that that is
 

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.690
showing on the area that that is
currently at night which is incredible

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:49.700
currently at night which is incredible
 

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.490

but we're not looking at apps today so

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.500
but we're not looking at apps today so
 

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.960
but we're not looking at apps today so
let's take a look at the widgets that

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:52.970
let's take a look at the widgets that
 

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.360
let's take a look at the widgets that
you can install so there are in fact two

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.370
you can install so there are in fact two
 

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.650
you can install so there are in fact two
of them and this is what they look like

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:56.660
of them and this is what they look like
 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.930
of them and this is what they look like
and they're both visually stunning

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:58.940
and they're both visually stunning
 

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.819
and they're both visually stunning
they're really good examples of the

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:00.829
they're really good examples of the
 

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:02.620
they're really good examples of the
power of a widget to really customize

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:02.630
power of a widget to really customize
 

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.000
power of a widget to really customize
your homescreen and make it something

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.010
your homescreen and make it something
 

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.490
your homescreen and make it something
that you really like to look at and I

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:06.500
that you really like to look at and I
 

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.350
that you really like to look at and I
think it's fair to say that both of

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360
think it's fair to say that both of
 

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.670
think it's fair to say that both of
these options are significant

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680
these options are significant
 

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.560
these options are significant
improvements over the default analog

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:11.570
improvements over the default analog
 

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.100
improvements over the default analog
clock widget I think yeah so Sterling's

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.110
clock widget I think yeah so Sterling's
 

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.630
clock widget I think yeah so Sterling's
biggest challenge here is really around

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:16.640
biggest challenge here is really around
 

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.970
biggest challenge here is really around
efficiency he's got this rich dynamic

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:18.980

content that needs to be regularly

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360
content that needs to be regularly
 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.180
content that needs to be regularly
updated and when you're building widgets

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.190
updated and when you're building widgets
 

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.769
updated and when you're building widgets
it's vital that you minimize the

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:23.779
it's vital that you minimize the
 

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:25.600
it's vital that you minimize the
required update frequency of them and

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:25.610
required update frequency of them and
 

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.100
required update frequency of them and
also minimize the amount of data that

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.110
also minimize the amount of data that
 

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.019
also minimize the amount of data that
you're regularly sending to your widget

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:29.029
you're regularly sending to your widget
 

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:30.790
you're regularly sending to your widget
so you'll note for example that there's

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800
so you'll note for example that there's
 

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.160
so you'll note for example that there's
no second hand on the display so at most

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.170
no second hand on the display so at most
 

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.930
no second hand on the display so at most
he's only going to need be a need to

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:34.940
he's only going to need be a need to
 

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.880
he's only going to need be a need to
update that widget every minute and

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:36.890
update that widget every minute and
 

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.410
update that widget every minute and
hopefully he's found ways to do it even
