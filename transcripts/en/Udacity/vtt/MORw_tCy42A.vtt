There are lots of different types of databases,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and we're going to focus on kind of the major ones.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We've got one type of databases that are called relational databases

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that often use a language called SQL to manipulate them,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and so we'll refer to these as relational databases or SQL databases.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Some examples of relational databases are postgreSQL,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which we use that in Reddit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We currently use that in Hipmunk, and lots of people use this.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It happens to be my favorite.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's MySQL, which is extremely popular,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and this is used by Facebook

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and basically everybody.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Not strictly everybody, but MySQL is far and away the most popular database,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and I'm sure you will encounter it in your web development adventures.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Also pretty common is SQLite, which you'll actually use in this class.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a really lightweight, simple database.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not for working on huge amounts of data, like postgreSQL and MySQL might be.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's generally better as a replacement for where you would normally use flat files

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but really handy, and of course, there's also Oracle,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is a huge company that sells the Oracle database product.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And incidentally, Oracle bought MySQL a number of years ago

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but has largely left it free and open.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
These are all free.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And these databases all basically work with tables.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They use a language called SQL to manipulate those tables,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and we're going to talk about that in this class a fair amount,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and in our general purpose, handy things.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There are other databases in the world.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Some examples might be Google App Engine's Datastore,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which is what we're going to be using a lot in this class,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and it's got a lot of similarities with these relational databases,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but also a lot of differences, and we'll spend a fair amount of time

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
talking about these differences.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Dynamo, which is by Amazon, and the reason I mention this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is because there is a great paper online that describes how this database works,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and I'll include it in the course notes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's worth a read.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's a really nice approach, and they take a completely different approach

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
from these SQL databases, and there's a lot to learn there.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's the NoSQL databases.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Of these, maybe Mongo is pretty popular.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Couch is pretty popular.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We're not going to discuss these much in this class,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but these are products that try to solve some of the limitations

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that SQL places on you that we'll get to in a moment.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But in this class, we're going to focus on kind of the basics of SQL

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and then Google App Engine's Datastore and how to use those

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to build your web apps.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Okay, quick quiz. Which database is the best?
