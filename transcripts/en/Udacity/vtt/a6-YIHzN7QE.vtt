Beyond showcasing your skills
through work experience and

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.050
your projects, LinkedIn also allows you
to list relevant coursework that you

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.550
have taken in the past.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.350
Again, for
those of you who are new to the field,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.340
adding new courses shows your commitment
to expanding your skill set and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.620
adds useful keywords to your profile.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.330
Creating content for
this area is pretty straightforward.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.150
Be sure to include only courses that
are relevant to your target profession.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.460
Additionally, you'll want
to note the course name and

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.620
organization you received it from.
