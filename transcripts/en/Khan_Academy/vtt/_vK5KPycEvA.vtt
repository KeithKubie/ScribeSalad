00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.330
- [Instructor] Here's a very
simplified model of an atom.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.080
The nucleus at the center of the atom

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.910
is where the protons and neutrons live,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.870
but they're kind of boring,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350
because for the most
part they just sit there.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.890
The real star of the show is the electron.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.360
The electron gets to do
all the interesting stuff,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.850
like move around, jump
around, bind with other atoms.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.090
These dashed lines represent
the different energy levels

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.840
the electron can have while in the atom.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.860
We like representing these energy levels

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.410
with an energy level diagram.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.970
The energy level diagram
gives us a way to show

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.310
what energy the electron
has without having to draw

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.380
an atom with a bunch of
circles all the time.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.820
Let's say our pretend atom
has electron energy levels

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.820
of zero eV, four eV, six eV, and seven eV.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.720
Note that moving left or right
on an energy level diagram

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.890
doesn't actually represent
anything meaningful,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.560
so technically there is no x-axis

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.690
on an energy level diagram,
but we draw it there anyway

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.830
because it makes it look nice.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.840
All that matters is what energy level

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.750
or rung on the ladder the electron is at.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.930
Note that the electron for
our hypothetical atom here

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.320
can only exist with zero
eV, four, six, or seven eV.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.100
The electron just cannot
exist between energy levels.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.340
It's always got to be right
on one of the energy levels.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.010
Okay, so let's say our electron

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.170
starts off on the zero eV energy level.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.350
It's good to note that
the lowest energy level

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.750
an electron can have in an atom
is called the ground state.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.300
So how could our electron
get from the ground state

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.320
to any of the higher energy levels?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.410
Well, for the electron to
get to a higher energy level,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.270
we've got to give the
electron more energy,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.500
and we know how to give
an electron more energy.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.440
You just shoot light at it.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.920
If a photon of the right
energy can strike an electron,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.690
the electron will absorb
all the photon's energy

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.810
and jump to a higher energy level.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.000
The electron in this
ground state needs four eV

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.280
to jump to the next energy level.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.600
That means if a photon that
had an energy of four eV

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.950
came in and struck the electron,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.830
the electron would absorb
the energy of the photon,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.300
causing the photon to disappear,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.880
and that electron would jump
up to the next energy level.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.060
We call the first energy
level after the ground state

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.310
the first excited state.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.620
Once the electron's at
the higher energy level,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.280
it won't stay there long.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.220
Electrons, if given the
chance, will fall towards

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.310
the lowest energy level they can.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.500
So our electron will fall
back down to the ground state

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160
and give up four eV of energy.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310
The way an electron can give up energy

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.320
is by emitting a photon.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.760
So after falling back
down to the ground state,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.330
this electron would emit a four eV photon.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.340
Electrons don't have to just jump

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.770
one energy level at a time though.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.610
If the electron in our ground state

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.300
were to absorb a six eV photon,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.210
the electron could jump all the way up

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.250
to the six eV energy level.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.620
Now that the electron's
at a higher energy level,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.810
it's gonna try to fall back
down, but there's a couple ways

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.350
it could fall back down in this case.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.950
The electron could fall
down to the ground state

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.540
all in one shot, giving up a
six eV photon in the process,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.150
but since the electron started
at the six eV energy level,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.830
it could've also fallen first
to the four eV energy level,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.340
emitting a two eV photon in the process.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.580
It's a two eV photon
because the electron dropped

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.770
two electron volts in energy,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.740
and now that the electron's
at the four eV energy level,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.990
it'll fall back down to the ground state,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.200
emitting a four eV photon in the process.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.990
So electrons will sometimes drop

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.220
multiple energy levels at a time,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.760
and sometimes they'll choose
to take individual steps,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.930
but regardless, the energy
of the photon is always equal

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.810
to the difference in
electron energy levels.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.640
What if our electron's in the ground state

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.270
and we send a five eV photon at it?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.870
If the electron were to absorb

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.730
all of the energy of the five eV photon,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.230
it would now have five electron volts,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.280
but that's not an allowed energy level,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.477
so the electron can't absorb this photon,

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:14.290
and the photon will pass
straight through the atom.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.970
Keep in mind, the electron in the atom

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.390
has to absorb all of the
photon's energy or none of it.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.380
It can't just absorb part of it.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.940
Alright, so now we could figure out

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.170
every possible photon
this atom could absorb.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.050
If the electron's in the ground state,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.460
it could absorb a four eV photon,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.180
or a six eV photon, or a seven eV photon.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.510
If the electron's at
the second energy level,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.850
also called the first excited state,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.470
the electron could absorb a two eV photon

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.680
or a three eV photon.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.170
And if the electron were
at the third energy level,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.420
or the second excited state,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.330
the electron could absorb a one eV photon.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.750
Those are the only photons that this atom

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.130
will be seen to absorb.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.650
2.5eV photons will pass straight through,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.410
five eV photons will
pass straight through,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.290
6.3eV photons will pas straight through.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.030
What this means is that
if you were to shine light

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.650
that consisted of all possible wavelengths

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.160
through a gas that was
composed of our pretend atoms,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.650
all the wavelengths would
not make it through.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.750
Some of the wavelengths
would get absorbed,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.700
then scattered away in random directions.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.820
This would manifest itself as
dark lines in the spectrum,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.550
missing wavelengths or
missing energy levels

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.440
that correspond to the energies of photons

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.270
that our electron can absorb.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.750
This is like a fingerprint for an atom,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.230
and it's called that
atom's absorption spectrum.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.110
If you were to ever see this
progression of dark lines

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.400
in these exact positions, you would know

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.730
that the gas you were
looking at was composed

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.670
at least partly of our hypothetical atom.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.960
This also allows astronomers to determine

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.120
what stuff in our universe is made out of,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.240
even though we can't get close
enough to collect a sample.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.870
All we have to do is collect light

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.810
from a distant star or quasar that shines

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.760
through the stuff we're interested in,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.690
then just determine which wavelengths

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.880
or energies got taken out.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.910
The details are a little
messier than that,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.380
but this provides astronomers

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.870
with maybe the most important
tool at their disposal.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.760
Now the absorption spectrum
are all of the wavelengths

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.090
or energies that an atom will absorb

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.270
from light that passes through it.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.600
You could also ask about
the emission spectrum.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.050
The emission spectrum are
all of the wavelengths

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.380
or energies that an atom will emit

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.810
due to electrons falling
down in energy levels.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.570
You could go through all the possibilities

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.470
of an electron falling down again,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.740
but you'd realize you're gonna get

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.600
the exact same energies
for the emission spectrum

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.250
that you got for the absorption spectrum.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.750
So instead of letting
light pass through a gas

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.040
composed of your hypothetical atoms,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.640
let's say you made a container

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.740
that had the gas of
your hypothetical atoms,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.700
and you ran an electric
current through it,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.370
exciting those electrons
to higher energy levels

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.770
and letting them fall back
down to lower energy levels.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.180
This is what happens in neon lights,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.360
or if you're in science
class it's what happens

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.640
in gas discharge tubes.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.800
So for the emission
spectrum, instead of seeing

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.250
the whole electromagnetic
spectrum with a few lines missing,

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.680
you're going to only
see a handful of lines

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.490
that correspond to the
energies of those photons

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.360
that that atom will emit.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.160
Okay I've gotta be honest about something.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.440
If any physicists are watching this video,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.510
they're cringing because the energies

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.690
that electrons will have in
an atom are not positive.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.840
The energies an electron
can have in an atom

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.180
are actually all negative values.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.020
This is because the
electron's bound to the atom.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.190
Anything that's bound to something else

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.790
will have total energies
that are negative.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.230
This is analogous to a ball
stuck at the bottom of a ditch.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.290
If the ball's not moving
it has no kinetic energy,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.180
and if we assume that ground level

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.960
is the H equals zero position,
then this ball's gonna have

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.630
a negative gravitational potential energy.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.860
Since this ball has a
negative total energy,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.190
it's stuck and bound to the ditch.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.500
If someone could give
this ball enough energy

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.640
so that it would have
positive total energy,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.110
the ball could leave the ditch.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.180
It would not be bound anymore.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.600
So to make our hypothetical
atom a little more realistic,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.290
let's subtract 10eV
from each energy level.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.670
This doesn't really change anything.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.210
In order for the electron to get

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.210
from the -10eV ground state to
the -6eV first excited state,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.810
it's still gonna take a four eV photon.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.530
People do get confused with
the negative signs though,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.730
so be careful.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.000
In order to find the energy of the photon

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.770
that was absorbed or emitted,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.470
you always take the higher energy level

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.670
and subtract from it
the lower energy level.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.610
So in this case, we would take -6eV,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.450
and subtract from it -10eV, which tells us

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.710
that it would take a four eV photon

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.660
to bump an electron up
to that energy level,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.540
and the electron would
emit a four eV photon

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.490
if it dropped back down from that level.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.260
Something else that's unrealistic

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.610
about our hypothetical
atom is that real atoms

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.400
wouldn't just stop at -3eV
for the highest energy level.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.240
Real atoms have energy
levels that get closer

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.780
and closer together as
you approach a zero eV.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.270
What happens when an electron
gets more than zero eV energy?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.940
Well if an electron has
more than zero energy,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.290
that means it's got positive energy.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.010
And if it's got positive energy,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.870
it's not bound to the atom anymore.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.890
It'll be free to leave, it'll be gone,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.270
and we'll say that we've ionized the atom

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.200
by removing an electron.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.510
So for example, say the electron started

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.510
at the -4eV energy level and
it absorbed a seven eV photon,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.010
that electron would have a total energy

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.003
of positive three eV, and so
it would be gone from the atom.

00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:55.724
(upbeat music)
