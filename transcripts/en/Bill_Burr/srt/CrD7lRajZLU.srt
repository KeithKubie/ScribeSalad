1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:09,400
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,010
ahhh

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,940
just checking in on you. I can't yell at,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,290
I am in New York City right now and
I'm, it's late. I forgot, you know,

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,660
today was Thursday and I had
to do the Po, the podcast,

7
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:27,280
so I apologize for it being
late. I, um, I dunno. I,

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,910
uh, I don't know. I wasn't thinking
the fuck do you want from me?

9
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,580
And all of a sudden I landed and I got a
bunch of tweets from people going to it

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,320
. I thought you were going to
check in on me. I was like, God,

11
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm letting people down. I'm letting you
down. So here I am. I'm checking into,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,950
so now you're gonna hear
it on Friday. Let's see.

13
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,600
Some lonely bastard on the west coast,
you know, still up or some lonely lay.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,660
Um, anyways,

15
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:54,400
so I just got here to New York because
I'm doing Foxwoods this weekend.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,790
And, um, since I left New York,

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,150
my neighborhood has become extremely gay.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,260
And I don't mean it in a way that
all the gay people don't like.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,640
When you say that neighborhood's gay,
like it stinks. I mean like literally gay.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,710
I mean, men are attracted to men.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,400
You know there's gay guys up and
down this trip and over each other.

22
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,670
And let me tell you thought.
Nobody's complaining honey. Right?

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,840
So here's the deal. When when
gaze move into your neighborhood,

24
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:29,530
there's three stereotypes
that everybody says. You know,

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,690
when gay people move into
the neighborhood, this is,

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,560
these are three things everybody says,
right? They say, number one, all right,

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,790
what are they saying? They
say the neighborhood's going
to become safer, right?

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,340
Number two, they say property values
that gotta to go up. And number three,

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,930
they say there's going to be all these
great new fucking restaurants and Holy

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,090
Shit, the cuisines going
to be fucking unbelievable.

31
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,160
Thank God the gay showed up.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,850
Now this neighborhood
can fuck in, you know,

33
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,350
live up to its potential.
Well, they showed up.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,580
Definitely got safer. Definitely
less shady. All right,

35
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:11,300
so check on the first one.
Stereotype number two.

36
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,280
Uh, the fuck did I say it was still
property value would go up? Yeah, it did.

37
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:19,220
But I miss New York. It
goes up everywhere, but you
know what? You know what?

38
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:23,540
It's election year. I don't want
to derail the podcast campaign.

39
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,670
I'll give you credit on
that one. Gay People,

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,580
it got safer and the property
values went up. And then lastly,

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,750
all this great cuisine was gonna
come here. And you know what?

42
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,280
It still hasn't shown up.

43
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,700
The food in my neighborhood absolutely
fucking sucks and I am so sick of it.

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,330
Okay. The goddammit,

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,770
I was told when these gay showed up
that the fucking food was going to get

46
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,560
better. And I think not only
is it not gotten better,

47
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,270
it's actually taken a nosedive.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,560
I just went out and got a Burrito. Right.

49
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:01,550
What kind of asshole leaves Angeles and
then tries to get a Burrito in New York.

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,200
You're listening to them, this
asshole. All right. The Brito was fine.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,400
Okay.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,670
Yeah. Chicken Burrito,
whatever. It's funny, you know,

53
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,630
I looked at the menu was all this
fucking shit. I just looked at the,

54
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:14,790
the waiter, I felt like I
disappointed them. I was like,

55
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:19,260
can I just get some chips
and with guacamole salsa
and like just like a chicken

56
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,140
burrito. And I just saw
it in his eyes like, oh,

57
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:25,560
you want white people Mexican
food? And I was like, exactly.

58
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,050
I am as white as it gets and I will
have my Mexican food is white as I am,

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,470
please. Right. Um, and before, you know,

60
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:40,410
Mexican people write in and tell me that's
not real Mexican food. I understand.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,900
I get it. All right, whatever.
This is what the fuck I wanted.

62
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,043
Here's my question.

63
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,100
How do you have all these gay people
walking up down the street and you can't

64
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,370
even make decent guacamole? How the
fuck does that happen? You know,

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,360
who do I blame in this
gay people slipping?

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,170
Is it because these are the millennial
gays and they're just Emoji in each

67
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,010
other? You know, I don't
know what's going on.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,920
Um, I'm blaming the gates. I'm
blaming you guys on this one. Alright.

69
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,500
Whatever pressure used to put
on a fucking neighborhood,

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,030
you're not doing it anymore. Or what?

71
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,180
You decided not to do it in my
neighborhood. I was so fucking,

72
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,090
you know the anticipation.

73
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,140
Okay.

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,360
Once you guys to send in on this one
straight shady fucking neighborhood,

75
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,040
you know, and the rainbow flags
came out and all this shit.

76
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,920
When the fuck is the food truck
getting here? That's what I want.

77
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,140
Enough fucking pizza sucks.
The fucking guacamole sucks.

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,130
The Middle Eastern food sucks the
whole fuck it. They just sucks.

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,780
Everything is just like, it's, yeah.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,420
How much I drank when
I'm in my neighborhood.

81
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,400
It's just so the fucking food
will tell. It's all like,

82
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,910
just get shit faced and didn't make
it fill up that hole in your stomach.

83
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,010
I don't know.

84
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,320
Maybe that's why I want all these gay
guys who are in such great shape around

85
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:02,340
here. They're cooking it on

86
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,600
a fuck. Nah, that pisses me off.

87
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:11,250
I just had a fucking God damn chicken
Burrito and Guacamole this late at night.

88
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,380
So at my age I, you know,

89
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,420
I'll probably have a heart attack around
eight 30 in the morning, you know?

90
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,340
At least it could have tasted good. Right?

91
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,320
Why is that fucking button
on it now? It's off. I want,

92
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,050
if you guys can hear this shit, f
whatever the fuck you going to do.

93
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,790
I don't know why the fuck I bring
my mixer and all that stuff.

94
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,640
God Damn and I'm in a grumpy mood
and I was in such a great mood.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,240
There's nothing worse than when you're
starving and you go out and you order a

96
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,800
fucking meal, right

97
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,810
in a neighborhood that's now a gay
neighborhood and it sucks. I mean,

98
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm talking literally like the two dudes
next to me at the end of their fucking

99
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:46,440
meal, right? They fucking like
kissed each other tenderly.

100
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,140
Can I at least get some
fucking decent guacamole?

101
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,450
How much care is it going to be around
here? It's only going at these burrito.

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,780
So I learned that stereotype
is a, is not true.

103
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,930
Just because they show up doesn't mean
the chefs are going to start fucking

104
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,960
throw in doubt that drop
in the fucking ball.

105
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm not going to lie to you
when the two went to kiss, okay,

106
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,960
is as open minded as
I am. I have to admit,

107
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,020
I was wearing a baseball cap and I
tilted it down so I didn't see their lips

108
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:19,910
meet. You know, does that make me
a bad person? If you're judging me,

109
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,770
can I just tell you that
one of them look like that,

110
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:25,130
that fucking scrawny little
dude that J-lo married.

111
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,710
Just imagine that Guy
Kissing Lenny Kravitz.

112
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,060
You know, forgive me, I didn't
want to see it. You know,

113
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,680
maybe that makes me a
bad person, but whatever.

114
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:41,630
I am a work in progress
just like everybody else and
I will have a decent bowl

115
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:46,310
of fucking guacamole. You sons of
bitches. All right, let's plow ahead here.

116
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,144
So, um,

117
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,980
I flew out this morning and I actually
have this app on my phone where I can

118
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,940
listen to the control tower and I'm
just totally nerd now. You know,

119
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,200
every time he had the tower
talking about our plane of Sydney,

120
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,240
he's talking about us.

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,910
He just told us to go into this little
fucking taxiway or whatever, you know?

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,620
And, um, so I'm flying up front, right?

123
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,500
Cause at this point I, I spent 20
years in the back of the plane.

124
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:16,180
I'm not flying. I'm not fucking, I'm
not doing that anymore. I'm done.

125
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,720
I don't give a shit if I
lose money on the gigs,

126
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm flying up front and for
all you guys, for 20 years,

127
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,380
I sat in the back of the plane looking
what goes on on the other side of that

128
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,470
curtain. What happens up
there? What is that like?

129
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,210
You know what happens up there? People,
spoiler alert. You know what happens?

130
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,200
They treat you like a human
being. I sweat. They do.

131
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,770
They treat you the way they treat
everybody in the commercials about their

132
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:43,040
airline. Right? Everybody's smiling,
having a good fucking time. You know,

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,070
you got a seat that's
actually comfortable. There's
nobody leaning on you.

134
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,940
Nobody breathing on you. You're hungry.
They bring you food, you're thirsty,

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,840
they bring you a drink. They
treat you like a fucking person.

136
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,360
It's posted in the back. Righteous
jamming in there, stuffing in there.

137
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,900
Right? So anyways,

138
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,850
two I board first because you know
I'm a fancy fucking guy, right?

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,460
So I fucking I board, right?
I can't say fancy guy.

140
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,190
Jim Norton says that fancy man. I'm a,

141
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,470
I don't know what I am the fucking
jerk off, right. So I get on,

142
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,000
I get on a plane, right?

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,800
And I'm this fucking lady behind me.

144
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,380
All right. The second she gets to a chair,
she just starts yelling on sir, sir,

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,620
stare. You know,

146
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,310
did she yelling at this foot that the
fucking male stewardess and he turns

147
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,110
around, he's like, Hey,
what's the problem?

148
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,350
And because there's something wrong
with my chair that on, is this broken?

149
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:46,400
Is it broken? Like freaking the
fuck out. And the guy's like, no.

150
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,440
The other person just, you know,

151
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,860
whoever was sat in this on the last
flight didn't bring in all the way to the

152
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:56,070
upright position. Oh. Because I
thought it was broken, you know?

153
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:00,370
And right there I immediately just
fucking hated this woman fucking,

154
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,030
and she had this,

155
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,930
the sniffles just kept sniffing and
shit didn't give a fuck about anybody.

156
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,100
And just, I swear to God,

157
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,910
this shit that I thought about her because
she sat up in the front of the plane,

158
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,700
I immediately judged and that she was
some rich company while I'm sitting up

159
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:13,534
there. Right.

160
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:15,820
Okay.

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,440
I don't know what she was thinking about
me was Baldwin head. Fuck. You know,

162
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,860
he used his miles to get up here.

163
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,743
Um,

164
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,740
okay.

165
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,100
Anyways, thought Jesus, I'm, I can,

166
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,370
I apologize early for the fucking
horrible fucking mood I'm in right now.

167
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,580
I was in such a great fucking mood,
you know, and I was actually, you know,

168
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:37,340
walking down the street here
in Manhattan and just laughing,

169
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:41,090
looking at these people, so excited
that I left this fucking place.

170
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,530
People in their 20s look,
okay? All right. In Manhattan,

171
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,830
they just got here. It's still
exciting. Okay. But see this, this,

172
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:53,120
this city beats the fuck out of you.
All right? I've always said, you know,

173
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,740
if you can do it, if you have a desire
to do it, at some point you life,

174
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,730
you gotta come here and
live here just to do it.

175
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,900
Cause it really is one of the most
amazing cities you're ever gonna, uh,

176
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,300
live in. But you know,

177
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,270
what else is amazing about after you
let you owe it to yourself, to Olivia,

178
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:12,020
and you also owe it to yourself
at some point to fucking leave.

179
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,210
I swear to God, Dude,

180
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,760
the amount of people that you see
walking down the street that looked like

181
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,623
shut-ins,

182
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,290
that finally just fucking came out
of the Cave of a God damn apartment.

183
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,210
Jesus Christ. I fucking walked into my
building and this lady standing there,

184
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,460
she looks like one of the
patients on shutter island.

185
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,160
Fucking dark circles under her eyes.

186
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,020
Her hat yanked down like one of those
people that's like ageless. It's like,

187
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:39,260
are you 70 or 26 I don't
even know what you just,

188
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,120
your skin is gray, right? And she's with
this older dude kind of look like me.

189
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
To be honest with you, I'm
a little chunkier, you know,

190
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,640
probably a lot more jollier. He's
probably not pitching about the Guacamole,

191
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,640
right? And I'm fucking like, hey,
excuse me. As I go, hey, how are you?

192
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,010
Excuse me. As I got to walk by,

193
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:58,340
and she does like this weird like
[inaudible] to get out of the fucking way.

194
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,610
Like, oh my God, another human
big. And then as I go to walk away,

195
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,020
she starts singing in this
beautiful voice as she walked up.

196
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:09,140
She is an amazing,
beautiful fucking voice.

197
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,400
Okay.

198
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,020
I said, so what? What happened
to you? Jesus fucking Christ.

199
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,040
What's like the way she looked and then
the sound that came out of it was like

200
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,670
haunting. Then I felt like I was
in one of those horror movies.

201
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,790
You know that now I'm in and now I
can't get out. You know what I mean?

202
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,930
She's actually a vampire is gonna
come by later to feed, you know?

203
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,490
Then I become her boyfriend forever
cause we're both vampires until she gets

204
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:39,440
sick of me and finds up fucking, I
don't know, a younger version of me.

205
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,870
That doesn't happen. Right.

206
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:44,420
The fucking red headed male
is never a love interest.

207
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,890
That doesn't happen in movies, you know?

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,470
Do you hear us bitching about
it or we boycott in anything?

209
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:54,550
I don't think so. We just trudge on

210
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,180
trying to stay out of the sun.

211
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,540
That's what it feel like when it
come to New York. Everybody here,

212
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,570
did she just go, can you get some
sun in your fucking face? Something?

213
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,470
What's that vitamin you get when the,
when the sun shines on you? It's,

214
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,380
it was fuck it. Things that everybody
just says in a bar. Oh yeah, vitamin D,

215
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,700
Sun's gone for your vitamin
E, you know, not too much,

216
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,460
but you know it's good for you. You know
what they say? You know what they say?

217
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,280
It raises your levels of, Oh, is that
what they say? Say what they say.

218
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,180
They're a guy with his fucking name
on his shirt. What do you do? Well,

219
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,960
what do you for you fucking on
clog during the course of the day.

220
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:33,650
What are you talking medical here for me?
For me or to me? Why are you doing it?

221
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,470
All right. You fucking plumber.

222
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,850
I say that with extreme prejudice.
You know, that's the one trade.

223
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:45,800
I don't respect the plumbing. You know,

224
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,920
cause I go to home depot and I swear
to God, I can almost figure it out.

225
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,510
Electrical. That's like wizardry. You're
a fucking wizard, right? Plumbing.

226
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,660
[inaudible] I mean he just opened the
door so everything's right there in the

227
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:59,330
sink. You know, once it goes in
the wall, then I give it to you.

228
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,830
You know what I mean? Then
you're a closer. All right?

229
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,270
But if you just find a way to
hit it with a wrench, he on Dick,

230
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:12,200
shut off the main fucking
water and yeah. Yeah.

231
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,080
Fucking he, I don't know. Until you're
young, screw it. Right. If you can,

232
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,610
you can fucking open and close.

233
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,670
Or You could take the lid off a jar if
you can remember what the thing is that's

234
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,860
on top of a jar. Right? You're smart
enough to be a fucking plumber.

235
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,590
I just don't respect that trait.
You know? Look, they they,

236
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:37,920
they really are. They're like welders
or this shit electricians or the shit.

237
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,220
People get fabricate stuff.
People who build hot rods, those,

238
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,160
that's the upper echelon. Those
are the one they have like the,

239
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:48,750
I work with my hand awards, my hands,
I should say. They're not jerking off.

240
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:52,200
I worked with my hands when
they have those awards. Right.

241
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,030
They've got to have those at some
point. The welders, right, or some shit,

242
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,590
whatever the fuck it is. You know?

243
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,110
Those are the people that bring
home the fucking hardware.

244
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,900
Nobody gives it to a plumber. Plumber.
Yeah. Once you go on clog something,

245
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,370
what trade did you really
want to be good at? Huh?

246
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,690
It's funny right now,

247
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,900
there's a plumber out there that's
actually getting upset by this

248
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,820
and someone will present it on another
website is if I was fucking serious.

249
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,150
Hang on, I'm trying to get
through my fucking password here.

250
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,260
Plumber Jesus Christ. I mean,
the whole fucking state.

251
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,110
It doesn't even sound perspectival
does it? Um, oh my God, dude.

252
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:38,930
The other night I fucking met law head
for a drink. Okay. I was just like,

253
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,870
dude, I am trying not to booze, but
I, I gotta I gotta have a couple,

254
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,300
two or three, right? So he
goes, all right. He goes,
you know, I'm doing a spot.

255
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,230
I'll meet you over at this bar.

256
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:48,170
So we go to the bar and sit in there
with shooting the shit with have a great

257
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:52,700
time. And uh, this the plumber
thing, this is what reminded me.

258
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,660
So this big guy comes in. By
big, I mean fat, all right?

259
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,460
Big Mother and hips to puts it
on like Oprah thighs and ass.

260
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,880
And then he also puts it on like a dude
and he puts it on like a chick and a

261
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:09,410
dude. This was just a fat man
and you know, he, he was obese,

262
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,220
but he wasn't even biggest loser
fat. He just was, he was just tall.

263
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,870
He was a mountain of a fucking man.
So he sits down at the bar store

264
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,510
just off the off of the, you
know, La head's right shoulder.

265
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,170
It's a really not a well lit bar.

266
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,630
And I'm just sitting there and I'm looking

267
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,140
and he's got this weird design
on his pants and I'm just like,

268
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,000
what the fuck is that? That's weird.

269
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,390
Is that a new style at genius on those
big dazzled jeans that everybody was

270
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,720
wearing like 10 15 years ago?

271
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,010
It looked like he had a horseshoe
on, on your pockets. You know,

272
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,780
the big thing was to have
the stitching like that.

273
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,300
The blue jeans were blue and then
you had the, it was all white.

274
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,090
I never bought those. I'm so
fucking glad I never bought those.

275
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,600
There's not one picture of me in those.
There's already pictures of me and Z.

276
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,530
Cavariccis okay. I don't need
it. I don't need to, you know,

277
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,880
jump on that trend
either, you know? So, um,

278
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,270
I'm sitting there going, what is
that design? It looked like, like,

279
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,990
like almost like he ordered custom pants
and they just didn't put this design

280
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,480
right and I looked a little closer,

281
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:21,200
my eyes adjusted and I realized
it was his hairy ass crack.

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,500
I couldn't fucking believe
it. This guy sat down,

283
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,300
he was so big, dude, I am telling you
there was the top of his ass crack.

284
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:35,990
He was so fat. It was like twice
the size of my whole ass crack.

285
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,870
That's why I didn't take it was
that, and it was fucking Harry,

286
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,790
I apologize for putting this image in you,

287
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,920
but it was hairy so it looked
like it was a design and it,

288
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,290
I just can't fucking in Lawhead what was
caught my eyes when I realized what I

289
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,460
was looking at and he was
like, dude, what the fuck?

290
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,070
And when I told him
what had just happened,

291
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:59,530
I don't think I've ever
made law laugh like that.

292
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,720
He was fucking howling
in this bar to the point.

293
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:08,370
I think even the guy looked
over at us. Oh my God.

294
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,270
Well I kept saying that. I said that
you could measure I was going to do it.

295
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,830
How can that be? How could
they be more ass crack

296
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,260
like this weird like when you lose weight
you like if you become a fat fuck you

297
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,160
have a giant, so you have this,
I never thought about this.

298
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:31,330
You have this giant fucking ass
crack. So when you lose the weight,

299
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,220
like the crack goes away too,
right. That doesn't seem,

300
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,500
money doesn't make sense to me.

301
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,390
Cause it seems like it's a hole in
your body kind of. You know, I don't,

302
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,250
I don't know where I was trying
to figure it out and I was,

303
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,340
I was riffing about this dog discussing
this was a the fuck did I say?

304
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,700
I was saying,

305
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,530
you remember that home run Mark McGuire
hitting the kingdom off to Randy

306
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,550
Johnson, I would say.

307
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,910
And you could measure that home run with
the amount of ass crack this guy had

308
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,130
coming out of the top of his
pants. And that was just his,

309
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,050
that was just as plumber
crack. Oh, Jesus Christ.

310
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,950
What a fucking image they'd gone air
already ate before I did this. Huh? Um,

311
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,630
all right, let's, uh, I, Oh God,

312
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,880

videos that just fucking see,

314
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:23,700
like you must have done that
before, right. You know,
when you look and say, Oh,

315
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,710
what is that? And then you realize
you don't know. I don't know,

316
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:29,190
pretty much gross things
in your head. Oh God,

317
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,490

323
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:56,220
if I'm going to tell you that I'm going

326
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,790

327
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,640
they're all like fucking 15
years apart. Like every 15 years.

328

being. All right, here we go.

330
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:19,140

Oh Shit. Here we go. Club Debby club,

331
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:24,120
Gabby folk for Kim clip. Debbie.
Um, if you're anything like me,

332
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,780
then you know exactly what you
like and how you like it. Well,

333
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,260
don't fucking talk shit for
me. If you're anything like me,

334
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:34,260
you question everything you do. And then
the next day, like, why did I say that?

335
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,910
All right. If you're anything like
the people that they think that I am,

336
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,860
you know what you like
and how you like it,

337
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:45,360
except when you're in the wine
aisle, tannins and to Terry,

338
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:47,670
our hours mean nothing to you.
I know what the fuck those,

339
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,510
and those are types of wine, I guess.
Unless you happen to be a fancy pants,

340
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:56,160
professional sommelier, you know,

341
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,100
there's no reason to shit on people
in wine just because you know,

342
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,690
they know something that you
don't, right. It's not wizardry.

343
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,350
They may can booze that just into
it. You know what I mean? It's like,

344
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:10,620
listen to somebody who's into star
wars. Really talk about star wars.

345
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,890
That's like, yeah, I saw it
once. What are you talking about?

346
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,260

the fucking little,

348
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,480
what are those little chihuahuas?

349
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,240
I still remember that my brother collected
the action figures. Such a jealous,

350
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,370

society looking fuckers. Right?

I got up early and I went
into the bathroom and take
a shower and I looked down

426
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:51,420
and what looked to be a brown wash cloth,
you know, that was all twisted up. Uh,

427
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
the bottom of the shower. I
think, you know, what's his going,

428
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,520
I reached down to pick it
up and if somebody had,

429
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,230
one of my roommates
had shit in the shower,

430
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,443
I never got over that.

431
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,860
I woke them all up. They
were all awoken by who?

432
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:10,820
Shit in the shower.

433
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,870
And they were laughing because I'd have
think laughing because it was hilarious.

434
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:18,320
And then also I started laughing
because it'd be literation later. I did,

435
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,921
but like,

436
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:23,921
I literally could not eat with that hand
for like fucking a month and thinking

437
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,740
now I actually, I don't remember
what she had. It was, I mean,

438
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,500
it's fucking disgusting. It's the
processing. That's the study. It's funny.

439
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,430
Is it, do you know what, if you laugh at
that right now, you're a sick fuck. Um,

440
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,660
and who am I if I told you
about it? Right? So anyways,

441
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:40,460
I was on the plane and, um,

442
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,160
I started watch this space
movie and um, you know,

443
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,400
it's just another one of those space
movies where it's just like, you know,

444
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,560
everybody dies or people leave.

445
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,440
There's always just like the
one person left out in space,

446
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,900
how are they going to survive?
And I started to watch it.

447
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,510
It's like I already saw this
fucking movie two years ago.

448
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,820
Sandra Bullock did this
movie, right? She could go,

449
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,330
I left alone when Richard Gere fucking
floated off into sweat. I would,

450
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,820
his fucking guy's name is the guy with
the motorcycles, right. Married the lady,

451
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,320
finally guy from oceans 11th one of
those guys. He has so much charisma.

452
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:18,050
All he has to do is just say
the fucking line. You know,

453
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,400
he doesn't have to throw in its dirty
mustard on it. That guy, George Clooney,

454
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,690
George Clooney, he just says the
fucking line and yet believe him.

455
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,980
Right? Fucking guys fearless.
You'd see him in that movie.

456
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,860
He didn't give a fuck. Yeah, I'm
just going to float out into space.

457
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:37,910
He's still cracking jokes and shit. Just
going to go over here and suffocate.

458
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,130
Take it easy sandy. Right. That's
it man. That's all man goes out.

459
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,040
I bet once she floated out of her
fucking ear shot, he started crying.

460
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,903
Woo.

461
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,380
I just sit there fucking
floating around. Um,

462
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,220
you gotta love Scifi. You know
I gotta love cy Fi. You know,

463
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,170
I said I hate watching real shit about
space cause all they do is just tell you

464
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:14,030
how infinite it is and how insignificant
we are. It's like I get it. I got it.

465
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,860
Do you have anything else?

466
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,780
Have you filed one fucking living
thing out there. You have it.

467
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,530
So there's really nothing to report
other than it's so fucking immense and we

468
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,350
still don't have the technology
to meet anybody. That's why you,

469
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:34,160
if you really want to see something about
space, you got to watch his psi movie,

470
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,960
you know, say what you want a
bottom at least a fine shit.

471
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,660
You know there's car chases and
people, you know, hot chick aliens,

472
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,470
right? Space bars and stuff like that.

473
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,990
You plucking put on of Bravo shows with
that black guy there who fucking knows

474
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:58,100
everything. What's his name? He's like,
he's like the guy from the matrix.

475
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,140
Laurence Fishburne, except for
just Fishburne. Fishburn whatever.

476
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,770
He's like that guy, except he's
real. The Lawrence is real.

477
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:10,070
I'm talking about his character.
I fucking watched that guy.

478
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:13,400
I've watched that guy like
three times and I, I just was,

479
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,120
he had me believing that we came from
the trees. I'm like, this guy is. Yeah,

480
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,960
we, and I was like, I thought
we came from the ocean of mud.

481
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,270
I was going with that and this guy's
like, no, we're from the trees.

482
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,980
We got the same fucking,
I don't know what he said,

483
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,970
but I mean there was nothing between my
ears that could argue with anything that

484
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,530
he said. You just have
to fucking listen to it.

485
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:35,510
I remember just sitting there
watching the guy just going like,

486
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,910
this has gotta be what it's
like when you join a cult.

487
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,410
Like how dumb I feel right now.
That's what you have to do.

488
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:45,140
Like I was reading this, this
fucking thing. Who's kidding who?

489
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,060
I was browsing it. I don't
really read anything.

490
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,310
We saw this picture and I just put words
to it in my brain and now I'm telling

491
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:56,510
it to you. There's some
fucking guy I know.

492
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:00,140
He had like 80 wives, one of those
fucking Weirdos out in fucking Utah.

493
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,400
You know what I mean? I, I'll
either that or he's just like,

494
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,740
how can rappers don't
talk about those guys?

495
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,200
They're always talking about fucking
pimps. How can a guy, that's key.

496
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:11,120
The guy's got 80 fucking women.

497
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,430
They all know about each other and they're
all smiling in the fucking picture.

498
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,870
Huh?

499
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,890
I want to see somebody else pull that
off and not live in the middle of fucking

500
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,050
Utah. I don't know what
the fuck it is about Utah,

501
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,830
but you could talk a woman
into anything out there.

502
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,060
You're the a one for me. Hi. Yeah,

503
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,710
you are no 79 other bitches. Okay,

504
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,120
but go make me some butter bitch. Um,

505
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,940
this guy's in prison and he's
still running that. This harem.

506
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,720
Okay.

507
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,590
They don't know any better.

508
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:51,990
You know when you're walking around with
a little house in the prairie clothes,

509
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:55,140
I mean, you can fucking tell
people anything. That's the key.

510
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,890
You know what I mean? They feel
like if you want to start a cult,

511
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,500
it's very difficult to start
it with people that have
gone to a department store

512
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:07,230
and bought their clothes,
you know? But if you,

513
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,800
if there's a group of people that are
standing there and clothes that they made

514
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:14,400
themselves, you get, that's where
you start. You know what I mean?

515
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,460
It's like when you've got
a shit team, all right?

516
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:21,210
And you got the number one
draft, pick the t, the guy,

517
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:23,310
the person you're going to
build your fucking team around.

518
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:25,980
That franchise player.
When it comes to cult,

519
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,150
those still the franchise tag is on all
those people with those little house in

520
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,990
the prairie clothes, those
Quaker clothes, right? The QC.

521
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:35,990
Okay.

522
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,180
You know, you ever think about start? I'd
started cult. I would do it, you know,

523
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,200
I would definitely start it
fucking called, but then I,

524
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:45,710
after a while I wouldn't want to do
the work and I would just, I'd Sorta,

525
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,870
I'd start like a, what do you call that?

526
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:50,270
When you fucking don't want to do
your job and you have other people do

527
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,560
delegating. I'd start delegating all
the fucking things and then granted,

528
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,120
one point some people
going to be like, whoa,

529
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,360
hey shea was [inaudible] how
come he's not doing anything?

530
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,740
I don't remember reading anything
about Jesus being being lazy.

531
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,790
Let he just sits around
and fucks everybody.

532
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,963
Yeah,

533
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,950
I'm going to check it as man shit.

534
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,890
Maybe I'm Jesus. Right?
And then he takes over.

535
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,830
Then all of a sudden they all
show up one day. You know,

536
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:25,130
is there anything scarier than angry,

537
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:28,760
stupid people standing in close
that they made themselves?

538
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,380
Just picture what that would look like.

539
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:36,050
You know the amount of Mano Browse
staring back at you and you just have to

540
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:39,800
relinquish your power and just at some
point ease your way out the back door and

541
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,480
let them know that you're
not the son of God.

542
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,800
There's a fucking afternoon
for you, Huh? Jesus Christ.

543
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,020
How many dead bolts would you
have on your bedroom door?

544
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,580
I'm speaking of which, by the way,

545
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,430
I got all the fucking interior
door locks fixed on my house.

546
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,320
They all have fucking skeleton keys.

547
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,240
And then I found this fucking person on
the Internet on the interweb as Richard

548
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,670
Rollins says, from fast and
loud. Uh, another great show. Um,

549
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,980
I got some of that's gonna
line it up with the door jam.

550
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,400
You know the little fucking latch thing,
Dan. And I'm going to be good to go.

551
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,730
It's going to be, fuck. I can't
wait. Very excited about that.

552
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,510
And speaking of great shows, I'm
finally caught up with better call Saul.

553
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,590
I feel like such a, not only a
bad fan considering, you know,

554
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:28,790
Vince hooked me up to be in, I'll
have a small part in breaking bad.

555
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,290
I should've been watching right along.

556
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:34,460
But what happened was those of you
who listened to the podcast last year,

557
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,200
I fucking was taping the thing.

558
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,950
For some reason I didn't get episode
three and then I suck computers and the

559
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,020
Internet. I couldn't figure out
where else I could watch it.

560
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,030
So I've been stuck on episode two.

561
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:49,150
So finally they came on Netflix right
before season two started and I just binge

562
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:54,410
watched the entire first season
and it was fucking unbelievable.

563
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,730
Whose fucking amazing
starts. It just, it's,

564
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't want to ruin anything for you,
but I gotta tell you something like a,

565
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,350
the level of acting that everybody's
doing, but like Bob old Kirk man,

566
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,850
you know, it's very rare that someone
is, is as great a comic as he is,

567
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,260
is equally as great a
fucking actor. He was,

568
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,500
I want you guys to watch it
just cause you got to see,

569
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,520
he has this blow out fight. I can't
ruin this for you with a relative.

570
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,250
Any now you just say
mean shit to each other.

571
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,250
His brother says something to him.

572
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:35,480
I've been thinking about that line
for like the last five fucking days.

573
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,050
It was just, I dunno,
it's one of those lines.

574
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,283
Okay.

575
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,560
That in real life usually gets set around
the holidays after you've been sitting

576
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:47,800
on something for 20 fucking
years, and when it comes out,

577
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,050
it's needle off the fucking record and
the relationship is over. It's just like,

578
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:57,910
yeah, dude, I'll see you when you're
on your deathbed or I'm on my deathbed,

579
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,530
or maybe never again. I mean, it's,
it's a fucking rap. It's over.

580
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,610
Um, oh man. The writing was just,

581
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:11,480
it was just fucking outstanding and I'm
can't say enough good things about it

582
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,940
and I am totally caught up and, uh,

583
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:16,340
I can't wait for next week's
fucking episode. There you go.

584
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,690
There's my little plug there for
better call Saul. Um, and with that,

585
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,170
that's it for this, uh, checking
in on your podcast. Once again,

586
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:26,750
I apologize for a few, you know,

587
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,980
for not doing the podcast
on t t on timely fashion,

588
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,670
a timely fashion over the fuck you said.
I realized that I brought up that app.

589
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,270
Sorry about the shit in the shower
story. The ass crack one was funny.

590
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,880
I don't give a fuck
who you are by the way.

591
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,620
That app is three 99 that I,

592
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,100
if you want to listen to the
towers anywhere where you're at,

593
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:50,390
it's called live t c. Dot. Net app.

594
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,380
Just do that ATC air traffic control. Um,

595
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,521
and it's really cool.

596
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:58,220
Like I just thought you could listen
to the towers and near you but you can

597
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,270
actually, um,

598
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,950
I was at lax today and
I was listening to uh,

599
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,630
Logan Airport in Boston and
it's really cool cause you, you,

600
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,020
you're basically like, I'll click on
California. They got Burbank, Cambra,

601
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,570
Rio Concorde, any place in El
Monte, any place you want to go to.

602
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,800
And when you click on it
as I'm doing right now,

603
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,090
okay, this one has ground and
tower and then you click on that.

604
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,900
Um, and then there's,

605
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:31,190
what's really cool is they have
like a diagram of the airport.

606
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,360
So like you can actually, you know, I
like to listen to it when, whatever,

607
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:39,630
whatever airport I'm at, as
we're taxing out to the, um,

608
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,230
to whatever the fucking runway,
Jesus Christ bells, you know,

609
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,050
you'd think you'd know that,
um, go out to the runway.

610
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:50,670
I just like listening to it and it's
fucking coolest shit. And I'm, you know,

611
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,360
watching the, um,

612
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,520
Jason Spill all the taxiways going by,
sorry, I'm trying to multitask here.

613
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,690
Answering a text message on, I apologize.
Let me just put the fucking phone,

614
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:05,520
don't see that, see that, pick it up.

615
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,920
And all of a sudden I thumb just
starts clicking on other stuff.

616
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm gonna Start fucking looking at Twitter
and when I'm trying to do a podcast

617
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,520
here anyway, she get the whole layout
of the airport and as you go on down,

618
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,440
he could tell what taxiway
you're on. And then, uh,

619
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,080
hey, last way, right? So Charlie,

620
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,910
there you go. See that? You
just listened to that shit.

621
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,120
So that guy just obviously was cleared
to land and that was the runway.

622
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,980
And he said his tail number, that's it.

623
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,860
So I just listened to that shit because a,

624
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,030
that's one of the hard things when
you first get a pilot's license,

625
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,280
when you get up there, it all
just sounds like, hey, I want to

626
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,400
join a damn way. I'm gonna [inaudible]
they don't even have southern accents,

627
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,650
but that's what the fuck
it sounds like to me. Um,

628
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,170
you know what's funny is when
this shit happens, when I, uh,

629
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,520
when I'm just like walking around, like
I'll accidentally set a pocket dialing,

630
00:36:56,521 --> 00:37:00,630
I'll hit this fucking app.
And uh, if you're in the mob,

631
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,280
do not get this fucking app because
they'll think it's a bunch of fucking feds

632
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,960
in a, in a van down the street.

633
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,860
You know,

634
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,090
if you fucking sitting there in a mob
meeting and all of a sudden you got this

635
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:19,500
fucking thing going and you're talking
about some bullshit and out of nowhere

636
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,260
this thing comes on. Come on. Just
do it one time. One more time for me.

637
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,560
Come on. This is Lex. Oh,

638
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:28,150
it's a quiet night out there.

639
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,610
Okay.

640
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,061
You know what I mean?

641
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:32,940
All of a sudden you just hear some
fucking guys voice in there talking some

642
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,470
official

643
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,900
seven 51 cross from way too
far left. [inaudible] ground.

644
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,090
Hey, what a fuck out there.
Fucking next. You know that the,

645
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,600
I can get tongue through your
throat. Um, all right, sorry.

646
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,660
That was a long way to go. Why, where
to go? Who uses a prop and a podcast?

647
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,920
All freckles does. Hey, go
fuck yourselves. You can't.

648
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,900
So I hope you have a great weekend
and a, his little music from Andrew,

649
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:52,600
Sam Willis,

650
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,600
a little throwback podcast from
a Monday or Thursday gone by

651
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,333
[inaudible] [inaudible]

652
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,770
you know, a few weeks ago
somebody was asking me, you know,

653
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,870
they wanted to break up with
somebody and I was saying, listen,

654
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:41,770
you gotta listen. You know,

655
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:46,830
the person who has it down how to do
the breakup was minivan men podcast,

656
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,370
own celebrity star Al Madrigal.

657
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,550
But if you don't have
time to email Al Madrigal

658
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,380
just listened to ll cool j a big old, but

659
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,950
I don't know why. I never really
listened to him when I was growing up.

660
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,600
You know, Mama said knock you out.
Did she? Is that what she said?

661
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:13,150
Ll Cool J I don't care. You know,

662
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:17,530
I just wasn't into witness deodorant
in his armpits when he was jamming with

663
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:21,520
those white guys. I just, I
never got into it. But lately,

664
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,200
lately, I dunno. I don't know
what happened. I G's just come

665
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,770
onto my youtube shit. I
don't know what it is,

666
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:32,710
but I was listening to some
of his stuff. Oh, I know why.

667
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,240
Yesterday I was trying to remember like,

668
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,300
what was that song he used to have that
I'm the type of guy and you're the type

669
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,340
of guy you put that,
what the fuck was that?

670
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,020
And then I listened to it and I kind of
liked it, but I hated that. Oh, we, oh,

671
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,510
part of it really
annoyed me. I'm like, oh,

672
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,160
that's why I never downloaded this shit.

673
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,790
But then on the side they
had a ll cool j big old,

674
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,620
but you know, I played drums at
Michael. Let me hear what this tracks.

675
00:39:58,621 --> 00:39:59,860
I was like, can I put it on?

676
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,890
And he basically teaches you how to break
up with a girl and that song or that

677
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:09,910
rap or that, uh, that rhyme, whatever,
however you supposed to say it.

678
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,590
He breaks it down and just
in like fucking 11 seconds,

679
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,990
he sits his girls down.

680
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,640
He's basically hanging out and like some
sunglass hut or some shit and some girl

681
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:26,641
comes in with an insane ass and
he does whatever he guy does.

682
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,130
He stares out and he thinks, I
want to fuck that. But Oh shit.

683
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:35,110
I have a girlfriend. So what does
he do? Does he sneak around on her?

684
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,620
No, he goes home and he sits
her down. He says, listen,

685
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,650
I met this girl named Tina.
Okay. Teen has got a big old,

686
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,620
but I know that I said I'd be true.

687
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,190
I'm really whiten this up.
But Tina got a big old butt,

688
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,970
so I'm leaving you. It's, I mean,
that's just fucking air tight.

689
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,070
He can't fuck with that. He was 100%
I don't know. She could get mad.

690
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,350
I think that's that.

691
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:10,351
I think women's show expect guys to be
lying weasely pieces of shit that if you

692
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,770
actually hit them with
that level of honesty,

693
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,530
I think they would just be stunned.
Just like the chicken, the video.

694
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:22,240
Like I didn't think that
that was bad acting.

695
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:25,180
I think that they would absolutely be
stunned if you just came home and said,

696
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:28,450
listen, I met this girl.

697
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,290
I know that I said I'd be faithful to
you, but she's better looking than you.

698
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,770
So I'm up with you.

699
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,520
Well, what is the combat? There's nothing.

700
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,950
There'll be like if your girl came home
and said, listen, I know we're together,

701
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:49,220
but this guy, you know,
I met him at the mall,

702
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:52,280
his Dick is twice the size of
yours and he's got a better car.

703
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,010
So it's kind of a no brainer. Amati

704
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,800
what are you going to do?

705
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
What are you going to do with your little
dick and your fucking Domino's pizza?

706
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,350
It's over. You just gotta fucking be
like, you know, you only go around once.

707
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,220
So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it.

708
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,010
So anyway, so if you don't
have time to email Al Madrigal,

709
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:19,240
which you should, which you should, uh,

710
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,370
just listen to a ll cool j big old bud.

711
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,120
You got to see his face. He
goes, so I'm leaving you. It's,

712
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,690
it's, I don't, can't explain it.
It's way meaner than it has to be.

713
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:37,160
That's what it makes it funny.

714
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,990
Cause there's a way to read that where
you're kind of letting them down easily,

715
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,100
you know, but he didn't,
he just did it like, yeah,

716
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,600
this is how it works. So they
would go look at that on a holiday.

717
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,180
Um, anyways, this is the Monday
morning podcast. It is the end of May.

718
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:59,180
Everybody. All right,
how many days are in May?

719
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,490
30 days had September
sodas, April and November.

720
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,240
All the rest have a bunch of
other dates except for statuary.

721
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,170
Go Fuck yourself with your song. Um,

722
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,210
she got 30 31 fuck, what is it?

723
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,110
April has 30. June has 30
maze. 31 well, what do I got?

724
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,570
The little thing I can click
right here. I'll have a computer.

725
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:26,780
I don't need to think right. It has.

726
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,060
Why is it in September?
Oh, for Christ sake,

727
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,730
do I have to click another
button? It has 31 days.

728
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,371
All right,

729
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:42,110
so you had till have you guys have until
Thursday midnight to make something of

730
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:46,580
May, 2012 all right. Are you
on a fucking relationship?

731
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:50,630
You don't want to be in? Do you
want to be in this relationship?

732
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,460
You don't want to be in in June?

733
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,390
Why don't you celebrate the end of
May by getting out of your fucking

734
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:58,850
relationship and sitting down

735
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,060
and basically just go
with the ll cool j vibe,

736
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,120
hold her hand and just go straight
honesty and then what she going to do?

737
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,340
Well, what is he going to do if
they're going to flip the fuck out,

738
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,470
but the die has been cast
to ship his set sail.

739
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,880
The ball is already rolling. The
Sun is setting, the rain is fallen.

740
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,680
Whatever the fuck you want to call it,
it's out there. Just put it out there.

741
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,380
Let them scream and yell and in
your head, as much as he sucks,

742
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,270
you're going to be like,
okay, I did it. I did it.

743
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,780
Now I've just got to sit here
and get yelled at and uh,

744
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,720
how long did somebody really yell
before they lose their voice? An hour.

745
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,140
90 minutes and an hour and a half.

746
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,150
I'm going to be in the car listening to
ll cool j driving away from that thing I

747
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,880
didn't want to be in. All right. And
I know I talk about this shit a lot,

748
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:53,310
but I think a lot of people
are in situations like this.

749
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,990
They don't know how to sit somebody
down. It just say, so I'm leaving you.

750
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,210
You know, if I was ll cool
J and I stop, you know,

751
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,110
selling tickets and all that type of shit,

752
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:11,030
that would be a side
business that I would have.

753
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:16,031
I would take that little fucking rhyme
that he had and I would custom do it for

754
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:21,670
everybody in their life and just make
people who just write you all right,

755
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,660
I need to charge it. You charge him a
hundred bucks and he would write you a,

756
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,730
you know, four bars.

757
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,810
It all rhymes and you just get out exactly

758
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,150
what you're saying. You know,

759
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,690
just be like you eat with your mouth
open. I know I said that I'd be true,

760
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,970
but you eat with your mouth open
so I'm leaving. You just get right.

761
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,840
You just get right down to
it. Your mom is a fucking con.

762
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,710
I know I said that I be true,

763
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,450
but she's fucking always coming over
here and some the runs with coffee.

764
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,760
You know I ain't got the, you
got the idea right? Jesus Christ.

765
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:06,750
What do I have to be yellow?

766
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:38,290
[inaudible]

767
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,280
let's get back into this mark from a
doesn't a furious. Yeah, I guess so.

768
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,393
All right.

769
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,590
Hi. What's up Ron? Standing here
with the guys from a dozen crs.

770
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,890
How do you guys think you set went to
that? Oh, I think it went really well,

771
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:55,760
man. I mean try that. Been the
hottest day so far in the whole tour.

772
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:58,550
But you know, we're Texas boys. Where
do you see the heats? I'll get up there.

773
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:01,220
Let's do our thing, man. So
you guys are like brand new.

774
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,270
You guys have won like a contest or
something to get on this? Yeah, I mean we,

775
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,980
we want a contest to be on the show. I
mean to be on the tour, but you know,

776
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,600
we've been a band for about two years now,

777
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:13,880
but touring on her own and doing
her own thing and you know,

778
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,720
this was pretty much just a
blessing, you know, you know,

779
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,450
a big step forward for us.
Definitely a blessing. How well

780
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,770
this is what I'm trying to get these guys
to say some fucked up like what you do

781
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,470
on tour and these guys, these
guys are covered in tattoos.

782
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,170
They all look like Mick Mars.
Yeah, Motley crew and they just,

783
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,760
I like the nicest guy ever. Needs to
blessing everything. Blessing to be here.

784
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,530
I noticed that in the
last days. God willing,

785
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:38,100
we'll go on to the next tour and why not?

786
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,860
I'll try to angle it towards some sort
of smut and they just keep going back to

787
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:42,310
the church.

788
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,890
Remember that when we did the [inaudible]
thing and there they're eating

789
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,790
vegetarian meals, backstage tofu or
drinking little green tea. It's like,

790
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,390
what's your, all you're going out
it up. They watch behind the music.

791
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:56,350
They saw that happens. Meanwhile
you're listened to behind them.

792
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,240
A contrast soundtrack to hell is play.

793
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,240
I know there's something going on in the
background that just listen to music.

794
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:09,000
How well or how well do people know
you're here? Um, so far it's been great.

795
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:12,240
I mean, we've done two signings and
they've been packed in tons of kids.

796
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,700
See what's the biggest asshole pride
you guys have been in front of him?

797
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,730
Just been like, fuck you. You're
the open advanced none yet man.

798
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:18,630
They've all been really cool.

799
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:22,620
I think they came out not expecting like
us to do what we actually do. You know,

800
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,650
everybody thought we were going to be
some MTV show man and stuff like that,

801
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:27,270
but it turns out, you know,
everybody's like, man,

802
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,430
you guys blew us away
and it's really cool.

803
00:48:29,431 --> 00:48:33,090
Like lots of Ford from the fans and shit.
So I mean we're like, oh, that's cool.

804
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,370
All right. You have the
other drama, right? Yes sir.

805
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,630
Have you ever like went to throw the drum
sticks in the crowd and some dude was

806
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,970
pissing you off so you can
Kinda, rather than tossed it,

807
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:46,700
just fucking throw it at him. Not
really that. It's just not somebody.

808
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,660
If you could put an eye out,

809
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,290
we wouldn't do things like that.

810
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,210
Make sure it's a rubber tip and I guess
we have special styrofoam drum sticks

811
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:59,500
that we throw out. So it was not to
injure any of our loving fans. Wow.

812
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,950
They were not biting. Even these
hardcore fans have become PC.

813
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,280
It gets even better.
I at it as far as like

814
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,540
hello. Good to see you again.

815
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:12,160
So many people talk really cold some off
first and so you know who gets the most

816
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:16,540
[inaudible]. None of us were all,
we're all a, we're all thinking, man.

817
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,930
Ah, we're in loving
relationships with lovely women.

818
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:26,990
It's just, it's the most
anti rock and roll. Wow.

819
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,270
Can Roll band okay.

820
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,900
Yeah, we're all good. We're all good.
This is really, you guys are the tattoos.

821
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:36,900
I'm figuring is this going to be maniac
going back to, and guys all committed.

822
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,180
Oh, we're all committed.
Anybody got a baby on the way?

823
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:43,310
You want to announce a daughter
already? The rest of the,

their kids on and Matt as safe.

826
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,310
Madison destined for a
pole though in Madison.

827
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,740
You know Zach named his son [inaudible]
Hendricks handed Jimmy Hendrix.

828
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,860
[inaudible] fucking animal is still
the real deal. It's an animal.

829
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,360
But these newer bands, you know
Billy just trifle beautiful.

830

a PSA though in the end.

thing here on now. Open Anthea.

833
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:18,090
So if you guys could just say
something to make, you know,

834
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:19,980

skin cancer, just wing it.

Anything throw a couple of fucks in
there so the kids are listen to it.

836

You know, I do that. We are
out in the sun all day long,

837
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:30,080
every day and we put on sunblock probably
like my times throughout the day. Man.

00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:58,820
You want to keep attaching fresh
shoes. You need to tighten it up.

848
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,540
Tighten it up real quick. Where
are your fucking sunblock? Bitches.

849
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:05,743
Bye guys.

850
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:10,250
All right, listen Ron [inaudible] idea.

851
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,480
I can do pieces thought I've eaten with
each band cause I had no idea where they

852
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:16,010
were.

853
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,990
So with each band I just made whatever
the PSA was more ridiculous and just

854
00:51:19,991 --> 00:51:23,530
always had them like throat. Just throw
a couple of fucks in there. Kids. Yeah,

855
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:26,110
the kid, you know, it's crazy. Something
a little rock and roll attitude.

856
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,780
I gotta say going into
that, I was like, ah,

857
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,420
audio from a band called a
dozen furious. Who Cares?

858
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,680
That was really interesting. And
in a lot of levels. Oh, they just,

859
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,490
they job bill bar. So what ordered me?
You ever have an orgy? Ah, you know,

860
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,330
more just like one on one connection
with somebody you know, really scary.

861
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,030
Monogamous on our relationships.

862
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,460
They're just not living their
rock and roll lifestyle anymore.

863
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,090
We know the whole arms. Oh,
I understand. I understand.

864
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,270
They got all the luck in the park.

865
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,130
You got the piercings that tattoos
and mixed messages. Yes. All right.

866
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,750
What about this Ben? Shadows
fall. Yeah, same shit.

867
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,380
I just would ask them questions and a
would go nowhere and then I just had them

868
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:08,810
do a PSA. Yeah. Well we got to
listen until we get to the PSA.

869
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,390
It's Brian from shadows.

870
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,840
Well, no, it's up. Stillbirth opening
anything show. I'm talking to Brian.

871
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,540
Fare from shadows fall. Grits.
That man has to feel about it. Oh,

872
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,060
that's what ask man. The whole
asbestos is incredible, man. You know,

873
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:21,610
sharing a stage with maiden and Sabbath
doesn't get any better than that.

874
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,280
It's how to help you sing
like that for so long.

875
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:27,100
And I yelled at my dad like that
for about 20 minutes of my time.

876
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,820
I couldn't talk much. I'm used to it for
yelling at my girlfriend that much you,

877
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,930
I was like, you know, builds it up. You've
got to build the strength, you know,

878
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,640
you know what? I'm going to do that
drop right now. You know what's good?

879
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,621
You'd glad you brought that up.

880
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:39,520
We had a opening at these doing like
a thing for like domestic violence

881
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:40,600
awareness. Yes.

882
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,820
Somebody kicked the shit out of that
girlfriend and like Newark or something.

883
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,730
So yeah. So just, just, just add,

884
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,160
lift some sort of dropped
and not do domestic violence,

885
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,290
see a girlfriend or
whatever, not, and you know,

886
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,870
it's kind of way it costs a couple of
amp moms in that just because I listened

887
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,250
as a retarded, but just try to
keep the good message. So just,

888
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,510
it was five shells fall and said,
hey, I just don't, you know,

889
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,270
oh, is such a great gag. Rockville.

890
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,510
You're gonna have to come back and
Redo this, uh, this new gag, right?

891
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,853
This is your thing.

892
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,670
Just say this five shouts ball and
so yeah, I just don't see it up.

893
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,420
Your girlfriend, you know, fucking
don't beat up your girlfriend again.

894
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,220
Let's not this bribe shadows fall, man.

895
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,590
You've got to stop punching your
girlfriend out there and say shit for the

896
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:30,090
bedroom. You know that's where it's at.
But don't take it to the streets. Okay.

897
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
Do it again. Just roll like one
fucking, then somebody got their idiots.

898
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,110
I was bribed. Shadow squad. Just say
stop hitting your fucking girlfriend.

899
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:41,360
You Idiots. All right. Save to violence
for the bedroom. My cool iron man.

900
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,780
So La, what do you guys go
from here? Um, after this, uh,

901
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,210
where the hell are we
tomorrow. Two days here.

902
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,860
Then we've got know I
don't even know where we go

903
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,550
us and they bring me where I gotta
be. It's hilarious. What do you,

904
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,690
what'd you think about playing out
here in the yard? The parking lot.

905
00:53:57,691 --> 00:53:59,790
Do you think it was gonna be one, like
a seated area? Cause I know I did.

906
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:03,120
I was kind of like, oh actually we're
on the main stage so you know that's it.

907
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,000
I like the parking lot by it actually
better cause there's no seats in the way

908
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,033
case you can go crazy.

909
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,450
That's thing you know we're gonna
be playing with where their seats.

910
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:11,910
So it's a little different
but you know it works out.

911
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,960
How long you guys been a band for?
Almost 10 years. XNL Oh good deal.

912
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,670
You got ain't you got a new
album or anything coming up?

913
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,470
The war thing has been
out for a little while.

914
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:21,360
We're going to be doing one more tour.

915
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,120
I'll draw specimen then working on new
records, so keep an eye out for that.

916
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,150
That's awesome. Always keep us
posted event next month. Thanks.

917
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,510
Thanks for that domestic
violence throttle. Thank you.

918
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,120
All Right, Nice Shit. That funny.
Go beat up your fucking girl. Palms.

919
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,050
They're idiots. Save it for the
bedroom. Save it for the bedroom.

920
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,880
Why did you punch her in the
bedroom? Oh God damn. Is that funny?

921
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:47,630
That's really good. We got one
more here from Peter from inflames.

922
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,760
Hey, what's up? It's
Cobra opiod Anthony show.

923
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,520
You know that cause you're
listen to this shit. Uh,

924
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,360
I'm with the bass player from
installation speed hours. Hey,

925
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:01,000
how would you set today man? Oh,
it's gonna be fine. Play. All right.

926
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,660
We need to start that again. So I
don't look like I ended up fucking,

927
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,610
how would you, oh man.
Like a retarded. Uh,

928
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,310
I get no rough assessment. So how do
you think your is going to go tonight?

929
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,600
You're looking forward. You on
the main stage. They over there.

930
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I think it's going to
go great. I mean it's a,

931
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,670
we always put in 150% and you know,

932
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:25,030
it's a bit different from a sitting
down crowd but instead it's going to be

933
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:25,490
great.

934
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,210
So far the older shows has been mostly
so I'm pretty sure today will be as well.

935
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:30,530
So you guys don't like your vibe,

936
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:34,970
you come more mellow melodic that like
how you guys are? I think we're metal,

937
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:40,380
you know, it's hard to categorize us
as one basically. No. Okay. Alright.

938
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,770
So you're not like I had
made meats, you know, like,

939
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:45,430
like pitch movies and stuff.
You're like, I made me, uh,

940
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,760
I guess we could say that,

941
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:50,360
but it wouldn't be unfair probably to
just categorize it into one. You know,

942
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,200
I often, I don't like that we're metal
baton. Ah, that's cool man. That's cool.

943
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:57,650
How long you guys been planned?
A long time. And I also, uh,

944
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,640
I think it's like 12 years
something. The events,

945
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,030
like five years and have everybody in
the band. If you had to kill someone,

946
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:09,410
who would you kill myself. It's
really snow on the roadside and gets,

947
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,440
you know. No,

948
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,270
but I mean it wouldn't be fair to
the other silhouettes to choose one.

949
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,220
Oh God. That's just, no
one would go with it.

950
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,030
No one wants to come to
a fair to the others.

951
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,970
It wouldn't be fair to those of
eyes to choose one. I like this guy.

952
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:27,280
This guy can tell. You're like the
peacekeeper in the band, right?

953
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,720
You're like the mellow one.
Listen man, we're also doing,

954
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,710
now this is kind of a side thing, but
kind of doing this so there's benefit.

955
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,860
Somebody beat up a special needs
kid and like no work and a,

956
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,710
so we just want you to just say, you know,

957
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,290
just give a shout out to the kids so
they know not to beat up somebody with

958
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:45,890
like, you know, special needs, you
know, so just, you know, say like,

959
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,920
uh, you know, hey guys, you know,

960
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:50,830
it's not cool to beat up on somebody just
because they're different or whatever.

961
00:56:50,831 --> 00:56:53,740
You know, just, you know, this
is like a quick, kind of like a,

962
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,260
like a soundbite and it's kind of
weird but throw a couple of, you know,

963
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,780
fox in there just cause I found the
kind of retarded, you know what I mean?

964
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,370
So you didn't like, you know,

965
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,520
I'm just playing there you
guys a spirit of replays.

966
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,500
She should've treated
everybody equally and uh,

967
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,750
don't beat anybody up or do something
bad to them. Just goes to a different,

968
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:14,080
everybody's the same way. Okay.
That's totally department vibe.

969
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:18,360
Just throw in special needs and
throw in like one or two fucks. Yeah,

970
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:21,070
the awkward, it's kind of
like I said, they were tired.

971
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,550
Same thing again or what? Yeah,
yeah. Hey, the spirit room,

972
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,320
flames a treat everybody
the same way. It'll be.

973
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,630
It's people still special needs and I'm
like that don't fucking go into and do

974
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:35,890
any bullshit than shooting
people up because of different
treat everybody at the

975
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:39,010
same time. That's beautiful.
And the kid's name is Russell.

976
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,920
Just give him a shout out to same thing.
Couple of blocks and a big metal fan.

977
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:45,800
So it means a lot to him. I scared.
Got beat up Russell from Newark. Only.

978
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,470
Fuck you're doing take care
of yourself, man. Season.

979
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,780
I do. That's beautiful man. Thanks
so much and good luck tonight.

980
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,910
Holy Shit. You are insane.

981
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,100
I love knowing the same breath.

982
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,130
Oh wish you could have seen the looks
on their face as they're trying to wrap

983
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:05,470
their fucking head around the
concert. I don't doubt it.

984
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,550
I love how in the same breath you're
saying this poor special needs kid. Yeah,

985
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:14,260
I'll listen as a fucking retard. And
they use this archaic term like retarded.

986
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,250
Oh Wow. Bill. That's
great. That was great.

987
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:26,170
Just to add special news and throw a
fucking couple and they just do it to say

988
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:30,580
hi to Russell. I'm noxious. Drown
the clown guy. What's this? Oh,

989
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,970
this guy was one of the funniest
acts that I've ever seen. He was a,

990
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,100
what's it called? Drown the clown.

991
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,470
You basically get all
the Dunkin stool dunking.

992
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,580
So some guy is sitting there in this
clown mass and he's just trashing these

993
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,180
peop. Half of them are fucking like
totally old jokes, but he says, Hey,

994
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:48,960
look at the white trash
people that you fucking lose.

995
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,900
And then even just said this
maniacal laugh like the clown Lou.

996
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,520
And then he'd just go get the end of it.

997
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:01,180
It was so fucking of Nazis.
He got some skinny kid.

998
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,260
He kept calling him a crack head and this
dude is literally walking behind what

999
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:08,830
you throw the balls like go,
come on. Dolphin Stole Mondo.

1000
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,720
You wanted to kick his and kick his ass.

1001
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,380
He would get these people so mad there'll
be like 20 of them and he'd get him so

1002
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:17,410
mad. But by the time that
they actually like dumped him,

1003
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,800
they would all start giving
the finger go fuck you.

1004
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:26,710
And where you might need video
on this one. I don't know. I,

1005
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,930
let's take a lesson. It's
obnoxious. Drown the clown guy.

1006
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,340
Hey Buddy. You want a
milk crate to stand on?

1007
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,240
What do you want to be
when you get old to fight?

1008
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:51,040
So by body

1009
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,963
[inaudible]

1010
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,960
and then he's taunting him. I'm not sure.

1011
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,090
I'm all pissed. Here's a
noxious drown the clown guy.

1012
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:11,910
I guess a chick with no boobs
was in the area. Huh? Hey Mommy.

1013
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,870
I know you love me. You
just don't know. We get

1014
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:21,170
oh babies now. You bet
the DVD before here.

1015
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,650
You don't want to. I can read
your shirt and your in dreams.

1016
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,360
Why did before do this group?

1017
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,500
Hey Buddy, it's going get
hot back then. A pound

1018
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:43,730
[inaudible] a [inaudible]. I'm going
to get eaten the tables with face

1019
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:51,510

got one more drug fee on that.

1020
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,650
Three d a v I can look at me.

1021
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,720
You got to have the beautiful
blonde. Yeah. Why is he

1022
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,283
[inaudible]

1023
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,490
not this shit was just old jokes.

1024
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,700
Just fucking the most
horrendous jokes and he said,

1025
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:13,850
ah,

1026
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:18,080
it sounds like Keith Robinson.
They laugh. I love this guy.

1027
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,760
Love noxious asshole. You could have seen
these fucking people standing around.

1028
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:26,680
How they all, there was
one dude, he had like a,

1029
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:30,860
he was like completely bald on top and
he had a hat on and he took, he just,

1030
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,850
I don't if he lost his hat, but his
face was like, like Puerto Rican Brown.

1031
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:37,490
Right. And then his fucking
head was totally white.

1032
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,820
[inaudible] head blows
up your fucking head.

1033
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,993
Okay.

1034
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,980
Raymond Adam and this fucking guy, he's
just losing. Yeah, look at my head.

1035
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,860
And then they would try to throw the
balls even fucking harder and they're like

1036
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:56,700
missing by like 20 feet
and every ball they throw.

1037
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,923
Okay.

1038
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,150
Oh, what an asshole. It was actually,

1039
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,530
it was literally like a better
job than stand up in a way. Yeah.

1040
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:08,940
You didn't have to just fucking sit
there and like goddamn parking lot.

1041
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,710
You're right. You have to do an act.
You just fucking irritate people.

1042
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,910
Time people. And it doesn't matter
how bad they try to heckle you back.

1043
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,730
We got more from the obnoxious drown the
clown guy. What are you talking about?

1044
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,390
[inaudible] I know you
ain't got a green color.

1045
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,100
You got clean cod there was like Mexican.

1046
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,430
I love that blend. Can we isolate
that? I want that on my machine.

1047
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,970
He though words get that on
my machine. Hmm. Alright.

1048
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:43,010
Another loser that he was making
fun of. What are you going to do?

1049
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,510
You laid a lose out.

1050
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:55,500
We were standing out there for like
six hours and you heard that laugh like

1051
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:56,790
every three seconds. Oh.

1052
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:58,710
People in the egg attain like
I'm gonna fucking kill it.

1053
01:02:58,711 --> 01:03:01,770
I put my head on the pillow and that's
all I hear. Is that guy laughing.

1054
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,720
What are you doing? You're
bone head. Total ball. Huh?

1055
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,550
Come on. You lose up. Give me
the second part of it. Done.

1056
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,733
Yeah.

1057
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:18,900
Oh, he wouldn't do the lab.

1058
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,080
He could only do the laugh
when he was sitting there.

1059
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:25,140
He probably doesn't even know what
you're talking about. The app part. No,

1060
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,830
you look like with that red
shirt on like a fire truck

1061
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,220
come off that boy on weight

1062
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,410
and all you hold the logo.

1063
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:57,580
Oh my God. I gotta do that all day. That
laughed out just off down the street.

1064
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,173
Okay.

1065
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:05,680
We've got to get that guy on the show.
How do we get ahold of that guy ass?

1066
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,250
We need him on the show on the clown.
We need him at the next road show, man.

1067
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:13,900
We're starting to put together
our first anniversary. A show.

1068
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,750
Someone says it's Nice show
Colin Quinn getting worse.

1069
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,770
You wouldn't have understood
the tonsil. Something Ironic.

1070
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,740
I was doing a Gig in
Wildwood many years ago.

1071
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:32,920
I was probably three years in the business
and some guy was heckling me and he

1072
01:04:32,921 --> 01:04:33,910
just rectally.

1073
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,240
I talked to him after the show and he's
really a cool guy and it was one of

1074
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:40,150
those guys, but one of those
fucking balls to really have. Yeah,

1075
01:04:40,151 --> 01:04:42,130
some of them like that
guy. Pretty good at.

1076
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:44,260
It doesn't matter how old the
jokes are, not. Doesn't matter.

1077
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,560
You got to see you say it with the right
attitude. It's going to work. You know,

1078
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,470
pissed people off. It's
bad if he just like,

1079
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:53,320
if you're completely uninhibited
and yeah, not going to shut up.

1080
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,470
You'll win every time. Yeah. Very
funny stuff. Bill, you got to leave.

1081
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,220
Are you staying? I can hang out
a little bit after 10. Alright,

1082
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,183
cool.

1083
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,743
[inaudible]

1084
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,770
what am I talking about
here? Um, cheap two.

1085
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:59,240
Can they show that fucking John Malcovich
talking to his phone and just having

1086
01:05:59,241 --> 01:06:03,290
the time of his life commercial one
more fucking time. What's more annoying?

1087
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:07,100
That one or where that
weird family does the a,

1088
01:06:07,101 --> 01:06:10,310
the acapella version of
Ozzy Osborne's crazy train.

1089
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,240
Would that random black kid in the back?
Like where did they get that kid? Like,

1090
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:16,950
you know, was he an exchange student?

1091
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,180
And he just seems like he's over all of
it and not enjoying hanging out with the

1092
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:25,200
other white people as he fucking shakes
the ice in his it, his great drink,

1093
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,663
you know,

1094
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,810
and then they got to end that great song
with the parents singing like they're

1095
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:31,680
on Broadway. Right.

1096
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,793
Go ahead.

1097
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,843
You know

1098
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:43,050
anybody else with me on that? John fucking
Malcovich sitting there all you know

1099
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,370
if that, if that commercial was 30
seconds longer, he'd have the phone like,

1100
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,550
like blowing him. Tell me a joke.

1101
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,620
Do I have anything coming
up tonight now? Oh,

1102
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,290
lobster souffle or whatever.
Pretentious fucking foodie orders.

1103
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,080
Was it pretentious bill?
Are you just not cultured?

1104
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,020
And his order made you feel dumb.
All right, you got me on that one.

1105
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,410
You got me on that one. Um,

1106
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,620
I'm the only one who's creeped out that
there's a fucking robot in my phone.

1107
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,380
Well, whatever it is, it's
that they try to make it human.

1108
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,010
What did they do that just
make it sound like a robot.

1109
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:22,840
Okay.

1110
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,710
Hi. Can I have you massage parlor Garry?

1111
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,440
[inaudible] just do it like that.
So I see it still keeps that like,

1112
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:32,660
okay,

1113
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,650
we keep that distance.

1114
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,830
I don't need intimacy with this
thing that isn't fucking alive.

1115
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,830
I don't need that 2001
space odyssey experience.

1116
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,490
That's all I'm trying to say
here. People, oh, he's bill burr.

1117
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:47,830
He's mad at phones. Get
out of his way. Everybody.

1118
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,790
This guy has got something to say.

1119
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,220
What's the deal with your mom?

1120
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:54,843
Okay.

1121
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,633
Oh,

1122
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,383
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1123
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,143
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1124
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,910
[inaudible].
