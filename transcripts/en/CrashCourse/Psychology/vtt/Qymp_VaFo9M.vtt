00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.120
People have been having sex and writing songs
about it and carving statues of it and changing

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.570
fashion for it since the dawn of humanity,
but it wasn't until fairly recently in the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.469
1940s that serious Western scientific study
of sex began.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.530
And by most accounts you can thank one guy
for that: Alfred Kinsey.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.570
Kinsey was born in 1894 in New Jersey, to
poor strict Methodist parents.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.230
He studied etymology in college, graduated
with degrees in biology and psychology before

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.320
heading to Harvard.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.590
His doctoral thesis was on the genealogy of
Gall wasps, a subject he tackled with intensity;

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.590
meticulously collecting over five million
samples, measuring hundreds of thousands of

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.590
specimens.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.150
And wasps are interesting and everything,
but Kinsey's interests drifted toward human

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.290
sexuality and his research in Indiana University
paved the way for decades of study into sex.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.320
He surveyed thousands of men and women about
their sexual habits and histories, and found

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.899
all sorts of interesting things related to
sexual preferences, masturbation, orgasms,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.040
and pre-marital sex.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.210
He established the "Kinsey scale" indicating
degrees of sexual orientation) and went on

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.650
to write the seminal texts on sexual behavior
in the human male and female respectively.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.040
Like many researchers of human behavior, Kinsey
and his colleagues were - and in some ways

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.970
still are - pretty controversial.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
But he definitely succeeded in two very important
tasks.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.280
One: he was an early adopter of a scientific
approach to studying sex, and two: he showed

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
that the popular perception of what people
do and don't do sexually, versus what people

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.870
actually do and feel, was often very different.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.380
Since then we've seen innumerable sex-related
studies examining the physiological and psychological

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.280
and social elements of sex.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.250
And, there's a whole lot of lingering misinformation
and judging morality swirling around the subject

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.250
of sex.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.130
It can be a tricky topic for sure but we are
here to clear some things up.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.640
It's the entire purpose of life so there's
no reason to blush.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.060
So.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.490
Sex.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.869
That one little word has complicated so many
lives.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.280
The desire for or lack of sex has spawned
poetry and made babies and transmitted diseases

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.180
and cost money and driven people batty and
kept late-night cable in business.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.620
Even the word itself can mean many different
things.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.000
First we've got the verb kind of sex, the
physical process of engaging in sexual acts

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.260
and intercourse, which, probably I don't need
to describe to you.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.730
Then we've got the biological definition,
having to do with the anatomical parts that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.691
go with the designations of male or female
or intersex - those who were born with the

00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.860
reproductive parts that don't fall into the
predominant definitions of male or female.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.420
And these are quite separate from gender,
or an individual's sense of identifying as

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.010
male or female or another gender identity
regardless of how that corresponds with their

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.569
actual reproductive plumbing.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.709
For transgender people, for instance, gender
identity typically doesn't match biological

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.709
sex.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.660
And remember that gender identity is completely
different from sexual orientation, which we'll

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.800
talk about in a minute.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.580
So beyond definitions, we have the physiological
and psychological aspects of sex.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.570
Let's start with the physiological, and with
that, Masters and Johnson.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.430
In the late 1950's and 60's, American gynecologists
Williams Masters, and his collaborator and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.020
future wife, sexologist Virginia Johnson,
did something no researchers had ever done

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.020
before.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.239
They invited nearly 700 male and female volunteers,
many of them sex workers, to come into their

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.750
lab and get it on, either alone or with their
partners.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.750
Their aim?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.959
To record the body's physiological response
to sex.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.480
This involved wearing a whole lot of wires
and heart monitors and such, and is probably

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.459
about as sexy as it sounds.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.410
All the volunteers had to be willing and able
to show arousal and be capable of orgasm.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.430
And over the years, Masters and Johnson recorded
more than ten thousand "sexual cycles".

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.239
The main thing they documented was that a
complete sexual response cycle involved four

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.350
distinct stages - excitement, plateau, orgasm,
and resolution - which Masters and Johnson

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.980
maintained happened in a linear way, one after
the other.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.330
In the excitement phase, things are gettin'
goin', blood is rushing to all the necessary

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.620
places, genital areas are becoming engorged
and secreting lubricant.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.380
Next comes the plateau phase.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.080
Pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rates
keep increasing and genitals are becoming

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.299
fully engorged.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.720
The penis is often secreting pre-ejaculate
as vaginal secretions increase until the big

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.509
event orgasm during which muscles all over
the body contract and breathing and pulse

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.979
rates hit their peak.

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.490
Of course, a biological male orgasm typically
releases sperm that may lead to fertilization,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.580
depending on the situation, but female arousal
and orgasm also help facilitate conception,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.849
again depending on the situation as those
muscle contractions and lubrication help draw

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.750
up and retain sperm in the uterus.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.300
Finally, the body comes back down to its normal
state of affairs during the resolution phase.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.759
It's during this phase that biosex males enter
a refractory period during which they're unable

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.669
to orgasm again for a few minutes to a day
or more whereas biological females refractory

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.669
period is very short in comparison.

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.110
While the four stage model of sexual response
is still taught today, some have criticized

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.060
both its rigid linear setup, arguing that
things don't always work so tidily in the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.360
bedroom, and it's insistence in including
orgasm which doesn't happen for everyone all

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360
the time.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.259
Others also question the model's clinical
focus on only physiological factors arguing

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.379
the cultural attitudes, psychological and
relationship factors, and other external details

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.099
should also be considered when looking at
sexual response.

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.139
I'll get back to that in a minute, but before
we move on to the psychology of sex, we got

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.139
to talk about hormones.

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.509
You remember hormones, those chemical messengers
brewed up by the endocrine system that travel

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.759
through the bloodstream and regulate all sorts
of physiological and behavioral activities

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.689
from growth to digestion to sleep to sex.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.169
Our sex hormones serve two major purposes.

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.050
One, they direct the physical development
of biological sex characteristics, and two,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.529
they help activate sexual behavior.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.559
Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female
sex characteristics and are secreted in greater

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.219
amounts by females than males and while all
humans make testosterone, it's the predominate

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.900
sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth
and development of male sex characteristics.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.150
Now most female mammals become sexually receptive
when their estrogens peak during ovulation,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.699
but it doesn't really work that way for humans.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.340
Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual
behavior, although studies have found that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.240
in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly
around ovulation, when woman are most fertile

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.039
and males can also be affected by this spike,
responding with higher levels of testosterone

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.669
when ovulating women are around.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:35.069
But these short term changes hardly compare
to the larger more major hormonal shifts that

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.559
occur throughout a life time.

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:40.770
Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a
lot more hot and bothered and interested in

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.279
dating and gazing at posters of their favorite
celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.610
hormone production normally decreases, our
amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.610
as well.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.270
Age affects our libido.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.069
But in the end you might think of sex hormones
as fuel for your sexual engine, and while

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.430
an engine can't run on a totally empty tank,
it also won't run any better or worse on a

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.439
full tank versus a half tank.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:10.339
We need our sex hormones, but we also need
the right psychological stimuli to turn us

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:12.779
on and keep us going sexually.

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:16.750
So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological
aspects of sex.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.240
First, there are the very important social
and cultural influences.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.439
Things like your families, your societies,
your religions, and your personal values.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.860
Does your community view sex merely as the
means for reproduction or can it be fun too?

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.159
What are the views on premarital sex, and
homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.159
in public?

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.490
Then there are the influences of external
stimuli.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.939
In western society, we're constantly bombarded
with sexually charged content from movies

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.770
and TV to advertisements, R&amp;B slow jams, and
Victoria Secret catalogs.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.989
And constantly looking at images of things
that you find extremely attractive can lead

00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:55.610
to folks viewing more average people, even
their own partners, as being less attractive.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.860
But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal
stimuli.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.689
Our imagination and memories and fantasies.

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:05.949
According to plenty of studies, at least 95%
of people fantasize about sex at some point.

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:09.199
The thing you need to keep in mind is that
none of these factors work independently of

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.199
each other.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.879
How we respond to both external and internal
stimuli can be really heavily influenced by

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:20.770
social and cultural factors, and that is where
a lot of the thinking and studying of sex

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.709
has gotten really complicated.

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:27.610
Human judgment and morality is often entangled
with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.349
have been made to feel miserable for liking
certain things or being attracted to certain

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:33.349
people.

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:34.709
There's also just been a lot of misinformation
out there.

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:40.209
For ages, a lot of folks believed that masturbation
could make you go blind, become mentally ill,

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:42.500
or kill the neighborhood kittens.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.560
It doesn't do that.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.240
And as I know, you're thinking right now one
area of sexuality has been needlessly associated

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.520
with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures
is sexual orientation.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.310
For our purposes, sexual orientation can be
defined as a relatively enduring physical

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.350
or romantic attraction to another person.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.990
Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are
all types of sexual orientation.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.019
And although the field once stigmatized non-heterosexual
orientations, we now know that homosexuality

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:10.519
and bisexuality are in no way related to mental
health.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:13.660
Psychologists are also beginning to look more
in depth at other sexual orientations.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:19.569
For instance, Asexuality or nonsexuality,
where no sexual attraction of any kind is

00:09:19.569 --> 00:09:20.569
experienced.

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:25.529
In any case, whether a culture itself is friendly
to or tyrannical against any of these orientations,

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:27.430
all types prevail.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.519
Sexual orientation is neither chosen nor changed.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.639
So, what might cause these differences?

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.730
Hopefully you already know this but it's worth
repeating.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.910
There's no evidence that sexual orientation
is determined by things like dominating mother

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.899
or passive father or sex hormone levels in
your adult body or your history of childhood

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:46.110
abuse or whether your parents were gay or
straight.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.110
In other words, decades of research have led
most researchers to believed that once you're

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.160
born, there are no clear environmental factors
that influence your sexual orientation.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.370
And there's been a lot of research into possible
biological components of sexual orientation,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.850
like genetics, brain anatomy, prenatal conditions,
or other things.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.660
It's also important to know that we're far
from understanding sexual orientation on a

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.139
purely biological level.

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:12.870
If anything, the evidence we've got simply
strengthens the idea that sexual orientation

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.319
isn't choice, but rather a naturally varying
occurrence among human beings, like height.

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:18.319
So.

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:21.560
After all this talk about sex, perhaps you're
wondering why we do it at all.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.440
I mean, it feels good obviously.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.050
But the biggest function of sex goes beyond
pure pleasure.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.949
In fact, sexual intimacy serves many of life's
most basic purposes: some times procreation,

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:36.250
but also stress reduction, maintaining healthy
relationships, social bonding, and the expression

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.880
of love, and overall fulfillment.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.019
People say he brain is the most significant
sex organ for a reason.

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:43.460
And intimacy is often its own reward.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.610
Today, you learned about Alfred Kinsey's ground
breaking sex surveys, the differences between

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.829
how we define biological sex and gender identity,
and about Masters and Johnson's four-part

We also looked at the role of sex hormones,
in our development and drive, how psychological

00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:04.740
