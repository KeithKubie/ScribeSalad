1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,410
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and today,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,460
well today we're going to tell you a
story which we hope does not become your

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:12,120
future, but it raises a simple
question. We all have computers,

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,220
we love computers, we
depend upon computers.

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:18,720
But what if the cost of
using your computer becomes
more than you're willing to

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,370
pay two stories today,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,670
which suggest that we might be at the
very beginning of a nightmare to first

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,090
comes from a journalist, Alina
Simone and her mother ina.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,660
I mean do you want to start with my
mom? Cause it really happened to her,

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,970
her, you know, she, she only got
in touch with me maybe on day six.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,733
[inaudible] Huh? Yeah.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,320
Okay. So, well yeah, day one.
What was the first, first thing

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,530
it happened on day one,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,620
one tampon that I called Tufts university
a t services because my husband,

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,870
folks at Tufts complaining that
my computer is unbearably amber

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,810
bliss. Slow stills it, I
don't know what's going on.

17
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:04,550
Every time I try to open a window
it's like click, click full,

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,490
practically stop to working. What do I do?

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,200
Checked whatever I said and
I'm probably nothing rebooted,

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,360
so did nothing basically.

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,870
Then she went away for the weekend and
when I came back I turned the computer on

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,640
and like it was doing something

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,090
and they so many,

24
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:34,091
many windows covering your screen
and those windows multiplied.

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,400
I cannot open any of them
and I could not figure,

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,560
but it was very late at night

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,810
so she went to bed,

28
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,700
got up the next day called
[inaudible] Gan asking for help.

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,100
They had no idea what was going
on. No, she says at this point,

30
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,380
whatever the computer had
been doing, it was done.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,600
All the windows disappeared except now
anytime she tried to click any of her

32
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,840
files, pictures, videos,

33
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,270
I cannot open any of them. Instead,

34
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,580
every time this message would pop up

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,370
and the message says,

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,710
what happened to your files? My files,

37
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:17,640
all of your files have been protected
with a strong encryption encrypted using

38
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,510
crypto wall.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,830
This means that the structure and data
within your files have been irrevocably

40
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:27,831
changed and in order to get
them back to unlock files,

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,820
you must pay 500 US dollars.
If you really value your data,

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,470
then we suggest that you do not waste
valuable time searching for the solutions

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,270
because they do not exist.

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,100
You're saying that somebody went into
your computer and locked up all of your

45
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:44,630
things?

46
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,990
Yeah, they gave me the exact clown,

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,930
5,726 files encrypted

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,660
live. When you say they, did you
have any image in your head of who?

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,070
My first thought was Russia or Ukraine,

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,360
which is even better.
Why? Because you know,

51
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,680
everybody talks about excellent,
fantastic education there,

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,760
especially math. I'm from the,
I know, you know, she's right.

53
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,750
They surpassed the u s and educating
their kids when it comes to math and

54
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,430
science and they've got a
severe underemployment problem,

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,380
especially outside of the major cities,

56
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:27,040
which is where these viruses often trace
down to not Moscow and St Petersburg.

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,780
But we're talking about, you know,
backwater. I was so positive that, uh,

58
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:36,781
it comes from that part of the world
that I wrote them in Russian family.

59
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,190
The criminals had provided her a link
to a website where she could send them a

60
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,730
message, you know,
customer sport. I rode them

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,420
[inaudible] I don't know how to translate
it in English. [inaudible] SAMHSA,

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,650
like I wish you all die. [inaudible]

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
in Russian language [inaudible] to die
for humans or in other word for animals

64
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,260
said use the animal one.
Yeah, it's not a curse,

65
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,530
but they got the message now ina says
she thought about a just wiping the

66
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,180
computer clean so that
she wouldn't have to pay.

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,510
Then it occurred to her that her
husband had all these files on there,

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,920
which he needed, you know,

69
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,220
like business receipts that he hadn't
filed yet and she's lazy to do.

70
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,310
So he has [inaudible] and she's
right that like, you know,

71
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,060
she has this tax information,

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,010
this reimbursement information and
ultimately it's worth more than $500.

73
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:36,220
My husband did not want
to buy overall themes,

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,580
so ina decides to follow the instructions,

75
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,210
basically one download and
installed horror browser.

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,370
So she goes and installs
this browser called Tor,

77
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,371
which apparently is more traceable to
Rhonda Browser in Wade for initialization.

78
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,570
She does that three type in the
address Bar, k Pie, seven YCR,

79
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:01,900
seven j x Q, and she's directed to a
site where it basically tells her, look,

80
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,170
if you don't trust us, we can decrypt

81
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,670
one of your files for free as
a sample that when you pay us,

82
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,770
you would know that you could
really get all your files back.

83
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,070
Huh. And I was curious,

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,950
I decided that I will try it.

85
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,370
So she clicked the button that
said yes and we got one file back.

86
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,950
But as soon as I did

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,690
the glocks, that chicken,
literally, she says,

88
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,490
a little clock appeared
at the top of the browser.

89
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,280
They gave me exactly seven days,

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,160
167 hours, 59 minutes,

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,900
59 seconds. So you decrypt the thing
and then suddenly it's a countdown.

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,850
Yes. They say, if you
won't pay by this day,

93
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,380
then the fire a little bit of both.

94
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,860
And if the wound bed in one more beat,

95
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,570
then you will lose your files forever
and you will never get that back.

96
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,820
Now in the message that it told INA
that she had to pay that $500 fine,

97
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,290
not in dollars, but in Bitcoin,

98
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,223
you know, I,

99
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,610
this was the first time in my life ever,

100
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,700
I heard the term bit corns.

101
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,980
So I um,

102
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,070
found this website called coin cafe
where you can buy bitcoins in to buy this

103
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,790
bitcoins is a nightmare

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,453
for what? Yeah,

105
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,630
what she needed to do with exchange
500 bucks for the requisite amount of

106
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,670
bitcoins. And at the time, uh,

107
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,390
500 bucks equals 1.37 bitcoins.

108
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,700
But before she could
even make that exchange,

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,220
she had to fill out all these
forms of all these questions.

110
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,600
What happened?

111
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,910
What is the reason to buy
bitcoin and reasons were listed.

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,800
One of them was ransom. So then

113
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,361
yes,

114
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:08,150
it would the first reason to
pay a ransom to the criminals.

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,720
She says after you fill out all the forms,

116
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,721
you have to make a big chair and send
them a photograph through the Internet.

117
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:18,914
Okay.

118
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I did not have a camera
because your camera happened
to be in the shot or one of

119
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,840
them that I have to make a picture of.

120
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:34,580
My husband called in a driver's license,

121
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,620
Sam them this picture back,

122
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,090
so they was banquet the criminals.

123
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,100
This is the people who sell you
bitcoin in exchange for your money.

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,320
I told you that it's a
torture. It's unbelievable,

125
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,080
but eventually she was able to
find a neighbor, borrow the camera,

126
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,520
take the picture she needs to take.

127
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,870
Then she had to get the money she wanted
to exchange to coin cafe and it turns

128
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:03,800
out the preferred way to do it, the
most secure way to do it is not online,

129
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:07,730
but through a money order.
They sold the day before.

130
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,350
Nothing's given Wednesday, still had
about six days before the deadline,

131
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,690
so she thought, all right, I'll
just pop down to the post office,

132
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,524
get the money order,

133
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,543
but

134
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,140
Lexington and the whole Massachusetts
[inaudible] terrible, terrible,

135
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,930
no storms. For a lot of us, this
could be the biggest storms so far.

136
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:32,530
This winter, drivable road and
significant snow, a wet snow at that.

137
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,740
I had to go to the post office
so she plows through the snow,

138
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:40,950
almost kills herself but gets there and
gets everything together, sends it off

139
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,450
and it's like, all right, so
finally I sent everything out.

140
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,690
The post office assured me that
they will get it on Friday,

141
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,710
which is the first working
day after the sense given.

142
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,180
Okay, so one Friday she called coin cafe.

143
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,510
They did not get it on set of the,

144
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,450
they did not get it on
Monday in the morning,

145
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,510
nothing was delivered and I was desperate
because my deadline was Tuesday.

146
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,210
Samson like 12 o'clock and I start
calling the post office, whatever,

147
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:22,600
nobody knows and they sing.
They said yes, two days,

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,370
but there is no guarantee.

149
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,820
Finally Walk Block in
the afternoon on Monday,

150
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,250
but 24 hours before the
deadline, they got it

151
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,110
and they send me bitcoins in
exchange because they got my money.

152
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,220
But she says when she went online
to check her bitcoin account,

153
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,170
I am $13

154
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,280
[inaudible] nearly 400 and
and I start calling them,

155
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,200
I basically the exchange
rate of change on her.

156
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,340
She had bought it at 500 now it was worth
four 87 I asked them how often do we

157
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:05,420
change the exchange rate
in this at every minute.

158
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,660
It's not a joke. Yeah, every
minute. I said, are you crazy?

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,260
I was a double victim. I was with them.

160
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:19,100
Square cube. You see what I mean?

161
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,260
Because driving was terrible.

162
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,290
I have to stand on my head to get a
camera and then I was struggling to Sam

163
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,990
them. That's the problem with this crime.

164
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:33,440
Like the criminals need a better
way to get money from the victim,

165
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:37,220
but everything else is traceable.
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

166
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,890
So you're $13 short.

167
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm calling they, they said there
is one more way. One more way.

168
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,500
And what does it, we have a ATM machine.

169
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,420
You said what? Yeah,
became an ATM machine.

170
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,880
One live one and I said, where is
it? It's in Brooklyn, Brooklyn,

171
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:06,140
New York. 200 miles away. Wait a
second, I don't understand this.

172
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,820
There is one ATM that is in the borough
of Brooklyn where you do not live,

173
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,390
but luckily her daughter,
Alina lives in Brooklyn.

174
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,270
You asked me how my daughter got
involved that Scow, so she calls Alina.

175
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,150
Yeah. My mom called me the
night before the Ranson was due.

176
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,940
So are you aware of any of this attack
point at this point? No. No. I remember,

177
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:29,090
you know, I was at night, I had the
TV on and I have a toddler, you know,

178
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,420
always all these things going on.
I was probably on my laptop too.

179
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,930
I was doing like 12 things and my mom
called and she was like upset with a

180
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:36,890
capital u.

181
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,690
She started ranting about criminals and
ransom and I literally thought she was

182
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:45,240
like talking in air quotes. I'm like,
Oh yeah, I know when I go to tech sir.

183
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,400
And like, yeah, they're
threats, extortion. And my
mom was like, no, like no,

184
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,130
really around some dope.
They're really criminals.

185
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,330
Her mom told her Google
crypto wall. I was like, holy,

186
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,310
this is really a thing.

187
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Plus I started googling as she
suggested I do and found out that police

188
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:06,490
departments had paid this, that
a sheriff's department and Dixon,

189
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,730
Tennessee had just paid it
to unlock like, you know,

190
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
70 plus thousand case
files. And I was like, yeah,

191
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,800
go after police department. I've
gone after governments, universities,

192
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,570
corporations, police departments.

193
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,410
Question ever come up in your mind
like why my mom? No, not at all.

194
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,450
Cause like a million people in the u s
have been infected with criminal. Yes.

195
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,880
Anyhow, next day was it
six hours left to Alina,

196
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,690
please go to this ATM so we can
just, you done with this whole thing?

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,280
You can cut it later but they
can tell you that in the morning.

198
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:40,940
She said,

199
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,940
I have a date for my
granddaughter date to play date.

200
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,500
I won't be able to do it until
12 o'clock and they call again.

201
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,800
I said I was crazy. I don't have time.

202
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,990
So I go out to Greenpoint,

203
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,370
this ATM and you know I just
want to add that to your head.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,290
Your plate like handled my po.

205
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,240
I didn't t I called you. You shorten it.

206
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,180
You might get okay. Right. Okay.
So should I cut my playdate short?

207
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,030
Sorry. Forget that crucial detail.

208
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,740
And I go out to Greenpoint and they
have an ATM and I'm just worried that

209
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:24,880
there's going to be 57 people all lined
up at this single ATM that you're there.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,560
We're totally not 57 people. I mean most
people do take care of this remotely.

211
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,360
Like there was no one at this ATM.

212
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:34,150
I mean what was funny about the ATM
is like I'm expecting like, yeah,

213
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,960
I've been to an ATM, like I have a capital
one account, I know what an ATM is,

214
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:38,201
you know,

215
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:42,580
but this was on like the second floor
of a workshare space in Brooklyn.

216
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:46,510
It was like in the hallway there was
like a bike hanging from a wall kind of

217
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:51,130
blocking it and there was like a paper
sign taped to the wall that just had a

218
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,740
printout from a computer
that just said Bitcoin ATM,

219
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:57,460
all lower case letters and
an arrow to this phone booth.

220
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,290
It looked very Soviet.

221
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,980
Like if you've seen photos of those
phones with no buttons and there's just a

222
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:06,360
receiver and it's totally
scary. It's like, yeah, yeah.

223
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,400
Like you just pick it up and like
somebody is always on the other line or

224
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,960
something. It was like that.

225
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:15,520
It was just this box with a screen
and no buttons and a camera eye.

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,650
And what you do is you hold up your QVC
Code, is that what they're called? QVC?

227
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,780
What are they called? QRC.
Yeah, it's like a barcode.

228
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,530
So there's this QRC code and my mom
had emailed it to me and it was like,

229
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,450
you need to print this
out and this is a sent.

230
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:35,470
This essentially gives you access to
my account to top it off, you know?

231
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:40,450
And so I put this QRC code up to the
camera on and it kind of went bloop and

232
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:43,420
then it was like we are
accessing your account.

233
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,160
And then I got a spinny
wheel, the wheel of death,

234
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,290
funny wheel elitist, starts frantically
dialing her mom. The guys at Queen Cafe,

235
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,330
I called, you know, I left like
three phone messages. I left five.

236
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,290
So finally they called me back
like 20 minutes later said, okay,

237
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,950
we're sending a technician over to
fix the machine. Which was very cool.

238
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,380
I didn't think that would
happen. And so, you know,

239
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,240
the technician was there and he fixed
the machine and he helps me deposit these

240
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:19,220
$25 and then, um, it, we start
talking and he was, he was like,

241
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,980
yeah, you know, he knew
my mom cause you know,

242
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,830
he'd been talking to her on the phone.
He's like, I feel so bad for your mom.

243
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,650
We've been getting so many of these
cases. And I'm like, why are you,

244
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,780
why a lot of these
cases, yeah. I was like,

245
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,500
why are you guys getting so why is
everyone coming to you? And he's like, oh,

246
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,101
I know why.

247
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:39,101
Because in the ransom note that they give
a list of preferred vendors and we are

248
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,370
number one or two.

249
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,780
What does the introduction with
a bad introduction to Bitcoin,

250
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,370
like we're going to hold you ransom
for all your information until you,

251
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,630
you know, use this new currency to pay
us off. I mean, that's so terrible.

252
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,990
This is Mike Coats and John [inaudible].
They are the co owners of coins.

253
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,160
I had a few weeks back, a
grandmother who was in tears.

254
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,460
She was going to lose all of her family
photos and because the deadline was

255
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:06,610
coming up, you know, crawling on
the phone to me and it got it.

256
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:07,750
It felt horrible.

257
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,050
Now clearly people who sell bitcoin just
believe that there should be a digital

258
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,840
currency that is decentralized.
It doesn't rely on the banks,

259
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,410
but unfortunately it has become
the currency of choice for ransom.

260
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,850
And so they, they're
in this weird position.

261
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,080
So it's a tricky thing because like,

262
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,630
I can't sell bitcoin to someone who I
know is going to do something illegal with

263
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,150
it, right.

264
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,420
That's will wheeler who runs a
bitcoin exchange called express coin.

265
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:35,230
And he says he and the other exchanges
are really worried right now that if they

266
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:38,710
keep helping the little guys pay the
ransom in order to get their files back,

267
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,800
they are in effect making
themselves accessories to a crime.

268
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,750
I finally got a call
back from a fin cen, uh,

269
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,260
which is the federal authority for
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

270
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,290
They said that we could perceive
paying a ransom as unlawful activity.

271
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,050
And so they might choose to use that
against the company who helps out, right.

272
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,920
And likely until we get a straight
answer from Vince and we'll take the, uh,

273
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,190
overly cautious approach and start
declining these transactions.

274
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,800
Even though in your heart you
want to help. Well, yeah, I mean,

275
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,140
do I want to risk being indicted
for helping you get your, uh,

276
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,300
travel receipts reimbursed
from your company? And I
mean, to me the answer's no.

277
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,543
In any case,

278
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,730
after Alina deposits the extra 25
bucks in her mom's bitcoin account,

279
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,550
ina the mom goes online,
[inaudible] leaked

280
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,140
and it was gone.

281
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,880
But then about an hour later,

282
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,930
I went to my computer and
[inaudible] the message that you are

283
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,810
Lynn Jones out that I was
doing the half hours late,

284
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,310
you have to pay

285
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,740
$1,300 roughly.

286
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,010
I did not have anybody to turn to.

287
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,010
So she went to that same website
where you can write them a message.

288
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,080
I wrote them that I was late,

289
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:10,350
but I mentioned the snow storm,

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,940
the things given, which they
probably [inaudible] off.

291
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,070
And the, of course,

292
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,900
the wonderful u s uh, mail service.

293
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,260
I said that I tried and I was only two
hours late and then all of a sudden

294
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,150

I am getting the message you paid in full

296
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,480
[inaudible]

297
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,170
without any explanation.
Nothing you pay. That's it.

298
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
And I got all my files back.

299
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,873
Oh,

300
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,490
do you think that they
took pity on her eye?

301
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Maybe I felt that

302
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,640
it's over. Finally. It's really over.

303
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,180
No.

304
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,940
[inaudible]

305
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,350
it does make you wonder
like who these people are.

306
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,640
Leave a story about that up next

307

was shot by police in summer 2016 he

323
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:18,330
pleaded with the autistic
man next to him to lie down.

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

329
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,100
So here's the next obvious who did this to

330
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,810
you know like do we know
anything about them?

331
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,390
When we put that question to a Joseph
men investigative reporter for Reuters,

332
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,540
done a ton of work in this area
and his hunch was that Inas right?

333
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,030
We're talking people,
Russian speaking folks.

334
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,640
By and large you had a book
called fatal system error,

335
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:07,510
which is sort of a deep dive into the
Russian hacking scene and much of it is as

336
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:11,830
you'd expect, you know, young guys, early
twenties kind of Grubby by and large,

337
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,630
they do not live a lavish lifestyle.

338
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,920
There are guys at the top of
these criminal organizations
that are very flashy

339
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,380
there like sort of pop icon,

340
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,580
some of them in the same way that rap
stars are in the u s there's a hacker

341
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:32,581
magazine with Gino as has has guys with
their sports cars and the supermodels

342
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,140
and whatever, you know,
buying bottle service,

343
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,840
you know discos at three in the morning.

344
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,760
Those are the guys who
hire the 20 year olds.

345
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,090
They hired the 20 year olds where they're
their franchise and he says the 20

346
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,710
year old brants working

347
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,890
office parks. Yeah, it's like a
call center type of atmosphere.

348
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,550
Is there like you know that's pretty Sir
Kelsey Padgett Ivan in a cubicle at his

349
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:55,450
computer board.

350
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,560
He has a meeting later with Judy
in HR and he's mad about it.

351
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,650
Is that the kind of like environment
that these people are in?

352
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,570
For the most part? I think so, yes.

353
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,230
The larger point is that it's not just
like you're a lone wolf pimply faced

354
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:12,760
hacker anymore. Cybercrime
is now super organized.

355
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,470
It is often corporate.

356
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,650
It is big business in the whole sort of
economy seems to revolve around these

357
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:24,250
secret sites where people come together
to buy and sell, things like that.

358
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:28,060
Ransomware from our last story there,
these underground web forms, the end,

359
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,270
there's a variety. Some are available.
You can reach you on the open Internet.

360
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,350
The more impressive ones are
password protected. You know,

361
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:39,250
you have to know somebody to get
in the really, really fancy ones.

362
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
You have to have a couple
of people vouch for you.

363
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,380
You actually have to apply with
your resume, your hackers resume.

364
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,790
Here are the things I can bring.

365
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,540
These are the kinds of hacking exploits
that I've had and therefore I should be

366
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,490
part of your exclusivity

367
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,603
club.

368
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,240
That Stina Temple rast in NPR,
cyber crime correspondent.

369
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,480
She's been tracking the government's
attempts to shut down some of these sites,

370
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:03,650
which she describes as sort of
a hackers black market. Bizarre.

371
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,980
So let's say someone is looking for a
bunch of credit card numbers that have

372
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,410
been stolen. You can get it
there. There's at one price,

373
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:12,290
if they're mastercard gold and
another price for you know,

374
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,640
a higher level credit, whatever.

375
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,380
Let's say you wanted to know about a
boss or an employee or a girlfriend,

376
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,060
you can get this piece of software that
allows you to turn on their phone at

377
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,591
any, anytime.

378
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:26,450
You could basically ease drop on them
cause you're in their pocket and for $300

379
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:30,200
a month you would actually get customer
service and the prices actually keep

380
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:34,280
coming down. It's a very, very
evolved fluid marketplace.

381
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,500
There's feedback and there's escrow.

382
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,300
There are feedback forms coming that CIF
was not really, there was like didn't,

383
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:44,840
didn't do the fee, the robbery. Right.
Absolutely. Particularly for something.

384
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,010
You'll see it a lot for

385
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,580
um, freshness of credit cards. Cause
you know, it's easy to say, you know,

386
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,290
here are 10,000 credit card numbers,

387
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,650
but if their credit card numbers had
been out for awhile and get declined,

388
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:58,140
everybody you've just wasted your money
and these people were called rippers a

389
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,880
is in there ripping you off and they
will get banned from the form. Wow.

390
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,670
It's reputational. Just like
everywhere else. Yeah. And it's,

391
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,570
it's as good as Ebay. If you
feel safe doing business on Ebay,

392
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,210
there's no reason you shouldn't feel
safe doing business with the criminals.

393
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,490
Now, uh,

394
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,490
all of this to me frankly felt like just
a sexy hacker talk until a couple of

395
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,050
months ago, Dina started telling
us about this one particular site.

396
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:23,050
Actually the biggest of these
kinds of sites. It's out there.

397
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:24,500
It's called dark code. Yeah.

398
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,170
The way it has been described by law
enforcement is sort of an amazon.com for

399
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,040
hackers. Actually,

400
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,250
here's specifically how us attorney
David Hickson described to her in an

401
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:33,940
interview.

402
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:33,980
Uh,

403
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,980
dark code is the largest English speaking
criminal cyber crime forum in the

404
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:40,330
world.

405
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,760
And one of the, I think most people know
Silk Road and they know, for example,

406
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:47,810
you could get a contract hit a a
from Silk Road and drugs and guns and

407
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,500
everything else.

408
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,950
So would it be right for me to say
that this was sort of a Silk Road for

409
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,580
hackers?

410
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,470
Yeah, I wouldn't want to
draw that direct comparison.

411
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:56,030
I think it's probably accurate.

412
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,680
I would say that all measure of cyber
crime that you see and watch around the

413
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,050
world was in some form or
fashion connected through it.

414
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,920
So we got really interested
in this world of this site,

415
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,540
dark coat in the people in it.

416
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,530
And so with Deena we started calling
around trying to find anyone that would

417
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:16,190
talk. And after weeks of searching
and calling and lawyering,

418
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,710
we found a guy who agreed
to go on the record.

419
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:22,700
My name is Daniel [inaudible]
and uh, I am a reformed hacker

420
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,470
as far as we know. Dan has never
talked about this publicly.

421
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,960
So how did you get
involved with Darko? Well,

422
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,540
I was one of the people who created it

423
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,930
a very long time ago. Daniel story
begins, not in Russia, but in Milwaukee.

424
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:41,080
Sure. Well, let me, let me start
with a little bit of con's.

425
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,790
Small Middleclass suburb
right outside of Milwaukee.

426
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,300
Do you have brothers and sisters? Two
younger brothers and two younger sisters.

427
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,030
Big family.

428
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,530
You have to share rooms with them or
were you in your own little kingdom?

429
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,490
[inaudible] I shared a room with both
my brothers for a lot of years. In fact,

430
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:58,760
that sort of plays into the story cause
he says what he would do to sort of

431
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:03,050
escape is go to the basement and
play video games. So yes, the,

432
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,350
the stereotypical hacker in his
parent's basement. I know, I know.

433
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,990
It's quite hilarious.

434
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,370
Dan says his hacking began innocently
enough when he would monkey with games

435
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,550
like age of empires. I hadn't
changed the graphics change,

436
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:20,600
the artificial intelligence of the
game, the way it plays, um, rework it,

437
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:24,230
create new maps, that type of
thing. Um, something I enjoyed.

438
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,530
And slowly, uh, throughout my teenage
years that developed into something more

439
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,460
[inaudible]

440
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,810
I, uh, did not get along well
with a lot of my peers in,

441
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:41,470
in grade, in middle
school. So I spent, um,

442
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,320
a lot more time know on the computer
and on myself than I did, um,

443
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,910
socially at least at that age.

444
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,650
And he says one day he was in a chat room
and internet chat room was called game

445
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:56,160
search, talking with a bunch of other
people about video games. And um,

446
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,520
at some point along the way he
meets this guy, you know, this,

447
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,530
this particular guy was into,
you know, botnets. Oh yes.

448
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:09,530
Botnets. We all cry. Yeah. Just remind
us what, what, what's going on there.

449
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,000
Botnets are, you know, malware
viruses installed on computers and um,

450
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,963
botnets, you know,

451
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,270
are the way to centrally control a whole
lot of infected computers. Just to,

452
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,440
to put this in context for saying, cause
I think this is totally fascinating.

453
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,213
Joseph Mens says that this whole

454
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,820
botnet situation, it started with spam.

455
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,210
One of the easiest ways to make money on
the Internet back pre 2000 a was spam.

456
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,120
Spam is in and out, penis
extensions, all that stuff.

457
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:40,910
What happened was that the, in the olden
days, most servers mail servers, uh,

458
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,390
acted as open relays,

459
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,630
meaning the mail people wouldn't really
pay attention to who was sending what.

460
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,600
So the spammers with spam, with abandon,

461
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,800
and then spam got to be enough of a
problem that the techies of the world

462
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,680
decided that's it. They
started to block people.

463
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:59,340
Like if they found a guy who they thought
was sending too many product emails or

464
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,030
whatever,

465
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,510
they would block his IP address so
that he couldn't send any more mail.

466
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,520
So what the spammers and their contractors
then needed to do was to have a bunch

467
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,750
of clean IP addresses
and send spam from that.

468
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,780
So what they did, which is
totally genius, totally evil,

469
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,960
is they hired a bunch of programmers
to create a bunch of viruses,

470
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,480
disseminated those viruses
across the internet.

471
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,910
People would accidentally click or open
something, get them onto their computer,

472
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,210
and then suddenly the spammers could
now remote control our computers at a

473
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:36,780
distance whenever they wanted for maybe
just an hour or two a night to send out

474
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,660
their spam because these were
clean IP addresses. Of course.

475
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,200
What happened is that once the
spammers had these botnets,

476
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,630
they started thinking, Hey, I
could do something else with this.

477
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,690
And the next thing that came along
was denial of service attacks.

478
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,370
You can have all of them tried to contact
ebay.com at the same time and knock

479
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:53,980
over Ebay.

480
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,980
This first gentleman that I ran
into, he had a botnets of um,

481
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,600
well over a thousand computers, which
you know, at the time was amazing to me,

482
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,640
you know, by today's
standards, a thousand for.

483
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,120
And that is nothing now they can get
up into the millions. But um, you know,

484
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,210
back then it was quite incredible to me
and cause he says he was in this chat

485
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:13,120
room, this guy was there and this guy
would get into fights with people.

486
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,260
And anytime he did,

487
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,820
he'd point his 1000 computer drone
army at that enemy and bet few, man,

488
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:21,700
I'm gonna Knock your Internet offline
and there's nothing you can do about it.

489
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,410
You know, if it was something in a game,

490
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:26,530
he could knock the game server that
they were playing on offline, you know,

491
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,870
stop their game. Things like that.

492
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,030
Take away years ball back
in 1935. That is exactly it.

493
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,160
Taking away someone else's
ball over the internet.

494
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:40,450
So this for some reason intrigued you?
Yes. It was amazing to me. I'm like,

495
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,510
you have of a thousand
computers. Wow. You know, how,

496
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,370
how did you do this? You know, I, I had,

497
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,730
at the time I had never heard of botnets.
I didn't know about any of this stuff.

498
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:52,430
Like how did you, how did you
get the software to do this?

499
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:54,470
How did you get it onto
all these computers?

500
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,260
And he was quite happy to tell you
all that. Oh, he certainly was this,

501
00:29:57,261 --> 00:30:00,290
this particular gentleman
had a very large ego.

502
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,570
And did you see him as a bad
guy? Um, yeah. To be honest,

503
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:09,260
I, I think at that age
I didn't really, uh,

504
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,090
think about it that deeply. It's
the Internet. It's a lot harder to,

505
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,630
um, kind of quantify right
and wrong there. I mean,

506
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,480
now doesn't mean it's easy to look back
at that and say, yeah, this is wrong,

507
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:23,150
but it's not like going up to someone
and punching them in the face.

508
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,670
There's no human connection there.

509
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:27,740
You don't see these people
or feel these people.

510
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,110
He says at the time it
was just sheer curiosity.

511
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,380
Okay.

512
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,400
So he says he asked this Pied Piper guy
to send him some with the Bot software

513
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,160
that made the botnet go. And that
really intrigued me, you know,

514
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:42,310
digging through the source code, trying
to understand what is this thing doing,

515
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:45,040
how does it work, how does it tick?
And this guy, was he a good coder?

516
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,900
Like is he good at it? Was he
good at it? Yeah. Uh, no, no,

517
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,440
I, I would, uh, you know,
in hindsight now, you know,

518
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:57,100
he's what I would classify as a
script kitty. You know, someone who

519
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,560
that is, but it's a whole new
curse to read off a script Kiddie.

520
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,650
So a script kitty is someone who has just
enough technical ability to Kinda take

521
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,450
some tools and software that other people
have created and just use them. Yeah.

522
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:14,284
To fast forward.

523
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,520
As Dan went the opposite direction of
the script kitties and got better and

524
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,290
better and started making these botnets
that could literally spy on people as

525
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,670
they were using their computers.

526
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,490
Interesting to see all the porn that
people are watching, that type of thing.

527
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,650
He says he found himself in another
chat room that was called Bach Talk.

528
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,820
This kind of place where hackers swap
tips. Brag like, Hey, look what I did.

529
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,190
I had to face this website,
take a look, and he says,

530
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,860
one day he was talking with a coder
friend of his guy named is there though we

531
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:46,600
were talking and why don't we set up a
community where we can really filter who

532
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:50,470
gets to join and to let all these
script kitties and idiots in,

533
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,550
I actually chose the name. I came
up with that a nice lame name.

534
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,470
I actually think it's pretty little
name again. Dark Code. Dark Code.

535
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,960
It's like with the carer.
K. O. D. E I think. Right?

536
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,750
It seemed cooler with the k. Yes.

537
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:07,450
So we chose the name and started getting
the site set up the rules where it

538
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:08,470
would be invite only.

539
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,350
So you had to have an invite and
each new person would be required to

540
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:14,230
demonstrate their skill. You know, here's
a piece of software that I created,

541
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,690
or here's a video of my botnet and action.

542
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,750
And at some point I'm not too
long after it was created,

543
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,450
it was decided for one reason
or another that you know, hey,

544
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:25,180
we got all these programmers on
here, that's great, but you know,

545
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:28,300
they also want to be able to sell
some of the stuff they're making.

546
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:33,301
So let's invite some people who would
be willing to buy some of this stuff.

547
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,590
This now begins to sound like a fair,
you said, well, I have a burglar's tool.

548
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,410
Do you a door, you want a burgle
and then I'll rent you my tool.

549
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,860
That's a simplification. But
yeah, people would post and say,

550
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,750
I'm looking to buy x, or here's
this piece of software I created.

551
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,280
Here's all the things it does,

552
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:55,250
here's some screenshots of it
in action and here's the price.

553
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,950
Could be a certain type
of botnet software.

554
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,830
It could be buying a
botnet itself. You know,

555
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,120
if you don't want to build one yourself,

556
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,300
you want to buy us one that somebody else
already created and has going. I mean,

557
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:10,301
I can get you onto 200,000 or 20,000
computers just giving me a check.

558
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,900
Yeah. What they called them were
installs, installs, you know, hey guys,

559
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:19,850
I've got installs and they're
$10 per 1000 something like that.

560
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,620
Now this is something that's sort of
surprising to us that when it comes to

561
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:28,490
botnets that there's this whole rental
market that's frighteningly affordable.

562
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,510
Yeah, it's bargain basement. In fact,
we were talking with one reporter,

563
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,030
Kelly Jackson Higgins,

564
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,970
who is the executive editor of dark
reading.com which is a cyber security new

565
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:42,170
site, and she told us you can actually
rent a botnet if you really wanted to.

566
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,120
You could rent a botnet for one hour
for about $38 a month in some cases as I

567
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:51,380
was 20 yes. As low as $20 a month. I can
go rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month.

568
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,283
You could.

569
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,280
It's like renting space here or you want
to use this to go do damage somewhere

570
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,870
or you want to make a statement
or you have some plan for,

571
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,450
do you want to send
some spam? Here you go.

572
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,800
You could go online right now and probably
find somewhere out there on the net,

573
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,570
somebody who will sell you access to
computers for cents a piece and these are

574
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,340
like people's computers,
like your computer,

575
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,850
my computer and Dan says as
dark code got bigger and bigger,

576
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,240
he began to see more of this
kind of activity on the site.

577
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,640
Like some guy would have a
bot net of 5,000 computers.

578
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,140
Another guy would have some software,

579
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:25,580
like the ransomware software guy would
then rent the botnet from guy one install

580
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,700
his ransomware ransom. These
poor people then move on.

581
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,230
You know, some of the
people were, you know,

582
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:32,910
doing some pretty
unpleasant things, you know,

583
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:37,050
moving more into the kind of financial
crimes territory, you know, which is,

584
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,950
you know, something that I really
never had a desire to be involved in.

585
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,740
It was largely because of that. He says
that in 2009, he decided to get out,

586
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,270
but unfortunately, the next year
I got a lovely visit from the FBI.

587
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,660
Um, they promptly, uh,

588
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,790
was it a like kick down in your door type
situation? They knocked, they knocked,

589
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,710
so, okay. What was that like? Ah,
pretty terrifying. You know, what, uh,

590
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,070
what's going to happen to me? What's gonna
Happen next and what did happen next?

591
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,790
I don't know how much of that
I can talk about, but, um,

592
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,660
I did cooperate with the government
and I have cooperated with them for the

593
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:19,290
last, you know, five plus years now
was a kick in the butts. You know,

594
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:24,060
my parents, uh, kind of kicked me
out. Not that kicked me out, but, uh,

595
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,850
assisted me with a rapid move out and, uh,

596
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,280
I've been living on my own since then
and, uh, became gainfully employed,

597
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,240
had a few jobs, um,

598
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,620
became a little bit more and
more serious, uh, with my,

599
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:45,390
my then girlfriend who is now
my wife. So, um, you know,

600
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,450
it's given me an opportunity over the
last five years to really make some

601
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:52,800
serious changes to my life.
[inaudible]. Meanwhile,

602
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,910
over the same five years,

603
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:58,911
dark code grew into this massive
cyber criminal swat mean where tens of

604
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,600
thousands of stolen social security
numbers were bought and sold.

605
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,020
Huge databases of personal information
and emails were bought and sold.

606
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:09,570
Malware and software of various
kinds are bought and sold.

607
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,810
And this continued coin to Dina Temple
and right up until July 15th of this

608
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:16,980
year, July 15th, 2015

609
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,850
today marks a milestone in our efforts
to bring to justice some of the most

610
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:23,430
significant cyber criminals in the world.

611
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,210
What ended up happening on July 15th is
that the FBI had actually gotten into

612
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,570
Darko with a number of intelligence
services from around the world,

613
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,700
and they had an 18 month investigation
in which they took down, right?

614
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,510
In the end, 28 people.

615
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,720
The FBI has effectively
smashed the Hornet's nest,

616
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:46,070
and we are in the process of
rounding up and charging the Hornets.

617
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,850
But here's, here's what's amazing, right?

618
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:52,080
So they take down a more than two
dozen people. Two weeks later,

619
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,910
dark code is up again, which just
popped back up, just popped back up.

620
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,570
A deep gratitude to
NPRs Dina Tempo Reston,

621
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,480

going on this whole project. Yeah.

622
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,960
Props to Kelsey paget do produce our first
segment and emails who produced their

623
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:21,920
second segment and who can from memory
give you the extended family tree of dark

624
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:24,200
code. It's just right out of
his head, right of his head.

625
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,530
You got original music this hour from
dub mood and Bianco Bay. Yeah. Wow.
