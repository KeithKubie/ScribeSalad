00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.100
Sometimes a good mystery can be satisfying
even without a solution, but when it comes

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.551
to TV, fans tend to prefer their questions
answered, and loose ends tied up. But not

00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.870
every TV show gets the time needed to tell
the story the creators intended, since networks

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.390
care more about ratings than leaving their
fans scrambling from unresolved cliffhangers

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.119
or random twists with no explanation. Here
are Screen Rant’s 10 TV Plot Holes That

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.420
Will Never Be Answered.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
The Walking Dead

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.100
The first season of the The Walking Dead had
its cast of survivors looking for an explanation

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.899
for the zombie outbreak, and possibly a cure.
They eventually learned what readers of the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.810
comic already knew: the zombie infection is
carried by every human, living or dead. In

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.270
other words, no matter how a person dies,
they're already a zombie just waiting to be

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.289
born. Creator Robert Kirkman has no intention
of explaining where the pathogen came from,

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.670
but fans shouldn't bother even trying to explain
how it&nbsp;works. Despite the show's attempts

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.490
at using real science to describe the infection,
bodies that can move without bloodflow or

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.409
organs are already impossible. To make things
worse, the comic series has implied zombie

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.530
bodies decay like real flesh, which means
nearly all should be liquid after a month

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
or two, and skeletons after a year. Let’s
just hope that Fear The Walking Dead will

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.079
answer this mythical question!

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.079
FlashForward

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.079
When ABC's Lost was coming to an end, the
network was looking for a new sci-fi phenomenon

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.079
to take its place. And when FlashForward began,
it seemed they had found it. The premise hooked

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.079
audiences immediately, when every person on
Earth blacked out for 137 seconds, and saw

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.079
a vision of themselves six months in the future.
The show debuted to huge ratings, but the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.079
20 episodes that followed saw the audience
fall by more than half. ABC cancelled plans

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.079
for a second season, but only after the finale
had been filmed, leaving characters' lives

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.079
in danger, and another blackout showing different
visions even farther ahead. The cliffhanger

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.079
was all fans got, with only their imagination
to offer any real ending.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.079
Game of Thrones

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.079
The fantasy series deals mainly with the politics
of noble men and women, but from the very

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.240
start, it was the mysterious White Walkers
who stole the show. The blue-eyed creatures

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.130
have faded into legend by the time the series
begins, having remained hidden for over 8,000

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.329
years, but the massive Wall built to keep
them in the North shows they were once the

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.460
greatest threat ever seen. The creatures appear
as frozen zombies in the TV series, but author

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.750
George R. R. Martin describes the White Walkers,
or "Others" differently: in the novels, they

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.250
are beautiful beings who speak an ancient
tongue, craft impossible weapons, and are

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.000
nearly unstoppable in every way. In other
words: TV audiences hoping to see their origins

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.930
or motivations explained shouldn't hold their
breath. No one is left alive who remembers,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.470
anyway.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.009
Lost

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.221
It’s no secret that ABC’s Lost raised
more questions than it did answers, with some

00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.890
of the strangest twists or mysteries in the
series left completely unresolved by the time

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.000
the series ended. Much was made of Hurley’s
connection to the Numbers, 4,8,15,16,23,42

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.420
– used in the Swan station, blown wide open
in the season 1 finale. But the horrible run

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.430
of bad luck that they brought Hurley, referred
to as “a curse” by the man who first uncovered

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.650
them, is never explained. Was it a curse,
or all in his head? But one of the most debated

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.480
questions is one the writers simply refuse
to solve. When season 5 saw Sawyer and Juliet’s

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.340
group exchange gunfire with another boat,
fans expected to find out who the unknown

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.130
men actually were. No answer ever came, and
the most obvious assumptions were thrown out

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.601
when the showrunners claimed it was a closely-guarded
secret. DVD extras hinted that it may have

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:07.959
been the time-travelling crew of the 19th
century ship stranded on the island, but until

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:46.430
the writers spill 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:58.870
the beans, fans only have theories to debate.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.590
Awake

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.459
Not every TV show can win over critics on
its premise alone, but even with star Jason

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.370
Isaacs, it was the fractured format of NBC’s
Awake that hooked early viewers. After a car

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.330
accident leaves Detective Michael Britten’s
son dead, he and his wife attempt to rebuild

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.101
their shattered home life. Until Michael goes
to sleep, and wakes up in a world where it

00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.920
was his wife who died in the car accident
instead. Unsure of which reality was the “real”

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.040
one, he realizes that details from a current
case in each reality help him solve the mystery

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.130
in the other. Despite the reality-bending
hook and solid cast, Awake was cancelled during

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.360
its first season, meaning the writers had
time to adjust their finale, showing Michael,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.330
his wife and son all reunited. But it’s
not an answer to the core question of the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.860
show: Creator Kyle Killen said the original
ending couldn’t work in so short a time,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.160
meaning the finale is just further fracturing
of Michael’s mind – not a happy ending.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.010
