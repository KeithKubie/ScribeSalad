00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.069
- [Instructor] We are
now going to go the east

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.492
and explore Ancient China.

00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:09.747
And we're going to do that in
the second millennium B.C.E.,

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:12.944
where we see some of the
first great dynasties

00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.814
of Ancient China emerging.

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:19.814
So if we go to roughly
the 16th century, B.C.E.,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:26.219
so that would be about 3600 years ago,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.282
we have the emergence
of the Shang Dynasty,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.082
and what's significant
about the Shang Dynasty

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.662
is it's the first dynasty
where we have significant

00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:38.026
archaeological evidence of its existence.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:40.304
We have a lot of evidence
in this area where,

00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:43.244
do you see, highlighted in
red, where the Shang Dynasty

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.816
existed with its capital at Yin,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.733
near the modern-day city of Anyang.

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:52.468
Now, we have accounts
of a Dynasty before it,

00:00:52.468 --> 00:00:56.685
the Xia or the Chia Dynasty,
although we do not have

00:00:56.685 --> 00:01:00.334
significant archaeological evidence of it.

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:02.384
But the accounts say that the Xia Dynasty

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:05.401
would have been around
for roughly 500 years

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:09.201
before we get to this 16th century B.C.E.,

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.648
with the emergence of the Shang Dynasty.

00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:15.882
Now just to get ourselves
acquainted in time and space,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.748
and think about, well
what else was happening

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:21.722
around 1600 B.C.E., we
could remind ourselves

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:25.889
that that was during the new
kingdom in Ancient Egypt,

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:30.695
right around here, the
height of Ancient Egypt's

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.445
power was right around that time.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.828
We could think about the Hittite Empire

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:39.241
that we study in other videos,

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.948
we could think about Mycenaean Greece.

00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:46.499
Around 1600 B.C.E. is
when you start having,

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.471
or when you have the
decline of the Indus Valley

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.615
civilization, also known as
the Harappan civilization,

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:55.953
and you start to have the Vedic period,

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:59.120
where you have these Indo-Aryan people

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.739
start to migrate into Northern India.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.906
In Mesopotamia, you have
the Assyrian Middle Kingdom

00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:12.381
right around here, so
this is all happening

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:17.022
in this mid- to late-second
millennium B.C.E.,

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:20.573
which is roughly the time
of the Shang Dynasty.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.498
Now the Shang Dynasty was
known for many things,

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.871
it was a Bronze Age culture,
and you can see depicted here,

00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:31.578
many examples of that and
this is pretty impressive

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:34.899
work with bronze, this
is a bronze battle axe

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.198
right over here, you can
imagine a handle for this axe,

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:40.661
something like this, this
is nothing that you would

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.445
want to deal with in a battle,
and you can see these other

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:48.612
very significant, large,
bronze crafts, handiwork,

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.612
that the Shang Dynasty
was able to produce.

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.456
Now what the Shang Dynasty
is also well-known for

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:03.392
is their writing, it's the first evidence

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:05.780
of a fairly advanced writing form,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.697
and it's related to modern Chinese.

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:12.494
And a lot of that writing,
the significant artifacts

00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:15.898
from that time are on what
are called oracle bones.

00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:18.503
That's an oracle bone right over here,

00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:22.261
this is actually the scapula,
the shoulder blade of an ox,

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:24.322
and what they would do is
they would write questions

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:28.489
in this oracle bone script on
top of that scapula of an ox

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:32.109
and then they would heat it up in a flame

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.097
or some type of source
of heat until it cracks

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:37.103
and then they would interpret the cracks

00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:40.748
to see what was the answer
to their actual questions.

00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:42.966
And you can actually see
how this oracle bone script

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:45.643
is related to modern Chinese script.

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:49.476
So this is Shang written
in oracle bone script

00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:54.046
and you can see how it evolved over time

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:56.946
to the modern-day Chinese script.

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.777
Even though if you go
straight from that to that,

00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:00.625
they look reasonably different,

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.961
but when you look at the evolution,

00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:06.017
you can see that they
have lot of commonality.

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:09.617
You also see it in words, right over here,

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:12.509
shows you evolution of the word tiger,

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.416
and once again, this is
the oracle bone script

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.732
and you can see it looks
right here like a picture

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:20.372
of a tiger, but then it evolved over time

00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:23.289
to the modern form right over here.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.501
Now, this Shang civilization,
it's no coincidence

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.566
that first the Xia and then the Shang,

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:31.519
that they develop over
here in the yellow river

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.478
and the Yangtze River valleys,
we've talked about it,

00:04:34.478 --> 00:04:36.451
the Ancient Egyptians, the Mesopotamians,

00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:39.339
all of the Indus Valley civilization,

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:42.231
they all started where
agriculture first emerged,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.930
which tended to be in these
river valley civilizations.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.644
Now the Shang in particular,
not only were they known

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:49.144
for their bronze work,

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:50.858
they were known for their large cities,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.833
they were known for their
complex social structures,

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:57.950
they were known especially near
the end of the Shang period,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.714
for having chariots, and some people think

00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:01.395
that because they had chariots,

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:05.294
there might have been contacts
with folks further west.

00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:08.992
Now the Shang Dynasty, I said
how the Xia Dynasty lasted

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.767
for over 500 years, and the
Shang Dynasty also lasts

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:15.579
for on the order of 500 years,

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.425
which is a very very very very long time.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.631
But as we get to the middle
of the 11th century B.C.E.,

00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.228
it would reach its end.

00:05:25.228 --> 00:05:29.837
The last king of the Shang
Dynasty is this gentleman

00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:34.174
right over here, this
would be Dix Xin or Di Shin

00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:36.896
and the accounts have
him initially in his rule

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:40.739
as being a very capable
ruler, but later in his rule,

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:44.661
he seems to get more corrupt,
becomes less competent

00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:48.828
of a ruler, his favorite
consort Daji, right over here,

00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:54.255
she's a bit of a not-so-popular
figure in Chinese history,

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:55.762
a lot of people think that she helped,

00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:59.073
or they blame her for corrupting Di Xin,

00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:02.049
and so he eventually faces his end

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:06.553
in the Battle of Muye,
against King Wu of Zhou

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:10.137
or Joe is actually the correct
pronouncing, King Wu of Zhou,

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:13.955
and King Wu of Zhou is
able to defeat Di Xin

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:18.122
at the Battle of Muye, and that
is the end of Shang Dynasty

00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:23.023
and it begins the Zhou
Dynasty, which will go on

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:26.595
for another 800 years,
that's pretty impressive,

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:30.046
how continuous these
dynasties actually are,

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:33.516
and after that battle, Di Xin
goes off and commits suicide,

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:35.134
and this right over here is a depiction

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:39.561
of King Wu of Zhou, who
starts the Zhou Dynasty.

00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.374
But the big picture here
is we're talking about huge

00:06:41.374 --> 00:06:45.033
swaths of time and we have a significant,

00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:47.691
I guess you could say,
civilization, that started

00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.122
with the river valleys
in China but it's amazing

00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:52.487
how continuous these civilizations were

00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:56.712
and it's almost amazing how
modern their writing was

00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:59.147
relative to modern Chinese script

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:02.303
and that's why historians
believe that writing of this form

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:04.942
was, because of how advanced it was,

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:08.236
was probably in place
for a long time before

00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:10.817
we see these oracle bones,
so even though we don't have

00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:13.691
the strong archaeological evidence yet

00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.585
for the Xia Dynasty,
there's a lot of evidence

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:18.703
that by the time the Shang came about,

00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:22.809
the Chinese civilization was
already quite well-developed

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.226
around the Yellow River and the Yangtze.
