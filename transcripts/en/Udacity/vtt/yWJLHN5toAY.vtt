00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.240
Wow.
There was a lot to learn in this lesson.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.090
Now that we've got an understanding
of modern application design,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.410
including the micro
services design pattern,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.270
we can see how Modern Apps are pushing
the limits of current automation tools.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.130
Instead of being one large Binary,
now these applications

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.290
are composed of many parts which
are smaller, easier to write and deploy.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.628
These smaller independent binaries have
led to on demand updates that can happen

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:23.170
at any time.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.550
This is led to a rethink
of the tooling and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.000
underlying infrastructure we're
using to support these modern apps.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020
These requirements have led to a new
set of automation tools like Docker and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.370
Kubernetes.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.570
Stay tuned for our next lesson where you
learn how to use the Docker image format

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.900
to containerize applications.
