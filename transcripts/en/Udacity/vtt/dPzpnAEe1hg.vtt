00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.210
Alright Charles, you were about to say, how we could do this.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.150
&gt;&gt; I think the answer is, simply, that we basically need to flip the, here's

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.480
my thinking. We need to flip zero and

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.340
one, which suggests that either our weight or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.870
our threshold needs to be negative. And since we, we The threshold is in above,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.345
it's going to end up being our weight being negative. So, let's say, if we have a

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.010
zero, we want to turn that into something above

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.360
the threshold and if it's a one, we

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.430
want it to be below the threshold. So,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220
why don't we make the weight negative one.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.058
&gt;&gt; And that, that turn a zero into a zero

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:40.750
and it will turn a one into a minus one. Alright.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.350
&gt;&gt; And so, then the threshold just has to be zero.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.730
&gt;&gt; So that would mean that anything,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.420
I see, so anything that's negative will be

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.230
greater than, zero or negative would be greater than

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.820
or equal to the threshold. And anything on the other

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.290
side of that. would be under the threshold. So

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.890
we get this kind of dividing line at one, so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.500
were taking advantage of the fact the equation had

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.790
a greater than or equal to in it. So, yeah,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.003
right, that ought to be a Not. So ,we've got

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:16.020
And, Or, and Not are all expressible, as perceptron units.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.470
So and, or, and not are all expressible as perceptron units.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.140
&gt;&gt; Hey that's great because if we have AND,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.270
OR, and NOT, then we can represent any Boolean function.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.890
&gt;&gt; Well, do we know that? We know that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.990
if we combine them together, we combine these perceptron units

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.800
together Can we, can we express any perceptron, oh sorry,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.020
any boolean function that we want using a single perception?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.310
&gt;&gt; So, what do we normally do in this case?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.420
So ,what's the most evil function we can think of?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.340
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed, we'll when we're woking on, on decision trees The

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.760
thing that was so evil was the XOR, the called parity more generally.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.310
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.620
&gt;&gt; So, alright. I mean, may, maybe if we can do

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.790
that, we can do anything. So, let's, let's give it a shot.
