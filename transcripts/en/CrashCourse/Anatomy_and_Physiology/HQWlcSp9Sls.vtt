00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re
pretty replaceable.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.560
When it comes to your body, science has figured
out how to hack, synthesize, or replace a

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.309
surprising amount of its parts and processes.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.700
We have implants to keep heart beats steady,
and steel rods to mimic bones.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.080
We’ve got drugs that can replace hormones,
and antibiotics to cover for your immune system,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.180
and pretty soon you’ll be able to just 3D
print a new ear if you need one. Really!

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.700
But one thing we absolutely cannot manufacture
-- despite what True Blood would have you believe --

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.960
is blood.
And yet blood is a thing that we all need.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.540
And sometimes, because of injury or illness,
we need extra blood.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.400
In fact, every two seconds, someone in the
U.S. needs a blood transfusion. This could

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.660
be a victim of a car accident, someone undergoing
surgery, or a cancer patient who needs new

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.170
blood to maintain their health during chemotherapy.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.489
And because we can’t grow it on trees, or
make it in a lab, or even it store it for

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.829
all that long, the blood that people need
-- nearly 16 million pints a year in the U.S.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.220
-- has to come from people who have donated
it.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.649
So let’s talk blood, shall we?

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.289
The meal of choice for vampires and female
mosquitoes, blood is red, sticky, salty, and

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.280
kind of metallic tasting.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.549
It is indeed thicker than water, and super
viscous -- which is why Hitchcock used chocolate

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.690
syrup as a stand-in in a certain classic shower
scene.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.740
For most purposes, blood comes in eight different
types, and it accounts for about 8% of your body weight.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.450
You might remember from our episodes on tissues
that blood is a type of connective tissue,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.770
which means it’s made of living cells suspended
in a nonliving matrix, which in this case

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220
is the fluid ground substance called plasma.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.440
And of course one of blood’s main missions
is to transport and distribute oxygen, nutrients,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.360
waste products, and hormones around the body.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.180
But it also helps regulate and maintain body
temperature, pH levels, and the volume of

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.780
fluids in your body. Plus it protects you from
infection and from the loss of blood itself.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.980
Perhaps second only to your brain, your blood
is the one component of your body that we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.380
haven’t figured out how to reproduce, synthesize,
or imitate.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.620
It’s a part of you that is literally irreplaceable.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.880
It’s Saturday and you feel like doing a
good deed, so you head over to your local

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.400
Red Cross for a blood drive.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.960
You get your finger pricked and then somebody
directs you toward a lounge chair, swabs your

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.260
inner elbow with alcohol, and then comes at
you with a hollow needle.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.700
Once the bag is full -- they usually take
about a pint -- you get unhooked and grab

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.240
a cookie and a juice to replace the blood sugar you lost.
And the whole process takes around 20 minutes.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.400
But for your blood, the day is just beginning.
Soon it will be taken to a lab, where it’ll

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.080
be tested for infectious diseases and separated
into different parts before heading out to hospitals.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.319
So, hold up: What exactly do I mean by different
parts?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.390
Well, the blood that flows from your arm into
that bag is whole blood, a mixture of cells

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.310
and cell fragments called formed elements,
along with water, and lots of dissolved molecules.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.370
A patient who needs a transfusion may only
need some of those things and not others,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.680
so the parts are separated.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.459
Once your blood makes it to a lab, technicians
put it in a centrifuge, which spins it around

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.900
fast enough to send the heavier components
to the bottom of the tubes, and bring the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.520
less dense elements to the top.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.959
In the centrifuge, three distinct layers emerge.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.069
Down at the bottom you’ve got a heavy red
layer of erythrocytes, or red blood cells

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.960
that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. They make 
up about 45 percent of your total blood volume.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.340
Then you’ve got this thin little whitish
layer in the middle. Those are your warriors,

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.910
the leukocytes or white blood cells, that
defend your body from toxins and foreign microbes.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.629
And there are also the cell fragments, called
platelets, which help with blood clotting

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.920
and make up less than one percent of your
blood.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.280
Finally, up at the top you see the yellowish plasma,
which accounts for about 55%of your blood volume.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.100
Plasma is actually 90 percent water, but the
other 10 percent is chock full of 100 different

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.879
solutes, including proteins, electrolytes,
gases, hormones, and waste products.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.269
The most of abundant of these solutes are
electrolytes -- which you may have heard of

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.420
as the secret ingredient in sports drinks. But they’re
really just positively-charged cations -- like calcium,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.740
sodium, and potassium -- and negatively-charged
anions, like phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.320
Together these ions help regulate your blood’s
chemistry, maintaining its pH levels and proper osmotic

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.040
pressure, and allowing other tissues to do their jobs, like
making muscles contract and sending action potentials.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.200
But when measured by weight, the bulk of the
solutes in your blood are really the plasma proteins.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.480
Most of these proteins -- like albumin, and
alpha and beta globulins -- are made by the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.500
liver, and do things like balance the osmotic
pressure between the blood and surrounding

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.119
tissues, and transport lipids and ions.

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:24.619
Others run defense for you, like the gamma globulin
antibodies that are released by plasma cells during

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.060
an immune response, or fibrinogen proteins, which
are vital to forming blood clots and stopping bleeding.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.500
All right, bleeding. I want to talk about that.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.139
Because, for the very reason that I mentioned
at the beginning -- that we can’t replace

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.659
your blood with some synthetic wonder-fluid
-- the LAST THING that your circulatory system

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.369
wants is for you to fritter away your blood,
in some sidewalk scrape or kitchen accident.

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:49.469
So, it has a whole system in place to prevent
you from losing too much of it, through a

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.629
process known as hemostasis.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.080
So imagine you’re slicing a nice garlic-cheese
bagel one morning, and you lacerate the distal

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.860
phalanx of your pollex -- in other words,
you cut the tip of your thumb.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.689
And now you’re bleeding all over your breakfast.

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.509
At the very first sign of a rupture, the blood
vessel actually constricts itself, to slow

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.080
the flow of blood through it.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.509
Then little cell fragments called platelets
gather at the site of the injury, creating

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.960
a plug that dams the breech and keeps the
blood from leaking further.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.479
Now these free-floating platelets don’t clump
together during regular circulation -- that

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.849
would be terrible -- but when the endothelial
cells lining a blood vessel wall tear, the

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.949
underlying collagen fibers are suddenly exposed.
And they chemically react with the platelets,

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.879
turning them all sticky and glue-like at the
scene of the injury.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.869
But that platelet plug still isn’t as strong
as it could be -- it needs reinforcement to

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:35.460
complete the clotting process.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.999
This reinforcement comes in the form of fibrin
threads, protein strands that join together

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.249
to make a sort of mesh that traps the platelets
and blood cells.

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.460
Eventually, the threads actually pull the
opposite sides of the wound together, to close

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.529
the vessel wall, so the endothelial cells
can be replaced.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.240
Over a few days, the blood vessel heals, and
the blood clot dissolves.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.699
Or at least, that’s how it is supposed to
happen.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.939
People who suffer from disorders related to
hemostasis may have trouble with unwanted

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.040
clotting, or the inability to form clots.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.219
In the family of disorders known as hemophilia,
a patient can usually complete the first two

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:11.199
steps of hemostasis just fine, but they can’t
make an effective fibrin clot. So it’s not that they

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.700
bleed more than anyone else, it’s just that they bleed
longer. Which, I guess means that they bleed more.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.029
As a result, they may need frequent blood
transfusions throughout their lifetime.

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.779
Which brings me right back around to that
Saturday morning blood drive.

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.249
Another thing you’re going to need to know
before you give blood is what type you have

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:28.649
-- do you have A, B, AB, or O?

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:32.740
These different types all do the job equally
well, they just sort of have a different flavor

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.389
related to your immune system.

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.599
All the cells in your body have a plasma membrane
with specialized glycoprotein markers on them

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.909
that act like name tags or labels, sort of
like “This cell is Property of Hank.”

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:44.659
These markers are your antigens.

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.619
And your body’s immune system is totally
fine with your particular antigens, but if

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:53.369
it detects antigens from someone else’s
cells -- including viruses or bacteria -- then

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:58.609
it’ll send out antibodies to bind to those markers, often
to tag them for destruction by the immune system.

00:06:58.609 --> 00:07:03.360
Your red blood cells have specialized antigens on
them, called agglutinogens, that activate antibodies

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.300
that work by binding invading cells to each other,
which causes coagulation, or the clumping of blood.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.720
Which agglutinogens you have on your
erythrocytes defines your blood type.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.520
But they’re classified in two different ways.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.659
In the most important blood classification
-- the kind people are most familiar with

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:22.459
-- there are only two kind of agglutinogens,
simply A and B. And your blood can either have

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.820
one, or both, or neither of these molecules.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.880
So the name of your blood type refers to what
kind you have or don’t have: A-type has

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.319
A antigens, B-type has B, AB has both, and
O has neither.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.189
So, why do you need to know what type you
are before you give or receive blood?

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:40.399
Well, like I mentioned: If you have either
of these antigens, your body will be fine

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.309
with it, because it doesn’t produce any
antibodies that label it for attack.

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:47.199
So if you don’t have a particular antigen
on your blood cells -- say the type B -- then

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:52.919
you do have antibodies that are going to label those
B antigens for attack, should they enter your space.

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:57.709
So AB-type folks are called universal recipients,
because they have both antigens, and therefore

00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:04.539
no antibodies for either. So they can accept
A, or B, or AB, or O blood. Meanwhile, O-type

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:09.579
doesn’t have A or B antigens, so those folks
have antibodies for both. That means that they

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.700
can only accept other O blood.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.839
And yet that lack of antigens means that Type
O blood can mix with other types of blood

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.379
without getting attacked, which is why it’s
known as the universal donor.

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:22.779
But just to complicate things a little bit
more, you’ve got a whole other set of antigens

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:27.559
with totally different protocol. These are
your Rhesus, or Rh antigens, named after the

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:30.189
species of monkey they were first identified
in.

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:34.519
Much like A and B, you either have the Rh
antigens, in which case you’re Rh positive,

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.329
or your don’t, and are Rh negative.

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:41.079
Most of the population is Rh positive, so
they don’t have the anti-Rh antibodies,

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:45.100
which means they can accept either positive
or negative blood. But negative types should

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.149
stick to just the Rh negative blood.

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:51.050
And since the presence of A-B antigens is
controlled by different genes than the Rh

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:56.190
ones, we end up with eight different blood types --
four separate groups, each with two variations.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.510
And now, hopefully, you understand why it’s
so hard to replace blood, and why True Blood

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.630
is...not true. I’ve not actually ever seen
that show.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.180
Along the way, you also learned the basic
components of blood -- including erythrocytes,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.460
leukocytes, platelets, and plasma -- as well
as the basic process of hemostasis that stops

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.960
bleeding, and how antigens are responsible
for the blood type that you have.
