learning we have this is another example
 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.470
learning we have this is another example
of lifelong learning but here's perhaps

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
of lifelong learning but here's perhaps
 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.870
of lifelong learning but here's perhaps
an idea about how these business models

lectures but here's a little correction
for you so this idea of global feedback

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
for you so this idea of global feedback
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.759
for you so this idea of global feedback
and then people who don't have the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769
and then people who don't have the
 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.890
and then people who don't have the
opportunity we talk more about them but

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
opportunity we talk more about them but
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.020
opportunity we talk more about them but
i think that there's really a wide range

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
i think that there's really a wide range
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.910
i think that there's really a wide range
of people out there who are taking

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920
of people out there who are taking
 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.250
of people out there who are taking
advantage of this and then there is of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260
advantage of this and then there is of
 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.140
advantage of this and then there is of
course who is not reflected here the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150
course who is not reflected here the
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.229
course who is not reflected here the
students at UC Berkeley which is really

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
students at UC Berkeley which is really
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.000
students at UC Berkeley which is really
the impetus for why we're doing this to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010
the impetus for why we're doing this to
 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.110
the impetus for why we're doing this to
begin with so as we look toward the next

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120
begin with so as we look toward the next
 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.050
begin with so as we look toward the next
steps

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
steps
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.729
steps
these are some of the questions that we

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739
these are some of the questions that we
 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.360
these are some of the questions that we
ask ourselves and we ask you how can we

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370
ask ourselves and we ask you how can we
 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.000
ask ourselves and we ask you how can we
do more of this better we've had a lot

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
do more of this better we've had a lot
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.530
do more of this better we've had a lot
of feedback from student in several

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
of feedback from student in several
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.710
of feedback from student in several
different reports of late that say their

and context more meaningful Judy talked

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209
and context more meaningful Judy talked
 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.840
and context more meaningful Judy talked
a little bit about that and then looking

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850
a little bit about that and then looking
 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.530
a little bit about that and then looking
out at all of the innovation that we've

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540
out at all of the innovation that we've
 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.230
out at all of the innovation that we've
seen today from the institutions and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240
seen today from the institutions and
 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.659
seen today from the institutions and
from the web 20 world as well as our

how can we leverage that innovation

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560
how can we leverage that innovation
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.279
how can we leverage that innovation
within our institution we get pretty

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289
within our institution we get pretty
 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.170

and I think you've heard from us issues

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729
and I think you've heard from us issues
 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.100
and I think you've heard from us issues
of scalability sustainability and we

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110
of scalability sustainability and we
 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.080
of scalability sustainability and we
take that pretty seriously but we also

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090
take that pretty seriously but we also
 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.170
take that pretty seriously but we also
take innovation and providing real

seriously as well some of the barriers

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900
seriously as well some of the barriers
 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.110
seriously as well some of the barriers
that we're facing currently I think that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120
that we're facing currently I think that
 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.180

looking at a patchwork quilt solution

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870
looking at a patchwork quilt solution
 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.680
looking at a patchwork quilt solution
right now internally we grew up out of a

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690
right now internally we grew up out of a
 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.230
right now internally we grew up out of a
research organization we did a great job

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240
research organization we did a great job
 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.560

we're at a point now if we want to do
 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.770
we're at a point now if we want to do
more we have to make it really scalable

principles I think staying focused is
 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.600
principles I think staying focused is
really important and we've done a good

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610
really important and we've done a good
 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.290
really important and we've done a good
job of that at Berkeley and I think that

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300
job of that at Berkeley and I think that
 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.010
job of that at Berkeley and I think that
we've had help from the larger direction

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020
we've had help from the larger direction
 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.590
we've had help from the larger direction
of higher ed in the recent years so we

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600
of higher ed in the recent years so we
 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.970
of higher ed in the recent years so we
have to make things scalable we just

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980
have to make things scalable we just
 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.610
have to make things scalable we just
know we do so how can we make things

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620
know we do so how can we make things
 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.590
know we do so how can we make things
reproducible how can we ensure quality

that we can get things into classrooms

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320
that we can get things into classrooms
 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.610
that we can get things into classrooms
all classrooms how can we scale it out

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620
all classrooms how can we scale it out
 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.440
all classrooms how can we scale it out
to the campus and in fact how can we

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450
to the campus and in fact how can we
 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.850
to the campus and in fact how can we
scale it out to hire it how do we make

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860
scale it out to hire it how do we make
 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.070
scale it out to hire it how do we make
things that don't just meet our needs i

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080
things that don't just meet our needs i
 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.290
things that don't just meet our needs i
mean we are driven by our needs but how

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300
mean we are driven by our needs but how
 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.690
mean we are driven by our needs but how
do we make it so that you can use it and

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700
do we make it so that you can use it and
 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.250
do we make it so that you can use it and
how do you make something so that i can

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260
how do you make something so that i can
 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.850
how do you make something so that i can
use it and then of course it has to be

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860
use it and then of course it has to be
 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.160
use it and then of course it has to be
sustainable how can i say goodbye to

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170
sustainable how can i say goodbye to
 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.490
sustainable how can i say goodbye to

let my campus know that we're not going

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170
let my campus know that we're not going
 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.870
let my campus know that we're not going
to walk away when that funding leaves

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880
to walk away when that funding leaves
 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.300
to walk away when that funding leaves

by mentoring others you don't have to

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260
by mentoring others you don't have to
 

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.790
by mentoring others you don't have to
reinvent the wheel you learn more by

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800
reinvent the wheel you learn more by
 

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.380
reinvent the wheel you learn more by
actually seeing the workings of things

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:42.390
actually seeing the workings of things
 

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.199

you change your mind sometimes and then

00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:45.209
you change your mind sometimes and then
 

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.150
you change your mind sometimes and then
by sharing common frameworks I think we

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160
by sharing common frameworks I think we
 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.850
by sharing common frameworks I think we
can actually feel

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:47.860
can actually feel
 

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.449
can actually feel
uncommon applications I think as long as

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:51.459
uncommon applications I think as long as
 

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:52.949
uncommon applications I think as long as
we're reinventing the frame works every

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959
we're reinventing the frame works every
 

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.810
we're reinventing the frame works every
time where we're going to sit there and

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:54.820
time where we're going to sit there and
 

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.579
time where we're going to sit there and
we're never really going to touch people

00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:56.589
we're never really going to touch people
 

00:11:56.589 --> 00:11:57.810
we're never really going to touch people
and really not going to make a

and really not going to make a
 

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.120
and really not going to make a
difference so let's get the frame work

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130
difference so let's get the frame work
 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.460
difference so let's get the frame work
out and then work on the applications

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.470
out and then work on the applications
 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.449
out and then work on the applications
working on the things that are really

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:03.459
working on the things that are really
 

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:04.620
working on the things that are really
going to touch people that's why we're

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.630
going to touch people that's why we're
 

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.710
going to touch people that's why we're
spending so much time working around

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720
spending so much time working around

because of those partnerships now the

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:12.810
because of those partnerships now the
 

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.050
because of those partnerships now the
question to us is look at all of these

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060
question to us is look at all of these
 

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.180
question to us is look at all of these
things how can we leverage what they

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.190
things how can we leverage what they
 

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.210
things how can we leverage what they
have done can we don't know we don't

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220
have done can we don't know we don't
 

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.190
have done can we don't know we don't
know but that's a big question so the

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200
know but that's a big question so the
 

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.100
know but that's a big question so the
whole world of interoperability is is on

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.110

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:34.400
community there's more and more of this
in a way you know I went out and I got

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.410
in a way you know I went out and I got
 

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.990
in a way you know I went out and I got
all of these different logos really it

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000
all of these different logos really it
 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.930
all of these different logos really it
is one community you know Sakai service

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940
is one community you know Sakai service
 

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.310
is one community you know Sakai service
started long as a community source

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320

qawali came along and learn from what we
 

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.940
qawali came along and learn from what we
were doing fluid is now learning from

we're seeing more and more overlap

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:48.029
we're seeing more and more overlap
 

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:50.050

community and OSP obviously is on top of

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:53.640
community and OSP obviously is on top of
 

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.259
community and OSP obviously is on top of
that so I think that what what we're

00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:57.269
that so I think that what what we're
 

00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:02.150
that so I think that what what we're
really trying to do in this area is say

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160
really trying to do in this area is say
 

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.620
really trying to do in this area is say
that when you come together around a

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:03.630
that when you come together around a
 

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.290
that when you come together around a
meaningful practice you can make a

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300
meaningful practice you can make a
 

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.360
meaningful practice you can make a
meaningful community as long as we're

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.370
meaningful community as long as we're
 

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.259

so that was that was our vice provost

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:19.510
so that was that was our vice provost
 

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.059
so that was that was our vice provost
for undergraduate education and then one

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:21.069
for undergraduate education and then one

this for a while he gets tons of fan

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:25.900
this for a while he gets tons of fan
 

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.870
this for a while he gets tons of fan
letters and he's quite an evangelist and

we started to target faculty to really

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:29.950
we started to target faculty to really
 

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.970
we started to target faculty to really
be spokespeople for us and what we find

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:32.980
be spokespeople for us and what we find
 

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.890
be spokespeople for us and what we find
is that they have incredible passion for

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:34.900
is that they have incredible passion for
 

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.780
is that they have incredible passion for
it and as we start to think about

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:36.790
it and as we start to think about
 

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.270
it and as we start to think about
expanding we want to tap them more to

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280
expanding we want to tap them more to
 

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.710
expanding we want to tap them more to
send that message out to more of our

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720
send that message out to more of our
 

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.330
send that message out to more of our
faculty so that they can take advantage

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:42.340
faculty so that they can take advantage
 

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.680
faculty so that they can take advantage
of this so alignment tearing down

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.690

parts of the organization so that you

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:51.910
parts of the organization so that you
 

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.550
parts of the organization so that you
can work in a matrix way you don't have

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:53.560
can work in a matrix way you don't have
 

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.740
can work in a matrix way you don't have
to read you know do it all yourself we

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:55.750
to read you know do it all yourself we
 

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.600
to read you know do it all yourself we
have a lot under this

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.610
have a lot under this
 

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.560
have a lot under this
but we rely heavily on our partners and

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:00.570
but we rely heavily on our partners and
 

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.240
but we rely heavily on our partners and
having your partner's believe in your

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.250
having your partner's believe in your
 

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.240
having your partner's believe in your
mission is very important also and then

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.250
mission is very important also and then
 

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.950
mission is very important also and then
also the I think playing nice with

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960
also the I think playing nice with
 

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.650
also the I think playing nice with
others and while embracing a networked

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660
others and while embracing a networked
 

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.900
others and while embracing a networked
environment is kind of a very important

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:11.910
environment is kind of a very important
 

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.640
environment is kind of a very important
thing right we don't have to own

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:13.650
thing right we don't have to own
 

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.320
thing right we don't have to own
everything it doesn't all have to be

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.330
everything it doesn't all have to be
 

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.770
everything it doesn't all have to be
this monolithic enterprise so let's

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780
this monolithic enterprise so let's
 

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.880
this monolithic enterprise so let's
figure out how to be in a networked

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:19.890
figure out how to be in a networked
 

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.710
figure out how to be in a networked
environment and there's a lot of

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720
environment and there's a lot of
 

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.930
environment and there's a lot of
technical ways of working on that or

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940
technical ways of working on that or
 

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.270
technical ways of working on that or
architectural ways but I think it's also

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280
architectural ways but I think it's also
 

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.940
architectural ways but I think it's also
a good principle so I think ways that we

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:31.950
a good principle so I think ways that we
 

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.390
a good principle so I think ways that we
can really work together is look for

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400
can really work together is look for
 

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.060
can really work together is look for
ways of funding the greater good and

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.070
ways of funding the greater good and
 

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.760
ways of funding the greater good and
some of that is investing from our

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:40.770
some of that is investing from our
 

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.890
some of that is investing from our
institutions at the foundational level

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900
institutions at the foundational level
 

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.669
institutions at the foundational level
and looking for funders to help us

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679
and looking for funders to help us
 

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:48.590
