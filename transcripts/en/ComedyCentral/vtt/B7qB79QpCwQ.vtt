I'm your guest bailiff,
Tiffany Haddish.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.740
And now here's your judge,

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:10.510
the honorable Judge Doug!

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.811 align:start size:47% position:53%
Hey, Doug.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:13.479 line:85%
Hey, Tiffany.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.781
Ah, hello.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.482
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.185
Judge Doug: It's time to play
good judge, high judge.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.487
Which one will I be?

Latasha and Lataya, I mean,
this is not a good idea

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.134
to put a high judge
in front of this case,

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.702
'cause just keeping
your names apart

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.439
is gonna be quite difficult,
but I'm gonna give it my best.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:43.643
Lataya, you brought us here.
What's your complaint?

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:49.248
I let Latasha use my vehicle,
which was a Lexus.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.820 size:88% position:44%
And I specifically told them
that the tags was outdated

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.222 size:66% position:33%
and there was tickets
on the car.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.257 size:66% position:33%
And within two weeks,
the car was gone,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.194 size:63% position:31%
because they live
by a police station,

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.362 size:72% position:36%
and they parked the car
on the street.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.331
What? That seems like a very
safe place to park a car...

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.599 align:start size:91% position:9%
No, that's not
a safe place...

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.367
...right in front
of the police station.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.635 size:66% position:33%
...to park a car
with no tags on it.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.238
Oh.
So they impounded it?

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.674 size:66% position:33%
Yes,
and the agreement was

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.643 size:72% position:36%
that $2,700 that I paid
for my vehicle

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.312 size:81% position:41%
would get paid back to me.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.281
Is that Kelley Blue Book
or Lataya Blue Book?

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:23.416 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:24.851 align:start size:63% position:38%
Probably a real book
that's blue, though.
