takes off from Heraclitus statement that
you cannot step into the same river

it is very important when you do step

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
it is very important when you do step
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.750
it is very important when you do step
into the river

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760
into the river
 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.100
into the river

whether you are facing upstream or
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.950

downstream they don't know what's going

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
downstream they don't know what's going
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.799
downstream they don't know what's going
on but they see it as it passes them the

along maybe a fish jumping or something
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.439
along maybe a fish jumping or something
and they see the pattern as it flows

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
and they see the pattern as it flows
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.349
and they see the pattern as it flows
past them and in some cases the farther

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
past them and in some cases the farther
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990
past them and in some cases the farther
downstream the water flows the more

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
downstream the water flows the more
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.620
downstream the water flows the more
apparent the pattern is and so this is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
apparent the pattern is and so this is
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.230

this kind of grouping of topics there
 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690
this kind of grouping of topics there
are a couple that are fairly obvious but

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
are a couple that are fairly obvious but
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.870
are a couple that are fairly obvious but
are not necessarily the ones that the

are not necessarily the ones that the
 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.340
are not necessarily the ones that the
authors had in mind for example is this

say what were the Muslims doing between
 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.010
say what were the Muslims doing between
1500 and 1750 is it just sort of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
1500 and 1750 is it just sort of
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.000
1500 and 1750 is it just sort of
grouping the Muslims and since the

Iran and the Mughal Empire in India were
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.620
Iran and the Mughal Empire in India were
indeed Islamic states and were arguably

indeed Islamic states and were arguably

indeed Islamic states and were arguably
the most powerful and influential

Islamic States now you could say well

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
Islamic States now you could say well
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.449

yes that that is sort of what it is but

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
yes that that is sort of what it is but
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.770
yes that that is sort of what it is but
that is that was not what was in the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
that is that was not what was in the
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.470
that is that was not what was in the
minds of the authors when they carved

minds of the authors when they carved
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.140
minds of the authors when they carved
out this chapter because they were very

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
out this chapter because they were very
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.860
out this chapter because they were very
conscious that there were other parts of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
conscious that there were other parts of

for example Morocco has a a kingdom that
is very robust this time you have a

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260
is very robust this time you have a
 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.930
is very robust this time you have a
number of very important in Islamic

number of very important in Islamic
 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.780
number of very important in Islamic
polities arising in West Africa and you

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
polities arising in West Africa and you
 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.910
polities arising in West Africa and you
have Islamic policies in Central Asia

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920
have Islamic policies in Central Asia
 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.800

you have the classical Caliphate and

you have the classical Caliphate and
then you have the collapse of the

but then you have the cost of the

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:21.829
but then you have the cost of the
 

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:26.220

the animal when the animal gets worn out
 

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.859
the animal when the animal gets worn out
and dies then you have to replace it so

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:44.869
and dies then you have to replace it so
 

00:39:44.869 --> 00:39:46.450

the animal and you add it all up and you

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:53.869
the animal and you add it all up and you
 

00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:55.000
the animal and you add it all up and you
look to open you could rent out the

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.010
look to open you could rent out the
 

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.060
look to open you could rent out the
camel for in the labor market and you

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.070
camel for in the labor market and you
 

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.560
camel for in the labor market and you
found out that that it was much more

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:02.570
found out that that it was much more
 

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:06.630

device and therefore you continue to
 

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.650

have camel carts pulling loads because

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:14.660
have camel carts pulling loads because
 

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.359
have camel carts pulling loads because
it's efficient that would apply pretty

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:19.369
it's efficient that would apply pretty
 

00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:22.120
it's efficient that would apply pretty
