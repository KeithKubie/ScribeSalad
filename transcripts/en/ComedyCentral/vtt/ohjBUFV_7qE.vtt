00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.360
FOLKS, THE 2016
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ALMOST

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.420
UPON US AND I FOR ONE CAPTAIN
WAIT TO SEE WHO THE AMERICAN

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.520
PEOPLE ELECT NEXT FOR JOHN
BOEHNER TO SUE.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.740
OF COURSE, FORMER FIRST LADY,
FORMER SENATOR, AND FORMER

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.354
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY
CLINTON IS THE CURRENT

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.589
FRONT-RUNNER, WHICH IS
SURPRISING SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.258
SHE CAN'T HOLD DOWN A JOB.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.660
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, SECRETARY CLINTON SAYS SHE

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.930
HASN'T MADE UP HER MIND ABOUT
WHETHER SHE'S RUNNING YET, BUT

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.301
ME THINKS SHE DOTH NOT MAKE UP
HER MIND YET TOO MUCH.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.836
LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.107
ONE, SHE'S ON A NATIONAL BOOK
TOUR PUSHING HER MEMOIR "HARD

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.408
CHOICES."

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.478
TWO, SHE'S EXTREMELY QUALIFIED.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.248
THREE, LET'S FORGET ABOUT NUMBER
TWO AND JUST FOCUS ON THE BOOK

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.216
THING.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.385
WHICH, BY THE WAY, FOR THE
RECORD I DON'T GET.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.989
SURE, IT'S BEEN ON THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST FOR SEVEN

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:59.826
WEEKS AND HAS SOLD MORE THAN
500,000 COPIES WORLDWIDE BUT I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.628
RECENTLY PICKED UP THE AUDIO
BOOK.

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:07.367
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO IT WHEN I'M
ON THE TREADMILL AT THE GYM

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:07.968
RAGER-SIZING.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.336
HERE'S THE COLBERT REVIEW.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.737
HERE'S MY REVIEW.

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:17.077
THIS BOOK IS 656 PAGES OF
SHAMELESS NAME DROPPING.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.212
JIM?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.550
&gt;&gt; TANZANIAN PRIME MINISTER
MIZENGO PINDA AND I DO SOME

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.119
PLANTING AT A WOMEN'S
COOPERATIVE IN MLANDIZI.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:30.557
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THUD. DID YOU CATCH
THAT, TMZ?

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:36.830
SHE JUST HAPPENED TO BE HANGING
OUT WITH MIZENGO IN MLANDIZI.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.098
NOT IMPRESSED.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.834
SO SHE'S TIGHT WITH THE PRIME
MINISTER OF TANZANIA.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:45.706
I HAPPEN TO BE E-MAIL PEN PALS
WITH THE PRINCE OF NIGERIA,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:46.840
OKAY?

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:50.777
THAT REMINDS ME I SHOULD
REALLY-- I SHOULD WRITE THAT GUY

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:51.245
BACK.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.012
SHIWRITE THAT GUY.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.216
( APPLAUSE )
GOTTA WRITE HIM.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.885
HE OWES ME A TON OF MONEY.

00:01:57.918 --> 00:01:59.119
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.293
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME I MET THE
BURMESE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:09.062
AUNG SAN SUU KYI IN 2011, WE
WERE BOTH WEARING WHITE.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.063
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.232
WEARING WHITE AFTER LABOR DAY?

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.201
OBVIOUSLY, HER NOBEL PRIZE
WASN'T IN FASHION.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.336
AGAIN, JIM.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.805
&gt;&gt; GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA
MERKEL HAS A GREAT SENSE OF

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:19.740
HUMOR.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:22.543
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HEARD IT,
FOLKS.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:27.714
HILLARY CLINTON THINKS GERMAN
CHANCELLORS ARE A LAUGH RIOT.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.183
HEIL HILARITY.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.452
&gt;&gt; HERE, BONO SITS WITH ME AT
THE PIANO.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.454
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BIG DEAL!

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.590
BONO SITS WITH EVERYBODY AT THE
PIAPO.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:40.093
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SITTING WITH
DAVID BOWIE AT A DIDGERIDOO.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.728
I JUST DON'T BUY ANY OF THIS.
THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:48.135
ONE WOMAN CAN BE IN SO MANY
PLACES AT ONCE.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:58.178
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:08.155
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:20.634
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:25.372
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "HILLARY")

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:26.673
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DON'T YOU DARE!

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.209
DON'T YOU DARE!

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:37.117
YOU WERE CHANTING MY NAME FOUR
MINUTES AGO, YOU TWO-TIMERS.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.754
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.323
HILLARY CLINTON.

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:46.293
&gt;&gt; NOW WHO'S A NAME DROPPER,
STEPHEN?

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.561
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, REALLY?

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.329
NAME DROPPER?

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:53.000
THAT'S NOT WHAT MY GOOD FRIEND
TOM HANKS CALLS ME.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.736
WHEN WE'RE HANGING OUT AT GEORGE
CLOONEY'S PLACE.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.971
&gt;&gt; OH, I LOVE GEORGE.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.575
I WISH HE COULD HAVE JOINED US
WHEN I HAD LUNCH WITH MERYL

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:08.448
STREEP AND ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT
RAFAEL CORREA.

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:09.683
&gt;&gt; OH, RAFI.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:14.788
HE IS SUCH A CUT-UP, ESPECIALLY
WHEN WE GO CAMPING WITH OPRAH.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.057
( LAUGHTER ).

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.592
&gt;&gt; OH?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.726
&gt;&gt; DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.664
&gt;&gt; NO, "O" IS JUST WHAT ALL HER
REAL FRIENDS CALL OPRAH.

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.433
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I KNOW PAUL
MCCARTNEY

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:30.971
&gt;&gt; I NEGOTIATED WITH HAMID
KARZAI.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:33.807
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I SHARED AN
OFFICE WITH STEVE CARELL.

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.975
( LAUGHTER ).

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:41.081
&gt;&gt; I HELD HIGH-LEVEL TALKS WITH
CHINESE STATE COUNSELOR

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.115
DAI BINGGUO

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:44.084
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, NOW YOU'RE
JUST MAKING WORDS UP.

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:48.155
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW, MADAM, I
ONCE DID AN ENTIRE SHOW WITH

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:49.723
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.860
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:55.128
( APPLAUSE )
I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.232
STEPHEN, BUT I'VE MET HIM, TOO.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GOSH, YOU KNOW
EVERYONE!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:05.305
WHAT KIND OF LOSER DO YOU HAVE
TO BE TO NOT BE INCLUDED IN YOUR

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.276
BOOK?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.212
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE NOT IN IT,
STEPHEN?

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:13.847
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, AREN'T I?

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:20.220
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW PRESIDENT OF
TURKMENISTAN GURBANGULY

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:23.090
BERD-MUHA-MEADOW ARE NEVER IN
THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:23.724
&gt;&gt; NO!

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.359
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, YES.

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:29.263
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND, MADAM, IT IS
NOT JUST YOUR NAME DROPPING I

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.631
CALL INTO QUESTION.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.065
I QUESTION YOUR TITLE.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.767
IT'S CALLED "HARD CHOICES."

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.171
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY REAL HARD
CHOICES IN HERE.

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:39.873
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING
FRAGILE ALLIANCES AND TREATIES.

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:43.177
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, I'M TALKING
ABOUT REAL HARD CHOICES--

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.513
ETERNAL QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
WOULD YOU RATHER FIGHT ONE

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:52.119
HORSE-SIZED DUCK OR 100
DUCK-SIZED HORSES?

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:52.786
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.089
&gt;&gt; WELL --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BOOM!

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.893
&gt;&gt; NOW, I ADMIT THAT IS A VALID
QUESTION.

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:02.696
HERE'S WHAT I'D DO.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.468
FIRST, I'D TRY TO FIND COMMON
GROUND BETWEEN DUCKS AND HORSES.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:14.942
FOR INSTANCE, THEY BOTH GREW UP
ON OLD McDONALD'S FARM.

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:20.881
THEN, I'D ESTABLISH A TIMETABLE
TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL HORSE-DUCK

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:21.782
DIALOGUE.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:25.052
( LAUGHTER )
AND, STEPHEN, I'M CONVINCED--

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.722
WITH PATIENCE AND A STRONG
COMMITMENT FROM OUR ALLIES, THE

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:36.196
PIGS AND THE GEESE, WE'D HAVE
PEACE-PEACE HERE, PEACE-PEACE,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.633
THERE, HERE A PEACE, THERE A
PEACE, EVERYWHERE A PEACE.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:46.073
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:49.109
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EI-E-I-OH, YOU'RE
GOOD!

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:53.113
&gt;&gt; AND NOW, STEPHEN, I'VE GOT A
HARD CHOICE FOR YOU.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.082
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BRING IT, H.R.C.

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.084
&gt;&gt; OH, IT WILL BE BROUGHT.

00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:58.652
YOUR CHOICE.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:02.589
PROMOTE MY BOOK OR I WON'T
APPEAR ON YOUR SHOW.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:11.031

ALREADY APPEARED ON MY SHOW.

NO!

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.106
&gt;&gt;I LEARNED THAT FROM GEORGE
LUCAS.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.673
( LAUGHTER ).

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:20.374
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I MET HIM.

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:21.508
HE'S A FRIEND.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:26.079
WELL, NO ONE WILL KNOW I GOT
HILLARY CLINTON ON MY SHOW.

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:26.813
FINE!
