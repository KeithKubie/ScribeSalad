00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.400
Welcome back, I'm now going
to do a slightly harder

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.790
2-dimensional projectile
motion problem.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.210
So let's start by drawing
the ground.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.480
This is the ground and I'm going
to leave a lot of space,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.350
so that we can do other things
with this chalk board.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.530
Just draw the ground
like this.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.510
And let's say I have something--
say I don't know.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.870
Let's say it's a slingshot.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.690
And it's angled up at-- let
me think of a good angle.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.800
It has an angle of-- say the
initial slingshot's angle, so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:48.820
just the angle at which it's
pointed is 30 degrees.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.590
And I want to hit a target.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.990
I don't know.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.870
Let me just make up a number.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.520
Let me say it is 100
meters away.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.820
I want to know-- and I'm
on earth, so I'm

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.760
dealing with gravity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.300
I want to know, how fast does
the slingshots velocity in

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.390
this direction, in the 30 degree
direction-- I want to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.080
know what this initial velocity
needs to be for me to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.450
hit this target exactly.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.880
So let's see if we could
figure this out.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400
Well, we don't know the initial
velocity, but let's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.310
pretend like we do and maybe
we can break it up into its

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.680
horizontal and vertical
components.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800
Let's just do that right here
since we already have the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.850
vector drawn out.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.290
Actually, no, let me do it
in the corner up here.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.880
So the first thing we want to
do is break it up into its

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.170
horizontal and vertical
components.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.155
So this is our initial vector.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.750
And it's vi.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.810
That's our initial.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.360
Let me call it vi,
initial velocity.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.120
Its initial velocity in this
direction, in the direction of

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.760
30 degrees to the ground.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.040
And we want to break that up
into its horizontal and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.820
vertical velocities.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.165
Or we could say it's along the
x-axis or the y-- whoops.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.330
I want to be neat this time.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.860
So I think it helps your
concentration, maybe.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.110
I don't know.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.020
So everything with horizontal
will be purple and everything

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.380
with vertical or along the
y-axis-- oh, whoops.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.820
I just said that and I changed
my convention.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.070
I'm malfunctioning.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.440
That's that.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.060
That's that.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.680
And we're ready to
rock and roll.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.080
And this angle right
here is 30 degrees.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.790
So instead of saying along the
vertical direction, let me

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.050
change this to along
the y-axis.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.930
You can think of kind of the
traditional coordinate axes.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.340
So what is the component of the
velocity along the y-axis?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000
Well we learned from the last
presentation, we could just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.890
use standard trigonometry.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.780
Opposite the vy, v sub y-- this
is v sub y right here,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.300
this line right here.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.440
Which I'm using the
wrong color.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.410
v sub y over the hypotenuse,
v sub i is equal

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.380
to sine of 30 degrees.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.740
Or we could say v sub y is equal
to the initial velocity

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.260
times the sine of 30 degrees.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.710
What's sine of 30 degrees?

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.130
If you remember your 30, 60,
90 triangles, you maybe

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.900
remember this by now.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.430
But sine of 30 degrees-- worst
case, use a table or a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.920
calculator.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.680
But hopefully, you know what
the sine of 30 degrees is.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.060
It's 1/2.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.420
So we know that my vertical
velocity-- last time I called

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.140
it v sub v.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.810
This time I'm going to call it
v sub y because this is kind

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.620
of going along the y-axis.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.210
My vertical velocity
is equal to 1/2

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.900
times my initial velocity.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.580
That looks like an l,
I don't know why.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.660
Did I actually say that an
l, a little while ago?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.700
Anyway, that's v sub i.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.110
So it equals 1/2 v sub i.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.810
And oh, where was I?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.670
My brain really is doing
something else right now.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.480
Anyway, and this 1/2 is just
the sine of 30 degrees.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.190
And what is my horizontal
velocity?

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.490
Let's get all the trigonometry
out of the way.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.010
Well, my horizontal velocity,
doing it the exact same way

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.920
here, let's call that v sub x.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.790
v sub x is equal to v sub i, my
initial velocity, times the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.900
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.760
And if you remember your 30,
60, 90 triangles, you'll

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.270
remember cosine of 30 degrees
is square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:59.590
So v sub x is equal to v sub i
times the square root of 3,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.540
all of that over 2.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.350
So how do we figure
out how far?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.020
Let's say we didn't know we
had to get to 100 meters.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.560
How do you figure out how far
this projectile-- whatever's

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.330
coming out of my slingshot--
is going to go?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.730
Well, we figure out how long
it's going to stay in the air.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.580
And then, once we figure out how
long it stays in the air,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.065
we can just multiply it times
our horizontal velocity and

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:21.090
it'll tell us how far it goes.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.130
So how long does this thing
stay in the air?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.230
For that we use our vertical
velocity or v sub y.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.970
So we know that the change in
velocity-- let me switch back

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.620
to that other color.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.910
We know that change in
velocity is equal to

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.540
acceleration times time.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.200
And what I want to do is figure
out, how long does it

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.470
take for this object to kind of
get to its maximum height?

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.600
So it's decelerating
from this vertical

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.120
velocity, v sub y, to 0.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.390
And how long is it going
to take to do that?

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.600
Well, let's see.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.610
The change in velocity is 0
minus v sub y, which is this.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.130
So it's 0 minus v sub y, which
is my initial vertical

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.000
velocity, the y-axis.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.730
It's 1/2 v sub i.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.460
I just wrote this
instead of this.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.800
And that equals acceleration.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.800
We're going to say minus 10
meters per second squared

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.140
times time.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.780
I'm not writing the units for
the sake of efficiency.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.620
And so, let's see.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.440
If I divide-- so this
doesn't matter.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.390
The 0 doesn't matter.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.220
This and this, if I multiply
both sides by negative 1.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:42.590
And then, if I divide both sides
by 10 I get t is equal

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.020
to 1/20 v sub i.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.550
Or v sub i over 20.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.080
Is this the total time of the
travel of the object?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.800
Well, no.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.890
This is the time that it takes
the object to kind of start at

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.870
a very fast initial
vertical velocity.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.950
And initially it starts at
this velocity and then it

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.400
keeps decelerating until at some
point along its curve,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.760
like here where it's vertical
velocity is 0.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.380
And then it starts decelerating
or accelerating

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.120
downwards and comes here.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.660
So just remember-- let me draw
the curve, actually.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.990
Because I think that
might make it--

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.340
So the object is going to
take a path like this.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.280
Whoops.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.720
Something like this, right?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.860
At this point, the object has
its full vertical velocity and

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.820
its full horizontal velocity.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.770
And at every point as we get
higher and higher, gravity

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.545
slows down its vertical
velocity.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.760
It slows down v sub y.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.700
It slows down its vertical
velocity, but the horizontal

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.190
velocity stays the same.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.530
And at this point, the peak
point, its vertical velocity,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.600
how fast is it moving
upwards is 0.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.890
And then its vertical velocity
turns negative and it starts

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.030
accelerating in the negative
direction or decelerating in

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.140
the positive direction
depending on how you

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.290
want to view it.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.750
So this time tells us literally,
how long did it

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.650
take to go from this initial
vertical velocity to 0?

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.410
So that's how long does it take
to get to this point.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.050
So the total time that
I'm traveling is

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.000
going to be twice this.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.670
Right?

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.100
So let's say total time-- time
in the air, let me call it

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.210
time in the air.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.730
That could be a good--
so time in the air.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.030
We could call this time up.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.970
And the time up plus time down,
and they're equal to

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.830
each other, is equal
to time in the air.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.210
Time in the air is going to
be equal 2 times time up.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:40.409
That equals 2 times this, which
is equal to 1/10 v sub i

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:46.150
or vi over 10.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.750
So we know now how long this
object will stay in the air as

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.270
a function of its initial
velocity in

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.770
this 30 degree direction.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.580
Now, we have to just figure
out, how far is this thing

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.510
going to travel?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.620
And I think I'm running out of
time, so I'm going to continue

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.870
this in the next video.
