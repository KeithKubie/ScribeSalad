00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.210
Sound is a wave that we perceive with
our ears.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.940
It makes our favorite music, and it keeps
us out of danger, but it's so much more than

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.290
that!

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.990
Hey everybody!

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.330
Thanks for checking out Dnews today.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm Trace.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.429
Now listen up!

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.169
Sound is extremely powerful.

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.929
It's made of
invisible waves of energy passing through

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.539
substances -- ground, water, air -- particle
to particle.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.300
The human ear can perceive these
waves as long as their frequencies are between

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.250
20Hz and 20,000Hz.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.910
Anything above or below
that, we can't hear but they're

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.930
still there because these waves contains
energy.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.930
And with enough

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.640
ding, you can make these waves do some
incredible things.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.460
Outside of medical technology, like
ultrasound, one of the most commonly

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.620
known ways to make sound do something

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.870
is by breaking a glass.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.250
This works only
when the sound wave is at the exact same frequency

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.630
as the object you're shooting at.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.550
If you gently flick a wine glass with your
fingernail, you will hear its frequency.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.010
Match that tone and turn the volume up!

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.010
Way way up!

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.010
To like a eleven!

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.850
And that glass
will probably break.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.470
Also within the range of hearing is sound
levitation.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.659
This is way cooler than breaking stuff if
you ask me.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.729
Sound levitation has been around for years,
but until recently,

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.020
we couldn't do much with the stuff once
it was levitated.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.499
It just hung there in the air.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.250
Thanks to advances at a Swiss University called
ETH Zurich,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.299
we can not only levitate stuff, but we can
move it around, adjusting floating fluids.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.670
This works by using the energy in the sound
waves.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.539
In this apparatus, the energy waves reflect
back and forth so quickly,

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.499
they form what's called a standing
wave or a specific point where the energy

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.119
from the sound can hold
an object in mid-air.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.090
Think it like these silly executive desk toys.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.340
The ball in the middle, that's the
standing wave.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.290
The thing that they just figured out is
how to move the stuff once it's levitated.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.359
Now they can use this system to manipulate
liquids combining and separating them,

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.779
all without touching them with human
hands, which is immediately applicable

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:52.779
to drug manufacturers.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:53.779
That's kinda cool.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.479
These energy waves can do a lot of other stuff
too.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.530
The LRAD, or long-range acoustical
devices, is a weapon that shoots sound.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.380
It's like a sonic death
ray, but without the death part.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.109
It can produce so much sound that you feel
physical pain.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.109
Like

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.109
160 decibels.

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.109
That's loud.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.109
Think NASA
rocket launch.

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.300
But it won't kill you.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.830
It just really hurts.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.920
Like a sonic hurt ray.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.670
If you combine some those
technologies, sound can produce really

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.670
strange effects.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.920
In the 1950s,
NASA the US Navy built a device

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.280
the produces ultra low frequencies or
ultrasonic sound.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.730
If you pointed it at a person and set it
to 19Hz, people would have

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.970
vision problems and get spots and stuff
because 19Hz

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.820
is the resonant frequency of the human
eyeball.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.630
Kinda like that wine glass example we talked
about.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.920
If you turn the volume up, people
actually would have trouble breathing

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.420
because the low frequencies were
impacting the lungs like

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.420
energy waves.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.590
And if you shot through the
ground, your skeleton would vibrate

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.930
causing nausea and joint pain.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.080
So which of these sound inventions is your
favorite?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.610
The levitating ones for drug

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.870
manufacturing, ultrasound or maybe one of
the ones that are used for EVIL?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.690
