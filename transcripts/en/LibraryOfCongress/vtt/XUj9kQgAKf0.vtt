00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt; Gayle Osterberg:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.040
It is already afternoon.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.060
This day, we plan it for
months and months, and it seems

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.590
like it goes by so quickly,
because it's so fun.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.130
My name is Gayle Osterberg.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.620
I'm the director
of communications

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.430
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.740
And I'm so happy to
welcome you hear today.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.640
Thank you for coming.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.660
We're thrilled to see
so many book lovers

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.550
as we celebrate reading and
literacy throughout the day

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.850
at the National Book Festival.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.010
The 18th National Book Festival.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.940
I want to take a minute
to say a big thank you

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.770
to our festival sponsors.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.210
Without their support, not only
would this event not be free,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.900
but it just wouldn't
be possible at all.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.140
And so I would encourage you to,
at some point during the course

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.030
of your day, stop down
on the expo floor.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.640
Many of our sponsors are
exhibiting down there.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.650
Tell them thank you for their
support of reading and literacy.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.780
One of, and importantly, if
you have enjoyed your day,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.630
and if you've enjoyed the
Book Festival in past years,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.020
I would also encourage you

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.340
to consider contributing
to the event.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.910
It's very easy, loc.gov/donate.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.320
No contribution is too small,
and they all help ensure

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.980
that this event can
continue into the future.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.280
One of our sponsors, PBS,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.880
is here on the concourse
downstairs.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.710
They are sharing out a
brand-new series that begins

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.370
in just a couple weeks,
The Great American Read.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.390
They kicked it off
earlier this summer

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.220
with host Meredith Vieira,
and they surveyed readers just

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.130
like yourself across the
country, developed a list

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.310
of America's 100 favorite
novels, and they are asking

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.860
that you stop downstairs
and vote.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.160
And throughout the fall,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.390
they will be having weekly
programs talking about the books

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.520
on the list, talking about
the voting and counting

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.050
down to announcing
America's favorite novel.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.330
So I encourage you to go
see them, cast your vote.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.050
And then a couple of important
logistical notes, everyone,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.680
please turn off your cellphones.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.040
Very important.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.630
Also very important, our next
author will be signing books

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.340
from 2 to 3 in line number four.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.810
So please make a note of
that as well, because I know

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.980
after hearing him, you're
all going to want to go get

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.380
that book and have
him sign it for you.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.880
His book, his 14th suspense
novel, is called The Switch.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300
I don't know how many of you
have had a chance to read it.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.030
I read this book in one day.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.000
I was flying home
to see my parents

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.330
for my dad's 80th birthday
after a series of long delays

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.090
at the airport, which
really worked well for me

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.700
because I was reading
this page-turner

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.000
and didn't want to put it down.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.350
I got home around 10, and I
told my parents I would have

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.390
to see them in the morning,
because I was really tired.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.720
And I went to bed, and
I turned off the lights,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.130
and I finished this book
with my cellphone light on so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.470
that they wouldn't know I was
still awake not talking to them.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.270
Actually, that is a true story.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.010
In addition to being an
incredible page-turner

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.260
and also really establishing
for me a lasting craving

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.200
for cold brew coffee, something
that I loved about this book was

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.390
that in an hour of great need,
the protagonist, Michael Tanner,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.810
turned to a library for
information and safety.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.360
And being that I love
our Library of Congress

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.830
and libraries in general, I
loved that part of the plot.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.510
The Associated Press
calls this author a master

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.610
at making the reader feel every
emotion, jump at every shock

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.900
and squirm with every twist.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.510
Please welcome the
author of bestselling

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.740
and award-winning novels,
including The Zero Hour,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.430
High Crimes and Buried Secrets,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.530
the master of the modern
thriller in his debut appearance

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.510
at the National Book
Festival, Joseph Finder.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:59.640
[ Applause ]

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.000
&gt;&gt; Joseph Finder: Thank
you, Gayle, and thank you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.280
for saying my name right.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.950
I am Finder not Finder.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.300
A few years ago, I
was on book tour,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.510
and I got on the
plane in Boston.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.440
And I was ready to
set off on my tour,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.680
and I saw someone sitting there

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.720
on the plane reading
one of my books.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.170
So I thought to myself,
do you say something?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.530
Like, what do you do?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.830
I don't know.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.280
So I kept going, and it
turned out I was seated

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.420
in the row right
behind this guy.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.180
And I could see him
between the seats.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.720
I could see him reading
the book.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.360
So I couldn't resist it
anymore, and I finally said,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.800
I stuck my head in between
the seats and I said,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.790
so, the book, how is it?

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:07.390
Eh. I said, it gets a lot better
by the end of the first chapter.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.430
I feel like I'm in a really
interesting place these days

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.290
with all of this
information swirling

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.320
around about Donald
Trump and Russia

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.360
and intelligences agencies
and the deep state,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.250
because the first thing I ever
wrote for money was a book

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.240
about a rich, powerful American
businessman who was trying

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.050
to conceal his connections
to the Kremlin.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.070
That was my first book,
a nonfiction book,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.330
called Red Carpet, long out
of print and deservedly so.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.900
It was in part the story of a
guy named Dr. Armand Hammer.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.540
Some of you may remember
who he is.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.930
Armand Hammer was
an interesting guy.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.460
He was the CEO of
Occidental Petroleum.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.520
He was known as a
philanthropist.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.940
He was also known as someone

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.280
who had a personal
connection to Lenin.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.870
And I was a graduate student
at Harvard, and I was training

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.090
to be a Soviet expert.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.910
And I read this People Magazine
article on Dr. Armand Hammer,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.030
billionaire oil tycoon.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.510
And by the way, he is
the great-grandfather

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.020
of Armie Hammer.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.500
Do you know the actor,
Armie Hammer?

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.090
That's his great-great
grandson, his great grandson.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.040
So, I was reading this
article in People Magazine

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.340
about Dr. Armand Hammer.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.440
I was sitting at the
dentist reading this article

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.390
on Armand Hammer.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.280
It talked about how
he was a friend

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.000
of Lenin's and a philanthropist.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.060
The thing is, at the same time,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.150
I happen to be reading the
letters of Lenin in Russian

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.950
for a course I was
taking in grad school.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.310
These were the letters of
Lenin they don't translate

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.070
from Russian to English.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.710
So, and in this letter, I
found one, in this collection

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.950
of letters, I found a
letter from Lenin himself

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.360
to comrade Armand Hammer.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.550
And I looked at that, and
I just thought, comrade.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.700
I remember when Lenin
called someone comrade,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.790
that meant he was a member of
the Communist Party, for sure.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.350
And I didn't quite get that.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.130
I was kind of surprised.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.970
And I did a little research,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.130
and I found out that
Armand Hammer's father,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.400
a man named Julius Hammer,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.240
founded the American
Communist Party.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.580
And Armand Hammer went over
to Moscow to meet Lenin

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.950
as an agent of his father's.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.310
And I thought, now
this is interesting.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.120
Here is this great
capitalist, this billionaire,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.240
who is a friend of Lenin's,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.620
and I thought there's
a book in here.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.920
And I thought, you
know something?

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.220
I want to write.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.990
And I have to confess to
you, what I really wanted

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.330
to write was fiction, but
I didn't have the courage.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.890
I thought, nonfiction is safer.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.160
So I'm going to write
this safer,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.880
easier thing, this
nonfiction book.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.810
So I scored an interview
with Dr. Armand Hammer

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.880
in his office in New York.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.160
And he was by then 85 or
so, and I was scheduled

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.470
to talk to him for two hours.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.580
And I started asking him
general biographical questions.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.630
And about 15 minutes into
my interview, I said,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.070
so tell me about your father.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.960
Your father, Julius Hammer,
was a friend of Lenin's

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.310
and a founder of the
American Communist Party.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.410
I think that's quite
interesting.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.200
Hammer stood up, and
he said, all right,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.890
this interview is over.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.190
Get this guy out of here.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.220
And he kicked me out.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.430
I thought, I think
there's something there.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.330
So I went to Moscow.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:46.870
I went to Moscow as a tourist,
and in those days, you had to go

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.230
on a tour within tourists.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:57.620
And I, starting with some names
I got from Russian emigres,

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.950
I eventually tracked down a
number of people in Moscow.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.360
One was a man who
claimed to be the son

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.260
of Armand Hammer's brother,
Victor Hammer, who was living

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.750
in Moscow, a man named Armond
Victovitch [phonetic] Hammer,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.170
living in Moscow all his life.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.590
He had been kept as a hostage.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.920
And I also met an
old man who claimed

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.800
to be Armand Hammer's
case officer.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.350
That is, Hammer worked
for the KGB,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.550
or the NKGB as it was
called in those days.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:48.240
Now this was interesting because
I had a source in the CIA named,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.010
who was in the CIA, as
kind of legendary chief

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.830
of counterintelligence
names James Jesus Angleton.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.180
And Angleton, the chief
of counterintelligence

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.920
for the CIA told me that he
believed Armand Hammer was a

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.930
Soviet agent, and I
didn't believe him.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.020
I said what's the proof?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.860
He kind of was vague, which
told me there really wasn't

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.400
any proof.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.740
But I decided I was going to
find that proof, and I did.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.480
I found this case officer.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.490
So, at the end of this day in
which I had found both this man

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:33.820
who was the son of Hammer's
brother and this case officer,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.840
the phone rang in my hotel
in Moscow, and it was someone

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.250
with the MVD with the police
asking me what I was doing

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.550
in Moscow.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.610
Because I clearly
wasn't on my tour group.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.340
And I quite bluntly
told him I was doing

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.820
investigative journalism.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.460
And he said, Moscow
does not believe

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.450
in investigative journalism.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.600
And he suggested that I
leave the country right away.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.590
Because if I didn't,
something would happen to me.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.580
And you know what, I
didn't need to find out.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.060
I left, I actually left
the country at that point.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.490
I started getting phone calls
when I was back in the US

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.150
from people who worked
for Dr. Hammer,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.390
who worked for Occidental
Petroleum who told me,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.490
one guy told me, hey,
piece of friendly advice,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.240
Dr. Hammer is very litigious.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.500
And he's going to
sue you for libel.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.590
He's going to sue you
out of your socks.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.890
I remember that expression.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.710
Going to sue you
out of your socks.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:54.090
So, I was a graduate student
living in Central Square

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.930
in Cambridge, and all
I could afford to pay

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.650
for rent was $245 a month.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.630
And I'm thinking, sue
me out of my socks?

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.680
These are socks with
holes in them, you know.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:16.230
Hammer then called my faculty
advisor at Harvard and told him

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.910
that he was prepared to
make Harvard a large gift.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.440
He wanted to give Harvard
a gift of $20 million

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.220
and the Hammer papers,
his personal papers.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.380
Just one request,
if you could get rid

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.790
of this annoying graduate
student named Joseph Finder.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.320
And I believe this is the
first time in the history

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.560
of Harvard University that
they ever turned down money.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.830
But they actually
turned that one down.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.990
And the day before
my book went on sale,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.000
I was reading the
New York Times.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.120
I was in New York, and I got
it, you know, remember back

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.410
in the days you could get
the New York Times early.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.750
You could get it at
midnight before it came

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.050
out in the morning.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.350
I was so excited.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.530
And there I found on the Op
Ed page of the Times a piece

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.270
by a lawyer named Louie Nizer.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.890
And Louie Nizer, who was
once a well-known attorney,

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.970
was also Armand Hammer's lawyer.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.140
And this was a piece
about libel law.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.880
And in this piece, Louie Nizer
says that one of his clients

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.710
and dear friends has been
libeled in a new book.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.090
And of course, according to
the conventional definitions,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.890
his client was a public
figure, and therefore,

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.600
couldn't sue for libel.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.180
He said, it's time to
change the libel laws.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.520
And I read that, and I just
went, oh, this is not good.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.250
This is trouble.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:02.940
They then, Hammer then had his
people talk to my publisher

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.790
and tell them that they
considered this book libelous,

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.360
and they wanted to
sue for libel.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.060
And my publisher, of
course, was nervous.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.690
Because that's what
publishers are.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.410
They get nervous about
these sorts of things.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.650
And they said well,
it's a small print run.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.750
They printed 10,000 copies.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.050
That's it.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.430
When it's done, we
won't print anymore.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.730
That'll be the end of the book.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.720
Don't worry about it.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.020
They couldn't kill it off.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.250
They couldn't kill the book
off by threat of a libel suit

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.170
or by threatening me directly.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:48.710
So, Hammer had his people
buy up as many copies

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.480
as they could find in the
stores around the country.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.030
And the book sold really well.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.800
I mean it sold out.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.640
This is what publishers
call a clean sell through.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:11.090
And I realized during this
whole time that there was,

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:16.060
I was able to say a lot about
Armand Hammer in my nonfiction,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.400
but I was too responsible and
too determined not to be sued

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.880
for libel to tell
the whole story.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.190
And I realized that that
man I had met in Moscow,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.250
that Armand Victovitch Hammer,
was probably not the son

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.550
of Armand Hammer's brother.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.540
It was probably Armand
Hammer's son himself.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.940
Because what I had been told is
that they kept him as a hostage

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:46.120
to ensure that Armand Hammer,
who went to Moscow in the 20s,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.660
met a woman, met a
Russian woman, had a baby,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.730
left the country, left the wife

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.580
and the child behind,
I think as a hostage.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.150
Anyway, I realized there
were aspects to this story

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.570
that I really couldn't
tell in nonfiction.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.290
I had to tell in fiction.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.170
I decided to give fiction a try.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:14.250
Now remember, I was afraid to
write a novel because I thought

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.200
that was too dangerous.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.880
It was too risky.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.260
I wanted to do something safer

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.200
like write a nonfiction
book, right.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:30.070
What I discovered,
actually, in writing fiction,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:34.280
was that people would talk
to me and tell me things,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.100
reveal things, that they would
never tell the New York Times

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.670
or the Wall Street Journal.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.300
It was the fact that
I was writing fiction

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.040
that made it safe for
them to talk to me.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.840
And I was able to find
out all kinds of things

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.620
and tell all kinds
of things in fiction

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.850
that you can't do in nonfiction.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.200
What I love to do, What I've
loved from the beginning,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.440
is finding things
out, doing research.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.480
Finding out inside information
that we're not supposed to know

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.470
and passing that
along to my readers.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:19.160
So, for instance, my first novel
called The Moscow Club dealt

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.390
with a fictional Armand Hammer.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.360
But its plot was
about a coup de tat

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.160
in the Kremlin against
Gorbachev.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.450
And you know, I had read a
lot of Frederick Forsyth,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.740
and it occurred to me it would
be kind of cool to actually put

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.020
in real names the
way Forsyth did.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.210
So I put in Gorbachev.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:49.690
I put in the names of the people
who would pull of this coup,

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.750
this fictional coup,
against Gorbachev.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:59.630
The book came out, finally,
in February of 1991.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.720
And one of the first
reviewers talked

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.460
about how its plot
was farfetched,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.730
this plot about a coup
against Gorbachev.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.030
Farfetched.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.380
Six months later, this is August
of '91, I get awakened early

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.870
in the morning by one
of my sources in the CIA

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.180
who said, are you watching CNN?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.840
I said, no, what are
you talking about?

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.040
He said put it on, and I did.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.500
There were tanks rumbling
through the streets of Moscow.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.880
Gorbachev was under house
arrest in the Black Sea.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.430
There had been a coup de tat.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.830
The guy said to me, do you see
who's involved in the coup?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.920
And I realized the people

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.900
who had pulled off the
real-life coup attempt

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.400
against Gorbachev were the
people I named in my novel.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.460
He said, you think
someone read the book?

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:10.360
So, it wasn't, it wasn't that
I had any particular talent

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.530
at Kremlinology or Sovietology.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.840
It wasn't that I could
predict the future.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.970
What I realized is, I was
willing to listen to some

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.080
of the crazier theories
out there.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.500
Some of the rumors that
were circulating in Langley,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.630
Virginia, and take
some of them seriously.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.940
I was basically willing
to stick my neck out

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.430
and make a fool out of myself.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.360
And it so happened in this case,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.100
I didn't make a fool
out of myself.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:47.910
But I learned in the process,
here was a way to sort of write

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.580
about real stuff, write
about espionage and spy stuff

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.220
and international relations, do
it in a way that's entertaining

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.990
and that actually provides
new inside information.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:06.220
But I have to admit, I didn't
always stick my neck out.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:12.500
I was working on a book, a long
time ago, on the Russian mafia.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.870
Russian organized crime.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.000
Now, as some of you may know,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.990
Russian organized crime has
taken an interesting turn

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.000
over the last few years.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.130
There are now oligarchs
who are now connected

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.970
with organized crime who has
taken most of Russia's assets

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.330
out and who are now some
of the billionaires.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.020
I wanted to do a story about
what it was like to actually be

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.560
in one of these groups
in my novel.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.600
So I found a source
who was in one

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.820
of these organized
crime groups in Moscow

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.120
who said he would sneak me in.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.850
I would just wear a fur hat
and look like a Russian.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.680
That means wear kind of a
schlubby overcoat, you know,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.690
and bad shoes and a fur hat.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.650
And I would sneak
into this meeting,

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.840
and I would basically observe,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.850
and people would
think I was Russian.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.150
That was fine.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.080
And this would be
this really cool bit

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.740
of research I could
do for my novel.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.970
So I get a phone call
at my hotel room again.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:22.290
The guy says, there's a rumor
going around that someone

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.710
from the CIA is about to
infiltrate our meeting tonight.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.360
And they think this
someone from the CIA is you.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.360
I said I'm not in
the CIA, really.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.650
And they said, that's
not what they believe.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:47.470
If you go, I can't tell you
what could happen to you.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.460
Well, I had a little
baby at that point.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.500
I just thought, is it worth
it really to write a novel?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.270
I don't think so.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.890
So I left Moscow as soon as
I could, the next morning,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.550
decided not to go
to that meeting.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.530
I decided that as interested
as I was in the Russia mafia,

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.500
it wasn't worth getting
killed over for a thriller.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.810
By the way, I wasn't in the CIA.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.100
Although I admit I
thought about it.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.340
Since I was sort of a Russia
expert back in the day,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.490
that is, I spoke Russian.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.790
I knew Russian history.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.610
I knew Soviet politics.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.570
I was naturally recruited
to the CIA.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.470
They did that a lot at
Yale, by the way, you know.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:46.840
I was recruited, and
here is the problem.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.630
I had read a lot of Robert
Ludlum's thrillers, you know,

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.260
the Bourne Identity
and things like that.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.590
So, I thought that if you worked

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.330
for the CIA they gave
you a Glock pistol

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:07.880
and several fake passports
and a Swiss bank account.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.520
And it turned out, in
fact, I would be sitting

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.420
at a cubicle translating
Tractor Digest

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.150
from Russian to English all day.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.140
And I thought, this
doesn't sound quite

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.440
as interesting as I expected.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.240
So basically, writing about,
you know, the sorghum harvest

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.140
in the Soviet Union in the
Ukraine 1953 to 1955, basically,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.790
Robert Ludlum ruined it for me.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.010
Now, speaking of Ludlum, one of
the questions I get asked most

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:48.270
of all is, about my books,
is it going to be a movie?

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.590
You hear this all the time

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.660
because the book hasn't
really graduated from college

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.470
until it's become
a movie, you know.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.160
That's how people
think about it, right.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.520
I have actually had two movies
made, which beats the odds.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.250
Two, one good, rather,
one good, one not so good.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.980
Which also beats the odds.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.950
The one that I like
is called High Crimes,

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.170
which stars Morgan
Freeman and Ashely Judd.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:24.250
And this is a story about
a woman who's a professor

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.880
at Harvard Law School.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.910
In the movie, of course,
she's not a professor

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.210
at Harvard Law School.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.870
In the movie she's a
criminal defense attorney

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.650
in San Francisco.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.110
Anyway. And in the
book, she discovers

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:43.900
that her husband has some sort
of a secret life and is accused

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.480
of a terrible atrocity, and
she decides to defend him

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.460
in the military courtroom
where she is not an expert.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.470
And she brings in
Morgan Freeman,

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.900
who is an expert
in military law.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.200
So this is the basic setup.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.460
It's a military trial.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.810
This is the basic
setup of High Crimes.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:08.300
So my agent, my Hollywood agent
called me up and said, you know,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.230
this movie actually
might get made.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.510
Because there's a lot of heat
around it and a lot of buzz.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.980
And when there's heat and
buzz in Hollywood, well,

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.220
there's always heat and buzz
in Hollywood, isn't there?

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:28.050
The truth is, 90, 95% of
books that get optioned

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.140
for the movies will
never make it into,

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.610
never become a movie or TV show.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:40.570
So, I was a little
skeptical about this.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.490
And I said, he said no, no,
my agent said no, really.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.600
We have a director.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.900
His name is Carl Franklin.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.260
He wants to make this.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.140
We have a really
good screenplay.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:56.650
Ashley Judd wants
to play the lead.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.920
Morgan Freeman wants
to play the other lead.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.210
This is going to get greenlit.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.510
I said okay.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.700
If it really is, I want a cameo.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.700
Is that so much to ask?

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:18.890
I mean, I did write
the book, right?

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:24.290
I said, Hitchcock did it.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:29.460
So my agent said Joe,
you're not Hitchcock.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.970
He was the director
of the movies.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.270
He put himself in the movie.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.690
You are the writer of the book.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:46.240
And in the totem pole that is
Hollywood, I'm below ground.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.120
That's just the way it works.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.980
So he said you're not
going to get a cameo.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.280
I'm sorry.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.650
I said well ask them anyway.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.080
So one day my agent called
me a few weeks later,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.380
and he said all right.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.720
Good news and bad news.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.020
What do you want to hear first?

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.320
I said the good news always.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.950
He said the good news is, the
director has agreed to put you

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.470
in a cameo in the movie.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.410
The bad news, you're going
to have to shave your head,

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.050
because you're in
a military jury.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.430
You're going to be on the
jury in a military trial,

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.060
and you are basically
playing a marine.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.320
And they're going to shave your
head high and tight, you know.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.120
And I said that's fine.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.420
I'll go and do it myself.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.370
I'll go out to Great Cuts
and have this done, you know.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.070
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you've got to have it done

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.630
by the makeup and hair people.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:45.390
So they flew me out there,
and I met with the director.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.150
And remember, I was supposed to
be in the jury in this movie.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.840
Now, you know, they don't
really show the jury very often

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.140
in movies.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.530
They sort of pan across the
jury kind of slowly sometimes.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.180
I knew that the odds were
I would hit the cutting

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.480
room floor.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.930
I would not actually
be in the movie.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:09.150
But still, being in the jury,
being on the movie set at all,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.870
sounded like something cool.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.430
So there I was talking

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.830
to the director before I
went to hair and makeup.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:23.810
And he said, you know, you've
got a certain authority.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.150
I said, yes, I do.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.320
He said, let's promote this guy.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:37.050
And on the spot, I was promoted
from mere member of the jury

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.300
to member of the
prosecution team.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.070
I was one of the prosecutors.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.740
And I got to sit at
the prosecutor's table.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.690
My job, and they told
me, my job was to glare

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.860
at Morgan Freeman, all right.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.020
So I was practicing this.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.850
I was sort of staring
at him, glaring at me.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.790
He glared back, you know.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.220
They never gave me
acting lessons.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.290
They never told me what to do.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.340
They just told me,
glare at Morgan Freeman.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:16.290
And in fact, my character, later
in the movie, beats him up.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.930
And it wasn't me.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.230
It was someone else.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.450
Anyway. So the guy playing
the prosecutor turned

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.240
to me when I sat down.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.910
There I was in my high and tight

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.700
and my marine uniform
and everything.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.560
He said, so, how you doing?

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.860
I'm Mike.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.160
And I said hey Mike.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.810
I'm Joe. I had made a deal with
the director that I was going

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.450
to be incognito on the set.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.430
They did not want
people on the set to know

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.020
that I had written the book.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:54.430
Why? Presumably because I would,
maybe because actors would come

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.340
up to me and say, this
line isn't right, is it?

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.730
How would you tweak this line?

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.880
Don't you think we
should add something here?

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.120
For whatever reason,
they were threatened

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.650
by having the writer on the set.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.560
Interesting, isn't it?

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.810
I agreed to basically
be incognito,

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.850
which meant that I would not
tell them who I was, right.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.420
So he said, so the guy
playing the prosecutor said

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.720
to me, I'm Mike.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.020
And I said I'm Joe.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.880
And he said, so, where you from?

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.490
I said, Boston.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.810
He said, and this was
in LA on the soundstage.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.860
He said, they flew you in
from Boston for this part?

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:36.000
Yeah. He said, do
you know somebody?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.730
No. He then said, all right,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.670
so let me tell you
about High Crimes.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.010
Let me tell you about
the book and the movie

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.310
and how they're different
actually.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.420
And I want to tell
you a little bit

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.070
about the thematic
underpinnings of this story.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:59.230
You really need to know how
this really works thematically.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.400
And he spent about five
minutes telling me all

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.700
about High Crimes.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.000
Telling me the story.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.490
Telling me what it
was really about.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.870
And I couldn't take it anymore.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.060
And I finally said.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.330
I said Mike, my name
is Joseph Finder.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.970
I wrote the book the
movie's based on.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.150
He said, oh man.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:26.750
Morgan, Ashley, this
guy wrote High Crimes.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.580
So my cover was blown.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:34.760
But I decided since my cover was
blown, this was my opportunity

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.320
to meet Morgan Freeman.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.360
Try and stop me.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.930
Because I had been told
not to talk to the stars.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.250
Below the line, that's okay.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.010
I could talk to, but don't
talk to Ashley or Morgan.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.310
Leave them alone.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.070
As an extra, do not
talk to the stars.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.530
I said okay.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.950
I saw Morgan Freeman standing
there during a break with a guy

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.250
who looked a lot like him.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.730
It turned out to be his stand-in

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.810
who is also his personal
assistant.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.780
So I went up to him, and I
said excuse me, Mr. Freeman,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.540
I just wanted to say hi.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.840
My name is Joe Finder.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.770
I wrote the book High Crimes
that the movie's based on.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:27.740
And Freeman stared at me, and
he turned to his stand-in,

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.330
and he said this gentleman
here says he wrote the book the

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.890
movie's based on like I give a.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:39.520
And like the blood
rushed to my head.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.680
And I just thought,
Morgan Freeman is supposed

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.160
to be the nicest
guy in Hollywood.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.340
Oh man. And he went, ha,
ha, ha, I got you, didn't I?

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:58.810
So the amazing thing is, I was
sitting on the set of a movie

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.780
that I had made up in my
head a few years earlier.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.050
I was sitting, I
remember sitting

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.010
at my computer describing
the courtroom,

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.980
describing every detail of it,
which they now perfectly had.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.810
And I thought, how cool is this?

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:19.050
I made this up, just me
sitting in my office,

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.950
sitting at a computer.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:24.500
It takes 500 people to
make one of these movies.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.830
But I could do it myself.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.270
I thought that was kind of cool.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:34.720
I acted, I use that term
lightly, I acted in five scenes,

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.900
which meant I was
shooting for five days.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.050
And I got paid for this.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.420
I got paid $200 per day,
so I got paid $1,000

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.440
to act in High Crimes.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.980
But there's a rule that if
you're in a movie for three days

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.220
or more, you have to join SAG,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:03.090
the Screen Actors'
Guild, which costs $1,500.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.390
But I joined it.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.690
I had no choice.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.990
There's a lesson there.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.450
I'm not sure what it is.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.220
Anyway. The other
movie that's made

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.910
from my books was called
Paranoia staring Harrison Ford

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.210
and Gary Oldman.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.190
And you're thinking, I
haven't heard of that movie.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.250
It's a Harrison Ford movie,
I haven't heard of it?

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.330
There's a reason you
haven't heard about it.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.230
The less said about
that one, the better.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:33.170
My attitude about movie
adaptations, people would say

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.610
to me things like so,
what did you think

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.520
about what they did to Paranoia?

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.210
What do you think?

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.430
I remember there
was a great line

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:46.690
from the author James M. Cain
who wrote Double Indemnity.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.090
He was asked, how do you feel

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.290
about what the movies
did to your book?

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.740
And he pointed to the
shelf and he said,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.040
they didn't do anything.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.980
The book's still here.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.450
And that's sort of how I feel
is, the book is still here.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.640
I don't care, as long
as it works as a movie.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:11.400
So, I need to tell you a secret
and that is, which I'm telling

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.750
to this small group here
because we're in genre fiction.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.430
We're all, you know,
you're my people.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:24.190
That I use my fiction
as a way to comment

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.490
on what's going on around us.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.310
I sneak it in.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.120
And unlike the movies,
I'm the boss.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.160
Which I like.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.410
My most recent book
is called The Switch.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.400
It's about a businessman in
Boston, a coffee entrepreneur.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.530
One day he's going
through LAX, the airport,

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.250
and he's in the security
line, and he reaches

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.360
down to grab his MacBook
Air from the security line.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.930
And he sees two identical
MacBook Airs, and he picks

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:58.180
up the wrong one, goes onto
the plane, gets home to Boston

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.640
and realizes he has
a computer here

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.110
that belongs to a US Senator.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.890
And on it, is some top-secret
classified information.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:12.990
And I thought, now this
could be kind of interesting

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.220
as I was putting this together.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.030
My hero's life is going
to be turned upside down.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:23.370
Why? Because he is not
going to return it.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.420
That's all I had.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.720
And that's what I created.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.620
So Switch, The Switch,
turns out to be

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.430
about this one guy's
struggle to survive.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.580
But on another level,
it's about something else.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.840
It's about how we're
giving up our own privacy.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.250
The secret information on
this computer has to do

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.620
with an NSA surveillance
program that I describe

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.300
in the book and which is true.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.090
There's a sequence in
the book when my hero,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.790
Michael Tanner, has
to go on the lam.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.940
You know, in thrillers you have
to go on the lam quite a bit.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.940
I'm not sure what the lam is,
but people go on the lam a lot.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.930
All right.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.860
Michael realizes he can't rent
a car, because that's going

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.420
to set off lights
all over the place.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.820
He can't use his credit cards.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.090
He's got about $6 in his wallet.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.870
He can't use his ATM card.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.320
Can't get cash.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.530
And there are cameras
everywhere he goes.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.730
I wanted to sort of, in this
scene, in this sequence,

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:37.510
show the extent to which I think
we have given up our privacy.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.690
We all check, you know
those privacy notices

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.740
that have been popping up all
over the place whenever you go

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.040
to a website recently?

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.670
The last couple of
weeks I've noticed this.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.240
I don't if it's a
European thing.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.810
I'm not exactly sure.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.890
But there's a little check here

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.350
to indicate you have
no privacy anymore,

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:55.810
which is basically what we do.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.250
We don't even, nobody reads
those privacy documents.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:06.140
I am here today representing
genre fiction.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.970
Specifically, mysteries
and thrillers.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.390
I hate the term genre fiction.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.680
It is condescending.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.060
But at the same time,
I love my genre.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.800
I love mysteries and thrillers.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.160
I feel that it enables
me to tell a story,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.530
and at the same time, reveal
some inside information,

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.030
something important,
something I think we should be

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.330
talking about.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:38.430
But let me be clear, my
job is to entertain you.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.910
I want you to stay up too
late to turn the pages

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.810
and be a wreck the
next day at work.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.710
That's really my objective.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.170
Because, thank you.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.410
We all crave stories.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:40:00.940
Whether through TV or stories
through movies or stories

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:06.240
through that superior content
delivery system, books.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.140
But we also love
learning things.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.010
Finding out more about the
world, which works for me

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.660
because I love finding
things out

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.260
and telling people about them.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.080
So I sort of feel that
I've traveled full circle

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.890
in my writing.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.280
How could I not be obsessed

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.730
with another billionaire
American businessman

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:36.510
with hidden connections
to the Kremlin, right.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.220
[ Applause ]

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.930
I heard steel dossier,
and you know,

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.360
I was hooked at that
point, right.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.550
I mean this is an amazing story.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.770
And I'm making light of it.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.500
I will be honest,
I'm really worried

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.890
about what's going
on in our country.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.090
I'm worried about
what's going to happen

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:02.810
when Mueller comes
out with his report.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.710
This is not like Watergate.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:10.440
There was no Fox News
in 1973 and 1974.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.530
I worry about what's
happening at the FBI

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.090
and what's happening at the CIA.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:22.380
In my new book, I mean imagine
how weird it is, by the way,

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.020
to be writing conspiracy stories
at a time when we're hearing

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.790
about conspiracies every day,
coming out of the White House.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.060
That sort of blows my mind.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:41.100
In my new book, I deal with
the Russian notion of kompromat

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:46.080
which is the use of secret,
damaging secret information

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.680
to blackmail or to
ensure loyalty.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.390
In my new book, it's used

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:56.160
against a female judge
who's made one bad mistake.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.990
That book is called
Judgment, and it's due

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.580
out at the end of next year.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.570
It may not be the only
book called Judgment.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.950
This is, I don't know.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.940
I worry about the
title, you know.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.870
There are other books
called Judgment,

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.200
but you can't copyright
titles I learned.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.670
So I've decided that
my next book is going

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.700
to be called The Da Vinci Code.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.510
I'd love to answer
any questions.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:31.360
[ Applause ]

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.660
Who would like to start?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.600
&gt;&gt; Hi, short preamble.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.330
My father worked for the
DOD for over 40 years.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.630
&gt;&gt; For the DOJ?

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.930
&gt;&gt; For the DOD.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.230
&gt;&gt; DOD.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.530
&gt;&gt; Yep, everyone in this
room knows what that is.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:50.170
&gt;&gt; I'm from Boston.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:55.690
&gt;&gt; So, in the 70s he was
working with submarines.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.010
And when Clancy's Hunt
for Red October came out,

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.200
I distinctly remember
watching him read that book,

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.150
and at a certain point in
the book, he said, what?

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:12.280
What? And he shut the book, went
to the phone, made a phone call

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.140
and said, have you
read Clancy's book?

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.940
Who is talking to him?

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.130
So my question for you
is, what is the process

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.760
like when a source
gives you information

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.530
that you know is delicious but
maybe shouldn't go in the book?

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.530
&gt;&gt; That's an excellent question.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.940
Because it's almost
irresistible.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.670
The investigative
journalist part

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.730
of me wants to get that out.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.030
Wants to get whatever it is out.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:47.380
But at the same time, if I
blow my sources, I've wrecked

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.110
for myself any other source
who wants to pay attention,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.760
who wants to help me out.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:59.210
So I have really decided
I have held things back

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.100
because I was told to.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.170
So basically, I, unlike
Clancy, I basically tend

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.290
to observe those rules.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.080
However, if I can find that
out by some other means,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.330
that's what I try to do is try
to get it in there if possible.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.040
&gt;&gt; I'm looking around.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.340
Are there other questions?

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.640
Yes.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.540
&gt;&gt; How do you pick, I know a lot
of your different books focus

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.260
on specific industries.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:38.340
How do you decide that this guy
is going to be a coffee maker?

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.640
This guy is going to
work in [inaudible].

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.940
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.240
&gt;&gt; How do you pick those?

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.950
&gt;&gt; I sort of, I basically
think of the story,

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:48.850
think of the character, and
then I'll decide what I want

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.150
to learn about.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.320
And it so happened when
I was writing The Switch,

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.330
that I was really interested in
coffee companies and the sale

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.610
of coffee and artisan coffee
and how that's happened.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.480
And I decided this would
be a really interesting way

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.780
of exploring that.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.510
When I wrote Judgment I decided,
I'm going to look at what it's

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:12.380
like to be a judge, because I
have no idea what that's like.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.380
So I sort of pick things almost
at random that appealed to me

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.340
and hoped that it appeals
to the readers as well.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.200
This is probably
our last question,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.700
because I've got to wrap it up.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:29.670
&gt;&gt; So, when you were discussing
the potential CIA job that's

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.120
just sitting in a cubicle
translating almanacs,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.620
the first thing I
actually thought

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:40.130
of is [inaudible] who's
basically running theme is

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.260
that people who did stuff
like that fought most

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.290
of the Cold War,
in so many words.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.990
Do you think that there
is a compelling thriller

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.660
to be written about that from
the American side of things?

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.610
Or are we just too
impatient for that?

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.910
&gt;&gt; Are we just what?

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:57.240
&gt;&gt; Are we just too
impatient for that?

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.540
&gt;&gt; I think we're too
impatient for it.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.760
I don't think it would
work really as a thriller.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.580
And you know, there's a question
that I think about a lot

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:13.990
and that is, what did
spies do for us ultimately?

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:18.730
Did we quote/unquote win the
Cold War because of espionage?

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.780
And I think the answer is no.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.440
And that, as much as I
value and respect the CIA,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.010
you have to keep
in mind the utility

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:34.960
that spies give us is sometimes
not as much as people think

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.130
because of guys like
me who write stories

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.400
in which spies are
lotted [phonetic].

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.130
Anyway, let me wrap
it up right there.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.430
Thank you so much.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.730
&gt;&gt; Gayle Osterberg:
Oh thank you.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.000
