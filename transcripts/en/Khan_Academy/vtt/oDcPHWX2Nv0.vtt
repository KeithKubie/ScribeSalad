00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.330
Welcome back.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.280
I got too excited, and I went 20
seconds over time-- I hope

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.960
YouTube still lets me publish
this video, so I'll try my

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.790
best.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.710
What I was saying is how related
these two formulas

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.885
are, and that makes sense
because at this point the ball

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:19.060
is stationary-- it's completely
the same as a ball

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.090
just being dropped, a stationary
ball being dropped

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.710
from height h.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.100
We can use this formula to do
the same thing that we did

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.010
intuitively in the last video.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.875
If we're just dropping a ball,
the initial velocity is zero,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.110
so this term goes to zero,
and this term is the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.480
only one that matters.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.150
Once again, if we're dropping
it, we started at height h and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.900
we go to zero, so the change
in distance is now minus h.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.780
We have at squared over 2, and
that equals gravity times--

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.000
what's the time?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.960
The time is not this full t0,
it's t0 over 2, so g t0 over 2

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.170
squared over 2.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.780
You multiply both sides times
negative 1, and you get this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.610
exact same thing.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.530
That's pretty cool.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.720
What I love about physics it
that there's so many ways to

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.280
approach the problems. You can
actually start off with any

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.720
one of the formulas that we've
been looking at, and as long

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990
as you kind of keep playing
with it and keep thinking

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.680
about it, you might not find
the fastest route to the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.390
solution, but as long as you
don't do anything incorrect,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330
you will get the solution.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.950
Hopefully, this gives you a
little bit of an intuition of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.230
projectile motion.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.400
In the next set of videos,
we're going to make it

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.970
slightly more complicated, but
also slightly more realistic.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.700
I'm going to introduce you
to what happens in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850
two-dimensional motion-- it's
when you're not throwing

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.360
something straight up, but you
actually throw something at an

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.080
angle like you normally do.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.400
I'll see you in the
next video.
