00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.772
(whirring)

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.275
(music playing)

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.111
(computer alert beeping)

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:14.147
<i>Ab, Ab, Ab-- No
joke, today is the day</i>

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.949
<i>we become Abbi and Ilana,
the boss bitches</i>

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.451
<i>we are in our minds.</i>

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.585
Are you with me?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.854
Yeah, I'm with
you, awesome.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:24.591
Are you--
Is that the whole thing?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.093
<i>Obviously I have a plan.</i>

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.063
Tonight we are going to see a
secret pop-up Lil Wayne concert

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.231
at Bowery Ballroom.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.467
I can't, I'm so broke.
<i>No excuses, girl.</i>

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.335
<i>I'm getting big ol' balls
of mozzarella today.</i>

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.336
<i>Chea-- Get it!</i>

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.071
<i>Chea-- Harder.</i>

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:40.040
You're gonna have to speak
in English for me.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.409
<i>I am getting my paycheck today
and I can spot you, bitch!</i>

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.677
I wish that I could,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.480
but I am so close to finishing
season one of "Damages,"

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.449
and I made, this,
like, amazing cashew stir-fry

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.685
for the week, so I'm
actually pretty booked.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.620
<i>Stir-fry?</i>

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.856
<i>Can I talk to the Abbi
who stole a van?</i>

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:58.525
<i>Ab, you're so stuck
in your little routine.</i>

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
<i>I bet you schedule when
you jack off.</i>

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:04.064
Schedule when I ja--
(exhales deeply)

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.866
Oh, my God.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.067
Is that Lincoln?

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.168
Yep.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.369
<i>Is he inside
of you?</i>

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.470
Yep.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:11.638
<i>I'm just
keeping him warm.</i>

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.340
All right-- Let's just set
some ground rules here

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.875
for everybody involved.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.944
<i>I don't want to
see you have sex.</i>

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.545
<i>Let's try and
avoid that.</i>

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.747
Lincoln, you seem well.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.716
Thank you-- I've been
doing this no-bread diet

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.351
and it's pretty good.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.419
It's been working.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.087
All right--
I'm gonna head out, then.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.522
Peace, bye.

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:29.523
That was hot--
That was cool.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.458
That was like a threesome,
in a way.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.393
Uh, Ilana,
what are we doing?

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.095
Are we just having sex,
hooking up?

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.330
Are we dating?

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.431
What is this?

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.667
This is purely
physical.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.870
Why does this
always happen to me?
