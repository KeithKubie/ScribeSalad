&gt;&gt;Katlyn: Remember, you are working
on your symbolism reflection piece

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:09.226
that is going on our final website.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:12.206
Help each other out,
collaborate as you always do.

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:14.336
&gt;&gt;My name is Katlyn
Wolfgang and I teach art

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.666
at Central York High School.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.996
I always wanted to become a teacher.

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:21.086
I looked into being a
math teacher and I looked

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:21.946
into being an art teacher.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:24.596
Art just happens to be the
media in which I teach.

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.946
I teach through the arts.

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:27.256
I teach the whole student.

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:30.526
I want the students to
be aware of everything,

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:32.116
of everything around them.

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:36.676
&gt;&gt;Miss Wolfgang is a really great art
teacher because she incorporates more

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.186
than just art into the class.

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:41.676
We use social studies, history,
English, writing, reading,

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:44.776
and we also use a lotta
technology, where we're putting all

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:48.366
of our projects and our reflections
onto a website that can be viewed

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.406
by anyone that wants to look at it.

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:54.676
&gt;&gt;Ryan: The school identifies and
defines integrated studies really

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:59.286
as curricular connections that
can be made between the subjects

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.316
and the different departments
within our high school here.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.096
If you can show students
relevance within the work

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.806
that they're doing,
they're more engaged.

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:08.416
They're more apt to be more
interested, to participate more,

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.876
and integrated studies is
a great way to do that.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.786
&gt;&gt;That leads us to
number seven where,

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:16.236
can any of you seriously say the Bill

00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.426
of Rights could get
through Congress today?

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:21.856
&gt;&gt;My name is Dayna Laur
and I teach social studies

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.126
at Central York High School.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:28.426
I don't think any subject matter
is really a stand alone subject.

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:30.676
You know, I think teachers
inherently start

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:32.876
to integrate other subject matters

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.316
without maybe really
even thinking about it.

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.126
In this particular instance,
though, it's something

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:39.716
that you wouldn't normally see.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:45.256
An AP class, let alone a politics
class, partnering with an art class.

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:48.206
&gt;&gt;The sculpture class has
had a few questions based

00:01:48.206 --> 00:01:50.976
on the information that
you've put on here.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:55.736
&gt;&gt;Dayna and I were talking and
we decided that we wanted to try

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:57.936
to have a collaborative
piece working.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.996
&gt;&gt;Dayna: My AP government students
are currently researching public

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.986
policy issues, looking at why
laws are made, what issues arise

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:08.116
that cause these laws to be created.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:13.156
And so we have partnered with
Katlyn Wolfgang's class to use art

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:17.926
and sculpture as a forum for
these ideas to be expressed.

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:21.686
&gt;&gt;Katlyn: We tried to decide our goal
and the goal was for her students

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:25.036
to research policy, and my
goal was for my students

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.136
to develop a political art piece.

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.396
&gt;&gt;Dayna: So the process that you saw

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:33.886
in the classroom today was actually
the students looking at some feedback

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.336
that they were given by the
sculpture students on the topics

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:39.296
that they researched,
and additionally,

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:43.076
the sculpture students had
presented us with information

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.656
and brainstormed ideas
that they would

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.796
like to potentially create
their wire armatures.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:52.336
&gt;&gt;Katlyn: You have to come
up with these creative ideas

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:55.556
and creative solutions and that's
what the students are forced

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:56.396
to do in my class.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:03:00.066
They're forced to take these concepts
and then they have to apply it

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.326
to the different medium
that I supply to them.

00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:07.586
&gt;&gt;It really is opening the eyes,
I believe, of my AP students,

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:11.486
many of which have never taken an
art class, and really exposing them

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:15.706
to a different medium, as
well as one that can connect

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:18.556
with many more people
in the outside world.

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:22.036
&gt;&gt;As far as working with other
students and collaborating outside

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:25.366
of the classroom, it really
allows you to pull in more ideas

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:26.996
than just the people that
are in your classroom

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:28.016
and learning about the topic.

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:30.276
So we're learning more about
art and they're learning more

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.396
about the different ideas that
are going on in AP government.

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:36.566
&gt;&gt;Katlyn: When my students
leave my classroom,

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:41.356
I want them to leave prepared
to embark on the outside world.

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:44.946
&gt;&gt;I want them to have experiences
that are gonna help them elsewhere.

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:49.956
&gt;&gt;If we operate in our classroom
alone and we don't expose ourselves

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:52.306
to ideas of others, or open ourselves

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:55.616
to potential collaboration
opportunities,

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:59.316
then we're not truly going
to serve our students

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:01.096
in that twenty first
century capacity.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:06.876
In order to open yourself to new
ideas, it really just takes turning

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:08.266
to your colleague next to you.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:11.606
There are professionals out
there that are more than willing

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:15.846
to get involved in projects that you
may want to do within your classroom.
