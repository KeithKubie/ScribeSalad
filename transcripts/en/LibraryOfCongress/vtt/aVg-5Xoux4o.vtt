&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.030


00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; My name is Sydney Trent,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.316
and I'm a senior editor
at the Washington Post.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.603
I edit for the Washington
Post magazine and for Style.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.593
And I am also a mother
of two young girls.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.950
And so I'm particularly happy to
be here in the children's tent,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.350
because I know that when you're
really trying to get children

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.646
to read, with all the
competition that's out there --

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.600
video, TV, texting -- that you
really need great children's book

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.303
authors to get them
attached to the books.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.816
And there's no better friend

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.766
than a really wonderful
children's book author.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400
And we have one here
today, and that is Pat Mora.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.510
[Applause]

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.133
Okay. Pat Mora...is a -- she's a
literacy advocate, and she's excited

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.966
about what she calls "bookjoy".

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.830
She founded the family literacy
initiative, El Dia de los Ninos,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.256
El Dia de los Libros,
Children's Day, Book Day,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.726
now housed at the American
Library Association.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.190
The year-long commitment to daily
linking all children to books,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410
languages and cultures
culminates in celebrations

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.266
across the country on
or near April 30th.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.890
Her book titled Book Fiesta,
Celebrate Children's Day, Book Day,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.606
Celebremos El Dia de los
Ninos, El Dia de los Libros,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.873
HarperCollins, promotes
the Dia spirit.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.190
Mora's haiku collection about
foods of the Americas, "Yum!

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.430
Mmm! Que rico!"

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.050
-- I wish I could roll my Rs, but --

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.583
won the Americas award and
was an ALA notable book.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.560
"Dona Flor, A Tall Tale
About a Giant Woman

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.310
With a Great Big Heart" was
also an ALA notable book

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.790
that received a Pura Belpre Author
Honor Award and a Golden Kite Award

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.910
from the Society of Children's
Book Writers and Illustrators.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.996
Mora lives in New Mexico.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.466
And here she is.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900
[ Applause ]

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.526
&gt;&gt; It is so great to be
back at the book festival.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.543
This is my third visit.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.276
The first one I was sick as a dog.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.996
The second one I was afraid
I would be sick again.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.663
And this one I didn't
even worry, so --

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.986
buenos tardes, thank
you all for being here.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.960
I would have been very sad
to be in the tent by myself.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
So I thank you.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.940
It's a little toasty.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.406
There's no doubt about that.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.793
And there's part of
me a little longing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.553
for a little New Mexico breeze,
but there's nothing quite

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.386
like the National Book Festival, and
one of the things we're encouraged

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.596
to do is not to read to you,
but to chat a little bit

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.096
about what we do and why we do it.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.766
I had the wonderful experience in
the media tent a little bit ago

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.743
to be interviewed by kids.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.010
And I have to tell you, I write
both for adults and children,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.776
but for those of us who do both,
there is nothing like the affection

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.683
of young people, you know.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.946
So my friends who write only

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.776
for adults don't know what they are
missing, because kids have a way

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.056
of making us feel like rock stars.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.980
So I had three little
kids from close

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.926
by who had all prepared
wonderful questions.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.850
They were not bilingual,
but they were kids who were

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
in a bilingual immersion school,
and I loved their questions.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.520
And then there was a group
of students from Delaware

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.946
who have their own
television program.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.103
And they were here, and each
child asked me questions.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.550
So...I coined the word
"bookjoy", because I so love books.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.516
I love reading them and
I love writing them.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.623
And one of the things that both
groups of children asked me is,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.090
what's the best thing
about your job?

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.890
And I said, "Well, probably that
I get to spend time by myself."

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.093
And that's an odd thing
for young people growing

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.936
up in our very noisy culture,
I think, to understand.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.670
But in point of fact, we
can't be talking to them

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.050
about reading, if we're not readers.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.733
So I spend a lot of my life
talking to teachers and librarians.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.960
How many of you are
teachers or librarians?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.910
God bless you, you know.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.220
God bless you.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.753
That is such hard work.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.463
And you all are the people who
often connect what we do as authors

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.240
with the kids in your more
and more diverse classrooms.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.633
And if we're going to
have a democracy at all --

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.270
and one of the great things
about the book festival is,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.890
it has now become bipartisan, right?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.613
So it was started during the Bush
administration by Laura Bush.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.610
I'm a Texan by birth.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
And she brought the Texas
Book Festival to DC.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.740
But the great thing is, now with the
Obamas we still have the National

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.246
Book Festival, and
we heard last night

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.513
that a very generous donor
has guaranteed five more years

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.980
of funding.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480
[Applause]

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.863
I also want to be sure to say for
all these people in the red shirts,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.450
that in my other life I was
a university administrator,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.536
and staff never get respect.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.756
So I do -- you know, I thank all the
people at the Library of Congress.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.450
Yeah, it's an amazing
job [applause].

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.313
It's an amazing job.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.570
I have a wonderful young man sitting
quietly back here hoping nobody will

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.323
notice him, named David, who has
taken care of me all day long,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.273
and without him I would
not have been here on time.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.293
I would not, you know,
seemed fairly calm.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.930
So I can't say enough
about the volunteers.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.936
I'm gonna touch on a few
books, and then mostly

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.443
on the book that's being
featured here in Book Fiesta.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.146
A couple of the new books I have --
one of the questions people ask is,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.606
where do you get your
ideas for books?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.540
And I have on my computer
a list of the books I want

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.420
to write while I'm on this earth.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.806
And so I add to that list, and
sometimes one of the books kind

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.940
of moves up, but I'm
-- but sometimes --

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.076
not always, but sometimes
-- people give me ideas.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.793
And at first when people say,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.740
"I know the next book
you should write,"

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.440
I actually tense up a little bit.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.160
Because I'm very protective
about this list

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.740
that I've got on my computer, right?

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.603
And I don't want them to
feel that they're orphans,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.880
and that I'm not gonna
get back to them.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.073
But in fact, the last recent books
-- one, "Dizzy, Poems About Love,"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.866
was a Texas librarian who said,
"Why don't you write a book

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.356
of love poems for teens?"

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.753
And I kind of burst out laughing,
and I said, "Love poems for teens?"

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.970
And then I started asking teachers
and librarians as I traveled,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.536
and here was what tipped it.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.480
One librarian said, "Yes, because,
not only do the girls read them,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.223
but the boys read them
and sign their names."

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.453
And though I may be
against plagiarism,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.653
that was a temptation
I could not pass up.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.006
That was a joyous, joyous
book for me to write.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.060
And then, because teachers and
librarians often say to me,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.723
you know, I want to do what you do.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.820
I want to be a writer, but
my colleagues don't know.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.446
Tell me what to do.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.603
So I actually wrote a book
of letters called "Zing,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.110
Seven Practices for Educators and
Their Students," about seven ways

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.340
that I think we can
foster our own creativity.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.850
We are all creative, right?

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.456
Everybody in the tent is creative.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.100
It's just we need to foster that.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.113
And then, if we need to
foster it, how do we foster

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.860
that feeling in all of our students.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.053
And of course for me the
emphasis is always the word all.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.986
Not in some of our students,
but all of our students.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.080
Book Fiesta also involved -- evolved
by by someone sort of suggesting it.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.280
I had started -- it'll
be 15 years in April --

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:07.990
and my wonderful web team is here,
so I have to be sure to tell you

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.970
that we worked very
hard on the website,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.753
and I hope you will visit it,
because there's a lot of information

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.286
about this literacy --

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.886
family literacy project,
that's on the website.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.196
And we started out -- it's
got a long name, right?

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:28.896
So it gives you a chance
to practice your Spanish.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.803
It's called El Dia de los
Ninos, El Dia de los Libros,

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.756
Children's Day, Book Day.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.223
And I really started it when I
was being interviewed in Arizona

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.353
and someone said to me, "Will you
tape some of your books in Spanish?

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:48.610
Some of my books are in
English, some are bilingual.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.010
And -- because I want to
play them on the radio."

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.233
And I said, "Well, for what?"

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.833
And she said, "Well,
for Dia del Nino."

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.616
And I said, "Gee, I'm
from the border,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.150
and I've never heard of this."

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.496
And she said, "Oh, yes, in
Mexico on April 30th the schools

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.293
and the parents have this
big celebration for kids,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.446
and maybe it's a picnic
or treats or whatever."

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.156
So I walked out of the building,
and it was like something hit me

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.550
on the head, and I thought, well,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.016
we oughtta have Children's
Day, Book Day.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.533
You know, we have such a literacy
challenge in this country.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.143
We heard statistics last night,
one of 'em I'm still reeling from,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.130
that 80% of the families

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.116
in this country did not
buy one book last year.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.083
And I'm trying to believe
that's not true.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.940
But, we know that we have
a real literacy crisis.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.580
And, you know, if we
don't have readers,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.293
pretty soon we don't have people
who understand what's going

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.380
on in our political life, and in
our financial life, etc., etc.,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.340
etc. So I do feel passionately
about this, because I'm lucky enough

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.683
to be a reader, and I think
every one of you is, too, right?

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.903
So, when we've been given this gift
that we didn't earn, somehow we have

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.396
to share it, and that's
really what Dia is all about.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.876
So the -- in April we will have
the 15th anniversary, and schools

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.950
and libraries plan
something special,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.490
book parades and, you
know, contests.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.006
Usually they give away free books.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.500
And so, if you come from a community
that isn't celebrating Dia,

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.803
I am deputizing you
to go out and do this.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.076
So the book was actually evolved
-- it's called "Book Fiesta".

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.403
The illustrations are unbelievable.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.156
And when I visit elementary schools
-- and I'm very lucky, you know,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.743
because I write for both
adults and children,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.883
sometimes in the same day I may
go talk to graduate students

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:49.820
about the adult work, and
in the afternoon I go talk

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.560
to second-graders.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.693
And sometimes the second-graders
pay more attention

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.510
than the graduate students.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.043
But the -- it's always a
disappointment to the kids

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.063
when I say to them, now, you know,
I did not do the illustrations.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.073
And I see on their little
faces that they're thinking,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.520
then why did we invite you
to our school [laughter]?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.196
And when they ask me -- and the
students did this morning, you know,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.480
they said, well, why -- have you
ever illustrated your own book?

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.070
And I said, "Well, if
you'd ever seen me draw,

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.343
you wouldn't ask that."

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.100
You know, some years back,
when Pictionary was so popular,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.613
my family was playing it and
nobody wanted to be my partner.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.093
But I'm incredibly grateful
to the illustrators.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.563
You know, for picture books
the illustrator is key.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.320
So an editor happened to say to
me, well, I want to do something

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:50.936
to help promote the Dia concept, you
know, this idea of children's day,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.996
book day, and linking all children
to books, languages and cultures.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.260
And she said, "So we
ought to produce a book."

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.580
She was an editor with
HarperCollins.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.450
And initially she said, "Well,
I think it should be a story."

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.403
And I said, "Well, it's
gonna be kind of a tough --

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.863
a tough thing to write a story."

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.660
I had already written, some
of you know the book "Tomas

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.120
and the Library Lady," about --
a true story about Tomas Rivera,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.673
a migrant worker from Crystal
City, Texas, who, thanks to books

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.520
and a wonderful librarian in
his life, his wonderful parents,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.280
he went on to become the
president of the University

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.090
of California at Riverside.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:41.640
So it was an amazing journey
that this little boy made,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.606
and I love to talk to
children about this book.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.226
Because, you know, we say to
them anybody can be President.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.850
But in a way, we're a little
cynical about that, right?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.120
I mean, we are a little
cynical about that.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.713
But with Tomas's story, we really
have a concrete and true example

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.576
of a boy whose family
did not speak English,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.760
did not have economic resources, but
he goes on and, yes, there's the,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.660
you know, the -- a
librarian takes an interest

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.133
in him, his family supports him.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.730
Parts that are not in
the book for children

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:24.653
but that I think it's
important that we know.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.753
When he got his first degree,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.370
he was an English major
in the state of Texas.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.030
Nobody was gonna hire
him to teach English.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.556
Why? He was bilingual.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.306
How could someone who was
bilingual teach English.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.713
So I like we've progressed
beyond some of this, right?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.740
But the other thing that I find
about talking about Tomas is,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.140
kids have no idea what
a migrant worker is.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:53.860
And sometimes the kids who don't
know what a migrant worker is have

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.820
migrant families, you
know, maybe two miles away.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.436
So as I say to kids, how do we think
the strawberries got to the store?

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.443
You know. The idea that someone
is bending over in the hot sun,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.903
this whole piece of how we eat those
delicious red bites is somehow lost

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.350
on our kids.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.526
So Tomas was a great
way to talk about that,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.573
and I felt that to do another
book like that, a story,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.120
I didn't know that that was
going to be the thing for Dia.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.893
So this book really, I wanted

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.490
to show kids how books are
wonderful in outrageous places.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.536
And so the way I wrote it, and
the way the illustrator did it,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.130
is that the kids are reading their
books in the hot air balloon,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.740
they're reading their books
in the mouth of a whale,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.516
they're reading their books
on top of an elephant,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.243
and it just keeps reinforcing
that idea

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.673
of just the pleasure of reading.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.143
I was interviewed a few minutes
ago by a publication that works

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.536
with childcare workers, and they
asked me, "Well, what would you say

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.003
to people who are working with
the really little ones about how

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.136
to use these bilingual
books," because I mentioned

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.270
that in honest moments, sometimes
teachers and librarians would say

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.163
to me, "Well, I would like
to use the bilingual books,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.163
but I'm not bilingual."

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.096
And I love to stress the fact that,
you know, if you're at the front

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.373
of a room, just like if you're
at the head of the family,

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.406
right, you have a lot of power.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.336
Teachers and librarians
have a lot of power.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.406
And so if you're holding up
and sharing bilingual books,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:55.590
what you're saying to
your bilingual students,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.550
whether they speak Japanese or
Arabic at home, you're saying,

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.250
you know, languages matter,
languages are beautiful.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.706
And to say to those kids, you
know, I only speak one language,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:11.810
how many of you speak more than one?

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.310
I love this story.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.516
I visited one -- an
international school in Colorado.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.036
One of the little guys
spoke five languages.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.240
So I say to kids, never
think there isn't room

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.080
in your head for these languages.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.996
Of course there is.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.663
I want to be sure we
have time for questions.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.496
And we have a timekeeper
with a big smile up here.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.353
So I'm hoping you're
gonna have questions.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.313
We have a mike here.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.180
Is that it?

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.180
All right.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.580
Oh, and a mike there.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.846
So although I haven't talked about,
you know, a lot of the other books,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:49.373
you can ask me about
whatever you want,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:51.850
but don't leave me
up here by myself.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.590
So be bold.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.686
I always say to audiences,
if you were third-graders,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.826
you would all have lined up.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960


00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.970
&gt;&gt; When you write about in Spanish,
and you write about in English,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.316
do you think that the thought of
Spanish, like Spanish will overcome

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.970
in certain way the English.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.830
What I want to mean is,
I am that teacher of ESL.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.770
I have teach four years.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.543
My first language is Spanish.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.813
So my drama is, should I
transfer the strength of English

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.196
like English, or should
I reserve that strength

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.606
of the Spanish and the English.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.176
&gt;&gt; Alright, it's a great
question about, you know,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.183
Spanish was his first
language, and -- I am bilingual.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:07.923
All of my grandparents came
from Mexico at the time

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.723
of the Mexican Revolution.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.656
However, I have always
been bilingual.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.976
So I have no memory
of not speaking both.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.560
And because I have spent my entire
professional life in English,

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.596
I always say I am bilingual,
but English dominant.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.863
I know all the rules in English.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.946
I know when I can break them and
when I can't, although I have

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.713
to say I heard more
grammatical errors this morning

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:42.750
from some very -- people
in very prestigious places.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:46.183
So we all know that, you know --

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:48.293
what we talk about English
grammar is changing every minute.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.473
So I start out in English.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.323
I did do one long poem -- I
had two wonderful parents.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.793
When my dad died, I wanted

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.976
to do really something
special to honor him.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.646
And so I did a long poem
completely in Spanish.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.630
And that was a real challenge,
not because of the Spanish,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.203
but because I did a
poetic form popular

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:19.930
on the border called the corrido.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.776
So I was both learning the form, and
I was sitting in Cincinnati, Ohio,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:26.920
with my Spanish-English dictionary
and a book about the form.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.633
But you know we do
things to honor people.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.173
So I think, you know,
as a teacher BLL,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.060
what I say to kids is I want
them to be able to speak English

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:41.743
and whatever their
other home language is.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.923
I want them to be able to read it,
write it and speak it really well.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.700
The truth of the matter is that
kids who do not speak English

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.120
in this country are often
still viewed as second-class.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.486
So for those of you who work with
students who are not, you know,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.670
dominant in English, they are
wrestling with -- internally --

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.783
with this sense that am
I really good enough?

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.813
And it just drives me crazy,
which is one of the reasons I feel

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.033
so passionately about linking
all children to books, languages,

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.016
in the plural, and cultures.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.433
How about on this side?

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.700
&gt;&gt; Hi. I am a third-grade
teacher, and we are going to be,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.690
in our shared reading, reading
about Tomas and the Library Lady,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.276
but in my guided reading,

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.276
we're going to be reading a
little book about your life.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.166
They -- my kids know that
I've come to see you today,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.520
and I wanted to ask you
what message would you

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.133
like me to take back to them?

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.386
&gt;&gt; Well, it's always the same
message, which is to be readers.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.013
I want them to be readers.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.813
And I think the hard thing,
when we're particularly --

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.300
if we're working with parents,
and, you know, when I say parents

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.183
who are not readers, those could
be really wealthy parents, right?

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.513
Today the fact that someone isn't
a reader doesn't have to do just

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.426
with your economic state.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:06.863
But I think, you know, we
want kids to feel that --

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.790
and that's part of the Dia
message -- that reading is fun.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.240
You know, that it's
not a punishment.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.740
I stress this with
parents all the time.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:17.863
It should never be a punishment.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:19.876
I mean, it's an utter pleasure.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:22.256
Some of us got to hear the editor
of the New Yorker this morning,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.430
and he was simply eloquent.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.753
And he spoke about
fear of being alone.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.543
And in my book for educators, Zing,

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:38.603
that's the second practice
I recommend,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:40.803
that you have to cultivate a
willingness to be alone, right?

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.670
To be a reader or to be a writer,

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.670
you have to grow comfortable
with being alone.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.270
That can be hard sometimes, when
we say that to young people.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.906
I was in my hometown of El Paso,
Texas, last week and I was speaking

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.406
to about a thousand kids,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.540
pre-service teachers
who were reading Zing.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.350
And some of them had said to their
professors, "Ooh, I don't know if I

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.090
like this idea of wanting quiet."

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.860
You know, I say cultivate
a pleasure in quiet.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.790
But we need to stress that.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.190
If you don't have quiet,
how are you gonna think,

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.390
and how are you gonna hear yourself?

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.523
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a student, and I
recently had an assignment

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.040
in my creative writing class to
write from a child's point of view,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.360
and I found it kind of difficult.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.690
And I was wondering how you
find it so easy to write

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.150
from a child's point
of view in your books.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.056
&gt;&gt; It's probably 'cause I'm
still a child [laughter].

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.880
And really, I think there's a
lot of truth to that, you know.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.473
I think that part of what happens
over time, when you first sit

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.466
down -- and I try to talk
about this in Zing --

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.873
that it takes a while to get rid

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.126
of all those what are people
gonna think, how'm I gonna sound,

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.313
what are people gonna say.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.230
The more you write, the more
when you get to that page,

00:23:59.530 --> 00:23:59.940
you're kinda curious about
what you're gonna say.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.986
And so I really do try to get lost
in the child that I am writing about

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.793
or writing for, and I'm trying
not to hear anything else.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.386
So if -- you're still hearing the
other people in your class, right?

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.753
And over time, if you keep doing
it, you won't hear them any more.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.826
&gt;&gt; How many schools have you
been, and when the students come,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.330
are they excited and do they
be polite or do they be rude?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.713
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, I think
we should clap for you for going

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.793
up to ask a question [applause].

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.660


00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.923
That was very brave.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.593
You know, I visit some schools,
as I say, because I write

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.176
for grown-ups and for children.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.410
I visit both, so I visit -- and
I speak at a lot of conferences.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.740
I don't know how many
schools I've visited.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.750
They are almost always polite.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.786
And I was a teacher before I started
writing, so if they're not polite,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.526
I kind of stop everything,
you know, how teachers do.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.950
And I say, well, if you're
gonna talk, I'm not gonna talk.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.963
And so usually they're very polite.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.296
And what I love best is
sometimes when I visit a school,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.196
and they maybe have
memorized some of my poems,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.703
and they let me hear them.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.823
That's a real treat.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.756
So thank you again.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.423
&gt;&gt; Hi. I am a teacher educator,
and I didn't get to hear all

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.003
of your talk, but the part

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.533
that I heard I really thank
you for and appreciate.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.273
I do use your children's books
with my pre-service teachers,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.693
and one of the things that
I'm wondering if you find this

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.433
with other people, but my
students are primarily white

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.060
and English-speaking, and
they don't like Dona Flor.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.500
And I don't know if
it's because they --

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.390
and there's a couple of other books.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.356
There's -- I can't think of
the name of it right now,

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.536
but a book about a legendary
character who's African-American,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.090
and they don't like that one either.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.130
And if they can't get their minds
around a legend that's not white,

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.763
and so I don't know if
that is something that --

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.210
&gt;&gt; What a fascinating
thing for you to say.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.330
If I were you, I would really
try to get behind some of that,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.920
either by having them do kind of
private writing, you know, to you.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.690
But just trying to create an
atmosphere where they could talk

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.066
about why, because in a sense the
whole idea is, I am empowering.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.556
I mean, for those of you
who don't know Dona Flor,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.683
it's the Paul Bunyan
legend that inspired it.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.473
But it's an immense, bilingual
woman with a great big heart.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.456
Are we out of time?

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.190
Oh, over time.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.723
That's what I would do.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.256
I appreciate it.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.790
And I do -- maybe saying
don't like is a little strong.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.656
They don't believe it.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.723
And I keep saying, it's not
supposed to be believable.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.190
It's a legend.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.990
&gt;&gt; Right. It's a tall tale.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.590
Well, I will be signing books later.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.590
I would love to chat
with all of you.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.580
Thank you, thank you,
thank you [applause].
