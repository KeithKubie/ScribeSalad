KEN HOETMER: All right.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.250
Well, let's get started.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.840
So welcome to the Fireside
Chat with the

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.320
Google Maps API Team.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.460
This is a chance for you to ask
any one of us a question

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.890
that is appropriately contextual
to maps, and we'll

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.490
do our best to answer.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.860
So just a chance for you
to interact with us.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.110
And this session is being
recorded, so people who watch

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.080
later, it's not Livestream,
but it's being recorded.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600
So people on YouTube can watch
us later and hear the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.560
questions that you ask and
our answers as well.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.030
So before we go into questions--
and if you want to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.710
ask a question, just start
lining up behind the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.820
microphones--

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.200
we'll just go through and
introduce ourselves.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.670
So my name is Ken.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm product manager based in
Sydney working on a number of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.970
different Maps APIs, but
probably the largest one being

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.550
the JavaScript Maps API.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.760
MIKE PERROW: Hi.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.240
My name is Mike Perrow.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.800
I'm the engineering lead for
Geo Down Under in Sydney,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.380
which includes our Maps APIs,
Google Maps Coordinate, and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.670
some advertising products
for Maps.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.010
DAVID WANG: Hi, My name's
David Wang.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.510
I'm also based in Sydney.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.390
I'm the manager for a number of
API projects including Maps

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.680
API, Android API, iOS API,
and a few others, too.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.980
MANO MARKS: Hi.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.810
I'm Mano Marks.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.790
I'm the lead developer advocate
for the Google Maps

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.640
Developer Relations Team.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.940
JEN KOVNATS: Hi.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.950
I'm Jen Kovnats.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.420
I'm a product manager in Sydney
working on Google Maps

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.310
Engine APIs.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.450
ANDREW FOSTER: Hi.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.270
I'm Andrew Foster.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.940
I'm the product manager for
Google's GO Mobile APIs, so on

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.530
Android and iOS.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.980
DAVE DAY: Hi, my name's Dave
Day, and I'm the technical

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.810
lead for all the web-based Maps
APIs, so things like the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.400
JavaScript API, Static
Maps, Geocoding, all

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.510
those sort of things.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.080
JAMES MCGILL: Hi.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.790
My name's James McGill, and I'm
the technical lead for the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.300
Google Maps Engine APIs.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.140
MANO MARKS: So if you have any
questions, please just come up

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.825
to the mics in the center,
because if you don't, we'll

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.900
all leave here.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.039
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.990
I was just wondering if you
guys have any plans to add

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.590
support for tracking aircraft
to Maps, to the Maps APIs or

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.840
the Maps products?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.650
KEN HOETMER: I'll
take that one.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.350
It's a good question.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.780
We have the Google Flight Search
products, which are

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.530
about booking.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.280
But I don't know of any plans
offhand that I'm aware of to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.790
start doing live tracking
of planes within that.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.180
I think if we were to start
doing live tracking of planes,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.670
you'd probably see it emerge
in our consumer Google Maps

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.520
applications before you'd
see it emerge in an API.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.820
MANO MARKS: But we can't
talk about features

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.290
that we haven't released.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.140
We're not allowed to say
anything about--

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.000
KEN HOETMER: I'm just
postulating

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.480
what would be cool.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.730
MANO MARKS: Just postulating.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.680
Sorry.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.890
Just doing the thing that I
always have to do at these.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.490
AUDIENCE: I also had
an API question.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.940
I was wondering if there are
any plans in the future to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.150
have some sort of route
optimization API or some sort

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.750
of thing like that
in Google Maps?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.110
MANO MARKS: We have that.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.080
That's in the Directions API or
in the Directions service.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.980
You can add in a number of
waypoints and tell us to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.970
optimize it.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.480
In the free Maps API, you can
add up to eight waypoints,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.530
plus your start and
end locations.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.460
And in the Google Maps API
for Business, it's start

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.340
and end plus 23.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.960
MANO MARKS: Sure.

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:48.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.025
I'm going to ask a question
somebody else asked yesterday,

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:55.070
and I didn't really hear
an answer to it, quite.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.430
The person asked if there was
a negative version of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.720
waypoints, like a
no waypoints--

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.550
places that you set as places
you want to avoid.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.770
For example.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.440
I want to get across
town, but I don't

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.060
want to take the highway.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.620
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.060
We don't currently have
that in the Maps API.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.200
AUDIENCE: I know you're not
allowed to speculate about

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.314
what you might be doing
in the future, but--

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:27.330
MANO MARKS: It's a great idea
and certainly, if that would

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.610
be a feature you'd be interested
in, I would

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.710
recommend adding it to
the Issue Tracker

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.660
as a Feature Request.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.770
Because we actually spend quite
a bit of time looking

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.910
over that and are really excited
to get input about

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.260
what developers want.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.780
So yeah, do it, and then get all
your friends to star the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.630
issue, so then it'll
raise that.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.250
We'll see that people are
interested in it.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.210
AUDIENCE: There's one other one
that I put into the Issue

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.630
Tracker actually today, which
was about places, about nearby

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.920
searches for places.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.570
I'd like to be able to do that
along a polyline, like to pass

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.810
a polyline rather than a point,
and see all the coffee

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.206
shops on the route home,
for example, or

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:09.926
something like that.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:11.610
MANO MARKS: That's a
really good idea.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.770
AUDIENCE: Is that--

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.630
I heard that some people have
proposed that, but I haven't

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.832
heard if it's actually
coming down or not.

00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:22.030
KEN HOETMER: The phrase that's
often used for it is Search

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.710
Along a Route.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.850
And at the moment, we don't
have that functionality.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.890
But star it.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.560
We've seen some areas get Street
View imagery updates.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.520
Has there been any thought put
to interfaces to see older

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.260
versions of Street
View imagery?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.510
KEN HOETMER: That's an
interesting question.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.700
I typically hear the question
of can I get access to older

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.290
versions in Satellite Imagery?

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.940
That's the way it's typically
answered.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.310
At the moment, that's not
something that we're able to

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.450
offer, so I don't have anything
that I can say at

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.490
this time, no.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.270
MANO MARKS: Although for
satellite and aerial imagery

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.928
in Google Earth, we do have
older versions, just not for

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:12.170
Street View.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.910
AUDIENCE: I had one
quick question.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.530
Can we have an API where we
combine the location and the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.570
camera, everything put together,
so that I can take

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.970
the picture and the location
together with one API?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.820
MANO MARKS: I'm not sure I--

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.170
AUDIENCE: It's for augmented
reality.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.530
Supposing if I'm going
somewhere, I take a picture,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.670
and I also want to share
my location,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.610
together with one API.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.690
I should be able to do that
and put my location and my

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.190
picture on the Google
Maps in the map.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.550
Right now, I'm trying to
do it separately with

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.080
two different APIs--

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.220
the Camera API and the
Location Manager API.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.420
But if you have an API which
does just both of them

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.200
together, then it can be a good

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.670
augmented reality app easily.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.790
Right now, we have to do it
with multiple things.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.040
MANO MARKS: It wouldn't be
that hard to actually

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.290
implement that.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.430
If you take a photo on a phone
that embeds the location, you

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.860
can parse out the
Exif headers.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.680
And then you could use that to
determine the location the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.160
camera was at when
it was taken.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.580
AUDIENCE: Now we use
two different APIs.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.720
Supposing if I'm writing an app
to have a camera intent,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.080
then I have a location manager
intent, everything.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.370
So I have to get a location from
my Location Manager, and

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.190
then from the Camera, I have
to get my picture, and then

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.915
combine both of them together.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:41.470
Instead of that, there is one
API, which is both of them.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.430
MANO MARKS: You're talking about
on a phone, an Android.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.650
AUDIENCE: On the API level.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.910
If we get an API level, we'd
see Get My Location

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.970
along with the image.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.370
If there is an option,
then it will be--

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.830
MANO MARKS: That's an
interesting idea.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.860
AUDIENCE: It would be good
for so many other things.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.500
MANO MARKS: That would
be one for a Feature

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.540
Request Issue Tracker.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.220
DAVE DAY: I mean, I think
in general, one of our

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.470
philosophies is to give small
composable parts and then, as

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.910
the developer that brings all
those pieces together and

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.120
builds her application, and that
way you can mix and match

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.290
them however is the most
appropriate to your

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:16.790
application.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.970
Whereas if we start bundling
them, then they start really

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.330
becoming used for only very few
specific applications, if

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.750
that makes sense.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.320
DAVE DAY: So that's what
we found works better.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.360
MANO MARKS: Our preference is
to not control how you use

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.960
your own data within the

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.940
experience as much as possible.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.270
AUDIENCE: You could have
something like a fused API or

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.020
something like that, like if
you have a fused location

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.480
manager and [INAUDIBLE], which
does the cell Wi-Fi and the

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.200
GPS together, something
like that.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.990
One more question I had.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.640
I had once gone to another
conference where Motorola was

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.960
displaying their phones.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.860
They said they have a barometer

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.050
to measure the pressure.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.340
So can we have an API
to get the pressure?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.010
That way, along with the
location, you can have the

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.440
pressure also together put?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.670
MANO MARKS: Well, I believe on
the Android devices that are

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.430
produced by Motorola, you can
actually access that sensor.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.130
So most Android devices don't
come with that, but I know the

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.760
Motorola Xoom did,
for instance.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.000
And there was some really
interesting work done in

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.660
Germany by some researchers who
are able to do things like

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.040
determine elevation within
the subway system

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.670
using barometric pressure.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.900
So certainly I think Motorola
does expose that within that.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:49.020
And the Android platform gives
the ability for OEMs for phone

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.580
manufacturers to expose
additional sensors beyond the

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.400
ones that are within the
standard Android platform.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.690
AUDIENCE: Like if you combine
the location with the

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.590
pressure, and if there is any
tsunami or anything coming, we

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.030
can know easily that way.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.640
MANO MARKS: Yeah, you could do
things around weather and

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.030
stuff like that.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.280
That would be interesting.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:08.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.500
I had a couple questions about
indoor locating technology.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.970
Do you guys have a target
accuracy level that you want

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.890
to get to consistently
when you're

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.470
locating phones indoors?

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.780
And I mean consistently.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.050
I mean, obviously, sometimes
you'll be--

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.230
do you guys have a target
accuracy level

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.810
that you want to hit?

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.940
MANO MARKS: You mean for indoor
maps, how accurate?

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.800
We try and get as accurate
as possible.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.500
KEN HOETMER: I think this
is a question about

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.900
the hardware, right?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.340
So we have maps of indoor
locations, and then when you

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.420
take your phone into the indoor
location, your phone

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.750
needs to be able to find
out where it is.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.880
And that's something that's
typically built into the

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.410
hardware that you're using,
and then would be exposed

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.470
through the kinds of services
that Android would perhaps

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.590
build on top of that, on
top of the hardware.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.400
MANO MARKS: But for indoor, part
of that is built on the

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.390
Wi-Fi, and so that's
part of the Google

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.482
services that are done.

00:11:17.482 --> 00:11:19.300
DAVID WANG: I can say
something here.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.420
If you saw Waleed's talk on
Beyond the Blue Dot, they're

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.170
doing some very interesting
things with sensors, and his

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.350
mission is one centimeter
accuracy everywhere.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.090
So one centimeter's the
target, I guess.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.610
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.296
Thanks.

00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:36.736
MANO MARKS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:37.910
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.580
Not some random person.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.490
I could just ask you.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.248
On that one too, can you talk
about some of the-- and you

00:11:45.248 --> 00:11:46.780
kind of alluded to with
the hardware--

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:52.640
any kind of hardware
enhancements, or anything

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.970
you're looking at to enhance
the indoor locating

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.450
technology?

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.860
Obviously, Bluetooth
is one of them.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.320
Obviously, you talked about
Wi-Fi and Blue Dot today.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.720
Are there any other ones that
you guys are looking at to

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.700
enhance that accuracy?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.330
MIKE PERROW: I think that comes
under, a little bit, the

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.580
answer to the last question in
that I think between us on

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.390
stage, we don't have anyone
on the Android

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.570
Platform Team here.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.720
Waleed, who gave a talk earlier
or yesterday, should

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.990
be around the conference.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.270
If you come by the Maps booth
tomorrow, we can probably

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.440
point you in the direction of
someone who can talk a bit

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.890
more intelligently about that.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.490
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.740
MIKE PERROW: Thanks.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.650
AUDIENCE: I'm a little nervous
about that gong.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.230
Is that for poor questions
or for poor answers?

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.760
MANO MARKS: I was wondering
about that, too, because that

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.110
was up here when we got here.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.680
So I'm thinking at some
point, we vote one

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.160
of us off the island.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.130
AUDIENCE: I've got
two questions.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.840
The first is about
the GME API.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.540
And I could be wrong, but I'm
under the impression that

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.490
currently, it's not possible
to create a table.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.350
If that's true, I'm wondering if
there's a timeline of when

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.860
that might be possible?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.010
JEN KOVNATS: Either of us.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.340
James is the TL, I'm
the APM on that.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.630
So that's right.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.410
Currently, it's not possible.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.970
What we did on this past Friday
was actually a soft

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.590
launch of the complete Google
Maps Engine API, it's SLA.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.070
And we wanted to start with a
small feature set to begin

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.530
with, just to make sure that we
could get it out the door,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.130
make sure it's really stable,
and get people using it.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.520
It's sort of a logical
progression to be able to

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.120
create tables.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.360
So it's on the roadmap, but
we don't really have a

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.760
date to give you.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.880
JEN KOVNATS: Yeah.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.130
And so the other thing Mano's
just whispering to me to

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.280
mention is that we have the
option now to give trial

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.210
accounts on GME.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.720
So if you're interested in
trying out Google Maps Engine,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.670
come by our Maps booth on the
second floor and we can give

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.420
you a trial account.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.180
AUDIENCE: So my second question
is probably a lot

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.290
more basic, but it has to do
with kind of maybe throttling

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.290
through APIs.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.300
I'm not sure if all Google APIs

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.200
authenticate the same way.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.610
I'm more familiar with Fusion
tables where you've got an

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.020
application key and an OAuth
kind of option as to how to do

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.180
it, and whether throttling is
different in terms of how much

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.990
you can do, whether use one or
the other or both for the

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.960
Google Maps APIs.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.455
Is that similar there?

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.480
DAVE DAY: So we've actually got
a pretty diverse mix of

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.970
authentication stories across
the APIs, mostly because of

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.070
the historical.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.440
Some of our APIs are
many years old.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.540
Eight years old is our
oldest, so it's

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.430
quite a different story.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.230
We are looking to go
increasingly uniform, so

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.240
things like the GME API is using
what we consider the

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.380
best of our current
technology.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.160
And that's the sort
of thing we'll be

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.030
going towards, generally.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.130
AUDIENCE: Which is what,
specifically, for throttling?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.240
Is it per OAuth, I guess?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.490
DAVE DAY: Yeah, it's
an OAuth-based--

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.190
JAMES MCGILL: Yeah, so the
limits in place for the GME

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:03.770
API, there is a per developer
limit tied to the simple API

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.300
access key that you use when
you're accessing the API.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.750
If you're accessing through
OAuth, the tie back to your

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.730
developer account is encoded
in the client

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.750
secrets you use for OAuth.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.980
That's used to make sure that
in GME, because data is

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.820
centrally hosted, it's used to
make sure that one developer

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.970
isn't using up a lot
of quota against

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.700
someone else's hosting.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.865
There's also quota limits
applied against hosting that

00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:33.415
you configure as well, in terms
of how many requests are

00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:35.705
allowed per day and how
much quota you have in

00:15:35.705 --> 00:15:37.316
your account overall.

00:15:37.316 --> 00:15:37.810
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.060
Thanks.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.160
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.100
I have a question about tracking
assets with GPS.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.760
Since the accuracy is not very
high, sometimes the points get

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.960
very far from the road.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.420
For example, if you visualize
it in Street View, the point

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.700
gets behind a building
and is not visible.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.710
Is there a way to project the
point back on the road via an

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.855
API, or is it possible to access
now the vector data of

00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:12.590
the road and do something
with that?

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.320
KEN HOETMER: So potentially,
yes.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.820
We call that feature
Snap to Road.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.550
The idea would be that you have
a trail of crumbs coming

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.210
from a mobile device.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.480
The mobile device is probably
on a road, but they do this.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.660
Right?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.680
And what you want to know is,
which road did the vehicle go

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.790
down and how far?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.190
And then where did it
turn and what road

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.200
did it go down again?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.960
So stay tuned for something
in that space.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.352
I can't give you a date, but
I'll say stay tuned.

00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:44.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.100
Thank you.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:16:59.790
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.810
I was wondering about what kind
of data you possess in

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:10.540
your maps regarding, for
instance, speed limits, the

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.720
width of the road.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.670
Say we have a bridge, how tall
it is, what kind of trucks can

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.280
go through it, and such?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.690
KEN HOETMER: Are you referring
to the Ground Truth project

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.770
and the kind of data that we
pull out of that and pull into

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.450
the base maps?

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.270
I'm trying to--

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.130
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of wondering
about what kind of

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.800
metadata you have
for your maps.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.050
KEN HOETMER: Right.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.460
So unless somebody wants to jump
in and reinterpret the

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.260
question, I think what we do and
we've talked about in our

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.370
Ground Truth project is a lot of
the imagery that we collect

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.770
from Street View is actually
used by operators to make our

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.980
base maps better.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.810
This is something
that the Google

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.790
Maps team does, generally.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.470
And a lot of the things that
they pull out of that are

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.790
things like stop signs
and one way streets,

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.680
and names of streets.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.300
And that's done in a hybrid
automatic, as well as there's

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.170
some operators who
look at that.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.320
And that's one of the major
sources we use for that kind

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.570
of information and to verify
that kind of information.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.060
MANO MARKS: So there was
actually a talk on that, the

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.920
Ground Truth talk yesterday,
which will be

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.350
on YouTube as well.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.270
And they also talked about
things like place names.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.070
So that's used to improve Google
Places and the Places

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.030
API, and a lot of that
sort of thing.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.720
Yeah, it's really great.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.510
And speed limits was
one of the ones

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.790
that they talked about.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.380
Speed limit data turns out to
be one these ones that's

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.980
really difficult to
get canonical

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.950
sources for speed limits.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.550
And this is kind of the only
way, I think, it can be done

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.680
is by driving all the roads
and picking up images.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.180
KEN HOETMER: So I'll just tell
you a bit of a story about

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.460
speed limits.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.000
I had lunch with one of the
engineers in Zurich who's

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.370
working on this, and he was
telling me how difficult it

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.550
is, because there's a difference
between posted

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.700
speed limits and actual
speed limits.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.970
Sometimes people drive slower
than the speed limit, and

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.080
sometimes people drive faster
than the speed limit.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.020
And sometimes that can change
between when the

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.320
speed limits change.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.370
And so actually creating a model
of how fast vehicles

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.595
actually travel and whether or
not they're over the speed

00:19:28.595 --> 00:19:30.350
limit or under the speed limit
is actually very, very

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.520
difficult, because it turns
out that the data is just

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.910
very, very noisy.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.600
AUDIENCE: I was just thinking
governments, for instance,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.860
possess usually information
about their streets and the

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.400
speed limits and such.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.760
Can you get that information
and incorporate

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.020
them into your maps?

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.850
MANO MARKS: Governments
publish that?

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.870
Actually, it's pretty hard
to get it, but we do.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.490
Whenever we can find open data,
we do acquire that data.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.460
Part of the Ground Truth
project is doing that.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.250
And it's part of why we do
encourage open data,

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:13.190
particularly from governments,
so not only Google but

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.820
everybody has access
to that data.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.460
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.126
I'm coming from Hong
Kong, and I've

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:24.080
got a couple of questions.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.380
First of all, is a very
hard problem.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.720
We still do not have Google
Earth in the Hong Kong Apple

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.270
App Store--

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.470
I don't know why--

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.030
still now.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.930
Because we [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.310
Google Earth as a very useful
client to the Google Earth

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.160
enterprise.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.980
So if it's not available,
that would be a problem.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.280
And the next question is I've
heard about a business photos

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.240
program as mentioned by
some talks before.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.270
And I'm just wondering if the
Google Maps API, no matter if

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.740
it's Android API or the
JavaScript API, is able to

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.940
call those business photos?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.010
I mean the Indoor Street View.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.650
And the third question
is about the--

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.510
MANO MARKS: I'm sorry.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.370
Hi.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.780
I don't think I quite

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.970
understood the second question.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.090
The first question was Google
Earth is not in the Hong Kong

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.620
App Store, which I've talked to
Peter Birch about this, and

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.740
he said that shouldn't
be true.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.670
But I'll follow up
with him on that.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.300
What was the second question?

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.360
AUDIENCE: The question is
whether we can, for business

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.810
photos, they take the Street
View of the shops.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.560
But for developers,
we can call the

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.940
Street View on the roads.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.760
So is it possible for us to call
the Street View inside a

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.030
shop to display on our
own application?

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.600
DAVE DAY: So at the moment, it
is possible in the JavaScript

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.230
API to navigate to the Indoor
Street View through just the

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.330
user interaction model.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.650
The only piece that's really
missing there is giving you a

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.800
programmatic way to find which
places have Street View and

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.310
then landing them directly
into the [? library. ?]

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.220
But definitely, the imagery's
already available.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.510
And so [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.020
And also, we have been longing
for the Mapmaker to be

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.060
available in Hong Kong, because
our customers usually

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.590
complain about some
of the map data.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.340
So there is no news or timeline
that Mapmaker will

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.540
come to Hong Kong, so we
are looking for this.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.060
MANO MARKS: Yeah, so we are
rolling out Mapmaker and

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.170
Ground Truth around the world.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.750
And I can't give you a timeline
for when it will come

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:45.050
to Hong Kong, but
we're hopeful.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.100
We've got Ground Truth
in 40 some countries.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.100
Does anybody know off the
top of their heads?

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.680
Yeah, but basically
most of the world.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.390
If you look at the Ground Truth
talk that was yesterday,

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.910
he talked a bit about
Mapmaker as well.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:10.760
So definitely, our plan is to
make it as global as possible.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.610
AUDIENCE: So here's
the last question.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:18.550
In the Android API for the
indoor positioning launched

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.470
yesterday, and I find it
really accurate for the

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.340
Moscone West Center.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.570
But for building applications
for our customers, they were

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.740
asking whether this feature
will be available in their

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.250
[? radio, ?]

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.170
because they may not have
that kind of AP density

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.220
and things like that.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.950
So just wondering if there
is anything that we, as a

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.260
developer, can help them, like
setting up APs or anything

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.750
that we can do to help enhance
the user experience or the

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.590
accuracy on their [? radio ?]
instead of just waiting for

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.610
Google to come and
take the data?

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.992
DAVID WANG: Yeah.

00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:58.460
So I think we'll have
to defer this to--

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.855
you know, Mano.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.630
MANO MARKS: And yes, you can see
this in Waleed's talk as

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.760
well, but there's an app
in the App Store.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.000
Once you've uploaded a floor
plan to Google--

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.550
and just search on Google
Floor Plan Manager, or

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.540
something like that.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.990
Once it's been uploaded, then
you can get an app that allows

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:24.670
you to walk around your store or
your location, and it will

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.880
map the Wi-Fi locations.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.720
So yeah.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.180
You can absolutely do this.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.790
And I think this is actually
a really great way for

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:38.980
developers to have business be
on a developer story, is

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.340
becoming part of the Business
Photos program, and then also

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.240
doing this indoor floor plans
and mapping to become a more

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.560
full service person, people.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.710
And this is [INAUDIBLE], who is
one of our Google Developer

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.570
experts in Hong Kong.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.960
So thank you, [INAUDIBLE],
for your hard work.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Mano.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.360
DAVID WANG: So Waleed actually
gave a talk--

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.430
I think it was yesterday--

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.430
where he showed how to use the
tool where you can do that.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.290
And the Android API today
essentially shares the same

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.900
infrastructure.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.670
So once that process goes
through, you should be able to

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.610
use it in your API, and it will
just magically appear.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.860
There's nothing we need to do.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.570
AUDIENCE: These are probably
feature requests, but in Maps,

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.180
getting transit mode directions,
is it possible to

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.270
coerce the walking portion
of your trip?

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.460
MANO MARKS: Coerce it to
be longer, you mean?

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.610
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.460
Or to be a proportion, or
some minimum value.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.230
MANO MARKS: We don't currently
have that capability.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.410
Yeah, you know, it's
interesting.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.760
I remember a long time ago,
511.org had that ability where

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.000
you could set minimum and
maximum walking distances for

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.930
their transit tool.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.790
Yeah, you might be able to fudge
it with some combination

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.710
of multiple calls and doing a
walking thing to a certain--

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.440
but yeah, there's currently
not a way to do that.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.640
AUDIENCE: Unrelated, when you
get directions, a way to have

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.860
them transported over to your
Google Activity Report.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.360
MANO MARKS: Your Google
Activity Report?

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.330
KEN HOETMER: I think this is
more a question about the

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.270
Google Maps consumer
application, I think.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.250
MANO MARKS: Is that right?

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.430
KEN HOETMER: Well, if it's going
to be in your Google

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.185
Activity Report, you have to be
logged in, and it would be

00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:40.440
you using Google Maps.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.790
So that's a good question.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.440
It would seem to me something
that would be appropriate for

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.370
the Activity Report.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.620
But I don't have a good
answer for that.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.960
As an API team, we don't
actually work on the

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.865
maps.google.com product
ourselves.

00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:57.115
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.170
MANO MARKS: I think you were
first in the front.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:02.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.460
So I'm working on a project
similar to the Igloo upstairs.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.050
I was wondering if there is a
way to get the equilateral

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.580
projection of a Street
View coordinate?

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.550
DAVE DAY: Are you talking about
the Google Street View,

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.480
or the ones that have been
taken on your phone?

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.440
AUDIENCE: The Google
Street View.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.390
DAVE DAY: Not at the moment.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.280
We have the Street View Image
API, but that comes back

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.840
pre-projected to try and give
you the right look.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.455
And we have the client side one,
which does the projection

00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:47.450
in the browser to make
it look right as

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.700
you're moving it around.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.690
But we don't actually expose
any way to get to the

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.860
underlying geometry at this
stage, of the image.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.450
AUDIENCE: Is there someone
that I can talk to

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.470
advocate for that?

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.010
DAVE DAY: Yeah, if you want
to have a chat with me

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.140
afterwards, I can try and
understand exactly what you're

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.440
trying to do and see
what's possible.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:06.920
Yeah.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.530
AUDIENCE: OK, awesome.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.470
DAVE DAY: Chris might also
be a great help, just

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.050
there next to you.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.300
Hi, Chris.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.990
Is there any way to embed a
sphere photo to info window?

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.550
MANO MARKS: I'm sorry.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.590
Embed a what?

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.330
AUDIENCE: I would like to use
a sphere photo to embed to

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.770
info window.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.830
MANO MARKS: A photo sphere
in an info window?

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.580
Are you talking about
in JavaScript or on

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.600
an Android or iPhone?

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.850
What platform are you?

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.260
AUDIENCE: Not Android.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.170
On the PC.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.420
MANO MARKS: On PC.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.380
Well, Dave, you look ready.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.920
DAVE DAY: Yes, that's
possible.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.510
So it's a matter of taking
your photo sphere and

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.540
projecting it in a way that you
can make a custom Street

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.780
View panorama out of it.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.690
And then it's possible to put a
Street View panorama within

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.200
an info window inside
the JavaScript API.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.520
So it is a little bit of effort,
and you have to make

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.580
sure that your image is in the
right format, and there's a

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.150
bit of coding involved.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.350
But it is definitely feasible.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.000
AUDIENCE: Are you guys--

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.570
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.980
I can answer this one, too.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.440
I created a project called
Street Sphere, which does this

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.420
conversion.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.070
I'll show you that afterwards,
I guess.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.510
DAVE DAY: To elaborate on what
Chris said, he's got a project

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.940
which, once you have your photo,
then it converts it

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.240
into a Street View panorama and
makes it really easy to

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.550
put it on a web page.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.760
So then really, your job would
be to take that panorama and

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.660
embed it how you'd like
within an info window.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.910
AUDIENCE: So that's
street-sphere.appspot.com.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.790
MANO MARKS: Any other
questions?

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.060
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.500
First of all, congratulations
on WebGL Maps.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.500
It made the keynote, so
that was spectacular.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.740
Thank you very much.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.860
AUDIENCE: Spectacular.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:26.090
One thing that I noticed in
playing with it is you can't

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.820
look at a pole, for instance.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.370
So you can reach the North Pole,
but you cannot go over a

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.640
pole, necessarily.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.880
So I was curious, because I have
a very young cousin who

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.570
loves Santa Claus, and
I would love to teach

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.750
geography with this tool.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:50.140
And I was curious what's
coming down the

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.680
pipe for WebGL Maps?

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.920
MANO MARKS: So the pole, you
mean in the Globe Mode?

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.900
AUDIENCE: Globe Mode, yes.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.320
MIKE PERROW: Yeah.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.440
I can understand why
that's the case.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.870
There's nothing announced at
the moment, certainly.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.350
And in current maps, this is
obviously not possible because

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.820
of the Mercado projection.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.630
Physically, there's no way to
display that 2D in that

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.790
projection.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.710
Globe lets us do that.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.870
It's not implemented
at the moment.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.350
MANO MARKS: This is actually a
problem that we had in Google

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.660
Earth as well.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.860
And part of the problem is
that we're basically

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.730
implementing the imagery in
these strips that end up

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.780
meeting at the poles.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.060
And so then you would see
this infinite fan

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.215
experience at the pole.

00:31:39.215 --> 00:31:40.390
We don't have anything.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.760
MIKE PERROW: You'll see that
we don't really have the

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.990
infinite fan effect anymore.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.540
We've changed the way that
we do that, but the

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.100
code isn't there yet.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.990
MANO MARKS: We're still
in preview mode.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.900
DAVE DAY: My understanding,
part of it's the user

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.520
experience too, just to try and
make it as difficult as

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.980
possible to confuse and
get lost on the Globe.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.650
So if you're actually keeping
the earth always within a

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.530
certain range of rotation, you
don't end up upside down and

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.840
all which ways.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.720
But it's obviously fine
tuning that, too.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:13.880
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.830
That's something that does
happen in Google

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.860
Earth a fair amount.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.100
People get kind of lost, because
they've gone over the

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.040
pole, and suddenly Australia's
in the north, and that doesn't

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.800
make any sense.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.190
AUDIENCE: There is a learning
curve, I agree.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.250
MIKE PERROW: It's also worth
pointing out that the home of

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.600
Santa is actually quite

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.350
contentious, country to country.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.080
When I was growing up in
Scotland, I was always taught

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.140
it was in Lapland, rather
than the North Pole.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.770
So we try not to comment on

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.720
geopolitical concerns
in general.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.620
MANO MARKS: We have to be
very sensitive around

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.280
these sort of things.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much,
and congratulations again.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.460
MANO MARKS: Thank you.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.470
I have two questions
for you guys.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:57.560
One is, do you have a way to get
the longitude and latitude

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.120
from IP addresses on the server
side, because I was

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.560
looking into that, but
Google Maps didn't

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.860
have an API for that?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.170
I was considering purchase
third party company, like

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.525
MaxMind or something.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:15.890
KEN HOETMER: Yeah.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.780
So we have an API for that.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.080
It's called the Geolocation
API.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.340
And it's an API that's not
freely available but you can

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.990
purchase as part of our
Enterprise Product Suite.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's not free?

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.110
KEN HOETMER: It's not free.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.590
Sorry.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:33.695
AUDIENCE: With all these open
source things, it's not free.

00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:38.030
Maybe you guys can have a limit
amount of requests, but

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.270
the basic version can be free.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.630
Something to consider?

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.680
KEN HOETMER: It is something
to consider, but I can't

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.960
comment on it further
than that.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.650
AUDIENCE: The second question
I have is, are you guys

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:56.010
planning to include any social
features to Google Maps, like

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.330
Foursquare, to check in and
keep track of where your

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:04.180
friends are, and maybe
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.890
or implement something?

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.810
When I'm on the maps, I'm
driving, it's nice to just

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.690
locate where I am with the local
restaurants with reviews

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.600
and things like that.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.620
KEN HOETMER: So I think this
is a question about the new

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.090
Google Maps, which was
announced yesterday.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.900
And I guess I can't comment on
the roadmap, but I do know

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.520
that one of their key visions
is a personalized map, and

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.219
that the personalized map
should have the relevant

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.230
information to you that
is location-specific.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.500
So I know that they're thinking
about those kinds of

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.760
social features, but
obviously, we don't

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.750
pre-announce anything.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.698
So I guess you just have to
wait and see what happens.

00:34:47.698 --> 00:34:50.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.260
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the indoor mapping, the

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.340
app for walking through a
building after you've uploaded

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.080
your floor plan.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.740
So one of the things that was
brought up in the talk that I

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.760
attended was that the presence
of people messes with Wi-Fi,

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.130
and you're largely basing
your location on Wi-Fi.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.256
So if I were going to
do a stadium-- let's

00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:13.320
say a hockey arena--

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.260
would I be able to
upload multiple

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.730
walk-throughs, basically?

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.070
Because the stadium is going to
have a different number of

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.210
people in it depending on
whether it's empty, there's a

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.490
concert, the game's on.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:31.150
In between periods, people are
getting their hot dogs and

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.070
messing with the Wi-Fi.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.690
But most of the time,
during the game,

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.820
they're in their seats.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.300
Does that really affect
it enough that I have

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.790
to worry about it?

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.980
Sorry.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.320
That's about three questions.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.480
MANO MARKS: So I think none of
us is expert enough in this,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.670
but I think Waleed will be
probably in the Sandbox a fair

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.730
amount tomorrow, so you could
try and catch up with him.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:56.380
Waleed or Sarah, who was
also in that talk.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:02.040
And I will say, I think you
can re-upload location

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.550
information.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.740
So I know they take more
than one sample.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.530
I just don't know if that just
replaces one or the other.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:14.770
The more different Wi-Fi routers
you have out there,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.720
more Wi-Fi signals that are out
there, the better, because

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.340
we can then triangulate off of
strength, and then it reduces

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.010
the impact of people.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.060
AUDIENCE: And you can re-upload

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.430
your data, can't you?

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.410
MANO MARKS: You can re-upload
your data, and we encourage

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.370
that, especially when
floor plans change.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.060
So a department store, often,
they'll rearrange things.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.520
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.770
Thanks.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:45.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.930
I had a quick question
about your lat/long.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.950
I was wondering what datum you
guys are using for that?

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:52.120
MANO MARKS: Sorry.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.630
Which data we're using
for where?

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.150
AUDIENCE: Which datum?

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.950
Was it WGS84 or NAT83
for your lat/long?

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.610
MIKE PERROW: I'm pretty sure
it is WGS84, but I'm--

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:08.020
MANO MARKS: Yeah, WGS84
for Google Earth.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.493
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:10.743
Thank you.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.120
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.870
I've got a question about, are
you able to display only one

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:30.480
country on the Map, or do we
have to display the whole

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.326
world on your Map?

00:37:32.326 --> 00:37:36.540
I've got a website that's only
specific to one country, so

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.020
obviously for me, only one
country is of interest.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.680
Thanks.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.560
DAVE DAY: At the moment, we
don't have any features which

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.670
let you individually turn
things on and off.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.450
And definitely, we've heard
from developers asking for

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.820
other things, like maybe, not
necessarily saying, I only

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.920
want to see this country, but
maybe, can you emphasize this

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.580
state or this building
or this road?

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.180
The only thing I could suggest
right now is bounding what

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.350
your map looks at, so if the
user tries to pan away, you

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.630
just sort of snap them
back, but that won't

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.870
always fit the bill.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.260
MANO MARKS: Another thing you
could do is do something like

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.080
a Google Maps Engine layer using
some open data, like

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:21.010
natural earth data, to put some
polygons and highlight

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.360
the boundaries, and then mute
all the other ones using a

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.610
styled map.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.200
AUDIENCE: I'm near to Android,
so I wanted to know what is

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.060
the equivalent of
Find My Friends.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.900
The app that Apple has, do you
have anything equivalent, like

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.860
Find My Friends?

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.190
I mean, I know you can track
people indoors, but you can

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.150
track yourself.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.450
But can I track my husband
or a friend?

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.800
MANO MARKS: Thor is nodding
vigorously.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.260
Thor, did you want to answer?

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.790
Former PM of the Google Maps
API, now PM for Google+ APIs,

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.645
Thor Mitchell.

00:39:01.645 --> 00:39:04.995
THOR MITCHELL: Wow, it
was worth me coming.

00:39:04.995 --> 00:39:07.960
You may remember that in the
keynote yesterday, Vic

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.910
mentioned that there
are 42 new Google+

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.000
features launched yesterday.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.930
And obviously, he didn't
talk about all of them.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.120
One of the features that wasn't
mentioned was that

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.040
Location Sharing has now been
added to the Google+ app.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.000
So if you open the Google+ app
today, assuming you got an

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.550
update yesterday, you look at
the menu of options on the

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.670
left hand side, one of
them is Location.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:32.420
You can now define circles
that can see your current

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.610
location using the Google+
app, and that's available

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.310
across all platforms.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.980
Thus ends the advert.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.540
MANO MARKS: Thank you, Thor.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:48.800
I think that's all the time that
we had for the Fireside

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.030
Chat, but we will hang out
probably out in the hallway

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.310
after this, if you want
to ask us any more

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.710
individualized questions.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.540
So thank you all very
much for coming.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.175
[APPLAUSE]
