00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.050
Distributed query is securely
obtaining useful data

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.100
from diverse EHR systems and
other sources.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.840
We'll look at three current open
source distributed query technologies.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.980
They're different in their
technical approach and goals, and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.060
understanding those differences and
the reasons for them is a key objective.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.600
This overall effort is now under the ONC
supported Query Health Initiative.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.200
I recommend you view an ONC video
referenced in the instructor's notes for

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.920
more details on the overall effort and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.910
the individual systems
that comprised it.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.054
As we learned in the interview
with Wellcentive,

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:42.230
there are also commercial
solutions to this problem, but

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.770
those are proprietary and less
available for this kind of discussion.
