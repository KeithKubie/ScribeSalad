00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.965
Now the relationship between the variables in the candy machine situation we

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:07.871
just talked about is of a special type, it's called a function. Now some more

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:12.019
strictly mathematical examples of functions are things like I've written right

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.304
here. Y equals negative 2 x plus 5. Y equals x squared plus 5 x plus 6. Y equals

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:21.030
negative 5. There are ton of other ones. Pretty much all of the equations for

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.506
lines and problems that you've seen in this course are functions. We just

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:28.680
haven't been using this word yet. Now, however it is time. Think back to the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.102
relationship between the input and output in the gumball examples from the last

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:37.582
quiz. And then please complete this sentence here for me. If we consider x to be

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:43.382
the input and y to be in the output of some function. Then there is no more than

00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:49.153
one value of, what for a given value of what. Remember again, how you answered

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.792
the similar question for the candy example. You can also, of course, look at

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:58.400
values of x and y that satisfy each of these equations, or you can graph them to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.503
figure this out.
