[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.418
SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, artist Mary Little.

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:13.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.420
MARY LITTLE: OK, so
most of you know me.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.220
A few of you don't,
and I'm just going

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.500
to start with an
introduction about where

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.770
I am from and to tell
you a bit about what

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.120
I'm going to talk about.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.680
And I'm going to
move my arms around.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.406
It drives me crazy,
and I can't stop it.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.280
I don't have pockets.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.690
So I was born in
Northern Ireland

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.260
on a farm, rolling
countryside on a peninsula

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.420
that was three miles wide.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.570
And so on the eastern coast,
it was sandy beaches and sand

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.590
dunes.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.650
On the west coast, it
was boulders, rocks,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.640
very soft formations, and things
that we could climb on and fall

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.370
and not hurt ourselves.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.950
The landscape where
the farms were--

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.680
really green, little
rolling hills.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.260
They're called drumlins,
and they're pretty much

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.180
the height of two people--

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.960
really small.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.990
So you felt really hugged and
enclosed in the environment,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.230
where I grew up.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.130
The farms were-- a
lot of them were--

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.450
my uncles and family
were surrounding me.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
And ancient fields,
ancient hedges, and it's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.615
like a patchwork-- all
very small and cozy.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.640
So my career took me--

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.120
well, from Belfast to
London to Milan and back

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.910
to London, California,
and to the Bay Area,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.000
moved to Connecticut, and
then came back to California.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.585
And now I'm in Los Angeles, and
I've been here for three years.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.860
And what I want to
talk about today

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.290
is something that is a
really big thing in my life,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.712
and that is that I'm a sculptor,
but I'm also a designer.

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:04.920
So I'm trained as a designer.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.836
I've had seven years'
education as a designer,

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.180
but I actually think
and my whole sensibility

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.200
is like I work as a designer.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.070
And the way that I like to
design best is if I'm designing

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.290
a chair, something that
the body really relates

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.920
to-- and generally,
I design for myself--

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.550
I like to create objects that
have some kind of relationship

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.410
to the body and
respond to the body.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.900
So you deal with
functional things

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.940
like making yourself
comfortable,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.220
good seat, good back.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.870
But then it's all
the other things

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.070
that make it into
a sculptural thing,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.530
and I want to talk
about that now.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.988
So I'm going to
show some examples,

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:55.160
and it starts with this chair,
which is called the air chair.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.960
Our chair is actually
20 years old.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.430
It was commissioned
by the Museum

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.220
of Modern Art in Glasgow,
and they wanted benches

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.390
for visitors to sit in.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.120
And it was in the gallery
called the Air Gallery.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.760
It was all white floor,
white walls, and skylights.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.020
So the whole concept and
theme was airiness, lightness.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.610
I wanted to make
chairs that people

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.160
could drag around and put
in front of a painting,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.140
so my proposal was 12 chairs.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.090
People could drag
them around, and they

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.140
have this kind of like ballet
dancer type feel to the feet,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.550
and everything about them from
the metal structure, the forms

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.740
of the plastic to
the plastic feet

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.562
is designed to have a sense
of lightness and airiness.

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:37.520
And just for the sake of
this show, it's nice--

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.201
or for this talk--
it's nice to put it

00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:41.450
in front of some of my
artwork, which I'm doing today.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.240
So you're seeing work
that's 20 years apart,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.880
and you can see that there's
a kind of common sensibility.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.463
And that's the sensibility that
comes from the landscape where

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:53.100
I was raised.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.830
So here, you see two
boulder-like forms,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.940
a bench for two people.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.390
So intimate conversation,
two people sitting together,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.080
head to head, boulder's merge
together, and it's sculptural.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.086
I've shown two photographs
here of this just

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:13.460
to give you some
kind of a sense,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.480
because photographs in 2D
never really put across what

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.620
happens in three dimensions.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.130
[INAUDIBLE] of this.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.110
This is called [? Gliss, ?] and
it's the same kind of concept,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.249
where it's two boulder-like
forms merged together,

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:29.540
but they're merged differently.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.180
And the thing I want to
bring your attention to here

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.300
is the little blue eyes
that are popping through.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.700
So I love working with cloth,
and the whole nature of my life

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.710
has just been really doing
different things with cloth.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.920
This is very rare.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.630
I have very small amounts of it.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.200
It's called shibori.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.860
It's made by master
craftsmen in Japan.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.620
And I wanted to
do something where

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.930
I was using this really
sparingly, but really

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.220
powerfully.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.720
So I've put these
little pieces--

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.240
I've slit the felted wool seat
and have these little raised

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.380
areas that are coming through.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.680
That's the second view of it.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.409
I'll just go back one
more time to give you

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.450
a three-dimensional view.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.590
And there's a real
ugliness to this piece,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.130
and there's a lot of my work,
where there's an ugliness

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.690
and beauty at the same time.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.940
And I really enjoy that.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.150
I enjoy it when there's a kind
of a challenge to the work,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.930
and that's not necessarily in
everything, but it is in some.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.430
So this chair that I designed--
it was finished in 1985,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.620
and it's bringing together
everything that I think

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.210
is important in
design, as I see it.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.080
So that is I want to
see if it enhances how

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.710
you feel when you sit in it.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.710
I want a chair that enhances
how you look when you sit in it

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.950
and one that looks amazing
as a sculptural object when

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.480
no one's sitting in it at all.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.770
And so when you're
sitting on this chair,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.760
you sit on the
wooden seat, and you

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.030
can see there's nothing
to impede your movement.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.300
You can move your legs around
in lots of directions--

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.030
a bit more than 180 degrees.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.340
Lean against the black, which
is actually stretched rubber,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.670
if you lean against that.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.810
This is me, 1985.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.340
My hairdresser's here.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.540
He can see how little
my hair has changed.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.700
And it's gone gray.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.890
And so if you think
about it, I always

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.497
want people to sit
really properly,

00:06:41.497 --> 00:06:42.830
because it's good for your back.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.450
But who does?

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.860
We all sit asymmetrically.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.890
We all move over to one side
or another, and at that time,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.465
I knew that I sat
way over to one side.

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:53.090
I was always leaning
over to the right.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.920
I was always having my
right leg over my left.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.530
And so I developed
this chair that

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.790
really allowed me to do that,
so when I sit in the chair,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.100
I feel amazing.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.920
The black leather, or the
black rubber, is stretched,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.040
so it gives me a
real firm support.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.430
And because of the form,
it lets me move around.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.410
So I'm kind of feeling majestic
when I'm sitting in this chair.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.220
I feel good.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.260
I know that I can look good.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.010
After that, I really got into
cloth, working with fabric.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.080
And I have really
done that all my life,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.930
but this is when I really
professionally, seriously

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.810
got into working with
fabric with my art.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.120
So the chair on
the left I call it

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.520
Rudolf, kind of after the
ballet dancer, of course,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.640
because it looks like
it's poised and dancing.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.580
But it's a descendant
of the blue chair,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.344
so there's a lot of
the same ideas, where

00:07:58.344 --> 00:07:59.760
when you're sitting
in this chair,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.250
you've got your arms out,
and you feel very expansive.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.220
This chair is actually exploring
having your arms out further

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.260
than in the blue chair.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.270
But the thing I want
to talk about with this

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.250
is just it's the
combination of two things.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.930
So the form making is with
carving foam and putting fabric

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.970
on tight around it.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.330
And then there's also in
the legs and the lower part,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.150
there's making
forms and character

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.670
with the fabric
as a loose cloth.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.500
There's nothing
inside but layers of--

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.620
interfacing the
stiffness, a stiff sheet,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.720
and it's really to do with
the way the cloth is cut.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.659
The chair on the right, Liz,
is a similar thing, but more

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.250
voluptuous forms in the bottom.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.212
It's only full of air.

00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:47.670
It's actually not
only full of air,

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.730
because it's got the tubular
steel frame that supports you.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.320
And so it's that they all
have tubular steel legs

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.790
and structure, and then
the only other thing

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.210
that's inside the legs is air.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.100
So it's a pattern-making
and the layers of stiffeners

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.140
that are inside, but
the thing I wanted

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.990
to talk about here
with Liz on the right

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.350
is it's got a regular seat.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.520
It looks pretty comfortable.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.590
It's got a regular back.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.220
It looks pretty comfortable.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.080
And then it's got this orb
on the right hand side,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.320
and remember, I
talked about me having

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.170
a sense of always wanting to
be over on the right hand side.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.530
So I put the arm on
the right hand side.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.590
Underneath this silk fabric,
that's actually just a sphere.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.737
It's an orb, a
very firm support.

00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:39.320
When you look at it, you think,
what's that thing doing there?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.320
It's going to get in the
way when you sit on it.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.710
But when you sit
down on it, it's

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.680
just absolutely the
perfect place for your arm

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.590
or for your elbow.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.700
So you just sit down,
put your arm down,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.340
and you're totally casual.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.316
You just-- like
at the minute, I'm

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.690
here up in front of all of
you, and I feel a bit awkward.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.231
But when you're
sitting in the chair,

00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.680
and if the armrests are
in just the right place,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.860
it just really makes you feel
wonderful and relaxed and good

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.920
about yourself.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.060
And that's how you should
be in a piece of furniture.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.850
Aesthetically, stylistically,
I, at the time,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.480
was looking at things like
Hans Holbein paintings,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.330
and there were an abundance
of in the National

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.890
Gallery in London.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.240
And so there, there
was a lot to do

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.960
with how silk was represented
and how cloth was represented

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.660
and the strange hats
from the 17th century.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.260
It was all such an inspiration.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.860
I have masses of
imagery from that time

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.850
that we're really-- they just
make my heart go when I think

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.680
about them or look at them.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.830
And this is Margaret, and
it's from the same series.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.060
And here, I'm cutting away foam.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.780
So if you think about
it, very often, you're

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.510
sitting in the chair, and
you're really relaxed.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.270
You have no requirement
whatsoever for support

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.940
in between your legs, so
I started carving away,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.910
cutting away the foam
in between my legs.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.030
I've made sure that I've got
a nice length under my knees,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.740
so I've got good
support under my legs

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.360
when I'm sitting really relaxed.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.150
And then I've got really
good lumbar support in this.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.410
Nobody ever thinks my chairs are
comfortable, and I love that.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.300
But when you sit on them,
you just feel a sense of wow.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.290
And I actually hear
that word, wow,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.700
when people sit in my chairs.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.741
And it tells me they were
thinking that something

00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:32.240
horrible would happen
to them, and it doesn't.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.760
And so this has
lumbar support in it,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.680
but it's got this
slit up the back.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.600
And if you think
about it, your spine--

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.890
your spine doesn't need support.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.850
It's the flesh on either
side that needs support.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.220
So I cut it away, and
those are all the kind

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:54.320
of thinking where it lets
me do sculptural forms when

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.080
I take a lead from the body.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.820
So the fabric in
this, the fabric

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.166
is-- this is the first time
where I really kind of felt

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:02.540
like I was getting
a hold of what

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.100
I was doing with the fabric.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.460
If you look at the back, and
it looks like it's opening up,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.130
it's like old fashioned
jodhpur pants.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.960
And so the full form,
and then there's

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.670
inner formers that
I've put inside.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.960
So I'm building up a whole
battery of tools and materials

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.530
that let me make forms that
are full forms in fabric,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.760
but there's a kind of
flexibility to them.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.790
I'm able to achieve
the forms that I want,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.710
but there's a control there.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.595
It's not just fabric.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.600
Little inch-high
stools-- these are petal

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.570
shapes, definitely referencing
the kind of sensibility

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.780
that I developed with growing up
in the countryside in Northern

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.590
Ireland and always that
kind of gentle softness.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.370
But here, I've looked
at Dior clothing.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.920
And if you think about
collars on dresses

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.350
and them standing up, so I
wanted to replicate and explore

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.720
that kind of concept.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.860
The fabric is a synthetic silk.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.930
It has a robustness,
and it's iridescent,

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.930
which is really nice,
because it really pulls out

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.270
the quality of the
three-dimensional form

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.760
and the folds and
the stretching.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.890
And when someone has
one of these pieces,

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.550
then they can arrange the
collar just as they want.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.820
A client in New York wanted
to have a chair for herself,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.530
and it was a daytime chair.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.270
She wanted it to
be white, and she

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.940
wanted to sit on it every day.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.610
So immediately, my
brain thinks practical--

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.410
how do you make a
white chair that's

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.480
really good for multiple years
and looks good all the time?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.190
And this is a woman
that came to me,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.420
because she was a collector.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.100
She collected the fiber
arts, glass arts, ceramics,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.240
and collected furniture.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.310
So she was commissioning
this piece,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.460
and I was listening to how
she wanted to use the chair.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.131
She wanted to read
the newspaper.

00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:09.380
She wanted to be on the phone.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.260
She wanted to do needlepoint,
so she wanted to sit astride.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.200
So it became a
chaise longue that's

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.500
narrower enough for her to
sit on with her legs astride.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.410
And I proposed quilting, and
quilting is a really good way

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:33.840
to have a white base cotton,
make it very hard-wearing,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.570
but to bring in really
interesting textures

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.370
and patterns so that
in the background,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.400
it's referencing waterfalls.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.722
And the seat part is
referencing tiles,

00:14:42.722 --> 00:14:44.430
which are both things
that I was thinking

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.280
of for hot climate, because
she actually wanted this

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.910
for her home in Palm Beach.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.150
And this client in--

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.050
she had an art
gallery in Chelsea,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.750
and she wanted a
desk and a couple

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.630
of tables for her brochures
and so on, her catalogues.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.475
And I wanted to do
something really tied

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:06.930
back and minimal for
her, but something

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.620
that expressed her gentle and
kind of feminine personality.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.290
Working with white wool--

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.680
and I've made
reference to things

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.210
like leather, leather
chaps, leather stirrups,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.450
if you think of horse riding.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.380
I'm also making a reference
in the quilting on the table

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.660
on the left to Chanel handbags.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.300
So I wanted to have multiple
layers in that part, where

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.240
the quilting is.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.230
I've got multiple layers
to give it that full form.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.619
I quilted them together,
and the quilting--

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:39.660
I knew I had to quilt it.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.280
I knew I had to stitch it,
so what are the images?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.790
What's the icon that
you want to pick up on?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.460
And it was the Chanel handbag.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.980
So in my case, in this one,
it's sketched really loose.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.632
I basically just drew it
with the sewing machine.

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:56.340
I didn't mark it.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.880
I made rough crisscross
marks to keep it very casual.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.380
And then at other
times, I do things

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.740
that are very flamboyant.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.140
So I know I work at
either end, so there's

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.730
this great flamboyance
in the stool here.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:17.220
And it's felted
wool, and it's a mix

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.755
of a yellow, intense
yellow, with black.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.570
I was looking at things
like flamenco dresses,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.470
and there's something about
me I just-- there are times

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.970
with working in the
furniture world,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.517
I very often was working
with a lot of guys.

00:16:32.517 --> 00:16:34.350
And it's really great
to do something that's

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.120
a lot more feminine
and flamboyant

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.400
and put it there right
in front of them.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.690
So I love that.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.490
And this chair, this
was a commission

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.130
for a woman in Washington, DC.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.860
And it's called Fleur.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.320
I call my furniture
sometimes after the clients.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.420
Not all the time,
but this time I did.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.050
So looking back, this was a
real turning point for me.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.030
This is just three years old.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.780
I did this when I first
moved to Los Angeles.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.609
And with her, I had done three
sketches for design proposals

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.800
for her, and she chose one.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.092
I looked it up, and I
thought, wow, I've just done--

00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:18.300
I've got this really soft
pencil, really thick layer,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.480
and I'd just done
squiggle for the leg.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.760
And now I had to
interpret it, so how

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.270
do you interpret a soft
pencil squiggle on a leg

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:32.340
into something that's in fabric
and really rich and really

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.020
is of a quality that
needs to be in--

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.740
she was putting together a
private gallery or museum

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.230
in DC.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.640
And so I started to
do lots of trials.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.940
I do many, many
trials in muslin.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.910
I'm always-- I start
with one single sketch,

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.670
and then everything
else from there is 3D.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.900
I'm a 3D spatial kind of person.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.020
I can't really think flat.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.060
So with lots of trials,
came up with this thing,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.260
where the fabric is
cut in a curvy line,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.590
and then sewn together.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.480
And sewn together, it gives it
this three-dimensional form.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.740
And it's much, much
more complex than that,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.950
but that's enough to go with.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.030
But the fabric here was
a really high-quality mix

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.760
of wool and silk, and
because of those two

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.170
together, the wool gave it this
beautiful softness and drape,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.580
and the silk gave it the sheen.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.550
So it really picks up the
suppleness, the wavy lines.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:35.980
It's like a really shiny
woman with really shiny hair.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.470
And so that, for me,
felt really important,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.970
and that was something
that I wanted

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.670
to go back to again and again.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.240
I made many trials, many
different kinds of objects

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.270
from this kind of motif.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.070
And this is something
where it really

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.020
transformed into
something else, so

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.900
in my home, a loft in downtown,
I needed to divide space,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.390
so I made a cloth wall.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.070
This is artist canvas, so
it's unbleached artist canvas.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.620
And it's put together with
just repeated patterns,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.280
and when it's sewn
together, it makes

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.850
these three-dimensional reliefs.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.090
And it picks up--

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.420
I have an east-facing
window, so it picks up

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.872
the lights, the relief, the
shadow, repeated pattern.

00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:30.330
Because it's fabric,
and it doesn't

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.220
have a lot of structure, it
has that kind of looseness

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.050
as well and kind of untidiness.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.920
And I love the way it just hits
the floor, in a rough manner,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.820
hitting the floor.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.600
So I started to think of--

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.410
sorry, whoops.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.080
Just want to go back one more.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.510
So I wanted to get into
staining this white cloth.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.260
I bought a roll of canvas,
staining the white,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.090
working with shadow,
working with pattern,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.250
working with repeat
pattern, and seeing

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.120
what I could do if I completely
ignored function and completely

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.880
ignored anything that
had to do with having

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.480
a relationship with the body.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.770
And that was kind
of a little scary,

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.710
but it was also a
real liberation.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.340
I felt really
excited to do this.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.510
So I have periods of time, where
I'm just working for two weeks

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.410
and not going out, where I
just have a mass of ideas,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:37.330
and I'm making
them, exploring here

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.090
pattern, life,
light, and relief.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.800
And with this one, this
is about 84 inches long.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.170
Looking at how the
pattern can be mid dense,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.140
so there's three blocks
of very dense pattern,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.710
and you get much
more intense shadow.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.152
And with ever such
a slight change--

00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:02.360
and this is the kind of
thing I am interested in now,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.400
how you can get a really
big change in outcome

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.380
with the smallest of iterations,
the smallest of changes.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.930
With this one, which
I've called Dunbar,

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.600
the pattern that you saw
previously, I call it a motif.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.190
Here, I put it horizontal.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.830
I've made the center
section a little wider,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.070
and the upper and the
bottom sections are lower.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.130
And it really brings
out the fleshiness.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.880
Working with gravity,
it really brings out

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.530
the fleshiness of the fabric.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.880
And there's two
stories to this that I

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.140
think are really important.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.110
And one of them is I had a
visitor come to see this.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.920
She was a girlfriend of a
friend, and at one point,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.280
I saw her in front of this
piece, and she was crying.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.500
And I said, what's up?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.270
How can you be crying
in front of this work?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.270
And she said, it just
touches me so much.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.710
It just moves me so much.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.510
And I don't really
know what it is,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.040
but I just can't stop crying.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.550
So I thought, that's the most
amazing accolade for someone

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.470
to do that.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.660
And the other was a
really good friend

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:19.230
of mine, who came to see it,
and she's had three children.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.335
And when she looked at this,
she said, I can't look at this.

00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:25.260
This is-- I don't know if
she said the word gross,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.440
but she hinted it
emotionally, and she said,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.530
this reminds me of how I am
today rather than how I really

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.550
want to be.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.670
And I've had that comment
from another person years

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.250
ago when I did a chair for her.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.790
She saw a chair
that I had designed,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.560
and she wanted
something similar.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.789
When I made it, she hated it.

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:46.830
And I said, what's wrong?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.160
And she said, Mary, I'm so
sorry, but the one that I saw

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.581
was of me when I
was an 18-year-old,

00:22:52.581 --> 00:22:54.330
and the one that you've
got in front of me

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.510
here is me as I am today,
and I'm 45 years old,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.100
and I've had two children.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.780
And I told her, take it home.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.010
Don't pay for it, and I'll
call you in three weeks' time,

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.650
knowing absolutely
with 100% certainty

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.990
that she'd love it
in three weeks' time.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.560
And she did.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.130
She loved it.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.260
She paid me, and now she's
a really great friend,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.290
and she's commissioned maybe
eight pieces over the years.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.630
So that's just a fantastic
thing when your work has

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.510
that kind of impact on people.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.400
And then in contrast,
something like this

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.070
is just real joy, very happy,
flamboyant spontaneity.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.800
And that's great too.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.960
And so they're in
the gallery here,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.440
and there's a large piece
that's 10 foot by 10,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.920
and it's picking up on the
thing that's on this piece here.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.680
This is called
O'Reilly, and it's just

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.950
like referencing seaweed,
referencing an awful lot

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.310
of the things from my
background, which is always

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.280
what I'm going back to.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:02.850
And then this
piece has got the--

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.940
I wanted to do something that
was just a simple rectangle,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.370
but it had a burst
of fabric coming.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.870
And this is very
much to do with how

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.070
I like to make three-dimensional
forms out of this cloth

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.510
that I'm now becoming
so familiar with.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.810
So I made this piece, hung
it up, and took it off,

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.260
hung it up back
to front, thought

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.460
it was so much more
interesting back to front,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.860
because here you can see the
lines that are coming in.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.830
You can see what's
called seam allowances.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.090
So when the two pieces of
fabric are sewn together,

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.990
there's half an inch
strip on either side.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.500
And then when that opens it up,
when that opens up in the way

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.630
that I do it, you've
got much more texture.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.090
And it gives this surface--

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.540
it's a large white
surface, but it

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.970
gives that kind of
texture and relief

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.200
and picks up on the shadow.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.350
And then I was going to
cut all the rest into--

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.650
I started to cut the sides
into a long slim rectangle,

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.890
but just loved the
outer edges, loved

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.190
the kind of
serendipity of finding

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.650
something that
was really playing

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.600
with the circle in the middle.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.990
And it took me about two weeks
of coming back and forward

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.780
to this and just getting other
people to comment on it to make

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.090
me realize that this is
just how it should be,

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.670
and I need to stop
right where I am.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.460
And that's one of the really
exciting things, just if I--

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.980
well, the thing that excites me
about what I do, I have a plan.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.960
And then I work really
very much in 3D.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.640
I'm working like a
sculptor, and then there's

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.416
so many really interesting
things that come out of that

00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:39.000
that I can go with or not.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.620
So there's a huge
sense of judgment

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.760
and a bit of courage
that needs to be taken.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.100
So these are four
panels, 24 by 24,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.260
and this is the first
time I've stretched

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.840
the canvas onto wooden
stretchers, wooden frame.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.540
And I really enjoyed it.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.880
You've got the
large white tautness

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.250
around this looseness
in the middle.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.960
Each of these is made
in a different way.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.840
They're each made from two
pieces of cloth sewn together,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.260
but the inner line, inner seam
is hand-drawn, and some of them

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.340
are flat.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.234
Some of them have got
second little dimples.

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:18.900
And then when I put
them up on the wall,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.608
I just manipulate them
and play with them

00:26:20.608 --> 00:26:25.390
and see what I want to
come to bring out of it.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.550
This is a similar concept.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.730
It's much more
controlled, regulated.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.140
Each piece is
absolutely identical,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.810
and in doing this,
of course, there's

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:40.470
the reference to the artist
Lucio Fontana, where he slashes

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.170
his stretched canvasses.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.070
In my case, I've
seen them together,

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.810
and then the seam line runs
inside where you can't see it.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.990
But you've got this really
lovely sensual forms that are

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.210
happening all over it, really.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.520
And it picks up the shade,
the shadow, the highlights,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.080
and just really beautiful
way that the cloth folds in.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.350
And this is me working
to the absolute minimal

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.660
that I probably
would do, where it's

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.460
the same principle as previous.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.350
This piece is actually in
the exhibition here as well.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.670
And it's just a little
dimple, and the little dimple,

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.770
before it goes in, it comes out.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.630
And it's actually--

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.590
I see it sensual, but it is
a very sexual piece as well,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:30.730
framed in a kind of
modernist squareness.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.170
And then this motif
you've seen before.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.670
But what was exciting
about this was

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.770
that I put it onto
the stretch panel,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.480
and it looked so different.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.500
So the previous ones were
just hung from the top,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.050
and the canvas let to
fall however it wanted.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.100
And this is pulled really tight,
and it's the margin around it

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.950
that is around it
that I find something

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:53.970
that I like to control.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.680
I like to think about the
boundary of the pieces.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.680
And here, you've got
practically no boundary at all.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.480
The pattern moves out
as far as possible.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.150
You've got the little dimples.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.850
Now they're horizontal
and repeated.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.380
I've made as many as I
can within the framework.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.580
And people are making
references to metal fences.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.224
And really when people look at
my work or really any artwork,

00:28:21.224 --> 00:28:22.890
they're going to look
at it and say, oh,

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.770
that reminds me of XYZ.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.620
And it's all to do with what
your own personal history is

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.230
and what your own
experiences are.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.011
And that's something that, as an
artist, you have to let go of.

00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:35.760
You make a piece, and
then you put it out,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.880
and people are going to see
it how they personally want

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.910
to see it, or it just happens.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.330
But so if you look at
this, the pattern of this,

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:50.820
and then immediately after, this
is exactly the same pattern.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.120
So I make patterns in paper.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.020
This is exactly the same
paper pattern as previous,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.260
except this one is
stretched really tight.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.530
So the dimple is
pulled really taut.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.900
It's got very
controlled aesthetic,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.110
and then this one hangs up,
and it does its own thing.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.220
And I love that.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.469
When I hung this up, the
first thing I thought

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:16.260
was-- well, actually
before it was hung up,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.760
I thought, I'll
hang it up, and then

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.070
I'm going to make it
really neat and tidy.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.350
I'll just start at the
top, neaten it all up,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.110
and work all my way down
and make it really neat.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.530
But as soon as I turned
around and stood back from it,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.280
turned around and
looked at it, I thought,

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.750
I love this just as it is.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.710
And so every time I take
it down and put it back up,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.750
it's different, because
it's a malleable.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.470
It's soft, flexible cloth.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.080
I just love the randomness of
this kind of thing and the way

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.540
it picks up light
in different ways

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.240
and the way that the edge is
not crisp, regular corners,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.660
and then the sides here--
it goes in and out.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.650
It does its own thing.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.220
In this piece, which
I called [? Man, ?] is

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.240
exactly the same as
this, but the pattern

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.880
is four times the size.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.410
So this is one of
the other things

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:14.880
that I'm exploring is scale and
how that affects the canvas--

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.220
from the narrow palette
that I'm working within,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.804
how much you can do within it.

00:30:21.804 --> 00:30:23.220
And then this is
another one where

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.340
the pattern goes vertically
rather than horizontal,

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.320
and it's really dense.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.180
And then there's the
margin up at the top,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.010
just one margin at the top.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.510
That's depth.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.850
And then on the
sides, just because

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.770
of the length that I've
let it stay, it comes out.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.610
So when you walk around this
piece, you can see behind.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.230
You can see the sides.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.670
And then at the
bottom, the margin

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.410
is so tight to the pattern
that it just hugs the wall.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.020
And I love that kind of thing.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:31:00.600
This is an aran sweater, a
traditional Irish sweater.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.800
And when I-- well,
this time last year,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.980
I was in Belfast
with all thy family,

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.637
and my mom died
this time last year.

00:31:10.637 --> 00:31:13.095
And we were clearing her house,
and I find this little bag,

00:31:13.095 --> 00:31:16.320
a little gift bag, and inside
with this tiny little baby

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:16.950
sweater.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.920
It really is literally
a really little thing.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.870
And I knew why it was there.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:27.014
It was because each one
of us, when we wanted to--

00:31:27.014 --> 00:31:29.430
if we had a friend who was
having a baby, we'd call my mom

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.250
and say, can you make
her a little sweater?

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.320
Can you make him
a little sweater?

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.820
And sometimes she
had some in stock,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.139
so this one I took
and photographed this,

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:41.430
put it on Instagram, and I
was just sitting and looking

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.620
at Instagram, looking at
that photograph one night,

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.040
and all around me in the
studio, I could see my work.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.500
And I thought, wow, this
is so close to my work.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.430
And I have not seen
it before, and this

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:58.950
was maybe a year and a half into
me making my bleached canvas

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.960
pieces, working with relief.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.540
And I truly had not
seen the connection.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.910
And so she worked with yarn,
unbleached, knit it together

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.510
into traditional patterns that
always had a massive infinite

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.070
variations.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.650
I was doing just the same.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:19.890
So the first time
I had the chance--

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.500
I make all of my
works in series.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.150
First time I had a
chance, I decided

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.000
to make a series of pieces
that were inspired by my mom

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.640
and inspired by aran sweaters.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.700
So the key thing
is scale, and using

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.710
a couple of different
motifs and patterns

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.793
and putting them together.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.470
And in this one,
it's called Sheila.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:45.760
And all of the pieces
are roughly 60 by 60.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.840
So the pattern from an
earlier piece, another pattern

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.590
going horizontally
from a different piece,

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.740
so I'm looking at--

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.660
I'm really revisiting
the patterns

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.841
that I've developed,
which is really,

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.590
for me, an exciting
thing to do, because I

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.540
get to know them better.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.120
Betty, this is called.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.730
That was my mom's name.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.780
Nice kind of cleanness along
the bottom, really intense

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.090
busyness.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.360
Not sure what I think of this
sometimes when I look at it.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.630
I love the little dimples
that are in the lower parts,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.520
so I'm trying to put pattern
within pattern and pattern

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.500
against pattern.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.310
And then in this one, I
really love the white expanse

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.160
at the top, and
the white expanse

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.040
is a contrast to the very
much flamboyance, folds

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.200
of fabric in the bottom.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.520
And so at the top,
it's all stripes.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.520
They're maybe 2 and 1/4,
2 and 1/2 inches wide,

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.670
and you get that kind
of dimply natural effect

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.190
that comes from it.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.070
And just the
contrast of the two--

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.369
for me, this is one of
my most successful pieces

00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:56.160
of the later works.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.560
But I know that everybody,
when they look at work,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.970
they see something different.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.150
This is the last piece
that I'm going to show you,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.670
and this is where the title
of this exhibition comes from

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.940
and the title of
this talk, and that's

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.760
"Intent and Serendipity."

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.610
And I think you
probably know already

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.800
that all the way through
there's intent, which

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.520
is in design, planning,
forward thinking,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.870
but then there's what happens
when something happens that you

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.650
didn't quite expect, or how
do you relate to this thing

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.150
when you're thinking
like a sculptor

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.440
and feeling like a sculptor?

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.590
How do you relate to this
thing when, actually, it

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:42.449
turns out to be something
that isn't what you expected?

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:45.150
So I hung up this piece.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.090
One of the really funny things
is when I hang up a piece,

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.630
and I'm right up
close, walk away--

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.050
I have to walk away nine feet--

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.199
and then standing there
with my back to it thinking,

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.400
what am I going to see?

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.990
Because so many
times, I just don't

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.460
know what I'm going to see.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.570
It's just so different when
it's on the wall from when

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:04.710
I'm making it.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.470
So I hung this piece up,
turned around and looked at it,

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.790
and I could see all those
little mask-type pieces.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.140
They weren't like that.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.870
But one of them was, and I
started to play around with it,

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.220
punch it, and push it
through, push it back, just

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.160
make it into something
that I hadn't intended.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.090
It's got such a much more
three-dimensional sense to it.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:32.190
And there's one, two, three
different patterns within that.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.920
And then when you think
of it wider, there's more.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.320
So this just sums
up what I was trying

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.550
to do with my mom's aran
patterns and the inspiration

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.870
from that.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:52.760
And so all my life, I have been
a furniture designer, sculptor,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.210
and just in the last
three years since making

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.210
that large canvas
that was for my room,

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.480
I have been working on something
that is devoid of anything

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.430
to do with function
in relation--

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.040
anything that has a
relationship to my body.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.230
And I keep thinking,
will I miss this?

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.130
But it's actually the opposite.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:20.390
I have very few narrow
options in what I'm exploring.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.480
And I find that the
constraints of those options

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.460
are making me even
more creative.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.990
I thought I'll maybe dry up.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.660
It will be something that
I'll do for six months.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:35.720
But really, it just feels
like I can't wait to go home

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.950
to keep on making more.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.050
That's how it feels.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.040
Thank you very much.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.690
[APPLAUSE]
