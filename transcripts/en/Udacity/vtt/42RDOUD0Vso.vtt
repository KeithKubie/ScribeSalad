00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.852
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that you've seen how to convert to slope intercept form, I want you to

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:07.923
try and graph this equation. I've marked up some points, and I want you to check

00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:11.567
all the boxes that make our graph. Take your time on this problem and think

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:15.142
about it. Be really careful with your negative signs, and think about the

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:19.063
directions you need to move with slope. As always, try your best. And if you get

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:23.324
stuck, try watching the previous video again. Or, watch some of the answer and

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:28.032
then pause it, until you get unstuck. This allows you to monitor your thinking,

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:30.080
and continue solving the problem.
