Speaker 1:          00:01          So this is where we were at the end last time. Trying to decide when a high homo or a low Lumo is unusual in its energy because as the world is things like to be in low energy, we'll talk about that later. Why that's so, but that means that electrons tend to be in the occupied, the low occupy, the low energy orbitals and not the high energy orbitals. So that empty orbitals are almost always higher than any occupied orbitals. So if you want to get good energy match and therefore mixing and therefore bonding, right, the occupied orbital that you're interested in, it must be unusually high and the vacant orbital must be unusually low. So the task we have is to recognize what orbitals should be unusually high and what ones should be unusually low. And if we can find the unusual ones, then we'll know what's reactive.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Be able to identify functional groups. Okay, so unusual compared to what? Compared to normal occupied and vacant orbitals that is in organic chemistry or most kinds of chemistry, actually a carbon, carbon, carbon hydrogen bonds are occupied orbitals not unusually high. There are standard of usual and the anti bonds corresponding anti bonds are unusual are the usual, uh, vacant orbitals. So what can make things unusually low are unusually high when the valence Shell orbitals that if they bonded, would go down and up, don't bond with anything, don't mix with anything, then there'll be unusual. Second, if the overalls don't overlap, then they don't go down and go up. Third, if you have an unusual atomic orbital, these are made of carbon and hydrogen going down. But if you start with something that's unusual, unusually high, or unusually low, then the things that come from it will be unusually high or unusually low.

Speaker 1:          02:11          And finally electrical charge. So right at the end, last time we were looking at the first example, unmixed valence, shell atomic orbitals. So we saw that the simplest of all acids, h plus of course is unusually, it would, if it were occupied, it would be unusually high for an occupied orbital, right? Because it hasn't gone down, but it's vacant and it's unusually low for a vacant orbital because it hasn't gone up and so on with these others. And unshared pair on nitrogen or a little less so on oxygen. A vacant orbital on Boron that's not bonding with anything is an unusually low Lumo. Even though orbitals on Boron are not unusually low because the nuclear charge isn't very big for something that's using a, uh, a second and equals to quantum level orbitals valence orbitals, it's an unusually low chart nuclear charge for that. So the orbitals are unusually low.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Uh, pardon me, are unusually high in energy, not being attracted by more protons, but it's low for a vacant orbital if it hasn't mixed with anything. Okay. And finally, notice that some of these are charged. H plus plus means that's a good place to put an electron, right? So unusually low, oh, pardon me. Oh, H minus unusually high because of the negative charge. Ch three minus especially high. So this slide also shows the fourth point that electrical charge makes a difference on the how normal occupied and vacant orbitals are. Okay? Uh, so these unusually low vacant orbitals are acids like h plus unusually high occupied orbitals are basis like oh h minus as we just showed on the previous slide. That means that you can mix the high homo of Ooh minus with the low Lumo of h plus and two electrons, the ones that were on the Oah minus go down and energy.

Speaker 1:          04:18          And that makes a bond. And our notation for showing that is to draw a curved Arrow and it gives water. Now think carefully about what a curved Arrow means. It's not the same as a straight arrow. A curved Arrow designates a shift of electron pairs. It doesn't show that this Adam moves from here to here. It shows that a pair of electrons shifts and that pair of electrons goes from being on the oxygen to being between oxygen and hydrogen to form the bond. So you start the curved Arrow where the electron pair is at the beginning and you end the Arrow put its point where it's going to be in the product, right? So it's not showing that an atom moves from here to there. It's showing that the electrons that were formerly on oxygen are now between oxygen and hydrogen. The effect of that is of course to pull the hydrogen to the oxygen, but that's not what's being shown by the Arrow.

Speaker 1:          05:20          What's being showed by the Arrow is how the electrons are moving and our picture, okay, so there's a case. Now here's another base with the same acid and we'd draw a curved Arrow there and show making an ammonium ion out of ammonia. Or we could use the same base with a different acid, the low vacant orbital of Bh three and draw the same curved Arrow and make this an ion. Make the bore on oxygen bond. Or we could start with completely different ones. We could start with ammonia, not o h minus, not Arrhenius is acid. A radius is based, but ammonia not Arrhenius acid, h plus, but be h three but it's exactly the same reaction. The high homo mixes with the low Lumo to form a new bond. Okay, so that's what curved arrows show. And don't confuse it by trying to draw molecules or atoms moving and showing the curved air. If you want to show a movie and draw some other kind of Arrow draw, a dotted arrows are a straight arrow or a wiggly arrow or something. But the curved arrows have a very specific meaning.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Now, the, the second, uh, reason that things could be unusually high or low is because they don't have much overlap. Notice in the first case, it was just an extreme case of that. There was no overlap at all. The orbitals were just there. But even though the orbitals are mixed with something else, if the overlap is poor, they haven't changed very much. They still look very much like they did originally. Right? So a good example of not having very good overlap is decide, decide, overlap of p orbitals. The Pie overlap. You remember from looking at those curves of amount of overlap for different orbitals versus distance. The Pie overlap isn't very big. So, even though the, uh, the P orbitals start a little higher on carbon than they do on a,

Speaker 2:          07:22          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          07:24          on hydrogen or, or normal bonds of carbon that have s character in them, they start a little higher, but they don't mix very much. Right. So the, the Pi or bundle is unusually high and the Pi Star anti-bonding orbital is unusually low because they didn't go down or up very much. Okay. Now, which of those do you think is more remarkable in its highness or lowness? Which do you see? So for this reason, the carbon carbon double bond could behave either as an acid or as a base, right? Hi. Occupied orbital makes it a base low vacant orbital makes an acid and indeed does have both kinds of reactivity. But which do you think is more pronounced? Which would be more familiar? How high the occupied one is or how low the vacant one is.

Speaker 2:          08:24          Lucas, what do you say hello? The Bacon. And why do you say so? Because electrons have to move into a position as close as possible.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Yeah. But on the other hand, the electrons of the pie want to move into something else.

Speaker 2:          08:40          There are lots and lots and lots of electrons. Oh No.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Well there are lots of, there even more vacant Oracle's than there are electrons.

Speaker 2:          08:48          Right, because you also have story in electronics like in a storable private. Let's just at the picture. Yeah, Catherine. I think the farther away from [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          09:04          Wow. The Homo is further above the normal bonds. Then the Lumo is below the normal anti bonds. Why

Speaker 2:          09:16          can't hear it very well? Because the P orbitals started a little off cause they started. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:20          a little higher. Right. So most reactions that will study or at least many reactions that will study of the carbon carbon double bond. It's reactive because of the high homo, not because of the low lube oil. Although there are cases where the low Lumo makes it reactive, but it's this Pi orbital here that makes it particularly remarkable because they started a little high. Okay. So the high homo makes it unusually reactive. Now how bout the C O Double Bond? Right. So it starts with the same p orbital on the carbon, which has pi overlap. Therefore not much. Shifting up and down was a p orbital of oxygen, which of course is lower than that of carbon because of the higher nuclear charge. Which of these will be most unusual? Somebody got a suggestion. So what would you think the characteristic reactivity of a CEO double bond? Would it be reactive mostly as a high Hobo that is as a base or mostly as a low Lumo, which is more unusual compared to what we compare things with

Speaker 2:          10:36          Andrew. Why this is further away and why is it further down compared to what we usually compare? Why does the

Speaker 1:          10:46          Pies Star C Double Bondo? Why does, why is that orbital so very low? One reason, pardon me, one reason it's low is because the overlap isn't very much so it didn't go up so much. Right. That's the same true that cc double bond, but what's special about the CEO? Double Bond. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          11:08          because of it.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Bad Energy match, right. It didn't go up very much from the carbon or down very much from the oxygen, but the average is low that it starts from, so it's an what's special here is the, the, the, the Pi is not so unusual, not so far from here, but this one Pi star is very far from here. So what should make a carbonyl, uh, especially reactive, is it's low vacant orbital because of poor overlap and that it started with an oxygen unusually low orbital atomic orbital.

Speaker 2:          11:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:50          We saw another example here. There's three membered. Carbon ring is unusually reactive for a carbon carbon bond. That is the electrons in that carbon carbon bond are not shifted down so much and the anti bond is not shifted up so much as a normal carbon carbon bonds. Why? What's special about the bonds and the three membered ring,

Speaker 2:          12:18          Kevin? Oh their bet. And what does that mean? Yeah, but, but their bet. So what

Speaker 1:          12:31          does it overlap as well? So it doesn't go up and down as much? Right? So another example of poor overlap. Okay. Or You could have an unusual atomic energy or in the molecular orbital, for example. How about a CF single bond? Right? So the overlap can be perfectly good. It's a regular old sigma bond straight on, right? But the fluorine starts very low. There's bad energy match. So the Pi Star isn't so very different from a vacant orbital on carbon, unusually low as a vacant orbital. So it should act as an acid. Things that have high homos should come up and react with. With that, uh, uh, sigma star of CF, it's an unusually low Lumo. Can you think of what the flip side of that, how could you have something like this? A carbon bonded to something that for the same or analogous reason would have an unusually high occupied orbital. What would you want the carbon to bond with?

Speaker 2:          13:40          She an elephant. Lithium. Why? Lithium can cause you looked at the PowerPoint. Why Lithium is easy for the barons electronically to be given the right. Why? Because it would be stable as a get request. Why? Because that's restating the same thing, right? What's different about lithium?

Speaker 1:          14:28          Why are orbitals on lithium as an atom unusually high in energy compared to carbon? Hydrogen.

Speaker 2:          14:37          Catherine

Speaker 1:          14:40          has, it has a low nuclear charge, right? It's right at the left end of the table. Okay, so it does, it's orbitals aren't very stable because it doesn't have very low, very high nuclear charge. So it's a high energy and that, and therefore it has bad energy match. Or it could have been lithium that I drew here. I happened to draw Boron, which is for the same reason a lower nuclear charge than carbon. Therefore, higher energy is an atomic orbital when they mix. What's special here is the occupied orbital sigma, right? Which is unusually high because the average started. Hi. Okay, so we, so boron, you may remember that in the first slide we showed boron had a vacant orbital, right? That p orbital on Boron is vacant, unusually low. Therefore what? Acid or base,

Speaker 2:          15:38          okay,

Speaker 1:          15:39          unusually low vacant orbital, which does that make it acid? So Bh three should be an acid, right? But what I just showed you is what? Shy on the previous slide. We'll go back. It has a high, unusually high homo BH three. So what does that make it shy?

Speaker 2:          16:00          Making a debate.

Speaker 1:          16:03          So is it an acid or a base?

Speaker 2:          16:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Wilson. It's both. And what does that suggest? If the same molecule is both an acid and the base, what do acids react with? So what if the same molecules, an acid and a base, it's going to react with itself. Two with the molecules will react with one another. Okay. At, that's why you can't do a crystal structure of Bh three cause BH three becomes B two h six let's look at how it happens. So there's the low Lumo that makes BH three and acid. What's the High Homo? What's the high homo of Bh three

Speaker 1:          16:57          in localized terms, I don't mean these big things that go over the whole molecule. It's the Bh Bond, right? Which was poorly matched and energy and so on. So there it's noticed that the BH bonding electrons are big on hydrogen. Small on Boron. We saw that last lecture. Okay. So they should overlap like this. Right? And the vacant orbital on B h three should stabilize, or the vacant orbital on the B should stabilize these high energy electrons in the Bh bond. But now you could imagine many different orientations of the top molecule that would allow overlap. Do you know why I chose this particular orientation? Which one as the acid in

Speaker 2:          17:50          which one is the base?

Speaker 1:          17:55          The one on the bottom of the vacant orbital act as an acid. The one on the top back. That is a base. So what other possibility is there

Speaker 2:          18:04          you Andrew, there also as you can reverse the roles,

Speaker 1:          18:10          Aha, you can have. So that would make notice. Incidentally, what I forgot to mention here is that there are three nuclei being held together by that pair of electrons. Now originally the top molecule that pair of electrons mostly on hydrogen, but partly on Boron, held the hydrogen and the Boron together. Now that same pair of electrons is attracted is, is helping form a bond with a boron, the bottom boron. So in fact, that's an unusual kind of bond because it's bonding three nuclei together, not just to, it's doing double or perhaps triple duty. So we need a new symbol to talk about such bonds and a reasonable one would be a bond that looks like that. It's a y bond. We could make it blue.

Speaker 2:          19:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:07          But now we have as you and just said, the vacant orbital on the top and the high occupied orbital on the bottom and they can do exactly the same thing. So we have two of these three center, two electron bonds, right? Two electrons holding three atoms together. Right? Or we can draw it that way. Right. And that's the structure of B two h six two of the pairs of electrons are each bonding three atoms together instead of two. Any questions about this? Yeah, Alison dotted line. The dotted just means it's a little different. You could draw the solid why if you want to. There's no really standard notation for that, but it's clear what it means. It's just that a pair of electrons is being shared among three nuclei rather than two. And their electron density is correspondingly. If you did a different density Mac map, if you could do an x ray of this, you'd expect electron density to build up in the middle of all three. Yeah. Claire,

Speaker 2:          20:15          let's me see like stupid, but we've talked about some base and although Lumo talks about as an acid is unoccupied, so it's, I mean I think about it like this, it's sort of receiving electronics, right? But generally basis are supposed to receive a lecture on this instead of acids and no, you've got it backwards. Yeah. Cause I

Speaker 1:          20:40          h plus is an acid, right? So it obviously can't give up electrons there. Adobe electrons and acid accepts electrons.

Speaker 2:          20:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:54          Think about it a little bit in the privacy of your room and you'll see that, okay, I can only happen here because of the geometry. Yeah. And then to get, to get that, you have to have overlap. So if you didn't have, if that top, if the top Bh three were oriented so that the Bh bond, we're vertical in the Boron was way up at the top, it wouldn't overlap the other one. So you have to, you always to get a bond, you have to have overlap because otherwise the orbitals don't mix and you just have the original orbitals as we've seen, this is kind of fun. During carnival it's kind of been very common. No, it's not very common because there are not many vacant or low really low energy vacant orbitals running around, right? Boron is a very special case, but a lithium can do the same thing, but lithium doesn't have energies, orbital energies as low as those of Boron because it doesn't have as big a nuclear charge. So Boron is particularly good at getting this kind of thing. And this answers the puzzle about Lewis structures that we raised in lecture too, about what, how can be h three react with Bh three right? That's how it does it by making three center bonds. Now, here's the true and false quiz on the basis of what you know. Is it true that low energy molecular orbitals result in bonding,

Speaker 2:          22:29          true or false? I don't think you've trusted me anymore.

Speaker 1:          22:35          We've been saying that when you get those low orbitals right, things come together. You've got a low orbital that results in a bog, lots of overlap.

Speaker 2:          22:48          Can't talk you into it. Go ahead.

Speaker 1:          22:51          That's false. What makes a bond is lowered energy. Orbitals it's when things come together and the electrons get more stable. It's not how low they are. It's how much they're lowered by the coming together because then pulling apart, they have to go back up again. So it's not whether they're high or low, it's whether they get lowered. Okay. Now compared to what? What do they have to get lower compared to

Speaker 2:          23:25          you and Joe? Kind of like how in your winning gold did it, showed the antibody,

Speaker 1:          23:35          you can say something in fewer words than that. What do you compare to when you say energy is lowered and that makes a bond? What's it lowered compared to Christopher DMC, their standard states? Uh, the, well, yes, but it could, it wouldn't necessarily be between atoms. It could be between two molecules like BH three with BH three what it's about. You're right, what it's lowered compared to is the things that was before they came together. Right now these things before they came together, one of them had electrons. One didn't. Those might have been very high. Right? So they came together, the electrons went substantially down, but still aren't so very low. They could have been very low energy orbitals to begin with, but not gone down very much. Okay. Because there was bad overlap say so these, even though they're lower than the ones we talked about first would not be so bonding. It's these that we're bonding because they came down a lot when the mixing happened. So it's lowering compared to what? Compared to the separated components before you made this bond. Right. So when things come together and that results in the electrons going way down in energy, that's a strong bond. Yes. Genuine part of it.

Speaker 1:          25:00          Well, that's what we're going to have to learn. That's a question of Lore, right? And it has to be at least enough to overcome the fact that when they come together, other electrons, other orbitals are filled orbitals are overlapping, which is net repulsive. So it may not be that there's an absolute criterion, right? It may be that if there are a lot of other things opposing the coming together, filled orbital with filled orbital, then you have to have on you really enormous going down. So you can't make a simple question, simple answer to that. But we're, we'll learn as we see examples. Okay, so now Homo Lumo mixing for reactivity and resonance. So reactivity means between molecules. So far we've been talking mostly about Adam's coming together and forming a bond. But molecules have high orbitals and low orbitals. As in the case of Bh three, the Bh was, uh, was a molecular orbital or if not an atomic orbital, right?

Speaker 1:          26:05          So when things come together, orbitals are orbitals. If you have an unusually high energy and then an unusually low energy and they overlap and go down, that makes a bond. So that's between molecules. But it turns out that what resonance is is Homo Lumo mixing within a molecule. Now you might say the molecules have certain molecular orbitals. How can you mix them? Right? The idea is that we made our first analysis on the basis of localized orbital sigma sigma star here, Sigma Sigma Star here. Not these big Kolodny things that go over the whole thing, but it may be that this sigma sigma star and this Sigma Sigma Star are near one another and overlap so that when we made our initial analysis and looked only at this and only with this, we didn't take into account that this one might interact with this one and give still lower energy when that kind of thing is important.

Speaker 1:          27:06          That's when you have to draw other resonance structures. And I'll show you an example, but first I'm going to show you reactivity and then we'll go on to residence. Okay, now let's look at the frontier orbitals four h f okay, so it has four valence electron pairs and five valence atomic orbitals, two s two p, x, Y, Z on Fluor, on fluorine and the one s on hydrogen. And and four pairs of electrons. So they're going to be four occupied orbitals and these are what the, this is what the lowest or, but it looks like what does, what does it look like?

Speaker 1:          27:49          Well, it's a two s orbital, the one s being the core on flury but it's made up of atomic orbitals. Is it exactly a two s of fluorine? Does it look like a sphere on fluorine? Alison, you're shaking hit your head. And how would they get a little distorted? What did we mix with the F orbital? A little bit of the one s on hydrogen. It's mostly the F on flury. Why? Cause the flu rates way down in energy. So the best the nation is mostly this, but you can see that it's a little bit egg shaped, a little bit drawn out toward the hydrogen. Okay, so it's mostly a two s of or a fluorine, but a little bit of one s on hydrogen right now here's the next one. What's that mostly? Can you see

Speaker 2:          28:47          Tyler a site that would say it too.

Speaker 1:          28:49          It looks like the Tupe on Fleury. Does it look exactly like a two P on Florida or is it just hard for you to see that it's not? It's very simple.

Speaker 2:          28:59          The blue one might be a bit,

Speaker 1:          29:00          yeah, the blue one is a little bit bigger because it's got a little bit of the one s of hydrogen lowering the energy of the two P of fluorine. Okay. And now the next two orbitals are these, what are those?

Speaker 2:          29:14          Okay, Steve, what did you say?

Speaker 1:          29:20          They're the two P Y and two PC. A fluorine. Do they make, why is their hydrogen in those two? Why not? Ah, they're orthogonal. It's a pie versus a sigma. There's no overlap, therefore no mixing. So those are the occupied orbitals and the two p's have the same energy. Okay. And then remember they're going to be five molecular orbitals and now you make the last one, which is going to have another node with the leftovers. What's leftover after we made the occupied or, but also what's it mostly leftover? We used up the two P's of fluorine to make those homos. Those were pure. Right? But what was leftover from from the bottom, we use very little of one s on hydrogen and there's a little bit of two p fluorine and two s Florian that we didn't use in the bottom ones. So they're back in the top. So what we have is mostly a one s on hydrogen, but a little bit of some kind of sp hybrid on fluorine. Is that clear to everyone? So that's the, that's the vacant orbital. Is it unusual energy? That vacant orbital? It's, it's low. Is it unusually low? Okay. Do you have an idea? What kind of criteria do we have for whether an orbital should be unusually low? What do we look for?

Speaker 1:          31:01          Overlap. Energy match. How about this case? Good overlap. White. Good overlap. It's a hybrid. Robert on fluorine pointed right toward a hydrogen. Good overlap. How about the energy match, Kate?

Speaker 2:          31:18          Sure,

Speaker 1:          31:20          sure, sure. It's good or it's bad. One of them is hydrogen. What's the other one? Where's flooring compared to hydrogen? Why? Right. Okay. Good. Energy match or bad energy match? Not very good. So you don't get much mixing. And you know that already by looking at the picture because you didn't mix it very much. It's almost all one s of hydrogen. So it's unusually low for a sigma star. It didn't go up very much from hydrogen. So indeed now it's got an unusually low vacant orbital. What does that make it an acid or a base?

Speaker 1:          32:00          It's an acid. Are you surprised that Ahf is an acid? Why? What's his name? Hydrofluoric acid. And that's what makes it an acid. A radius would say it's an acid because it gives up h plus we say it's an acid because it's an unusually low vacant orbital right now here. Uh, so notice that those three are made up of three atomic orbitals, the one s of hydrogen, the two s of fluorine, and the two p a p two p orbital, a fluorine, and they're in different mixtures in three of these. Usually we've looked at just two things, right? There's one Adam atomic orbital and another one. And they mix right a pair here. There are three going in to give three molecular orbitals, but still you can see quite easily why they should be the way they are. Why the bottom ones are almost pure fluorine and the top one is almost pure hydrogen.

Speaker 2:          32:59          Uh,

Speaker 1:          33:00          okay. And so that top one is sigma star, the Lumo, the unusually low Lumo look us,

Speaker 3:          33:08          be sure that the one is of like the low nuclear charge. Hydrogen is going to be that much different from that really highly of their charge to us in Florida.

Speaker 1:          33:17          Yeah. This you have to learn and I'm going to show you very soon how we can tell that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          33:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:25          Okay. There's a different picture that was made in 1973 of the same thing. These pictures were drawn just a year or two ago, right? But this, this is, you can see the same thing. It's drawn at a different contour level. It was based on a different calculation, but you can see it's the same thing. And we'll notice that. How many nodes does this thing have that are clearly visible to nodes? Right? Between the H and f, that one is anti-bonding. Right? When they came together, they canceled in the middle rather than reinforcing, there's another node there, but notice that that didn't have anything to do with the bonding that was already there in the atomic orbital you started with, so it didn't have anything to do with lowering. It didn't have anything to do with whether the thing was bonding or anti-bonding. The pink node had to do with whether it was bonding that came when they came together.

Speaker 1:          34:21          Right. It's an unfair, it's unfavorable, so it's better for them to come apart, but if they come apart, you don't do anything with the blue note. It's still there. It's part of the Adam. Okay, so you have to recognize that there are two kinds of nodes. There are nodes that were there already, atomic orbital nodes, and they're ones that are associated with the coming together, and that's what makes something bonding or anti-bonding this particular case, it's anti-bonding. Okay, now let's look instead of h, let's look at ch three f. Sam because you have occupied orbitals and then you have vacant orbitals and the ones you're interested in are the lowest of the vacant and the highest to the occupied at this border between occupied and vacant orbitals.

Speaker 1:          35:15          Okay, so this one has seven valence pairs of electrons. So you're going to occupy seven orbitals and here's what they look like. The seven that are occupied, what's the very lowest one? Mostly it's the two s of fluorine, right? And what's the next one? Well, it's ch bonds all mixed together, right? But also a little bit of a Pr, but alon fluorine, it has the blue sort of toward the front and a little bit of that red behind as part of the p orbital on flooring. So it's a mixture of the ch bonds and of the, uh, of the p orbital on fluorine. And then we have these others, some of them coming and payers. And those are the homos because we have seven occupied. And let's look at them a little more closely and compare them with each one with the one beneath it. And I'll draw another picture too for of that. Older kind for making this comparison and we're interested in what is it that went together to make these orbitals and why is one lower in energy and the other higher? So what do you see on the top orbital? Say this one here at the top left. What's that made up of? What is it on the left side? Sophie, what would you say the orbital is on the left side of that.

Speaker 2:          36:41          Okay,

Speaker 1:          36:43          right. This part here is a two P pi, right? Orbital of fluorine. Now what's this thing on the right here? The Dash, the bit down here. If you just saw that without any of the rest of it, what would you say that was? It's more, it's more than a one s on hydrogen that would be spherical. It's at a certain contour. The CH bond. You see that? So this is, this is electron density in here, bonding between Cnh and these two on the top are little bits of ch bonds as well mixed together. So what this orbital is, is a mixture between some combination of ch bonds on the right and the p orbital of fluorine on the left. Now, is it a favorable or an unfavorable combination of the fluorine orbital with the Cah orbitals. This one up here is the interaction between the fluorine orbital and the Cah orbitals bonding or anti-bonding. Becky, do you have an idea? Are they building up electron density in between or having a node in between? There's a node in between, so that's anti-bonding. What's the orbital on the bottom? This one, that's the same components, but it's the bonding combination. So this is the favorable combination of those and this is their unfavorable combination. So this lower energy when is favorable and the upper energy is unfavorable combination. How about here and here? Can you what that is? What's on the left here that that that lump of red and this lump of Blue Eric.

Speaker 2:          38:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:49          Here, here in this thing is made. That is a, it's very complicated. Okay. Will you agree on that? Okay, but part of it is part on the left, there's a red lump in behind and a blue lump in front. You can see it maybe more clearly here, red behind and blue in front surrounding the green fluorine atom. What is that? Orbital at atomic orbital.

Speaker 2:          39:15          Can't hear it right away.

Speaker 1:          39:17          It's The p orbital on fluorine that's pointed more or less toward you. Okay, so this is a PR battle of flury that's mixing with ch bonds here, right? In fact, it's the same thing as this turned on its side. Okay, so this is the bonding combination built up between the fluorine in the CHS. This is the anti-bonding one with a node between the fluorine in the CHS. So here we have a node in this bottom one, but that node came from the atomic orbitals. That's what made it a p orbital here on fluorine, that when you don't get rid of, if you pull the fluorine away, that doesn't have anything to do with the bonding. That's just an atomic orbital node. Right on the top. You again have the same atomic orbital node because it's the same p orbital that's involved. But what about the top Sam?

Speaker 1:          40:18          There's another node that one, and that's an anti bonding node, right? The electrons in that orbital would get a lower in energy if the, if you broke the bond, if the fluorine came away. So the pink nodes are the ones we're interested in. The anti-bonding nodes, not the ones that are just part of the atomic orbital. Okay? Now, uh, we're getting to Lucas's question. So this thing down here is made up of fluorine and c h the one here is made up of fluorine and Cah, right? This is the favorable combination and this is the unfavorable combination. So you get it right. So here are the two of them. They come together when the f comes up to the methyl right and you get a favorable one and an unfavorable one, but the fluorine and the Cah is may not be at the same energy.

Speaker 1:          41:22          How do you know which one's lower? That's your question. Is the fluorine lower or is the ch lower or are they about same? Now, how are we going to tell if the fluorine is lower and they come together? What does the lower one look like? Mostly flury. If the floor higher and they come together, what does the low one look like? Mostly Ch, right? So by looking at how big these are, we can tell which one is lower. So when we look here, uh, we, uh, we, we see that here the, I would say they're pretty similar left to right. There's not much difference between a two p orbital on fluorine and ch Sigma bonds. Not much difference, but to the extent they're different. I would say looking at this, that the ch is a little bigger here and the fluorine is a little bigger here.

Speaker 1:          42:22          Would you say that? So, which is lower a ch sigma bond or the P orbital of fluorine? Ch sigma bond would be a little lower than Fleury. Not much though. Pretty similar. So they're about the same as we say. But if you have to make a choice, the ch is a little bit lower in energy, the flu reads a little higher. Okay. Uh, now there's also a vacant orbital made up with the leftovers here. Some of the leftovers. And what's that? Let's look at a different picture of it. So this has three nodes that are obvious. There's one that's near the fluorine atom, a node plane that goes back the furthest to the left. Everyone see that? Is that a bot anti-bonding node or is that an atomic orbital node? That's part of the Fleury at atomic orbitals of some hybrid on fluorine. Right? And the same is true at the Cah end. There's a node that's an atomic orbital node of the carbon, right? But what's important between those other two is what's between the fluorine and the carbon and the ch three and that's anti-bonding so that the Lumo is a sigma star anti bond between C and methyl.

Speaker 1:          43:45          And why is it unusually low? The question is whether the Lumos should be unusually low. Why is it unusually low? Is the overlap bad? No, the overlap's good. Did hybrids pointed right toward one another? But what makes it low in energy? So you know, I'm not giving you specific problems on this, but look over those things and run your brain as to those four different things that make orbitals unusually high or unusually low because that's what you'll be doing next week. When you're doing these wikis, each of you decide some functional group. Why is it functional? What makes it unusually higher, unusually low, or maybe neither, right? Why is the c f bond more properly the CF sigma star or orbital? The anti-bonding orbital. Why is it unusually low compared to what? What do you compare to a ch bond? How come C F is lower for the sigma star? Alex? Pardon me? Yeah. The fluorine is really low. Their average is very low, so the vacant doorbell is unusually low. It didn't go up much, right? Where have you seen that before?

Speaker 2:          45:15          H f

Speaker 1:          45:17          the previous slide. Ahf was exactly the same. It's an acid. Remember Kate, you helped us with that. It's an acid because of the bad energy match between fluorine and hydrogen. This is the same thing, but it's the bad energy match between fluorine and carbon. Okay, so ch ch threeF is an acid for the same reason that HF is an acid. All right, there's the low Lumo of Ahf, right? It's got that same anti-bonding node shy. Why is there no, maybe it just happens that it worked out that way. Oh, it's let's screw hydrogen is one s that makes it unusually low, but it doesn't have very big nuclear charge. Carbon has a higher nuclear charge, but you're talking two s and two P and it turns out those just cancel out. If that hadn't been the case, organic chemist, like if if Boron happened to match hydrogen, then maybe our organic chemistry would be, but be Boron, hydrogen, not carb ever be borrow hydrates, not carbohydrates.

Speaker 1:          46:32          Right? But that's the way things are. So in this picture, we do sell that. Actually, there are other reasons it wouldn't be boron because Boron has these vacant orbitals and farms B two h six and so on. But it just happens that that cancellation works that way. You just by looking at this picture, we can say that, uh, ch three, there's four mg magic because the rules around Floreano much smaller than those around, Oh, let's look at the next slide here. Uh, is it this one? No, we're going to get to that. If you looked at ones that were very badly mismatched, then the favorable and unfavorable combinations would be very dramatic. And actually you've already seen that in HF. Okay? Uh, we have one minute to start this. Okay. So we're going to look at how c h three f behaves like h f right?

Speaker 1:          47:22          Both of them are acids. So first we'll look at HF, and next time we'll go on to see h three f. So here's, here's HF. So you have to bring, here's a veilleux low vacant orbital. We've talked about that ad nauseum. Okay, now you want to get good overlap from what direction? We'll another orbital come in order to get good overlap without the nuclei getting too close together. Obviously it'll come from are often the right where this orbital is big, where you can get a lot of overlap without getting close to the nuclei. So if you had something with a high energy pair of electrons that would come and it would overlap from the right, something like Ooh, minus, and you draw curved Arrow to show those electrons, the high homo of Ooh, minus being stabilized by the vacant orbital of HF. And how would you draw the curved Arrow? Where would it start? Where would it end to show the electrons have h minus forming a bond with Oih Bod? You start from the pair of electrons that you're talking about and you'd end between h and o, right? But that means this is really important. That means you're putting electrons putting electron density into this orbital, right? What effect does putting electrons in that orbital have on the HF bond?

Speaker 2:          48:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:52          Okay. The curved arrows, blah, blah. We did that.

Speaker 2:          48:57          Sherwin,

Speaker 1:          49:00          it's what? What do you call that? Orbital. What's the name of the orbital that we're putting electrons into oneness? It's Sigma Star. It's mostly one s on hydrogen, but it's Sigma Star. What does star mean? What does it mean if you put electrons in the bond? Double Braids, right? It has that anti-bonding node, so electrons that go into that, we'll get more stable if the bond breaks. So we're going to draw another curved Arrow

Speaker 2:          49:34          like that.

Speaker 1:          49:36          So we make a new bond between Hno, but we lose the bond between h and f. So there's our product that's an acid base reaction, and it showed HF acting as an acid, not because it gave h plus h plus never appears in here. Right? What happened is you make a bond and break a bond to the hydrogen. So it's an acid base reaction and the same thing will show next time happens with ch three f. Okay.
