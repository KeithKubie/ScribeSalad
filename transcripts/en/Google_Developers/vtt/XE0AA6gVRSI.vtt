BRETT SLATKIN: Hey, my name is
Brett Slatkin, and I'm a

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.040
software engineer
here at Google.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480
We're here today to talk about
IndieWebCamp and the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.380
independent web with Tantek
Celik, who's a technologist,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.980
writer and teacher.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.880
He currently is at Mozilla,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.880
focusing on open web standards.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.460
And you may also know him as a
creator of many communities

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.170
like BarCamp and Microformats.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.771
You can find Tantek
at tantek.com.

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:33.020
So yeah, let's get into it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.485
So, Tantek, you recently
won an election.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.305
What was that election about?

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.220
TANTEK CELIK: So I recently
ran for the W3C's advisory

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.115
board, and that's a board of
about nine people that advise

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:50.900
the W3C on all matters, like
process, running the W3C, all

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.780
that kind of thing, and selected
by all the member

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.970
companies of the W3C.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.730
BRETT SLATKIN: And this is for
web standards just like HTML

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.210
and CSS, and basically
everything that makes up the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.350
internet, the web
as we know it.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.940
TANTEK CELIK: Yeah, so the
advisory board doesn't work on

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.660
those standards, but sort of
works on how does the W3C work

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.240
at all to create the
groups that then

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.070
work on those standards.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.170
BRETT SLATKIN: For governance
and things like that.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.470
TANTEK CELIK: For governance
and things like that.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.220
So a bunch of us had been
pursuing making standards more

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.630
open, how they're developed more
open, and ran for the W3C

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.210
advisory board on this sort
of platform of openness.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.770
And some of us got elected, and
so now we're going to be

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.090
pushing to make the W3C even
more open in how it works.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.200
BRETT SLATKIN: That's great.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.070
So open is very important
to you.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.440
We're talking about the
indie web today.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.590
And maybe some people
don't know.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.360
What is the indie web?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.210
What does the indie web mean?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
TANTEK CELIK: So the indie web
is really about people owning

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.020
their own content, owning their
identity, owning their

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.070
own domain on the web and
controlling it, doing with it

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.010
as they please, and using
that as their primary

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.950
identity on the web.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.300
And that's sort of in contrast
to creating an account on

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.360
somebody else's system and
posting your content on

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.460
someone else's site.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.200
BRETT SLATKIN: Great.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.780
So there's also an event that
you helped organize, called

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.170
IndieWebCamp.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.180
It's been around for
a few years now.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.920
It started in 2011.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.300
And it's happening next week in
Portland, June 22 and 23.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.190
So tell us about IndieWebCamp.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.420
What is IndieWebCamp
all about?

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.650
TANTEK CELIK: So it's all fine
and dandy to create your own

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.490
website, but as humans, we build
communities around the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.730
things we have in common.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.910
And the IndieWebCamp really
started as kind of a BarCamp

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.720
DevCamp for those of us that are
passionate about the indie

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.510
web, creating our presence on
the web, but we wanted to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.430
collaborate, and share our
ideas, and share our code, and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.530
share our designs for doing so,
and hopefully even get our

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.120
sites to talk to each other.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.000
And we can get into a little
bit of that later.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.090
BRETT SLATKIN: So what kind of
people go to IndieWebCamp?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.350
TANTEK CELIK: The people that
go to IndieWebCamp--

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.790
essentially, you have to be
dedicated to owning your

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.360
identity on the web, so you have
to have your own domain

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.860
and be like, this is me, this is
who I am on the web, and I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.990
don't mind putting my
stuff out there.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.340
And then you have to be a
creator of some sort, so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.920
whether that's a builder or
developer, like you write

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.170
code, or you do user interface
design, or you do graphic

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.350
design, or any kind of flow.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.075
Even if you're just a content
author and being an

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.080
independent content author is
your thing, you have to be a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.130
creator of some sort.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190
And then the third quality that
we look for is people

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.830
that are willing to freely share
at least some of what

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.530
they create so that we can build
on each other's work.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.070
So that's really what
it's about.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.910
You have your own identity
on the web.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.250
You're a creator of some sort.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.410
And then you share
some of what you

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.690
create openly and freely.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.310
BRETT SLATKIN: Great.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.340
So what inspired you to pursue
the indie web and start

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.450
IndieWebCamp?

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.360
TANTEK CELIK: So I've had my own
site for a while, and I've

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.280
been blogging since 2002.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.440
And a lot of that, I kind of
slacked off on that myself

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.574
with sort of increased use of
Twitter, and Pounce, and lots

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:52.280
of other services--

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.330
Flickr.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.300
But one of the things I finally
realized, the more I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.370
used these services, the more
frustrated I got with

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.500
different things, and I just
couldn't do things.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.710
Like I wanted to add navigation
between my tweets,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.750
and I have to wait for
Twitter to do that.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.990
BRETT SLATKIN: Well, and
there's also some bad

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.090
examples, too.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.220
So there's cases where you want
it to be more custom or

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.910
more flexible, but there's also
cases that I know of of

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.959
data loss or even losing
your content.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.440
Could you talk about
those a little bit?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.700
TANTEK CELIK: So on the sadder
side of why a lot of folks

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.655
come to the indie web is they
build up a whole site, a

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:30.640
community, a something, on
someone else's site, and then

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.120
it gets shut down, oftentimes
with very little notice,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.810
oftentimes with no easy way
to download your content.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.105
Sometimes you can download your
content, sometimes, but I

00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:42.070
think Posterous is sort of
the most recent example.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.410
And this seems to be a
cycle that repeats

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.560
almost every year.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560
Large company acquires smaller
company, all the content.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.240
And then within a year or
two, the content and the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.860
URLs are all lost.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.600
So it's one of those downsides
of whenever you go and you put

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.180
your content on someone else's
site, we call that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.710
sharecropping.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.700
Certainly the same practices
of trying to actually grow

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.870
your crops on someone
else's land.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.610
You actually don't have
control over it.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.660
BRETT SLATKIN: And then
how about identity?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.670
What are some cases of the
problems that happen with

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.050
identity in the indie web?

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.310
TANTEK CELIK: So one of the
things with buying a domain

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.270
name is it's pretty much yours
unless some company comes by

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.230
and says, hey, we have a
trademark on that name.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.900
We're going to take it.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.960
And then you're sort
of dealing with the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.550
broader legal system.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.610
But with accounts on any
random system, the site

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.600
provider, the social network,
whatever, can decide to give

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.360
away your account or to lock
it for any reason.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.590
They all have very different
terms of services.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.930
They essentially amount to
you don't own anything.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.850
We control everything.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.700
We can do whatever we want.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.670
So a lot of people have either
lost or had their identities

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.490
even reassigned.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.020
BRETT SLATKIN: And
there's really no

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.130
recourse when that happens?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.410
TANTEK CELIK: There's basically
no legal recourse,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.220
because you agreed to their
terms of service which let

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.180
them do whatever they want.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.520
That's what all the
terms of services

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.280
essentially come down to.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.470
Some of them are a little bit
better about that, like

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.100
Flickr's long time had
a really good--

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.900
you own your content.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.060
We don't claim any rights to
it or something like that.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.590
And it would be nice if there
were more sites that did that,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.650
but in general, sites sort of
err on the side of, no, we own

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.720
everything, and you're just
kind of playing in our

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.900
playground because we're letting
you do it for free.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.860
BRETT SLATKIN: So that's kind
of more of the worries about

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.670
what the indie web solves.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.590
What are some of the positive
things that the indie web

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.910
helps with, and what are the
good positive reasons that

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.000
people would want to
join the indie web?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.140
TANTEK CELIK: So like many
things, a lot of these

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.840
frustrations turned into sort
of the mother of invention.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.530
Like you go, you're like, OK, I
want to build my own thing,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.490
because I'm frustrated with what
the service is offering

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.920
me or not offering me.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.980
And you start doing that, and
you realize, wow, I actually

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.730
have so much more freedom here
to do amazing things, like I'm

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.990
not limited to 140 characters.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.020
I can start embedding images in
line, JPEGs, and movies or

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.750
whatever, in a much
better way than

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.170
Twitter does it, or whatever.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.290
I can provide a better user
interface, a cleaner user

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.670
interface than what
Twitter does.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.890
BRETT SLATKIN: And for user
interface, you mean your

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.360
readers, the people who consume
what you create.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.760
TANTEK CELIK: That's right.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.180
So on my site, at tantek.com, I
can post a video, and I can

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.300
post an image, I can post a
series of them, and it'll show

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.810
up like interspersed
in my content.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.200
And I think I can provide a much
cleaner experience for

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.502
people to come to read my
content there than on Twitter

00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:29.490
and all the other sites, where
you see lists of suggested

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.100
followers or here are some other
ads you might check, or

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.760
maybe use this promoted account
or all this noise.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.220
It seems like every content silo
eventually deteriorates

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.680
into something like that, where
you're just surrounded

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.260
by all of this distraction
around the actual content.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.660
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah, so you have
control over the way it

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.100
looks and feels.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.610
TANTEK CELIK: The experience.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.340
BRETT SLATKIN: The experience.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.820
That's great.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.980
TANTEK CELIK: That's a really
big thing for me.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.840
The personal expression's
a big one.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.990
I get to alter the design
however I feel like.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.390
BRETT SLATKIN: So are there any
other examples of positive

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.210
things that come from that?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.515
I mean, so you get
to customize.

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:02.020
But what are some
other positives?

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.420
TANTEK CELIK: So we talked
about sites going away.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.336
In fact, we have a whole page on
site deaths, where we have

00:08:06.336 --> 00:08:08.355
a chronology of different sites
that have shut down, how

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.640
many people's accounts have
lost, links have been lost.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.200
If you own your own
domain, it's like

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.792
owning your own phone.

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:19.480
As long as you're paying the
bills, you've got that domain

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.430
name and you've got your
content there.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.820
BRETT SLATKIN: You mean like
phone number, like a portable

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.430
phone number.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.700
TANTEK CELIK: Right.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.120
BRETT SLATKIN: You could go
between providers, and nobody

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.080
can take it away from you.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.360
TANTEK CELIK: Right, so just
like you can port your phone

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.920
number between providers, you
can port your domain between

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.240
web hosting services.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.039
And you'll pay someone to host
it there, some trivial amount,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.940
less than it costs to have
a phone, a lot less.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.580
But we put so much energy into
so much of this content we

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.680
create for the web, and yet we
don't sort of back it up with

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.750
even a fraction of what
we do for just

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.480
having a phone number.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.570
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.970
So I've been to IndieWebCamp.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.120
I'm going again this year, and I
wanted to talk about some of

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.025
the things that people hack
on at IndieWebCamp.

00:08:58.025 --> 00:09:01.860
So two of the examples that I
know about are these kind of

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.520
funny terms.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.950
There's POSSE and PESOS, so I
thought I'd talk about that

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.610
real quick.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.960
The thing is, in the indie web,
if you make content on

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.250
your own site and you publish it
on your own site, you still

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.020
want to engage with
your audience.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.840
And you want to push what you've
created to Twitter and

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.230
Facebook and Google+ and on and
on, because you want as

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.370
big of an audience
as possible.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.950
You're writing content to be
read in a lot of ways.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.600
TANTEK CELIK: Sure.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.400
BRETT SLATKIN: But the question
is, how do you engage

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.010
with your audience without
losing control?

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.723
And so POSSE and PESOS
are two of the ways I

00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:36.440
know of doing that.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.920
I was just going to
say what they are.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.600
The first one, POSSE, is Publish
On your own Site,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.550
Syndicate Elsewhere.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.910
So this is where you
have your blog.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.020
You publish to it, and then you
tweet out a link or share

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.790
a link on Facebook that
people can find.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.370
The second one is PESOS, where
you actually publish somewhere

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.970
else and then suck all
the content back

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.530
into your own site.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.870
There's a bunch of tools that'll
do this now, so you

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.460
can just engage all
over the place.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.560
But then almost like a personal
archive, it'll bring

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.410
everything back to your site so
there's one place to find

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.360
everything.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.720
So then what are some other
examples of things that people

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.220
hack on at IndieWebCamp?

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.200
What can we expect?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.010
TANTEK CELIK: So I think a lot
of it really comes from the

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.470
core value of because it's your
own site, because you're

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.300
putting your own stuff out there
and you're building on

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.090
it, that's something we
call self-dog fooding.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.300
There's this concept of dog
fooding that we have in the

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.680
industry of eating your own dog
food, like whatever you

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.210
create, working on it.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.230
And it's oftentimes applied to
companies, where a company

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.770
will have an API, and so they'll
build on top of their

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.850
own API to make sure that the
API actually works properly.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.250
But we've introduced this notion
of self-dog fooding,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.990
where it's like it's not just
you and your company, but you

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.440
with yourself.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.450
And I think once you start doing
that, you realize, oh,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.960
my priorities for what I want to
do are very different than

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.380
if I was just building a product
for some person.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.620
Because I want to own
my own content.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.420
I want to control it.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.400
But yet I still want to stay
in touch with my friends.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.280
And that's really where POSSE
came from, was this diligent

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.180
desire to own your own content,
but then like, hey,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.220
my friends are reading it on
Twitter, or my friends are

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.750
reading it on Facebook, or my
friends are reading it on

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.210
Google Reader.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.103
Wherever they're reading, you're
like, OK, I have to

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.120
have a feed if someone's
using a feed reader.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.680
Or if someone's just using
Twitter, I need to post copies

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.900
of my content to Twitter
or Facebook.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.940
But in all those cases, one
thing we've tried to do is

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.880
make sure that there's always
links or some identifier

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.560
pointing back to the original.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.810
And that's important, because
when you start kind of forking

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.710
these conversations in these
different forums, you may want

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.840
to actually integrate them back
in your own site, and

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.020
somebody might want to see
the whole story of

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.690
what's going on.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.550
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.540
TANTEK CELIK: So that's kind
of what drove POSSE.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.290
And what's kind of interesting
is that the indie web efforts

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.890
really have built on a lot
of previous efforts like

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.680
federated social web, things
like that, that were looking

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.790
to create a giant distributed
social network of different

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.150
sites and things.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.170
But when we all took an
independent individual

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.240
approach to it--

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.660
so the word "indie" sort of
has double meanings here--

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.440
it turns out that the priorities
really change from,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.010
oh, Federation, to, no,
we want to stay in

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.320
touch with our friends.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.420
A lot of that comes
down to that.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.070
And we talk about readers
and audience.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.710
But a lot of the folks on the
indie web are doing it purely

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.400
as hobbyists, as independents,
not necessarily as a business.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.860
Although, sure, if you want
to do it as a business,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.660
it makes sense too.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.760
You should own your own site.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.130
BRETT SLATKIN: Right.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.450
So then the range of projects
that we're going to see--

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.380
I mean, it's a lot of hobbyists
and amateurs, in

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.820
some ways non-professional
reasons to do it.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.420
It's labors of love--
that kind of thing.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.720
I was thinking what are a couple
of examples of that?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.060
I know that RelMeAuth was a
big thing last year, Indie

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.830
Comments are another thing
kind of this year.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.970
Maybe you could tell us a little
bit about RelMeAuth and

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.300
Indie Comments.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.350
TANTEK CELIK: Sure.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.090
So RelMeAuth arose out of
a need to do independent

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.350
identity with URLs, and so
there's a standard called

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.360
OpenID that kind of solved this
problem, did a great job,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.200
there's a lot of deployments
out there.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.500
And you can set up your own site
to be your identifier and

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.930
log in to all of these different
sites using OpenID.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.760
Now, the challenge is that on
the indie web, everyone's sort

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.500
of a small scrappy developer,
because they're all developing

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.070
themselves.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.043
And so if you want to consume
an OpenID, it's

00:13:09.043 --> 00:13:09.550
actually a lot of work.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.190
BRETT SLATKIN: It's
very difficult.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.040
TANTEK CELIK: It's
really difficult.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.000
A lot of us have tried
and looked at the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.170
libraries and gave up.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.780
We were like, this is
just too much work.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.330
There's got to be
an easier way.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.360
Since OpenID, things like
Twitter Sign In came up,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.870
Facebook Connect, all these silo
specific sources came up.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.520
BRETT SLATKIN: And even OpenID
Connect, which is a

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.260
simplification of OpenID,
because they realized that

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.250
there were some issues
with the way--

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.930
TANTEK CELIK: They tried to come
out too, but that didn't

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.010
really take off.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.650
Twitter and Facebook really
raised the bar, in terms of it

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.570
should be this easy to integrate
sign on, so third

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.100
party delegated sign
on to your site.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.110
So we were like, OK,
that's good.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.110
That's a good bar to set.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.430
So with RelMe, we have a way
of connecting your site to

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.760
your Twitter account, or your
site to your GitHub account.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.770
And from there, what we do is
we say, hey, we'll use your

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.940
site as your identity, but since
you're delegating your

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.840
authentication to GitHub,
we'll use GitHub's OAuth

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.750
support that they already
have built in.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.500
BRETT SLATKIN: And all
their security that

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.230
comes with that, yeah.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.490
TANTEK CELIK: And all their
security that comes with that

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.840
to authenticate you.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.450
So you kind of get the
best of both worlds.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.480
We're going to keep
track of you as--

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.800
what's your domain again?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:11.900
Big Fluke?

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.670
BRETT SLATKIN: One
Big Fluke, yeah.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.730
TANTEK CELIK: One Big
Fluke, that's right.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:14.610
.com.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.850
But whenever you log in, we're
going to authenticate you

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.290
using whatever providers you
happen to provide at that

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.560
point in time.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.260
So that's how RelMeAuth started
is sort of like a

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.390
simpler version of OpenID like
work that people could consume

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.290
that was much easier
to implement.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:26.990
BRETT SLATKIN: That's great.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.570
And then what about the
new IndieWeb Comments?

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.330
TANTEK CELIK: So IndieWeb
Comments are kind of a

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.420
fascinating rebirth from
an effort that was

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.450
about 10 years ago.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.155
So about 10 years ago, Ian
Hickson developed and wrong

00:14:39.155 --> 00:14:40.690
this spec called Pingback.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.660
And it kind of was the evolution
of a lot of efforts

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.260
like Trackback, of blogs talking
to blogs, and trying

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.320
to include excerpts or be like,
hey, I linked to you.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.750
Here's the pingback.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.410
But it never really solved
the comment problem.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.965
And by the comment problem, I
mean if you want to comment on

00:14:53.965 --> 00:14:55.860
a blog, you have to go to that
blog, you have to sign into

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.900
that blog, you have to type
a comment on that blog.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.920
And then it's kind of there.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.470
It's like a dead end.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.460
Or there are services now that
do this with JavaScript too, a

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.190
bunch of them.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.500
But that just means they
don't get indexed.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.730
So we wanted to solve this.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.540
We were like, well, no, if I
write a blog post, if another

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.720
person wants to comment on it
like on the indie web, they

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.480
should write their comment
on their own site and

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.590
then send it to me.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.230
And then I'll syndicate it and
show it just as good as if

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.000
someone had written the
comment natively.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.410
BRETT SLATKIN: That reminds me
a lot of the Tumblr model,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.990
where you reblog something
and then add your

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.930
little bit to it.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.870
TANTEK CELIK: Yes, very
similar to that.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.100
It's very similar to
the Tumblr model.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.810
BRETT SLATKIN: But it's
distributed, so anyone can do

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.800
it from any site.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.030
TANTEK CELIK: Yes, that's the
biggest difference there.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.290
And we were basically working
through the pieces of how to

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:38.890
make this work.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.160
There's a simplified version of
Pingback called Webmention

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.050
that uses just pure
HTTP, essentially.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.340
There's no XML or PC in there.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.000
That's great.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.250
And then the other big piece
really came down to

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.360
presentation.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.760
So to make a comment look good,
I'd say if there's one

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.520
big distinguishing feature in
addition to self-dog fooding

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.790
of the indie web versus sort
of previous efforts is that

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.620
we're all focused on making our
sites look good and feel

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.365
good, because it's
our own site.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:06.810
BRETT SLATKIN: And there's
a lot of designers in the

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.260
community too, so it
seems like it's--

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.380
TANTEK CELIK: We're a much
more designer-friendly

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.750
community, for sure.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.070
So with comments are
the same problem.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.220
We're like, OK, you bring up
someone's comment post, and

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.650
we've got to make those comments
look just right.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.400
What does that mean?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.790
We need the content
of the comment.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.250
We need the permalink
of the comment.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.620
We need an avatar
for the person.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.090
We need a link to their site.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.400
We need a date and time stamp.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.680
We need all these things, which
it turns out we actually

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.220
have all that with
Microformats.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.620
So people publishing this on
their web page in HTML, just

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.570
adding a few simple
Microformats--

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.090
hEntry, hCard, saying, hey, this
entry is here and here is

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.650
the hCard author of it--

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.990
all we had to do is actually
add one rel value,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.030
in-reply-to, so that you could
link to the thing you're

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.460
commenting on and say,
rel=in-reply-to, this is a

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.030
comment in reply to this post.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.060
And by doing that, it made it
so that it was discoverable.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.770
And then the person posting the
comment just sends a web

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.550
mention to the original post
and says, hey, by the way--

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.680
just like Pingback--

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.130
I mentioned you, but this is
actually a reply, a comment.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.240
The guy's site goes back and
says, OK, let me read your

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.310
permalink that you claim
is a comment, see if

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.250
you're linking to me.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.869
Oh, you are, with
rel-in-reply-to, cool.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.380
Let me get to contents
of your comment.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.770
Oh, let me get your avatar.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.980
Great, now I can display it as
if it was a native comment on

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.440
my own site.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.079
BRETT SLATKIN: That's great.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.190
TANTEK CELIK: And that
just happened.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.550
BRETT SLATKIN: It
was very recent.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.490
TANTEK CELIK: Less than
two months ago.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.000
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.090
And how many sites are doing
kind of the IndieWeb Comment?

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.050
TANTEK CELIK: So I have to
actually look at the site,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.210
because when it started,
I blogged--

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.250
BRETT SLATKIN: Obviously,
two was the beginning.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.850
And then it was three very
quickly after that, and yeah,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.860
what are we up to now?

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.770
TANTEK CELIK: So within minutes,
the first comment

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.690
showed up, and it worked.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.730
And it was kind of like magic,
because the guy writing the

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.820
comment didn't know it
was going to work.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.880
And then there's follow up
commentary, and within a few

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.575
days there were four people.

00:17:52.575 --> 00:17:53.540
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah,
four people.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.550
TANTEK CELIK: From four
different countries.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.850
BRETT SLATKIN: Right,
and totally separate

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.000
implementations as well.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.030
TANTEK CELIK: Belgium, the
US, France, England--

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.540
totally separate

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.860
implementations, different sites.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.180
And the funny thing is, none
of them from the Bay Area.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.940
That was the other thing.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.210
BRETT SLATKIN: That's cool.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.130
TANTEK CELIK: It's like
indie web is such

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.230
a distributed thing.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.350
But now if you look at it,
there's let's see.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.770
So this says four.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.020
BRETT SLATKIN: A lot.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.795
And you expect more this
weekend, I mean, after this

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:18.290
coming weekend at the
IndieWebCamp.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.480
TANTEK CELIK: Six, seven--

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.430
so we're up to seven different
implementations.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.870
BRETT SLATKIN: Right, and I
think out of this weekend at

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.380
IndieWebCamp, next weekend,
hopefully

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.080
we'll get a lot more.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.600
Because that's kind of what
happens is a lot of

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.370
hacking and so on.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.550
TANTEK CELIK: Yeah, yeah, in
fact, Ben Werdmuller is the

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.370
first one in the Bay Area to
actually join in this thread.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.740
BRETT SLATKIN: OK, to actually
employ that.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.530
TANTEK CELIK: And this
commentary thread on

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.750
[? Eshnu's ?]

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.790
blog, where he literally just
started with saying, testing,

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.450
IndieWeb Federation.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.770
And then he--

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.230
BRETT SLATKIN: And it worked.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.560
TANTEK CELIK: He at mentioned a
few folks, which works over

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.400
the indie web.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.690
And then a bunch of people
started commenting on it, and

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.950
now it's become this kind
of proving ground.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.090
When you've got commenting
working on your site, you kind

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.650
of go leave a comment on his
original post, testing this.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.630
So you can kind of see a
chronology of who got what

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.580
working when.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.300
It's very exciting.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.210
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah,
it's exciting.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.480
Oh, yeah, so this other thing.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.830
So there are more spaces.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.410
Before we go, there's a few more
spaces at IndieWebCamp

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.570
next weekend, June 22 to 23.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.470
TANTEK CELIK: Eight, there's
eight spots left.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.710
BRETT SLATKIN: In Portland,
Oregon.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.530
So if you are around and have
the time, please come and sign

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.400
up at indiewebcamp.com.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.500
You can find Tantek online
at tantek.com.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.110
You can find me online
at onebigfluke.com.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.900
And thanks very much
for watching.
