00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.520
Now that we know how to run
a simple sample, and how it looks,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.590
let's talk about what notification
features are possible on Android Wear.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.150
The first thing we can do is add extra
action buttons to a notification.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
The user can view these actions by
swiping the notification to the left.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.630
These actions are also visible on
the phone notification as well, so

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.790
this is not wearable specific.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.990
So you make a call to
the addAction method

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.340
of the notification compact builder.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.600
You need to supply an icon to use, and

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.470
you also need to provide
a string to show underneath, and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.680
finally you'll need to provide a pending
intent for the specific action.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.170
You'll notice that this code
snippet creates a pending intent

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.738
that refers to a location, so

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:44.700
it would open up a mapping application
to display this on the phone.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.490
It is important to realize that
notifications created on the phone

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.140
always cause the intent to run on
the phone as well, not the wearable.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.840
It's also possible to have different
actions appear on the wearable

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.550
device compared to
the actions on the phone.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.980
To do this, we introduce a class
called WearableExtender for

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.319
wearable specific
features we want to use.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.540
We use the extend method of
NotificationCompat.Builder, and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.530
pass in the new WearableExtender object.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.420
With WearableExtender,
we call addAction here

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.970
to add the wearable specific action,
which is defined here.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.060
Note that when you use addAction
with the WearableExtender,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740
none of the regular addAction calls
will show up on the wearable, and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.710
none of the wearable addAction
calls will be shown on the phone.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.060
They're decoupled from each other now.
