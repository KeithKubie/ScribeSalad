My name is Mark Zondlo, and my head is in the clouds.

Mark Zondlo:
I'm measuring water vapor on the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser hygrometer.

Mark Zondlo:
In a 21st-century version of Captain Cook's historic voyage, we are exploring the atmosphere from

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:37.000 position:98%
Mark Zondlo:
pole to pole in a flying laboratory. We porpoise through the skies, taking readings from 14 kilometers high

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Mark Zondlo:
to just above the sea ice.

Mark Zondlo:
This National Science Foundation project, called Hiaper Pole to Pole Observations, will

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:56.000 position:98%
Mark Zondlo:
give us the most comprehensive picture yet of greenhouse gases and how they affect climate.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:18.000 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
Our journey includes Alaska, the Arctic, Hawaii, the Cook Islands, New Zealand and Antarctica.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.380 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
Why clouds? They can warm the earth, they can cool the earth, but we don't know how they form,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.930
Mark Zondlo:
and water vapor holds the key.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.930 position:98%
Mark Zondlo:
In discussions about global warming, carbon dioxide and methane get all of the attention,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.000 position:88%
Mark Zondlo:
but water vapor impacts climate more than any other gas.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.090 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
We've invented a laser-based sensor that measures water vapor throughout the atmosphere.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.140 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
What's neat about it is that it actually sticks outside the aircraft and allows for real-time,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.300 position:91%
Mark Zondlo:
precise and pristine measurements, and it's plug-and-play.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.300

While we circle the globe, Princeton graduate student Minghui Diao analyzes the data in

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:27.300 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
real time. What we are finding is surprising. Large plumes of water vapor exist in areas

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.209 position:97%
Mark Zondlo:
we never expected to find them. Learning how this fits into the puzzle is crucial for predicting

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:41.209 position:98%
Mark Zondlo:
climate and making smart policy decisions. The atmosphere is perhaps Earth's last frontier.
