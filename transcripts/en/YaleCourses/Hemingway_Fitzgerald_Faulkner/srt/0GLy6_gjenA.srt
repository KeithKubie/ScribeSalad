1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,790
Um, uh, going to, uh, start
by the way, and I know that,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,270
um, Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,500
very much iconic figures
of American literature. Um,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,560
and probably you guys are here,
uh,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,840
because you know something
about those offers already.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,290
So I'm not going to be going over a lot
of material that you guys know already.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,880
Instead of will,
I like to do,

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,150
is to come up with a little bit of a
material that might be somewhat surprising

9
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,880
to you. And, um, I'm going
to be talking about, um, uh,

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,870
free analytics scales are,

11
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,600
this is kind of a critical
paradigm that we'll be using, um,

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,210
throughout the semester,

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,580
which is the use of three analytics
scales to talk about the authors.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,020
So first of all,
this,

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,050
the macro history of the United States
and the world and two techs come to mind

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,280
both Hemingway's for whom the bell
tolls and to have and have not,

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,720
uh, so that's the largest
possible level. Um,

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,490
and then we'll go down a little
bit to the next level, um,

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,000
which is, um, still large. Um,

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,080
but it has to do with narrative
experiments, um, of modernism.

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,100
And the text that we're reading
can all be called moderns text, um,

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,000
in one way or another.
Um,

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
so we'll be looking at the sound of
fury specifically for that register,

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,680
that analytic register of experimentation.
Um,

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,740
and finally we'll be looking at the
smallest possible scale micro level.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,880
Um, and it has to do with sensory did
housing. It's like all three of them, uh,

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,530
are wonderful on sensory details.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,380
But today we'll just be
talking about one tax, uh,

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,440
the great Gatsby and what particular
moment when the registering of the sensory

30
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,650
world is very important.
Um, so let me, um,

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,120
go to, um, Hemingway and, uh,

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,690
talk a little bit about him.
Um,

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,100
in many ways as a kind of
a gateway or a guy, uh,

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,500
to Google vision of American literature.
Um,

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,090
Hemingway was framed much a world
traveler. Um, he, um, you know,

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,200
basically we can get a map of the world
by just looking at his writings. Um,

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,030
but he had this special love of
the Spanish language. Um, so,

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,230
um, for whom the bell tolls will be
reading this in our class, uh, Isabel,

39
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,120
the Spanish civil war.
Uh,

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,860
and Hemingway was there as a
war correspondent. Um, and,

41
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,660
but we can see that he actually got
into combat situations right here. Uh,

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,670
so, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's really
interesting to think about Hemingway.

43
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,920
It's both a journalist
and also, um, uh, uh,

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,920
the novelists. Um, so this the
global dimension of Hemingway,

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,750
but also the global diamonds
in the Spanish civil war
itself. It was a civil war.

46
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,580
It was portraying, um, two
sides fighting in Spain. Um,

47
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,500
but it was also very much an international
war, um, in the sense that, uh,

48
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,480
Russia was a part of it. Germany was
DePaul of it. Italy was positive.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,760
Um, so it very much
was a gathering of, um,

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,390
a lot of nations, uh,
converging on the soil of Spain.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,320
Um,

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,240
and fighting a war that in
name was the Spanish civil war,

53
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,740
but actually in action in terms of
his castle players was very much an

54
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,160
international war. Um, so, um,

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,930
this is one level at which
we can understand Hemingway,

56
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,350
is that he really was a player,
um,

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,270
in a very large scale map of the world.
Um,

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,460
and because he was such a
player on a large scale map, uh,

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,610
we shouldn't be surprised that he will
be going to other countries as well and

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,650
love loving the Spanish language.
Uh, we're taking him to Cuba. Um, so,

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,550
uh, we'll be reading to have and have
not, uh, which is about Cuba. Um,

62
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,360
and this is a very,
um,

63
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,120
unforgettable image of
a Hemingway and Castro.

64
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,280
Uh, we might not know that they
were actually good friends.

65
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,940
Uh, so this is just
something that, you know,

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,940
we should keep in mind as we read
Hemingway. Um, and Hemingway actually, uh,

67
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,380
the, as the war ended in 1939, um,

68
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,970
and from 1939 to 1960,
he actually lived in Cuba.

69
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,770
Um, he wrote a lot of is uh,
important novels there to oh man.

70
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:46,000
And the sea was written when he was
living in Cuba. So, you know, again,

71
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:50,360
a very important fact to bear
in mind. Um, and this is, um,

72
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,350
the interior of his house in Cuba.
Um,

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,720
and I don't know, I'll put all of
this, the PowerPoint on our website,

74
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,100
so you'd be able to see the detail.

75
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,110
But this is a cigar box there was given
to Hemingway, um, and on the cigar,

76
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,350
but the box is as a grant and Mikko
the Cuba great friend of Cuba.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,360
So he, anyway, uh, it isn't,

78
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,160
it right now is not just an American
author, but very much a Cuban, um,

79
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,900
other, um, in Cuba. Um, so, um, we,

80
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:29,510
we won't actually be talking
about Castro's Cuba to
have and have not actually

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,100
took place earlier, but this is just
a kind of a continuing relation, uh,

82
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,720
the Hemingway has to that
country. Um, so, okay.

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,730
So we'll move on now to the
next scale of analysis. Um,

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,140
and this is the narrative
experiment. Um, the very,

85
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,273
um,

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,280
striking a narrative styles that
we see in this body of writing.

87
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,000
Um, and no more so than in
the sound, the fury. Um,

88
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,010
I think that if we've read that novel,

89
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:04,700
we know that it's impossible just to
read it once and understand of it, right?

90
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,410
This is kind of not really compels us
to go back to read several times, um,

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,730
because the level of experimentation,
um, in, in that novel.

92
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,910
So this is from the opening of the sound
of the fury and you guys probably know

93
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,660
that there are four sections
to the sound and the fury. Um,

94
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,360
and the First Section is toe,
uh,

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,980
by Benji who's clinically retarded.

96
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,720
So this is all the action is unfolding,
um,

97
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,400
in the mind of someone who's not
really registering the world. Um,

98
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,610
most of us do.

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,020
So let's just see how Benji
understands the world,

100
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,650
how he takes in the world.
Did you come to meet Kelly?

101
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,500
If she said rubbing my hands,
what is it?

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Whether you're trying to tell Kenny Kelly
smell by trees and like when she says

103
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,390
we were asleep,
whether you're moaning about [inaudible],

104
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,810
you can watch again when
we get to the branch here.

105
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,790
Here's you a Jimson a week he gave
me the flower. Makes no sense,

106
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:12,710
right? Right. Now it doesn't make
any sense. Okay. So I, I'm sorry,

107
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:17,480
but I have to tell you that this is
actually a conflation of two moments in

108
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:22,310
time. The first moment takes place
when Benji was just a young boy.

109
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,120
The second I tell in Italics,
um, takes place when, uh,

110
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,490
Benji is actually 33 years old.
Um,

111
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,720
so we don't usually
tell the story that way,

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,470
jumping across such a vast space of time.
Um,

113
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
but that's exactly the kind of narrative
technique to Faulkner users in the

114
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,460
sound of fury.
Um,

115
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,720
and the numerous advantages and
challenges to that kind of writing.

116
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,680
Um,

117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,680
but one interesting fact that
emerges from this little old moment,

118
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,680
um, is that a young white
girl, Kathy is Benji's sister,

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,040
a young white girl is seen in intimate
power level with a young black boy who's

120
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,530
luster, the black servant
who's taking care of Benji.

121
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,130
So what could be the connection between
a young white girl and a young black

122
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:22,400
boy? It turns out that it really
has everything to do with smell.

123
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,020
Benji love Patty and she
smells like trees for him.

124
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't think the Bangy actually
registers Kenny as a person.

125
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,140
She's really just a smell to
him. Um, and uh, it, you know,

126
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,650
I think that most of us actually
registered people in that way, you know,

127
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,100
taking one very specific aspect of
other people. But I think they're Benji,

128
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,750
especially those that,
um,

129
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,780
so it is caddies smell that means
everything in the world really to Benji.

130
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,770
Um,

131
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,770
and when luster gives him the Jimson with
it is not exactly the smell of catty,

132
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,090
but it's close enough.

133
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,330
So that luster is actually the closest
that Benji can get to in the very sad

134
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,570
times when he is 33,

135
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,990
when he's really lost everything that he
loves in the wall luster and the Jimson

136
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:18,690
weed is the closest they can get back
to caddy. So this is the language,

137
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,050
the way their Faulkner's telling the
story is not based on linear chronology.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,620
It is based on the logic of
association in our minds.

139
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,010
And different people have different
logics of association and Benji's logic of

140
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,480
association is completely based on the
sense of smell bits on Sam as well,

141
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:44,250
but then the smell and the specialist.
So, um, we can tell that, uh,

142
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,780
we can say that in some stance, Hemingway
has taken us to a foreign country,

143
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:52,020
you know, thing that's to
stay in and to Cuba. Um,

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,080
and Fargo has also taken us to a foreign
country in the sense that the mind of a

145
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:02,241
retarded person is the sort of foreign
country to those of us who are not

146
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,260
retarded. And this is a very
interesting kind of foreign country,

147
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,430
um, to go to, um, and to
steep ourselves in. Um,

148
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,260
so finally, um, we'll move on
to the smallest possible scale,

149
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,630
uh, which is, uh, as, as they related to
what we've just seen in thought now. Uh,

150
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,610
but this was an early moment in the
great gas VA. Um, and it is about daisy,

151
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,940
one of the most famous characters
in American literature. Um,

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,830
and this is nick Carraway, the narrator
talking about daisy, his cousin.

153
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,970
Um, so nick is not retarded.
He's highly intelligent,

154
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,470
but um,

155
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,500
his take on daisy is interesting and
that is not necessarily the tech that we

156
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:51,570
would have to our cousins. Think
about how we think about our cousins.

157
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,370
Probably not nothing like this.
So who voice compel me forward?

158
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,410
Breathlessly as I listen.

159
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,130
Then the glow faded each like discerning,

160
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,740
discerning her with lingering regret,

161
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:08,220
like children leaving a
pleasant street at dusk,

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,420
highly idiosyncratic idiosyncrasy of,

163
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,140
of highly intelligent person.

164
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,280
But in many ways as unusual as Benji's my,

165
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,650
so Nate tends to conflate
different senses.

166
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,010
He's talking about the quality of son
of days a but his youth using visual

167
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:34,350
images to talk about
that quality of staff.

168
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,770
So they uses voice failing out is like
children leaving the street at Das is

169
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,850
very interesting visual image to
talk about a certain quality of Sar.

170
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,410
Why does he want to do that? Why does
Fitzgeral want to write in that way?

171
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,590
Why is it that the visual register is
being involved in all to talk about all of

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,270
the [inaudible].

173
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,080
That's one of the questions that we'll
be thinking about as we move on, um,

174
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,460
in our class. So, um,
so far you've noticed,

175
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,660
um,

176
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
that I've associated one scale
of analysis with one author,

177
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,010
right? So Hemingway is associated
with the largest possible scale,

178
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,413
um,

179
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,880
partner with kind of a middle scales
and Fitzgerald with micro level.

180
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,990
Um, it, we could do it that way. Um,

181
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,220
but I don't really want you
to get the impression, um,

182
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,290
that one author is to be associated
only with that one particular scale.

183
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
So in the rest of the lecture,

184
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
what I'd like to do is to talk about
one phenomenon that is across scale

185
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,840
phenomena.

186
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,580
That is something that invites
experience on all three levels,

187
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:56,581
on the largest possible scale on this
mid level and smaller scale as well that

188
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,670
all three offers talk
about to some extent,

189
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,260
maybe they don't talk about it and I kind
of frontal away, uh, but they engage in,

190
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:09,640
in some fashion.
So it's an important event for them.

191
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,620
Um, and it's not surprising that
war should be an important event,

192
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,530
two or three others because the body
of writings that were looking at, um,

193
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,100
really all come right after World War One.

194
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,780
So well one is in some sense the
unspoken horizon ray behind all of his

195
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,330
writings. Um, and, uh,

196
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:33,040
we'll be talking about war today
and talk about war generally,

197
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,930
um, as the most obvious
level, which is large scale,

198
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,150
uh, geopolitics. Um,

199
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,080
and to some extent when you have
action happening on that scale,

200
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,210
there's a kind of a loss
of individual agency, um,

201
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,580
and the narrow to a problem that comes
with that. Um, this also the deep,

202
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,310
the problem, the
deformation of language, um,

203
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,340
the way that worst get used as
euphemisms in and the conditions of war.

204
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,970
Um, and what that does to
language in general. Um,

205
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,450
and then we'll talk about war
as a psyche phenomenon. Um,

206
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,480
combat trauma and the
psychology of homecoming.

207
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,790
All this worth familiar all is,
uh,

208
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,690
just things that happen when we go to war.
Um,

209
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,190
but we'll,
we'll,

210
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,191
one is especially important to think in
terms of those lives because this is in

211
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,760
many ways the first war, uh, that, um,

212
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,730
that that was not only fought on this
scale that was unprecedented, um,

213
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,340
but also different war
strategies were being tried out.

214
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,900
So one of the very important features
of where we're one was trench warfare.

215
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,480
That this is really what we see here.
Um,

216
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,410
people digging themselves
in and staying in those, um,

217
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,600
trenches from months
and years, really. Um,

218
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,540
and to experience has no more
than people firing at you. Um,

219
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,570
and then being sung in month.
Um, Matt is the most important,

220
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,820
um, sensory material the people
actually remember about the war.

221
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,030
Um, well, well one is, uh, was
is also important because, uh,

222
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,440
chemical warfare was introduced.
Um,

223
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,120
and so in this image, um, we see, uh,

224
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,160
Ashley British soldiers who
suffer from poison gas. And we'll,

225
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,050
we'll one,
I'm just looking at these images.

226
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,350
We can see that this is really not a
glorious why there's no other heroic war.

227
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,160
It is a war that is impossible
to romanticize. Uh, you know,

228
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,870
when you are stuck in those conditions,

229
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,620
there's almost no way you can
prove that you are brave person.

230
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,810
Personal bravery doesn't really come
into play under those conditions of war.

231
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,740
So it is a war that is
impossible to feel good about.

232
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,180
No matter how brave you are,

233
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,040
you can get a sense of passion that
comes from that kind of bravery.

234
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,370
Um, and so, um, there are a
number of consequences, uh,

235
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,450
of that, uh, impossibility of filling,

236
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:13,280
heroic in possibility of getting any
kind of emotional satisfaction from

237
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:16,540
fighting. Paul Fussell, who's a very, um,

238
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,120
insightful and important critic wrote
about called the Great War and modern

239
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,260
memory. Um, and I've
kind of a celebrate, uh,

240
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,270
classic on, on one
their Azure. Uh, and he,

241
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,350
this is what he says.
Well,

242
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:38,330
he claims Om the primal
scene is undeniably horrible,

243
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,840
but there's irony is dynamics of host
of bridge is what horns the memory.

244
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,830
I'm saying that there seems to be one
dominating form of modern understanding

245
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,460
that it is essentially ironic that it
originates in the application of mine and

246
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:03,380
memory to events with a great one.
Great Warriors. Whoa, whoa one.

247
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,370
Um,

248
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,370
so Paul also claims that
the war's structures,

249
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,610
human experience,

250
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:15,380
both those who are actually
fighting and civilians back at home,

251
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:20,381
where people who come back to civilian
life as basically an ironic structure

252
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,630
through which we experience the world.
What does that mean?

253
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,460
We'll be looking more to think about
what it means to experience the world

254
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:33,290
through the lens of Rna. Uh, but right
now we can also get a little bit of what,

255
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,520
um, first for me is just
from this one passage. Uh,

256
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,090
it has to do with the
dynamics of hope's a bridge.

257
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,010
What does it mean to live without any
kind of hope for yourself or for the

258
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:50,400
outcome of the war. And sometimes
hope is not even linked to vegetarian,

259
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:54,420
which is a really radical claim that it
doesn't really matter if you're on the

260
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,930
winning side. That doesn't
really give you grounds for hope.

261
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,160
Why would that be the case? Um, and uh,

262
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,250
and that, and the other claim
that foster was making, um,

263
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,010
is that RNA is basically a
mental structure, the structures,

264
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,720
our memory as well.

265
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,800
It's not just our immediate reaction to
wall when you're going through it that

266
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,650
you can make ironic comments
about things that are happening.

267
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,030
But when you think about it, when you
bring it back to your mind afterwards,

268
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,360
that RNA is the structure by which you
recall something and lift that event over

269
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:30,661
again.

270
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:35,340
What does it mean to have an ironic
recall in relation to your own experience?

271
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,680
Um, so let's look at
Paul fussell's claim, um,

272
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,710
through the three authors who have written
a fairly memorable things about those

273
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,850
phenomena out.

274
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,330
And I'm very glad to be able to talk
a little bit about farewell to arms.

275
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,870
We're not reading farewell
to arms in this class. Um,

276
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,010
some of you might have read it on your
own, but this is a celebrated moment,

277
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,720
um, in farewell to arms, um,

278
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,740
talking about the effect
of war on language and how
it makes it impossible for

279
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,760
us to use certain words.
I was always,

280
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:16,320
this is the protagonist Fredrick Henry.
I was always embarrassed by the worst,

281
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,183
sacred,

282
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,630
glorious and sacrifice and
the expression in vain.

283
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,490
We had heard them sometimes standing
in the rain almost out of earshot.

284
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,631
So the only,

285
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:32,631
the shower it worse came through and
had read them on proclamations now for a

286
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:33,564
long time.

287
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,020
And I had seen nothing sacred and the
things that were glorious had no glory and

288
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:45,111
the sacrifices were like stop loss as
Chicago if nothing was done with the meat

289
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,930
except to Barry, yet abstract
was or just glory, honor,

290
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,170
courage or hello work have seen beside
the concrete needs of villagers,

291
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,440
the number of regimens and a days is
as Hemingway writing in their world to

292
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:09,240
arms. But in some sense, this
really disrupts the whole
pan in way that we know,

293
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,090
right? The importance of days,
the importance of places, um,

294
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,680
the importance of numbers.
Um,

295
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,440
this is alive long habit for him in where,

296
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,830
and here we can sometimes see the origins
of that way of writing the fairy queen

297
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,800
very economical,

298
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:32,560
very not really kind of writing,
um,

299
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,670
in is in some sense a response to the
circumstances of war is almost as if warm

300
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,210
makes it impossible to do
a romantic kind of writing.

301
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,510
And Hemingway's writing is the kind
of the counterpoint to a flowery,

302
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,980
uh, to heroic, to
romantic kind of writing.

303
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,230
So on the level of use of was,
so it was just becoming impossible to use.

304
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,490
But I think that, um, irony also
extends to a larger scale, uh,

305
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
which has to do really with
the way we tell a story,

306
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,370
whether or not we can tell the
story in a straightforward fashion.

307
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,870
And Paul offers or suggest,
and I like to test this with Hemingway,

308
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,740
is whether or not after World War One,

309
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,990
it is still possible to tell
story in a completely linear,

310
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,240
straight forward fashion.
Um,

311
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,270
is there something about war that makes
it almost necessary in order to tell the

312
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:36,790
story from the side tower
in a truncated version,

313
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,350
tell it in a jumbled version
as we've seen in Bangi, um,

314
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,020
or tell it in some way that is mixed up,
you know,

315
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,670
all those things that we recognize
knowledge, all three authors,

316
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,550
maybe it has to do with what. So right
now I've sort of just outlined, you know,

317
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,300
some things to look for as
we're reading this office.

318
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,740
One is the twisted logic
of events, um, and um,

319
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,080
that things are just not working out,

320
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,430
not landing where we will
expect them to land. Um,

321
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,980
the possibility of symmetry of blame,

322
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:13,030
which seems the logical consequence
when we have no heroes. Um,

323
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,000
and our focus retelling of the past,

324
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,300
not looking at the events frontally
but looking at Lurie fashion.

325
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,200
Um, and then there could be
some point in being blurred.

326
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,360
Usually being very is not
a narrative advantage,

327
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,090
but it could be that
under some circumstances,

328
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,480
learners is actually a cultivated
effect and is designed to do something,

329
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,030
you know, so the work that has
been done by being the lyric, um,

330
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,710
understanding as we know something about
ray, how many ways is famous for that,

331
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,620
I'm just being totally,
um,

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,700
giving us the minimal expression,
um, understand the emotions, um,

333
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,940
and then the possibility of
content until we've outcome.

334
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,820
So this is just a kind of schematic way
of laying out some of the things that

335
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:02,050
we're looking for. Um, that
will test once again, um,

336
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,890
by looking at specific
passages. Uh, so you know,

337
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:08,380
I just said that Hemingway Fitzgerald,

338
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,380
Faulkner or engage well
or one in some fashion,

339
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:15,410
but I should qualify that by saying
that the engagement is sometimes quite

340
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,510
oblique. So Hemingway actually
fought in world war one.

341
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,560
He was an ambulance
driver. Um, and so he did,

342
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,280
he was actually in the war.
Um,

343
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,390
but he got one that very quickly, he got
wounded after a few months. He was oh,

344
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,840
of commissions and the rest of the ward.

345
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,790
So he didn't actually experience
one on one in any of the way.

346
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,650
Um, and even though he, he talks
about, well one and farewell to arms,

347
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,820
really his deepest experience of war
is a war that came a little later,

348
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,380
which is the Greco, the Turkish
war of a horrendous event. Um,

349
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,410
I think it's safe to say that there
really is there no good guys and that in

350
00:23:56,631 --> 00:24:00,980
that war, both the toast and
agrees with equally reprehensible.

351
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,140
Um, this is an image of the
burning or smirk now, um,

352
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,240
1922 and the first story that we'll be
reading in our time is on the CI as well.

353
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,770
So this is the background
to that Hemingway story. Um,

354
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,500
and I'll be reading you,
um,

355
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,070
two passages by Hemingway to think
about what irony means for Hemingway.

356
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,491
Uh,
for us,

357
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:31,491
what this is an image of the leader on
the Turkish side and he's actually our to

358
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:35,390
Turk is actually the founder of
Turkey of present day Turkey.

359
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,970
So a very important historic figure
that also actually figures in Hanaway's

360
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,270
account of that war. Um, so this is, um,

361
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,720
having way this passage is having weight.

362
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
Once again going to cover the Greco
Turkish war as a war correspondent,

363
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,990
he was writing for the Toronto
Star. Um, and this is the, uh,

364
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,250
news article that he
sent to the Toronto Star.

365
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,280
It is oil to come out [inaudible] and
company one Mesopotamia for and it is oil

366
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,740
that Great Britain was to keep
my circle 10 the authority.

367
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,210
So the ears that is disappointed and
canal a salad because he shows no

368
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:24,761
indication to plunge into the fanatical
holy war me yet get the warrant from

369
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,270
Kamala, the businessmen. Okay.

370
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
So there's actually has a kind of
current residents as well oil your is um,

371
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,960
and um, was frustrating about Ataturk, um,

372
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,860
to um, this, the, the religious side,

373
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:50,090
it's not an exam is that he turns
out not to be your fanatic at all.

374
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
He's totally cool and completely
deliberate and deliberative in his mouth.

375
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:57,460
It's not going to plug it into any hand.

376
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Why is water so you're not going to get
someone fighting as fanatical religious

377
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:06,940
war. War is not going to happen
because of religious fanaticism.

378
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,970
What is going to happen because of the
economic rationale as he coming from the

379
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:19,931
importance was that is really the irony
that Hemingway as a war correspondent is

380
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,650
pointing to is there some,
was a highly rational,

381
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,560
we can't really say that it's irrational.

382
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:31,850
While we can really say that the war is
bad because it's irrational because some

383
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:36,380
was a highly rational,
and this is supremely ironical.

384
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,380
Hemingway is non approval war.
All he's saying is that this,

385
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:43,250
this award and it's driven
by economic rationality.

386
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,420
So this is one side of RNA is
that things are not lining up.

387
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,200
The good guys don't look like good
guys and the bad guys or bad guys,

388
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:56,460
not because they look like the bad guy
that we would expect them with expect bad

389
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,260
guys to look like. So it's just, and
it happens. A largest possible scale.

390
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:06,170
It's really the global geopolitics of
war that's creating this monster that is

391
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,070
Arthur too, but who was also a
model of economic rationality.

392
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,840
Um, so the other, um,

393
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,050
I've bit of irony of voice actually what
we'll be reading is the first story in,

394
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,550
in our time on the key. A smirk. No. Uh,

395
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,610
and this is the concluding
paragraph of that story.

396
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,140
The Greeks were Nice
chaps to the losing side.

397
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,890
The Greeks were nice chaps
to when they evacuated,

398
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,640
they had all the baggage animals
they couldn't take off with them.

399
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,330
So they just broke the four legs and
dump them into the shallow water.

400
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,220
All those muse,

401
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,670
the four legs broken push
over into the shallow water.

402
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,710
It was all pleasant business. My
work. Yes, the most pleasant business.

403
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,840
So,

404
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,840
so much for the brutality of the Turks
and so much for the victim hood of 10

405
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,423
weeks.

406
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:09,810
Fixing Hood is something that actually
extend from those who experience it into

407
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,930
a condition they can.
They then then confer on other people.

408
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,670
There's no glory.

409
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,730
There's no moral advantage to being a
victim in the war because the victims of

410
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,120
justice reprehensible as vectors.
So this was really,

411
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,420
I think that what Paul
means by saying that,

412
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,780
that this really an abridgment of hole
in a wall like this is that we can't

413
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,490
really go and fight for the weeks,
you know,

414
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,290
because they are the victims
of the Turkish aggressive.

415
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,710
We can't really say that because the
Greeks are aggressive to the aggressors on

416
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:51,590
their own muse, on their own, um,
animals or transportation. Um, so it's,

417
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
it is,
um,

418
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,540
a world in which that is in some sense
that has been emptied or moral meaning

419
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,270
empty, the moral virtue. Um,

420
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,980
and to the extent that that makes
it impossible to take size with NSL

421
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,700
satisfaction is very,
very desolate landscape,

422
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,430
emotional as well as moral landscape.

423
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,910
So this is really what irony means for
Hemingway is that it is an impossible

424
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,640
place to inhabit.

425
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,010
It is unbearable to
talk about it directly.

426
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,530
It was straightforward way.
And the only way you can talk about it,

427
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,760
it's being ironic and using, talking
about it in a particular tone of voice.

428
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,030
So very important component of RNA is
to tone of voice that says our census.

429
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm pulling this,
we'll use our ears to,

430
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,290
to Hemingway as we read
these words on the page. Um,

431
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,630
so let's move on now,
um,

432
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,090
to Fitzgerald and the Great
Gatsby Fitzgerald, um,

433
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,920
Ashley, um, did not have,
um, a very extensive, um,

434
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,320
experience of world war one
either. He actually, um, and he,

435
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,200
he enlisted but he didn't actually
get to fight in world war one.

436
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,510
So this is a really interesting,
um,

437
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,680
reaction of someone who
wants to talk about the war,

438
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,080
as in some sense the central event
of his generation. Um, but we,

439
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:18,330
we didn't actually have a kind
of a personal acquaintance, uh,

440
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,300
without central event. So this is
from the great Gatsby theme. Um,

441
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,950
and uh, is, uh, at this point, uh,

442
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,940
we haven't been introduced to Gaspe right,

443
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:31,210
because you guys know that nick Carraway
is the one who's been telling the story

444
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,990
for good part of the time
as the great Gatsby begins,

445
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,040
and he's just meeting this fellow,
um,

446
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,620
that he's making conversation
with your face is familiar.

447
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,840
He said politely once you in the
first division in a war while yes,

448
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,240
I was in a 28 infantry.

449
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,910
I was in the 16th until
June, 1918. I knew,

450
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:59,911
I've seen you somewhere before we talk
for a moment about some wet gray little

451
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:04,060
villages in France. Okay. I can tell you,

452
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,840
we can go to the gas and see that
this is taken from the great Gatsby,

453
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,410
but it could have been written
by Hemingway. Right, exactly.

454
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,720
All those points that he makes,

455
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,790
if they were to arms about important
of the number of your division dates,

456
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,180
places Fitzgerald rise
exactly as Hemingway.

457
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,340
So has people would write under conditions
because those are the only details

458
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,840
completely on the emotional,

459
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,370
factual play numbers
playing geographical facts.

460
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Those are the only things you can bear
to name because to name anything else is

461
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:48,130
in some sense an insult
to your own experience.

462
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,670
And in South Sioux English language.
Um,

463
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,490
so I don't think that,
you know,

464
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,830
most of us actually talk thing
about the great Gatsby, um,

465
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,240
as a war novel and it is
not. So don't, you know,

466
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:05,720
don't think that I'm trying to create a
reading of the great Gatsby based on the

467
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:10,390
importance of over one note,
uh, is a one that one novel. Um,

468
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,520
but it is difficult that this person,

469
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,950
that nick is talking to
his gas Gatsby of course,

470
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,210
and that they do have
world war one in common,

471
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:23,980
that they both actually were
combat soldiers in World War One.

472
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,180
Um, and that's part of the
bond between Nate and gas pain,

473
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,980
what it means for that to be beginning of
a relationship between the two of them.

474
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,290
Um, so in that sense, the great
Gatsby is shadow by Whoa, whoa one.

475
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:43,291
And we can think of various ways in which
one or the phenomenon of war functions

476
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,350
as a shadow and unspoken, barely
alluded to, but nonetheless,

477
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,150
not inconsequential,

478
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,890
not trivial event that we
should bear in mind this week.

479
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,790
Read on about Gatsby and the bottle neck.
Um,

480
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,220
so one other,
um,

481
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,110
finally shouldn't be surprised that
we'll be moving on to Faulkner.

482
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,420
Um,
and I should

483
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,820
tell you something about
Faulkner, which is, um,

484
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,490
really vary on the heroic. I
mean, we've been talking about,

485
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,790
one is a very unheroic out war, but, um,

486
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,300
foreigners own conduct.
Um,

487
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,750
it's especially on heroic father actually
went to Canada in 1918 to list in the

488
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,860
Royal Air Force. Um, so he
enlisted, never saw action.

489
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,390
Um, his brother actually was
seriously wounded in world war one.

490
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,600
Um,
but for the rest of his life,

491
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,410
farming actually claim that he fought.

492
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,450
He fought in world war one.

493
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,820
There's not something that he claimed
for awhile, you know, not like 19,

494
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:57,130
19 or 19,

495
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,140
2019 for these three is still claiming
to his nephew that he was in action in,

496
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,370
well, we'll want me, this is kind
of a shocking fact about Vulcan.

497
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,780
I don't know what to do with that except
that this just bear in his biography.

498
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,940
So, uh, Faulkner writes to his
nephew, Jimmy Faulkner. Um,

499
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,800
I would have liked for you to have
had my dog tag Royal Air Force,

500
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,330
but I lost it in Europe, in Germany.
I think that the Gestapo has it.

501
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,510
I'm very likely on the records right now.

502
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,550
It's a dead brother's flying officer spy.
So,

503
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:37,220
um, well, I mean, you know, it's, um,

504
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,860
that's just a fact and we can
do what we want with that. Um,

505
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,840
Faulkner did write a novel,
um, Carl, um, soldiers, uh,

506
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,040
home. Uh, it, um, I'll,

507
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,820
I'll give you the reference. His,
his, his, his fits first novel. Um,

508
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,790
it's actually about a veteran coming
back. Um, so I will put that on,

509
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,260
on the, on, on the website. Um,

510
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,540
so he actually does write about
what we're one, uh, but, um, he,

511
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,130
for, for the most part, he's not known
as someone who writes about whoa one. Um,

512
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,770
and instead, um, he actually, uh,

513
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,800
we can say that there are
shadows of a war in of Whoa,

514
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:24,770
one in ice writings about
the American civil war,

515
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:29,630
which is obviously what is
appropriate to partner to write about.

516
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,230
Um,

517
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,790
and he's not making anything up when he's
writing about the American civil war.

518
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,540
But what is interesting about Faulkner's
writing about the American civil war is

519
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,700
that after three orders,

520
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,330
war is actually only five minutes.

521
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,721
Ashley,

522
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:53,400
the only order that gives us
who gives us a huge growing,

523
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,080
idealistic,

524
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,220
possibly romantic image of
someone who did not fight in Whoa,

525
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:02,251
whoa.

526
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:07,251
One can actually give us
a utopian account of war.

527
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,100
I think that is interesting that
Hemingway would not be capable of writing

528
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,210
anything like this.

529
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,500
Even about the civil war though he's
idealistic by the civil war as well.

530
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,940
Um,

531
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,330
partner is the only person because of
his complicated relation to all one there

532
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,060
for him.

533
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,060
The civil war is actually
in the affirmative moment
in a kind of twisted counter

534
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:37,200
intuitive when, so this is a
novel. Um, W won't be reading,

535
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,160
but it's a great novel.

536
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:43,161
So I encourage you to read this on your
own if you have a chance after this

537
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:46,230
class. Um, but it's, it's um, is about,

538
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,540
is really about the civil wars,

539
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,370
the background to the novel or in the
sense that it doesn't really appear in it.

540
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,480
Um, but a good part of it, um,

541
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,120
some of it is about the women left behind.
Um,

542
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,290
and I'll just read you this moment
and then we can talk about it. Now.

543
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,080
There's two white women and a negress,

544
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,720
not as three Negros are three
wise now even it's three women,

545
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,410
but merely as three creatures who still
possessed in need to eat but took no

546
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,990
pleasure in it,

547
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,170
the need to sleep but from no
joy in awareness or regeneration.

548
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,310
We grew intended and
harvested with our own hands,

549
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:34,610
the food we ate made and work that garden
just as we cope and ate the food which

550
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:40,821
came out of it with no distinction
amount of three of us of age or color.

551
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,810
It was as though we were
one being interchangeable.

552
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,990
And in this remanent um,

553
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,850
we already have seen in the sound
of the fury that for the races to be

554
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:58,851
interchangeable and in this women in
between Kelly and luster is a good thing

555
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,210
for far right.
And for here,

556
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,790
the civil war is what enables that
breakdown of racial distinction to take

557
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:10,890
phase.

558
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,810
Usually interchangeable is
not really a good quality.

559
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,030
Um, for, for us it's an insult
to our individuality. Um,

560
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
but here it is under the circumstances
of their probation when all you can do is

561
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:33,440
just to keep your body flows,
just to make sure that um,

562
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,890
you can put something into your,

563
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,470
when that is the basic condition of life
and when everyone has to work towards

564
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,180
the fulfillment of that condition,
um,

565
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,650
then raise really doesn't
matter. So this is a really, um,

566
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,280
for Faulkner really emblematic moment.
Um,

567
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,040
when wise as well as blacks
have to work just as hard.

568
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,900
That labor is just a given for the
mysteries as for the slaves. Um,

569
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,510
and when there's just
complete commingling of lives,

570
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,610
um, in, in, in, in, in every
aspect of daily life. Um,

571
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,670
for Faulkner that is one of the
consequences of the civil war is that even

572
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:22,960
though there is a battle going
on, um, and deadly consequences,

573
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,970
the battle, um, that are
dividing the nation in one sense,

574
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,820
you know,
nothing can be more divisive than still,

575
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,870
even though the nation is
being torn apart by war.

576
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,040
The real is strange kind of healing,

577
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,200
a strange kind of unity.

578
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,530
This coming from that division,

579
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,970
which is the very local,
very personal,

580
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,510
everyday unity between those who are
left behind to 10 for themselves and the

581
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:59,650
necessity of acting as one.
So it's three people,

582
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,710
blacks and whites acting as one
and war as the necessary condition.

583
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:10,401
It's really the genetic ground for that
kind of configuration of three people

584
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,920
acting as if they were of one
mind and one body. It is a soup,

585
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:18,940
keenly Utopian vision for war.
Um,

586
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,770
and ironically both for good and new
[inaudible] Faulkner who never fought in

587
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,860
world war one who is capable
of imagining that Utopian, um,

588
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,650
a possibility. So, you know,

589
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:34,030
I would say that that this is a kind
of RNA that Paul Fussell wasn't really

590
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,530
thinking about reflux for him. Irony
basically as a kind of a negative anomaly.

591
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,640
But I would argue that we can actually
also expand poff Aso's those inside to

592
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,730
say that the irony of war is such that
one of the counter intuitive outcomes

593
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,640
will actually include an
affirmative understanding of war.

594
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:00,080
Um, and actually we see this all the
time. The bond amount, comrades, he will,

595
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,110
you know, gis bonding. That's just
a phenomenon that we know about.

596
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:10,120
Um, and we're following is really talking
about in some sense is the similar bond

597
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,080
amount, the women, um,

598
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,130
similar Paolo to this kind of important
emotional and social bond under

599
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,920
conditions of great divisiveness of all,

600
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:25,210
which is to show that there's
actually no good resting clothes. Um,

601
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,710
and this is really what I was saying about
all three of others is that, you know,

602
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:34,711
I think that all of us want to
bring to rest at some point and,

603
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,330
you know, they do come to
rest in our own minds. Um,

604
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,530
but I think that it's always
possible to give yet another twist to

605
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:44,010
interpretation,
uh,

606
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,230
while it's going on and the range of
possibilities that emerge from any one

607
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,550
event.
Um,

608
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,380
so this really was wonderful and
challenging about those authors.

609
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,370
Is that something that seems to come
to an end one level, Ashley? You know,

610
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,460
if we just look at the largest
hospital level in a divisiveness, um,

611
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,270
on the level of Oomph, geopolitics, uh,

612
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,080
it turns out that this actually unify
and level on a much smaller scale. Right?

613
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,530
So what is, was themes a tragedy? Um,

614
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,530
on one level can turn into a kind
of a comedy of those straight,

615
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,440
straightforward along the
either the comedy in the
sense that allowing some hope

616
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:25,200
to emerge. So I would have
met Paul Fussell's, uh,

617
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,900
argument about their brichman
of hope in some way as well.

618
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:32,780
Is that yes,
there is an abridgment of hope,

619
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,350
but there's also the possible
reconstitution of hope,

620
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:42,320
um, and what we're seeing in absolutely.
Absolutely. Yes, in some sense,

621
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,390
the reconstitution of hope. So
I'm good. Stop right here. Um,

622
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,050
and once again,
um,

623
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,890
those of you who didn't
get to came in late,

624
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,660
let me just say that I'll be talking a
little bit about writing in this class.

625
00:42:56,661 --> 00:43:01,661
This class fulfills the railing and
requirement and also as all of you to sign

626
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:06,070
both the signup sheet and also
put down on the index cards, uh,

627
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,550
your preferences for sections.
