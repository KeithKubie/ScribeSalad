00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.330
Everyone’s got a cell phone, compact fluorescent
lights are the norm, and we cook our dinners

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.279
in the microwave every night.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.330
Or at least I do.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:15.240
Could all these electromagnetic waves whipping
around be harmful?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.030
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.539
A recent article by Ed Cumming in the Guardian
describes a tiny hamlet in West Virginia with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.000
an array of massive radio telescopes looming
over it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.589
Telescopes like this are extremely sensitive;
this year in Australia what was originally

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.500
thought to be a major breakthrough in the
search for life was actually just bursts of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.250
radiation emitted when someone was opening
the microwave in the break room before the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.270
timer went off.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.230
So in order to pick up radio waves from the
edges of the universe clearly, the town has

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.390
to be an electromagnetic dead zone.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.640
That means no cell signals or radio, and if
you have wifi in your home, occasionally some

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.440
nice men and women from the telescope will
come ‘round and ask you to turn it off.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.770
While this sounds like my own personal version
of hell, to others it’s a safe haven.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
Not from the barrage of facebook and twitter,
which I totally get and by the way you can

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.740
follow me @JHug00, but from the electromagnetic
waves themselves.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.830
Diane Schou is one of the people seeking peace
in Green Bank because she claims she’s electrosensitive.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.510
Schou says she moved there after she started
getting severe headaches, blurred vision,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.680
and skin rashes.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
She describes her symptoms as radiation sickness
and attributed it to a US Cellular tower by

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.120
her home, but she’s also sensitive to fluorescent
lights and electric fences.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.620
She’s not alone either, and since she moved
to Green Bank, 40 other electrosensitive people

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.620
have joined her.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.950
But is it real?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.360
Can the invisible little waves that constantly
surround us have an effect on our bodies?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.750
Science says probs not.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.680
First consider Schou’s own account.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.040
She says she was sensitive only to US Cellular
towers, and specifically said she didn’t

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.490
react to AT&amp;T.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.110
The problem with that is US Cellular uses
frequencies around 850 MHz and 1900 MHz, and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.350
so does AT&amp;T, so right away her claim is looking
suspect.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.119
She also likens her symptoms to radiation
sickness but there’s a problem there too.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.270
Just because “electromagnetic radiation”
has the word radiation in it, doesn’t mean

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.710
it’s going to cause radiation sickness.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.489
Radio and microwaves have less energy than
visible light, and substantially less energy

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.220
than x-rays or gamma rays.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.439
These higher energy waves, along with particles
emitted from from nuclear radiation, can damage

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.450
tissue and cause radiation sickness by stripping
electrons off atoms.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.530
Microwaves?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.530
Not so much.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.989
Most people who report electromagnetic sensitivity
also have a wide and varying range of symptoms,

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.650
which makes their case harder to substantiate.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.590
There’s also the fact that Schou says she’s
sensitive to fluorescent lights.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.060
Fluorescents do emit more UVB radiation than
incandescents but UV radiation is at wavelengths

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.279
that are orders of magnitude smaller than
radio or microwaves.

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.900
They’re on the other side of the spectrum
as visible light.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.499
So why isn’t visible light also irritating?

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.169
Plus the falloff of radiation from compact
fluorescent lights, or CFLs, is so steep that

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.489
at just 4 feet away it’s equivalent to background
radiation.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.040
CFLs are different than incandescents because
they flicker, and you might guess the flickering

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.540
from fluorescent lights is giving Schou headaches.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.540
But that’s unlikely because modern fluorescent
bulbs flicker at 10,000 to 40,000 cycles per

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.129
second, and that is way too fast for the human
eye to see.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.319
Studies have looked into the claim of Electrosensitivity
too, and they haven’t turned up any concrete

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.650
evidence it’s a thing either.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.999
A double blind study from 2006 observed 60
self-reported sensitive people as well as

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.150
60 non-sensitive control participants.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.010
They were exposed to a 900 MHz pulsing signal,
a non-pulsing signal, and a condition with

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.150
no signal present.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.249
The sensitive subjects reported symptoms when
a signal was present 60% of the time.

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.889
They reported symptoms when a signal wasn’t
present 63% of the time.

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:36.889
Soooo…

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.249
Doesn’t seem like they can really tell.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.569
That’s not to say the symptoms aren’t
real.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.290
But the cause is probably not electromagnetic
frequencies, it’s the belief that it’s

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.489
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.290
It could be another case of the placebo effect’s
evil twin, the nocebo effect.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.930
So despite the abundance of invisible waves
carrying phone calls and dirty snapchats past

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.370
you in the air, it looks like you’re going
to be A-OK, so long as you think you’re

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.370
going to be OK.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.609
If you’re not terrified of radiation, good
news, you can also use it to wirelessly charge

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.609
your phone.

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.909
Yay less wires and more radiation!

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:36.820
Trace explains how it work here.
