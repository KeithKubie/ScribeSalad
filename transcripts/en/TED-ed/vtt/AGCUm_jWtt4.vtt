00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.163
As you can imagine, 400 years ago,

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:21.997
navigating the open ocean was difficult.

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:25.713
The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course,

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.514
and so sailors based their directions on the port they left,

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:35.080
attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.380
This process was known as dead reckoning,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.665
because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.780
This was an easy mistake to make.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.497
Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible:

00:00:53.497 --> 00:01:00.863
sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily.

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:08.414
All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land.

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:11.365
John Bird, an instrument maker in London,

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:16.830
made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.230
called a sextant.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.230
Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.947
Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship.

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:33.515
Clocks came next.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:38.497
In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter,

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:41.980
built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.480
The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.796
was necessary in order to know the time back in England.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.880
There was one catch though:

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.714
since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive.

00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:05.380
So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.848
The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours.

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:17.713
But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position.

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:24.163
Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece.

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:32.947
John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device.

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:41.430
Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.432
Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed,

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:49.130
and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.080
This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.547
Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London,

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:07.614
read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier.

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:11.065
Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:18.413
and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler.

00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:23.231
They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.431
would greatly simplify everyday calculations.

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:30.797
Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms.

00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:35.098
Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century,

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:44.017
any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers

00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:46.730
were done using logarithms.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.181
The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math.

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:54.380
There were many players responsible for successful navigation.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.913
Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians,

00:03:57.913 --> 00:03:59.981
and of course sailors.

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.098
Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work,

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:08.563
it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too.
