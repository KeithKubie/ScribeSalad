00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.930
Hi, I'm Bethany, a
designer at Google.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.420
These days, UI designers need
to be thinking about phones,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.330
tablets, laptops, TVs,
smartwatches, and beyond.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.630
It can be daunting.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.480
So for the past few
years, Google designers

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.310
have been working on
making cross-platform

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.400
and multi-screen design easier.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.660
We wanted to build a design
system that felt at home

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.920
on every screen, from
the smallest watch

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.430
to the largest TV.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.870
From the beginning,
we also wanted

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.230
to help third-party apps
express their functionality

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.280
and branding in
a consistent way.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.990
The result is what we
call material design.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.180
The material aesthetic
tackles the timely subjects

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.600
of realism and minimalism,
distilling and blending

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.940
the best of both.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030
Surfaces and shadows
provide visual cues

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.370
grounded in our
experience of reality.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.550
Meaningful motion gives
context to scene changes

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.220
and encourages simple
gesture navigation.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.740
And in material design,
the contents of surfaces

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.480
adopt a print-like aesthetic.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.600
Refined typography, geometric
iconography, bold color,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.800
and rich imagery lead to
a simple beautiful look.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.490
But this is just the first step.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.780
We recognize that design
is never finished.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.170
Design systems should be
consistent and coherent,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.680
but not static.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.020
We look forward to seeing how
designers around the world

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.728
evolve material design with us.

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:12.254
