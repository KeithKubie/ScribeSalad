00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.810
If you're new to Google
Cloud Platform, you might

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.060
be wondering, what
are the best resources

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.720
I should know about to
help me get started?

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.170
There's a lot out there
and sometimes it's

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.550
difficult to know
where to begin.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.140
So today I'm going to take
you on a lightning quick tour.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.980
Google recently
launched a new course

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.050
in collaboration
with Udacity to help

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.910
you learn the components
that make up App Engine.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.820
There's lots of video
content in the course

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.860
as well as practical
hands-on coding

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.010
exercises and an
integrated discussion forum

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.850
so you can learn as part
of a growing community.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.160
Every year Google holds
Google I/O in San Francisco

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.770
and this year's I/O included
some awesome code labs

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.770
that anyone can
follow, including

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.660
two labs for Google
Cloud Platform

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.960
to help you get Google
Compute Engine and App Engine.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.170
Actually, I/O has
lots more resources

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.200
to help you learn about
using Google technologies

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.010
and most of the tours
are available for you

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.870
to watch online.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.140
Google has organized collections
of these tours by product

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.090
and you can find
lots of index talks

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.220
on services like Big
Query or Compute Engine.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.500
Once you start working
on your own projects,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.640
there's a bunch of useful
tools that can really

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.260
help with understanding all of
the various API and parameters

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.380
that are available.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.670
My favorite of these is
the powerful API Explorer

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.350
which allows you to list,
interact, and experiment

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
with all of the available
APIs in your browser.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.050
One of the trickiest aspects
of working with most APIs is

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.740
the use of OAuth and Google has
put together another Playground

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.970
specifically aimed
at helping debug

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.740
the sometimes
complex issues that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.020
can arise around this protocol.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.330
Finally, there's also a third
Playground designed especially

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.750
for Google Cloud Platform
that provides you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.380
with a place to
experiment and get

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.480
to know the various
services from the comfort

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.610
of your browser without having
to install or modify anything

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.256
on your machine.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.380
When you feel a bit more
confident with the various

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.120
services, I highly recommend
you check out the detailed

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.470
documentation on
cloud.google.com/docs.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.000
You can find articles and
tutorials on everything

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.430
from mobile apps, big data,
gaming solutions and much more.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.590
You'll also find links
to lots of sample code

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.740
on GitHub hosted under the
Google Cloud Platform account.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.220
Actually, there are quite
a lot of these repositories

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.980
on GitHub, so Google
built an easy to use

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.950
front end that makes
finding that sample

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.210
code you're looking
for a breeze.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.860
You could search by technology,
programming language,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.200
or solution.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.520
Sooner or later you're going
to run into a problem or issue

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.360
that you'd like some help with.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.871
It might be a bugging or code,
a performance issue, or maybe

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:37.120
you just need some help
understanding that new feature

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210
everyone is raving about.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.070
For more technical
questions where

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.079
you want to share
some of your code,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.370
I recommend heading over to
Stack Overflow where you'll

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.370
find lots of experienced
developers and Google engineers

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.030
contributing help.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.610
Just use these tags to find
the most relevant answers

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.600
to your questions.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.670
For more general advice about
which design patent or library

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
to use, check out the official
Google Cloud Platform community

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.090
on Google+.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.980
I often find that new developers
can find the product life

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.950
cycle takes a little
time to get used to.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.270
The Google Cloud Platform
product life cycle

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.150
consists of a series of stages.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.590
Early on in the development
of new products and features,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250
Google might offer
an alpha release.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.890
At this point,
developers can ask

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.590
for one of their
apps or projects

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.606
to be white listed to
try out the new feature.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:28.230
For alpha, Google often
signs up developers

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.910
to a dedicated
Google group where

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.830
they can ask questions, make
suggestions, and raise issues.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.370
Further into the product
development life cycle,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.620
Google usually
offers a beta stage

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.280
where anyone can use
the new features.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.020
At this stage, you won't find
a service level agreement,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.020
or SLA, and you
should expect to see

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.900
some open outstanding issues.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.480
Next, comes general
availability,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.950
where developers can expect
full support, documentation,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.990
and an SLA.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.996
Eventually, some services
need to be retired

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.620
and these periods
are typically covered

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.660
by something called
a deprecation policy.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.370
During this period,
you should plan

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.970
to migrate those features
or aspects of your code

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.110
that will be affected
by the deprecation

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.040
before the end of the period.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.320
The best place to keep up
to date with the latest

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.970
announcements and news
around Google Cloud Platform,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.990
including upcoming events, new
features, and deprecations,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.860
is the official blog.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.040
You can also sign up
to a monthly newsletter

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.200
to have the latest news
sent right to your inbox.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.375
Finally, there are a couple
of great annual events

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.640
to look out for.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.730
Every year, many of
the Google Developer

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.930
Groups, or GDGs,
around the world

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.480
host community-run
DevFests that include

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.440
talks, code labs,
and hackathons.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.180
You'll find many Googlers
and Google Developer Experts

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.830
taking part in these
events and it's a great way

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.130
to get to know your local
developer community.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.400
Many GDGs also host
events to celebrate

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.580
Google I/O in their
local communities

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.350
with live viewing parties,
speaking sessions and product

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.500
demos.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.930
You can learn more
about these at

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.130
developers.google.com/events.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.370
So remember, the
community is made

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.520
possible through
the participation

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.710
of awesome developers
just like you.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.610
I highly recommend checking
out your local Google Developer

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.730
Group to see how you can
contribute and have fun.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.630
You can also take part by
helping other developers online

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.800
using any of the ways
I've described above.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.200
I can't wait to meet
you online or in person

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.070
and hear what you're building
on Google Cloud Platform.
