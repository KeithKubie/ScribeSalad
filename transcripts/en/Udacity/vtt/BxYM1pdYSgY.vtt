00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Gravitational potential energy--well, the energy that's somehow stored in gravity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, what do I mean by that--well, we talked earlier about lifting a bucket of mass m

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
up to a distance--let's call it h for height.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, last time we actually assigned some values to m and to h and of course,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we used g the acceleration to gravity to calculate this work that we had to do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This time we're going to leave our answer in terms of variables and so what I want to know

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is how much work do you do and that's you--not how much work does gravity do

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and not how much is the total work--how much do you do when

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you lift an object of mass m by a distance of h.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I've given you four options. Try and choose the best one.
