confusing data into something which is
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.740
confusing data into something which is
less confusing and more structured so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
less confusing and more structured so
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.689
less confusing and more structured so
what happens is you basically tell the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
what happens is you basically tell the
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370
what happens is you basically tell the
machine i'm going to give you all this

you what the input should look like
post-processing on this side so you kind

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
post-processing on this side so you kind
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.269
post-processing on this side so you kind
of give it the hint and what it does the

this is a cat and so this is okay when I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
this is a cat and so this is okay when I
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.770
this is a cat and so this is okay when I
see two eyes and a little pink nose and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
see two eyes and a little pink nose and
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900

attend some whiskers doesn't actually

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
attend some whiskers doesn't actually
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.979
attend some whiskers doesn't actually
say it's but that's what it's worth

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
say it's but that's what it's worth
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710
say it's but that's what it's worth
thinking then that is a cat so you teach

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
thinking then that is a cat so you teach
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539
thinking then that is a cat so you teach

it might be so that's machine learning

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
it might be so that's machine learning
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210

things like natural language well now

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
things like natural language well now
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990

the beauty of machine learning the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
the beauty of machine learning the
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.399

not think like humans that's too much of
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.319
not think like humans that's too much of
a stretch but certainly operate in the

that for example when you're a child you

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900
that for example when you're a child you
 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.240

walking around the house your mom or
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450
walking around the house your mom or
your dad will say look at that ball or

your dad will say look at that ball or
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149
your dad will say look at that ball or
go get the ball and so what's happening

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
go get the ball and so what's happening
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800
go get the ball and so what's happening
is over time you're getting reinforced

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
is over time you're getting reinforced

is over time you're getting reinforced
that when you see an object in the floor

that when you see an object in the floor
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399
that when you see an object in the floor
that is stationary and has a certain

you begin to understand how that's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
you begin to understand how that's
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380

in this room are you asking why there is
no Jaguar animal in this room and then

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
no Jaguar animal in this room and then

animal in this room and because again
the search engine understands what a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
the search engine understands what a
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.809
the search engine understands what a
Jaguar is and the animal is and where

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819
Jaguar is and the animal is and where
 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.250
Jaguar is and the animal is and where
they usually live and they would say

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260
they usually live and they would say
 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.839
they usually live and they would say
well because you're not in a jungle and

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849
well because you're not in a jungle and
 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.849
well because you're not in a jungle and
jaguars generally don't live in in

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859
jaguars generally don't live in in
 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.089
jaguars generally don't live in in
conference rooms like this and so NLP

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099
conference rooms like this and so NLP
 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.030
conference rooms like this and so NLP
becomes very exciting because it's it's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
becomes very exciting because it's it's
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.220
becomes very exciting because it's it's
it's modeled on the notion that the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230
it's modeled on the notion that the
 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.750
it's modeled on the notion that the
system that the search system

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
system that the search system
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.550
system that the search system
understands the physical world

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560
understands the physical world
 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.650
understands the physical world
everything in it and how all those

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
everything in it and how all those
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.420
everything in it and how all those
things relate to each other and so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
things relate to each other and so
 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.250
things relate to each other and so
suddenly now you begin to be able to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260
suddenly now you begin to be able to
 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.259
suddenly now you begin to be able to
engage in dialogue just as you and I

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
engage in dialogue just as you and I
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.869
engage in dialogue just as you and I
would do as humans when we have a

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879
would do as humans when we have a
 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.280
would do as humans when we have a
question about meeting your intent or

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290
question about meeting your intent or
 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.439
question about meeting your intent or
context we engage in clarifying

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449
context we engage in clarifying
 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.059
context we engage in clarifying
questions that's what will happen with

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069
questions that's what will happen with
 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.490
questions that's what will happen with
NLP and search and it's already

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500
NLP and search and it's already
 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.990
NLP and search and it's already
happening today in certain cases

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
happening today in certain cases
