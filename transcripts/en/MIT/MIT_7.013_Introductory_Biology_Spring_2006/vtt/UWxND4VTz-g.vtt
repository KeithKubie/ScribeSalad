00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
particular, we have a class quiz up there.  Take a moment if you  

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
haven't.  You've heard a lot of these terms before.  One you  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
haven't.  I have a particularly wonderful item to make  

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
up for the tough exam. It is a flashing,  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
isn't that so cool? It's a flashing jellyfish ball.  OK,  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so let's see what we can do.  Yes, I know, this is a post-test item.  OK,  

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
settle down.  Please, we have a lot to cover.  You've  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
heard most of these terms before. This lecture is all about these  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
terms phrased in a different way. So I want to make sure we are  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000
together before we start.  [Student speaks] Yes, ma'am?  OK, so the final function of  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a cell, OK.  Potency in the pink top.  I saw your hand first,  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
yeah?  Yeah, OK, potency. This is a very big one in stem cells,  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the number of possible fates that a cell can assume,  

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
commitment, decision to make a cell type, differentiation,  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
someone on the side of the room must have some thoughts.  Yeah?  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
OK, I'll give that to you, to the final transition here.  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Do you want one that's orange rather than pink?  God knows I don't want  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to be genderist here, but there we go.  The  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
differentiation, the process by which a cell assumes  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
its final fate.  And what we are going to discuss today  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is the kind of gradations of commitments in differentiation,  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
commitment particularly, some of the steps of commitment.  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The last one we have not discussed in class, but if anyone wants to  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
have a go, I will, yeah?  Lineage, the term lineage in  

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
biology.   

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Ish, ish.  Let's try another one. Good, OK, a group of cells or a  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
group of cell types that descends from a common precursor,  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
so, this is a funny term, lineage, because it's used a lot in  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
stem cell biology.  Let's think about it for a moment.  The  

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
definition I have is the set of cell types that normally arise from a  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
precursor cell.  Now, of course, if you think hard,  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all cells arise from a fertilized egg from a zygote.  So,  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
really, all cell types are of a common lineage.  

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And this gets to the question of semantics, and where you put your  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
definition boxes.  OK, in stem cell biology, and a lot of  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
biology, the term lineage refers to a subset of cells arising from a  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
common precursor that is somewhat arbitrarily defined.  All right,  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so this diagram which you've seen over several lectures  

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is really important. That's just what we've been talking  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
about, the progression from uncommitted cells through committed  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
cells through differentiated cells. And so, we are in the how-to two  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
module, talking about stem cells. Stem cells are in the news all the  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
time, and I want to, today, take you beyond the  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
newspapers, beyond the magazines, and tell you what I think stem cells  

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
are all about. So, if you look at our game board of  

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
life, we are, I would say, halfway plus through the semester,  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and we've gone through all of these things, sticking out here into stem  

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
cells.  So, where are we? OK, so what's a stem cell?  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Let me go back for one moment, and let's talk about stem cells.  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
For those of you who don't have a handout, you really should get it.  

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's two pages up front here. So, let's do some board stuff,  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
stem cell, which I will heretofore abbreviate SC is a cell type that I  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
am going to refer to as somewhat committed.  So that's deliberately  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
vague.  This is not a committed cell type, but it's somewhat committed.  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It knows more or less what it's going to become.  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It can be either unipotent or pluripotent or totipotent.  And that  

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
stem cell, by definition, will go on and make an asymmetric  

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
cell division.  So, it will give rise to itself,  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
another, not itself, but another stem cell.  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And it will also give rise to a committed, and here's jargon you  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
should know, progenitor.  And so, this is an asymmetric with one S,  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
asymmetric cell division.  So, you'll end up with two daughters  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that are different from one another, a committed cell, and a stem cell.  

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And so, the stem cell in a sense is self renewing,  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
or is self renewing.  And then, this is one of the big deals about  

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
stem cells.  That committed progenitor will go on to divide,  

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and it eventually gives rise to one or more differentiated cell types.  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
OK, in those differentiated cells will come from a specific lineage.  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So, the stem cell is  

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
undifferentiated.  The committed progenitor is undifferentiated,  

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and eventually you'll end up with a differentiated cell.  You can look  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
at your first handout.  Here it is; I've drawn it for you out.  You need  

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
to know this, so I've done it in two places.  There is the asymmetric  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
division stem cell plus progenitor, and the progenitor goes on to give  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
these differentiated cell types. There is no magic about this.  This  

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is the same process we've been talking about all along except for  

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the fact of the self renewing thing. So, in the normal embryo,  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
cells go on down the pathway of commitment towards differentiation.  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
But they generally do not renew themselves.  

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, a zygote, for example, although it's totipotent is not  

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
considered a stem cell because it doesn't self renew.  And that's true  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
of most embryonic cells.  They do not self renew and so they are not  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
considered stem cells.  So, what's the deal with stem cells,  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and why, when I Googled stem cells in Google News last night did I come  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
up with several thousand entries for the previous week?  

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is the deal.  One of the great goals of biologists is to repair  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
organs, to repair damaged tissues. And this has been very difficult to  

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
do.  We touched on this a few lectures ago.,  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
stem cells have some kind of promise a some kind of universal repair kit.  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And the idea is this, that one could isolate some kind of  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
magic stem cell, or some kind of stem cell,  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and it would be autologous, which means it would be matching  

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
your own cells. OK, so you isolate some kind of  

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
autologous, self matching stem cell. That stem cell under ideal  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
conditions is pluripotent, or that set of stem cells, and can  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
be coaxed to form many different cell types depending  

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
on how you treat it. So, you can imagine adding some kind  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of factor.  And if you like, you can call that an  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
inducer as we have been talking about secreted factors  

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in developmental biology.  And that inducer would turn those stem  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
cells into progenitors. And those progenitors would  

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
have a specific --   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
-- future fate by virtue of which factor you treated the stem cells  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
with.  You would then take those progenitors, inject them into  

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:37.000
someone whose body needed repair --   

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And the notion is that these progenitors would go on to  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
differentiate and repair whatever needed repairing.  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 OK, so this is the dream.  And  

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
this is why you can find headlines like this everywhere.  These are  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
some of the ones I pulled out last night: Stem Cells May Help Repair  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Stroke Damage.  Stem Cells May Repair Broken Bones.  Note the use  

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
of the term may.  OK, there's a lot of hype about stem  

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
cells and not much that's been proven.  There's a lot of money  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
involved in stem cells, trying to isolate stem cells to  

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
repair people, and there is also,  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
there are also advertisements where you pay people to take your stem  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
cells, and to store them. So, poured blood refers to the blood  

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
of the umbilical cord of a newborn, which is believed to be, it was  

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
known to be full of stem cells of a certain kinds.  And  

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
you can pay someone a couple of thousand dollars to freeze that  

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
group of cells and keep it in case the child needs some kind of stem  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
cell therapy in the future.  So, what's the deal?  Do stem cells  

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
actually exist?   

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Well, yes, OK.   

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Do stem cells exist or are they just hype?  They do exist,  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and the idea is that sometime in embryogenesis,  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
as cells are normally going on and making the different cell types,  

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
some cells are put aside, that the body is going to use later on for  

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
repairing itself.  And there are some examples,  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and I will tell you a couple which are really fantastic illustrations  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
of this. So, do stem cells exist?  

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Yes.  Where?  Likely in the older embryo, and the adult,  

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and the particular organs that contains stem cells is not clear.  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There are several very good examples, but it's not clear whether or not  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
some, yes, all, not clear. It's not clear whether all organs  

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
contain stem cells.  So, let's look at this a bit more,  

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and let's go back to talking about how stem cells were discovered.  Why  

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:36.000
are we having this conversation?   

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And I'm going to be referring to number two on your handout.  So,  

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
let's talk about the discovery of stem cells.  The discovery of stem  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
cells was an accident, and it came about when people  

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
started looking to see how long cells lived in a particular organ.  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And the way you do this is by using a protocol called a pulse  

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
chase experiment.   

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And a pulse chase experiment gets to the question of turnover rate,  

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:31.000
or if you want, half-life of cells in an organ.  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
OK, this is the way it goes.  You've got this as number two on your  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
handouts.  You take a cell population, or you just take the  

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
whole organism if you like, you feed it something called  

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
bromodeoxyuridine.  It doesn't have to be this, but this is a good one.  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Bromodeoxyuridine is a nucleotide. Deoxyuridine, so,  

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
you know uracil is normally an RNA, but if you make the deoxy form,  

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
it gets incorporated into DNA. The bromo part allows it,  

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
later on, to be detected by various colorimetric assays,  

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and you can add BRDU to an organism for a short time.  This is called a  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
pulse.  The BRDU is incorporated into DNA of those cells that are  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
undergoing DNA synthesis, and then by various means you wash  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
out the BRDU.  And what you get is the labeled cell  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
population that had undergone DNA replication during this pulse  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
period.  And then, if you follow this group of cells  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
over a period of hours or days or weeks or months or years,  

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
you can look and see what happens to those labeled cells.  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So, in my example, I started off with for labeled cells  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
over some period of time, the number of labeled cells per  

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
total unit number of other cells decreases by half.  And that gives  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
you the half-life of the population. And if you do this for many organs,  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
you find that adult organs do not just sit there with a cohort of  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
cells that doesn't divide. There is an enormous amount of cell  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
division in adult organs.  And we talked briefly about this  

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
previously.  So, for example, red blood cells have a  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
half-life of about 120 days.  And that actually means that there are  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
more than ten to the 7th new cells produced per day.  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The intestine is something we touched on previously.  Cells in the  

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
intestine, some of the cells in the intestine had a half-life of three  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
to five days, and you're producing about ten to the tenth new cells per  

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
day.  Obviously, the number that you're producing per  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
day depends on the total size of the population.  

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Skin has a half-life of about 14 days, hair on your head,  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.000
a half-life of about four years, and your eyebrows and eyelashes,  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000
half life of about 30 days.  One of the mysterious half-lives are the  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
neural cells, your nerve cells. It was believed for a long time that  

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
nerve cells never divided, and once you've got all your nerve  

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
cells by about age two, you never made any more.  In fact,  

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
that doesn't seem to be true.  And there are certainly populations of  

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
neurons that divide.  But we don't really know the half-lives for those  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
cells.  So, this was very interesting data,  

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and it said that there had to be some way that the organism was using  

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
to replenish these cells that were dying, and to repopulate the organs  

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
so that things functioned properly. And in fact, you can go further  

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
than this because you can not only count the labeled cells,  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
you can ask what those labeled cells become.  So, you can look at your  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
labeled cell population and assay the fate of those labeled cells.  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And if the cells want to differentiate from an initially  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
undifferentiated population, you know that these differentiated  

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
cells must have been derived from stem cells or from progenitors  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
by definition. OK, so what organs do we know have  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
got stem cells? Let's talk a bit about this.  The  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
test is a great example, and the spermatogonia,  

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
the diploid precursors of the spermatozoa are dividing cells that  

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
divide throughout life, and go on to give rise to themselves  

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
so they can replenish themselves. And they go on to give to these  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
primary spermatocytes, which are the first step in the  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
cascade or in the lineage of cells that are going to differentiate as a  

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
spermatozoa.  OK, and you know you can do these.  You  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
can look very clearly, and mathematically look and see the  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
number of cells, do this pulse chase analysis,  

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and know that the spermatigonea must be stem cells.  This is a very  

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
important stem cell lineage.  It's the hematopoietic lineage.  

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
In the bone marrow, there is some kind of pluripotential  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
hematopoietic cell that gives rise to all of myeloid progenitors,  

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
so all the red blood cells, and the various other cells in the blood  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
stream as well as to all the immune cells.  And those come from a  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
single progenitor, a single pluripotent cell.  This is  

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
called the hematopoietic lineage. And we will talk more about  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
that in a moment. This is an example that I mentioned  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
to you many lectures ago.  Newt limbs, if they are amputated, will  

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
regrow.  The reason that they regrow is that there seem to be a  

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
population of cells in the lab which are called blastema cells,  

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and those are the cells which can go on and to form the entire limb  

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
again.  And that's something obviously we can't do,  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
but people are very interested in. That's been a tough system to look  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
at.  This might be a better system to try and understand the  

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
details of regeneration. So, this is a planarian.  This is a  

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
flatworm.  These are little guys. They can grow up to a couple of  

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
centimeters, or a few centimeters. They are very pervasive animals in  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
the animal kingdom.  And they have this extraordinary property,  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
as many simple animals do, that you can cut them into pieces,  

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
and they will regenerate the whole animal.  So, you can take out the  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
head.  And over time, it will regenerate the tail.  You  

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
can take off the middle; it will regenerate a whole animal,  

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
and so on.  And this bottom picture is a planarian that's stained for  

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
BRDU incorporation, or for another marker as well.  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And each of these dots is a cell called a neoblast.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
The neoblasts are the stem cells of planaria that can regenerate the  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
whole animal.  And if you look right up front here,  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
it's not very distinct, but you will see a region where  

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
there are no neoblasts.  And that is the one region of the animal  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
that cannot regenerate.  So, if you cut off the very tip of the  

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
sort of nose equivalent region.  It will not regenerate a new animal  

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
because there are no neoblasts. And the system is being studied  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
here at MIT by Professor Reddien of the Whitehead Institute,  

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
who is a new faculty member, and who some of you might went to Europe  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
with sometime.  OK, so let's talk about isolating stem  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
cells, and how you do this.  If one is going to use stem cells for  

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
repair, you've got to be able to isolate these things.  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And the challenge of isolating stem cells is that they are rare.  For  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.000
example, in the bone marrow, the hematopoietic stem cells,  

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
which I'm abbreviating HSC, comprise about 0.01% of the bone marrow.  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And I would say it's fair to say  

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
that no one has really seen a cell and said, oh, this is a stem cell.  

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It's hard to pinpoint exactly what a stem cell really looks like.  It's  

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
just a cell.  But it's got particular properties,  

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and you need the appropriate way to look at the cells and see these  

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
properties.  One way that's been used to isolate stem cells is  

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
something called FACS, or fluorescence activated cell  

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
sorting.  I'll talk about it in a moment.  And there are two ways  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
that FACS is being used to isolate stem cells.  One is by getting a  

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
group of cells called SP cells where the SP stands for side population.  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
We'll talk about that more in a moment.  And the other is through  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
the use of cell surface proteins that are characteristic,  

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
or enriched in stem cells.  And this has been many decades of work  

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
by many people to come up with a set of criteria by which one can enrich  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
for stem cells in a particular population.  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So, here's the way.  Actually, before I go through that, let me go  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
through the assays, and then we will go through all the  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
slides together.  How do you assay for stem cells?  

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Well, one of the ways you know you have a stem cell is if you have  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
something that can act as a stem cell.  And there are two assays  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
that you should be aware of.  One of them is a repopulation assay usually  

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
done by transplant, and very often you remove some  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
endogenous group of cells, and then try to replace that group  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
of cells by using stem cells. So, you remove some set of  

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:27.000
differentiated cells.   

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And then, you try to replace with transplanted stem cells.  And  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
the other way you can do this is in some kind of in vitro culture assay  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
which I will talk about later on. All right, so with this in mind,  

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
let's go through some of the slides. You've all heard of bone marrow  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
transplants, which people who have leukemia and other associated  

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
disorders undergo to repair themselves to get rid of the  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
leukemia cells to get rid of the cancer.  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
This is how it works in a mouse. And this is a repopulation assay.  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I'm going to use bone marrow transplants as an example.  You take  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
your mouse, or your person if you are undergoing bone marrow  

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
transplants.  And you irradiate to destroy the bone  

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
marrow.  The reason you do that is to make space for new cells to come  

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
in to expand and grow. If you just put your new cells into  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
an animal with an intact bone marrow, they kind of disappear  

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
amidst the masses.  So, you have to give the cells your  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
assaying a chance.  And then, that irradiated mouse would die.  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
That irradiated person would die. But you get them,  

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
now, an injection of normal bone marrow.  And if things go well,  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
the mouse or the person lives. And there was a Nobel Prize given  

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
out some years ago for developing bone marrow transplantation.  One of  

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the gold standards in the stem cell field is asking whether or not this  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
rescued mouse has regenerated stem cells because you can imagine that  

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
what you're doing in this case is giving cells that are the  

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
progenitors.  They are one step down from the stem cells.  Or they might  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
even be partly differentiated.  So, you can imagine that you are  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
restoring this mouse is life by giving cells that are  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
not self-renewing. Excuse me, one of the gold standards  

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
in the stem cell field is to take this rescued mouse,  

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
isolate more stem cells or more putative stem cells,  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
and take those and then tried to rescue another mouse.  And  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
in the hematopoietic system, you can do this over and over again.  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So, how many stem cells do you need to repopulate a mouse?  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Actually, you need one, and I will tell you how this is  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
done.  So, the idea of the first thing when you are trying to do  

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
assays to figure out how many stem cells you need for rescue.  You take  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
your bone marrow; you stain it for some stem cell marker.  You have  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
this in front of you.  OK, this is number nine of the first  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
page of your handout.  You stain somehow for a stem cell marker.  

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I'll tell you in a moment how you sought the stained cells through  

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
this fluorescence activated cell sorter.  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And you isolate from it a pure-ish population of stem cells,  

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
an enriched population of stem cells.  And then,  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
you do a dilution assay where you inject different  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
numbers of cells into a recipient irradiated mouse.  Now,  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
you don't actually injects one, ten, and 100 cells.  You inject one  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
cell, and millions of carrier cells to help those cells along,  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
OK?  The one cell would just disappear in your syringe.  So,  

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
you've got to give it some companions.  But  

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
the bottom line is you really only need one stem cell to rescue the  

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
life of that mouse. It can go and repopulate the entire  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
hematopoietic system, all the blood cells, all the immune  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
cells.  What is this fluorescence activated cell sorter?  

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Fantastic machine.  It looks like this.  Again, you have this in front  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
of you, so look up here.  The idea is that you take a reservoir of  

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
cells that you have labeled with particular antibodies.  And these  

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
are living cells. OK, you label them in certain ways,  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
and they can be labeled with fluorescent antibodies or  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
fluorescent dyes.  I'll tell you a dye example in a moment.  And  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
you put them in a reservoir, and you trip them out so that one drop of  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
liquid contains one cell on average, or zero cells.  And you let those  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
cells drip through a laser and a fluorescence detector.  The laser  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
activates the cells.  They fluoresce, and you set the detector to activate  

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
a charging collar at a specific wavelength of  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
fluorescence. And when the charging collar is  

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
activated, it will activate some deflecting plates which will give  

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
charge to cells of particular colors, and move them into particular tubes  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
so that they are sorted on the basis of their color.  OK,  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
this is done one cell at a time but it's really quick.  And  

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
you can purify millions of cells to do these kinds of assays.  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
This kind of thing is not done for human bone marrow transplants.  

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
There, you take a much bigger population of cells from the bone  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
marrow, and you generally don't purify them very much.  But  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
if you want to do specific stem cell assays, and many others,  

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
the fax machine is really fantastic. So, what do you get out of this?  

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Well, you can plot what the cells look like.  So,  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
here in this example, I've got cells that are labeled in  

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
red and green.  And you can label them according to this  

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
plot as to whether they have no label, red label,  

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
green label, or both red and green. This is a real example of an  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
experiment that was done here at MIT a decade ago in Richard Mulligan's  

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
lab.  And this is what a real FACS plot looks like.  OK,  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
it's a mess.  Every little is a cell.  But for reasons known only to  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
the Mulligan lab, Peggy Goodell who is now a  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
professor in her own laboratory, they assayed this little region of  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
cells in the bottom left-hand corner for their stem cell properties.  

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
They called these SP cells or side population cells,  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
and they found to their surprise that these SP cells were highly  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
enriched for hematopoietic stem cells 1,000 fold or more.  And  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
in fact, if you take the very bottom left-hand corner where there are  

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
almost no cells, you get a 10,000 fold enrichment.  

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
So, the way they sorted these was with a dye called Hest 3342.  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
This is a vital dye.  It stains the DNA but it doesn't tell the cells.  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And somehow, these SP exclude the dye, or efflux it,  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
remove it from the cell.  And it's really not clear what that has  

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
to do with stem cellness, but this is still one of the very  

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
best ways to isolate stem cells from almost every organ.  These SP cells,  

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
these things that don't stain with these DNA dyes seem to be the ones  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
that are stem cell-like. OK, so let's move on to the question  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
to several questions that I want to discuss with you that fall under the  

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
umbrella of regulation and control of stem cell fate.  And  

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
there's several questions I like to pose to you.  Firstly,  

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
what makes a stem cell self renewing? What's the molecular basis for that?  

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
What makes a stem cell decide whether it's going to make  

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:15.000
progenitors or not?   

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
And the big one for the stem cell field, what controls the potency of  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
a stem cell?  Well, this is where we step back into the  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
developmental biology that we've been talking about because it all  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
controls at some level by gene expression.  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And in particular, there are both intrinsic and  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
extrinsic factors that seem to control certainly the first two  

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
points on my list, the self renewing and the progenitor   

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
aspect, and perhaps also the potency also.  

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Intrinsic factors, cell autonomous factors,  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
determinants --   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
-- and extrinsic factors, non autonomous factors, secreted  

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
ligands, inducers, and these and extrinsic factors have  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
been given a special name in the stem cell field just for argument's  

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
sake.  They are called the niche where the niche contains all the  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
cells that influence stem cell activity, cells that influence  

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
stem cell activity. OK, this is just a term.  You should  

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
know it because if you read it you will know it.  So,  

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
here's how it works.  The surrounding cells in the niche are  

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
cells that seem to maintain stem cells usually in acquiescent state.  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So, it's believed that in most organs, stem cells are  

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
sitting there quietly. They're not dividing very much,  

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
but they can be stimulated to divide, and this is on the second page of  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
your handout.  They can be stimulated to divide by some kind of  

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
environmental input, and this changes the surrounding  

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
cells.  And the environmental input could also be a secreted ligand for  

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
example.  And the surrounding cells then induce  

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
the stem cells to be activated.  And they go on to make progenitors,  

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
and of course also to self renew. This is a fancy way of saying that  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
cell fate is controlled by induction.  OK,  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
so you should be nodding.  The should not be anything new for you  

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
at this point.  It's phrased a little differently,  

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
but that's all.  This is a very interesting example of control of  

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
cell fate by surrounding cells. This is from my colleague,  

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Professor Fuchs at Rockefeller who studies the hair follicle,  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and who has shown that this region called the bulge is the  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
source of stem cells. So, this brown thing is the hair  

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
that sits in a shaft of cells that got a bunch of interesting cells  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
around it.  In particular, there's a rather inconspicuous group  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
of cells on one side called the bulge.  And some years ago,  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
there is another group of cells. I'm also going to refer to two at  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
the bottom, which is called the dermal propeller.  

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
But some years ago, Professor Fuchs took the cells of  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
the bulge and she transplanted them into a mouse that didn't have any  

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
hair.  It's called a nude mouse.  It has lots of problems including no  

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
hair.  But when she did that, here's the control and here's a  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
mouse into which these stem cells have been transplanted.  And  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
you can see all of a sudden this poor little nude mouse has got tufts  

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
of hair.  OK, and in fact, these hairs actually  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
glow-in-the-dark.  They've been labeled with green.  It's  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
really cool, OK? The cells that were transplanted,  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
this is something you know, as well. They were lineage labeled,  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
and so, you could prove that these hairs came from the transplanted  

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
cells.  All right, so let's look.  So,  

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
during the hair cycle, so you're hairs grow cyclically.  

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And there are a whole bunch of processes including growth,  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
regression, induction of growth, and new growth.  And during that  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
period of time, the bulge and the dermal papillae  

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
are in relatively different positions.  

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
So, during a process of growth, they are far away from each other,  

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
and then as the hair and growth regresses, they come closer until  

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
they're actually touching each other during the process of induction of  

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
new growth.  And it's at that time that new growth in  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
the hair is stimulated.  And it's clear that the dermal papillae  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
is signaling to the bulge cells. And here's what it's using to  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
signal.  It's using something called the wind pathway,  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
and in particular, a molecule called beta-catenin.  If  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
you think back several lectures, we talked about beta-catenin is one  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
of the things that told the embryo to make its back rather than its  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
belly.  So, here's a different use of the same molecule in stimulating  

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
hairs to grow.  And so this is a particularly cool example of cells  

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
coming together at particular points to stimulate stem cells to go on and  

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
to make progenitors. All right, let's move on to  

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:46.000
something important called embryonic stem cells And all right --  

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 -- also called ES sells.  So,  

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
although I told you that most adult organs are likely to have stem cells,  

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
and this has been very clearly shown for many, there are many organs  

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
where it's not clear whether they have stem cells,  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
or it's very difficult to isolate them.  Stem cells are rare in all  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
organs, and things like neural stem cells in the nervous system seemed  

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
to be a exceedingly rare and difficult to isolate.  So,  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
the push has been to try to find a source of stem cells that would be  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
more plentiful and more useful for repairing lots of different organs.  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And that's where the embryo comes in this particular kind of stem cell  

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
called an embryonic stem cell.  And the idea is if one takes an embryo  

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
or part of it, puts it into culture,  

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
after many steps you get out cells that are called ES cells.  And  

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
these ES cells are pluripotent. They are not totipotent.  But they  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000
are very, if I can be forgiven, they are very pluripotent bouquet,  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
and they are pluripotent, and you can control their cell fate.  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
So, let me going to the slides, and we will talk more about this  

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
through the slides.  So, in mammalian development,  

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
and we're going to talk about mammals here specifically,  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
mammalian development, the blastula forms.  And at a certain point in  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
development, a group of cells called the inner cell mass segregates from  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
the rest of the cells which form a shell around the embryo.  

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
We mentioned this previously.  This yellow stuff is fluid,  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
and this little group of cells called the ICM,  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
or inner cell mass, is the thing that's going to give  

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
rise to the embryo proper.  The cells surrounding are going to give  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
rise to the placenta and the other extra embryonic components.  So,  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
the idea in trying to get these ES cells is to take the inner cell mass  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
of an early embryo, take it out of the embryo,  

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
and put it in a Petri dish that's got nutrients and various factors to  

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
disperse the cells such that you've got single cells dispersed in the  

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
plate, and give them nutrients. And over time,  

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
those cells will grow, and they will form clumps,  

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
each of which is derived from a single embryonic cell.  OK,  

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
now, normal embryonic cells do not do this.  OK, they will normally go  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
on and differentiate, and stop dividing, but there's  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
something that happens during this culture process that is abnormal.  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And it turns the cells into groups of cells that can self renew.  OK,  

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
so you've turned these cells into self renewing cells.  And  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
each of these groups of cells or colonies that you get may be able to  

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
grow into a stem cell line.  And I'll talk about cell lines in a  

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
moment.  I'll talk about cell lines now.  So, you might not be familiar  

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
with the term cell line. What is the cell line?  

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
A cell line is a cell population, a homogeneous cell population that  

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
could grow continuously in culture. So, it's self renewing.  OK,  

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
so all cell lines are self renewing. A stem cell line is a cell line  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
that has the capacity to go on and differentiate into specific normal  

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
cell types.  So, there are many cell lines that will  

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
grow continuously in culture, but they will never go on and  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
differentiate as anything.  They are very abnormal cells.  

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
They are useful for many studies, but they are not stem cells.  The  

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
stem cells not only can grow continuously, but they can go on and  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
differentiate.  But you are dealing with an abnormal cells here.  This  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
is not a normal embryonic cell.  OK, how do you test the potency of these  

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
ES cells done in the following way? The ES cells from a mouse, a black  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
mouse, are taken, and they are injected into an early  

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
embryo of an embryo derived from white parents.  

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
And if you do that, the ES cells incorporate into the  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
embryo.  You then take the embryos, and put them into a surrogate  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
mother.  And when the mice are born, when the babies are born,  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
you can see that they often are not just pure white.  They often got  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
black stripes, and you can look at the various  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
organs and show that these ES cells have incorporated into various  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
organs.  So, these ES cells are highly potent.  And  

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
the idea is that you can take these ES cells and add to them  

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
various factors. So, you can add a particular red  

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
factor that will turn an ES line into heart muscle cells or pancreas  

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
cells or cartilage cells.  And you can use those cells in your stem  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
cell repair assays.  OK, and this is true.  You can take ES  

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
cells, and you can do exactly this to them.  And then,  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
they will become these different kinds of differentiated derivatives.  

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So, this is really cool. And the push has been to try to get  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
this to work not for mice but for humans.  And this is where the huge  

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
controversy in the stem cell field comes from.  So,  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
the controversy comes from the fact that you need embryos to get these  

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
stem cells.  You get the embryos from in vitro fertilization that we  

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
touched on a few lectures ago.  Eggs are isolated by ovarian stimulation.  

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
They are fertilized in vitro, and they are allowed to grow in  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
vitro for a week or so. And at that point,  

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
there are harvested or killed to make the ES line.  And  

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
this is the very controversial point, whether or not it is ethically OK to  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
harvest these embryos, and turn them in to stem cell lines  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
or not.  Presently, there is no federal funding that is  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
allowed to be used to make human ES cell lines.  There are some that  

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
exist, and President Bush has told scientists that they need to use the  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
ones that exist. However, they are not very good cell  

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
lines, and so scientists have used private funding to make new human ES  

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
lines that hopefully will be more useful.  I don't think there's any  

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
right or wrong answer whether this is OK or not.  My opinion is that  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
this is an OK thing to do, with all due respect to the embryo.  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I think one can save people's lives, well, and the embryo at this point  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
is not a differentiated entity. But it is an embryo.  And so,  

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
this is an ethical issue.  There's opinion here, and it's good for you  

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
to think about what your opinion about this type of research is.  OK,  

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
so let's move on.  And I'm going to, in the last minute,  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
just touch on something called stem cell plasticity.  

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 One of the things that has come out  

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
of the human ES work or all the ES work, and that has come out of the  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
quest not to use embryos for stem cells is to ask whether or not one  

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
can turn one stem cell line into another.  So, it's easy,  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
or relatively easy, to get hematopoietic stem cells.  And  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
wouldn't it be wonderful if you take those hematopoietic stem cells and  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
turn them into brain stem cells, and fix people who have Parkinson's  

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
or Alzheimer's? OK, wouldn't it be wonderful to fix  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
people who have muscular dystrophy by turning hematopoietic stem cells  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
that you can get lots of into muscle cells?  So, the idea is maybe you  

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
could turn something from one lineage, a hematopoietic stem cell  

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
into a stem cell from another lineage and get it to  

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
do something else? And the hypothesis,  

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
then, is that if you do appropriate experiments, you may be able to  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
figure out where the stem cells from one lineage can contribute to  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
another.  This is the second to last slide on your handout.  So,  

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
this is the way the experiments were done.  It's the last thing I'm going  

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
to tell you.  Bear with me.  You can take a mouse that's been dyed green,  

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
and its hematopoietic stem cells are expressing GFP,  

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
which is a green fluorescent protein.  You use that mouse as a  

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
daughter for bone marrow transplants.  

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
You put in the great cells.  Not only do you rescue the bone marrow,  

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
you also ask whether other organs have got green cells in them,  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
indicating that the hematopoietic cells can contribute to other  

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
lineages.  And when you do that,  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
initially people got very excited because you saw results like this.  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
And this is data from my colleague, Dr. Camargo over at the Whitehead  

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Institute.  When this experiment was done, he could show that the liver  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
of such an animal had lots of green cells, suggesting that the  

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
hematopoietic stem cells could also be liver stem cells.  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
But when he looked more closely, this is a complete artifact.  And  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
what had happened was that the hematopoietic stem cells had  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
actually fused with the liver cells, making the liver cells green.  And  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
in fact, presently, there is no data to suggest that you  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.666
can interconvert stem cell lineages. And I'll stop there.  Thank you.
