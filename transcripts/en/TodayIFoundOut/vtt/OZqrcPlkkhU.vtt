00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.400
The Business That Would Evolve Into Taco Bell
Started Out Selling Hot Dogs

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.209
In 1946, Glen Bell left the Marine Corps at
the age of 23.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.740
Like many of his comrades, he was looking
forward to post-war activities and settling

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560
into a career when he returned home.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.429
Luckily for him, the fast food business was
booming, and Bell had an idea: a hot dog stand.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.900
It was called Bell’s Drive-In, and it was
set up in San Bernadino, an agricultural town

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.120
in California.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.480
Bell didn’t know the first thing about running
a hot dog stand, but that didn’t matter;

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.090
he learned as he went along.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.040
The first stand did well and when Bell sold
it in 1952, he was able to go on to make a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.220
bigger, better stand that sold both hot dogs
and hamburgers.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.260
At this point, Bell wasn’t exactly thinking
outside the bun.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.590
He did manage to start up his second stand
before the McDonald brothers announced their

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.520
fast food venture—also in San Bernadino.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.740
You can probably guess how it went, since
McDonald’s is still selling burgers and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.189
Bell’s business isn’t.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.710
It was likely because of the increased competition
that Bell started to explore alternative menu

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.710
options.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.540
Feeling the pressure to stand out from the
crowd, Bell did start “thinking outside

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.740
the bun” and landed on Mexican food.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.600
A big fan of Mexican take-out himself, he
thought that Mexican food lovers needed a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.580
fast-food option, as people often had to wait
a while to get a good taco on the go.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.020
So, Bell began scheming.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.430
In his own words,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.830
My plan for experimenting with tacos was to
obtain a location in a Mexican neighborhood.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.260
That way, if tacos were successful, potential
competitors would write it off to the location

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.460
and assume that the idea wouldn’t sell anywhere
else.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.909
With his new location secured, Bell began
with what he knew—hot dogs.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.450
Both regular hot dogs and chilli dogs were
on the menu, and the chilli dogs had a secret

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.369
sauce on them that would later become the
basis for the taco sauce we know today.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.400
While those were selling, Bell was researching
tacos and coming up with ways to produce them

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
quickly.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.180
Many Mexican food restaurants stuffed the
shells, then fried them, which was partially

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.470
why it took so long.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.930
Bell decided he would instead fry the shells
and then stuff them, meaning he could have

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.000
fried shells ready to go before the customers
lined up.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.310
It took a while to work out all the kinks,
but Bell soon hit upon a deep fryer that suited

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.310
his needs.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.840
At the taco’s debut, they cost 19 cents
each (about $1.61 today).

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
According to Bell,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.810
I’ll never forget the first taco customer
because naturally, I was really concerned

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.810
about his reaction.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.260
He was dressed in a suit, and as he bit into
the taco the juice ran down his sleeve and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.400
dripped on his tie.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.650
I thought, ‘We’ve lost this one,’ but
he came back, amazingly enough, and said,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.000
‘That was good, I’ll take another one!’

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.480
Business was booming.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.970
Bell ended up opening another stand in Barstow
that sold tacos and shakes, and a few years

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.200
later he opened three stands dedicated to
tacos, which he called Taco Tias.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.550
Obviously, it didn’t end there.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.390
Bell became more and more ambitious.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.150
Even when the three stores started raking
in $50,000 a year each, he was happy to give

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.180
them up for the chance to expand into Los
Angeles.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.710
The move was risky; Bell bought two lots to
build restaurants on, but in doing so he became

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.739
strapped for cash.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.110
To solve the problem, he ended up partnering
with a few of the L.A. Rams footballers who

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.819
trained near a Taco Tia and loved the food.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.150
Together, they were able to build several
stores and make a profit in their first year,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.550
quite the accomplishment for a single restaurant,
let alone a few in their debut.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.700
The restaurants were called “El Tacos.”

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.180
However, Bell wanted a business that he solely
owned, so he built essentially the exact same

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.440
restaurant, but re-branded it as “Taco Bell”
in 1962 in Downey.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.390
He followed it up with eight other small Taco
Bells on Long Beach.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.310
He then set about franchising his restaurant,
with the first Taco Bell franchise purchased

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.350
in 1964; this first franchise, run by an old
L.A. policeman, did unbelievably well, and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.760
the owner was reportedly bringing in around
$10,000 per month (around $74,000 today) almost

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760
right away.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.430
After that raging success, it’s no wonder
that people were clamouring to own a Taco

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.430
Bell.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.450
A mere three years later, in 1967, they opened
their 100th restaurant in Anaheim.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.239
Just three years after that, the company “went
public” with 325 restaurants in 1970.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.180
What had once been a tiny hot dog stand had
evolved into a huge Mexican fast food company

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.549
in a little over a decade.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.520
Taco Bell celebrated its 50th anniversary
in 2012, two years after the death of its

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520
founder.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:35.120
It now boasts some 5,600 restaurants, 350
franchisees, and over 150,000 employees.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.930
Taco Bell almost started out as a mini-golf
course.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.500
Thinking about what people might want to invest
in after the war, Bell thought they might

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.889
want to return to fun pre-war activities like
mini-golf.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.139
However, he didn’t have quite enough money
to run a golf course, so he opted for the

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.530
hotdog stand instead.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.540
A man named Ed Hackbarth was employed to run
the second taco and shake stand in Barstow.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.840
He went on to found Del Taco.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.600
The popular “Taco Bell Chihuahua” was
featured in many Taco Bell ads from 1997.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.330
Her name was Gidget, and she became so popular
that they started making toys in her likeness.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.570
When they stopped using the dog in 2000, revenue
dropped by 6%, the largest decrease in Taco

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.570
Bell history.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.340
It’s thought that they stopped using Gidget
because she was portrayed as a stereotype

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.259
which was upsetting some Latin American communities.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:41.250
Gidget was euthanized at the age of 15 after
a stroke in 2009.
