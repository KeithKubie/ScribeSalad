00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.292
So, let's take a look at problem one.

00:00:01.292 --> 00:00:05.337
That is, what's the probability of
getting the observation sequence,

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.250
given lambda, given an HMM.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.704
It's the first I want to look at
a naive solution, and then, you'll see

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:14.785
how the cool solution is so much
much better than the naive solution.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.894
So, let's start off by pretending,
assume for the moment,

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:21.667
we actually know the sequence of states.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.505
Okay?
So, that's q sub 1 through q sub cap t.

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:27.575
Right, q sub 1 through q sub cap t.

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:30.840
That's the actual state
at time one through time,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.890
to each one of them is an s sub j,
right?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.935
So, maybe it goes from state three,
to two, to four or whatever.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.820
One through t is the time, okay?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.050
So, we're going to assume that.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.480
And the other thing we're going to
assume is that the observations

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.810
only depend upon
the state that you're in.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.690
So, when we say, independent
observations, what we mean is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.270
that if you knew this state, then
the probability of observation is just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.680
dependent on the state and
not dependent upon anything else.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.982
Well, if that's the case,
then the probability of the particular

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:05.220
observation, observation sequence,
given the state sequence.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
Well, because of independence, it's just
the probability multiplied times each

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.460
other of the output of that,
of the particular symbol

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.830
seen at time t, given that you're
in the particular state at time t.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.930
And that taken the whole product.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.720
And that's just these b variables,
right?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.510
So, b of q1 that of o1, means
the probability given that I'm in q1,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.890
whatever q1 happens to be,
of outputting o1, and et cetera.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.390
Okay?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.930
So, if we knew the state sequence,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.823
then we could just multiply this to
get the observation of the sequence,

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:45.230
of the likelihood of the observation
sequence given the state sequence.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.180
But for any given state sequence,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750
I can tell you the probability
of getting that state sequence.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.010
Right.
It's just a very simple product shown

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.820
here, right?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
So, if I know it's q1 through q cap t,
then it's the probability,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.970
here's pi of q1,
of starting in that state.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.275
And then, a of q1q2, is the probability
of going from that state,

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:11.847
q1, to whatever the next state,
q2 is, times a q2q3,

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:14.792
all the way up to a qt minus one, to qt.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:15.375
All right?

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:19.319
So, assuming I knew the sequence,
I could tell you the probability.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.910
Well, you say, in that case,
I can do the following.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.520
Given that I can compute
the probability of a sequence,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.500
of an observation sequence,
given a state sequence.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.320
And given that I can compute the
probability of any given state sequence.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.246
Well, then, obviously, we can compute
the probability of getting that

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:47.417
output sequence by just summing over
the all the different state sequences.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.609
Right?
Taking the probability of the state

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.425
sequence times the probability of the
observation given the state sequence,

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:56.570
summed, as I said,
over all the state sequences.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.280
Okay?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.250
You could just do that.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.070
Of course the problem with doing that
is it would take you a long time.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.900
How long?

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.600
A really, really, really long time.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.340
And the reason is,
this is summed over all possible paths.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.459
All possible state sequences.

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.640
All right?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.300
Well, their end states and
their T times steps, that's N to the T.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.090
Okay?
Exponential in time into the T.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.150
And each one costs t calculations
because I have to figure out

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.230
the probability of oh, so the complexity
of that is T times N to the T.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.870
That, as we say, is a really long time.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.000
So, it's not such a good solution.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.833
So, you think we can
do something better?

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:41.985
Well, of course, we could or

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.070
else I wouldn't be standing
here wasting your time.
