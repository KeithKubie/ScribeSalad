Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:06.215
So today we're in the rocket van and I've got two little science helpers here right?

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:07.157
Kids: Yes, right.

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:08.174
Are you wearing your seatbelts?

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:08.897
Yes.

00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:11.121
OK we're gonna do something pretty interesting. Check this out.

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.041
I've got a pendulum suspended from the top of our family van

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.801
and we're just gonna drive forward, we're gonna accelerate,

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.279
so if we're going that way, which direction do you think this pendulum should go? What do you think?

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.793
3.. 2.. 1.. Go.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:25.336
Kids: Yes.

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:26.462
Which way is it going?

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:27.346
Kids: My way.

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:29.381
That's right. It's because I'm accelerating right?

00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:30.543
Does that make sense to you guys?

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:31.356
Yes sir.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:33.685
OK very good, I was hoping it would make sense.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.508
So we're gonna change it up just a little bit.

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:39.926
OK so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace this pendulum with a balloon.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.031
We should see the same thing right? Let me cut this off.

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.133
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna accelerate that way

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:52.536
so we have the mass of the balloon and the acceleration that should net in a force and will have to react with this string right?

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:53.539
You guys ready?

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.291
Yes sir.

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.675
3.. 2.. 1.. Go.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:02.159
Wait a second. What just happened?

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.555
What happens when I stop?

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.775
The balloon goes backwards when I stop.

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:09.213
What's happening?

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.668
3.. 2.. 1..Go.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.933
There it is. It's coming right at me.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.689
Why's it doing that?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.412
Do you wanna know?

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:19.417
Yeah.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.065
Alright, I brought something to show you.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:24.500
You remember I told you I was gonna bring this jar earlier? Remember that?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.982
So it's like this. Imagine this entire van is just like this jar,

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:33.032
and all the air inside this van is just like the water in the jar. Does that make sense?

00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:37.360
So let's imagine that the balloon is this bubble on top,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.497
because the helium in the balloon is lighter than air right?

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:41.846
So that causes it to do what?

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:43.104
Kids: Go up.

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:44.325
Go up, that's right.

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:49.535
So if I've got this air that's just like it, what happens if I move the jar that way?

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.859
All that water sloshes to the back.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.437
And when that water sloshes back this way, which direction does the bubble go?

00:01:56.437 --> 00:02:00.236
You see that? So the air bubble moves in the direction of acceleration,

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:01.495
does that make sense?

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:03.246
I know you're five but I think you can get this.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:08.417
OK so I've got my seatbelt on. If I drive forward real fast right now which direction is the balloon gonna go?

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:09.236
Forward.

00:02:09.236 --> 00:02:10.303
Why will it go forward?

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:13.001
Because all the air's sloshing back.

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.696
That's right! Very good! Watch this.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.142
Look at that. You see that?

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:19.244
So you know what that means don't you?

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:24.985
That means you have more air to breathe than daddy does when I'm going fast.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:26.143
Did you realise that?

00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:27.074
Kids: Nooo!

00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:33.108
Yeah that means when I go fast, that means more air sloshes back there to you and you have more oxygen to breathe.

00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:34.992
Doesn't it feel good back there?

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:39.983
OK so now we have the plumb bob right next to the balloon, so if I go forward they should spread apart right?

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:42.084
Let's check it out.

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:43.915
Is it working?

00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:44.751
Kids: Yeah.

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:49.644
So what I want to do is I want to tell everybody on Smarter Every Day that if they go download

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:54.569
a free audio book that it'll help Smarter Every Day by sponsoring us.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.269
Audible will, if they go to audible.com/smarter.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.971
And so they get a free audio book, but I'm gonna do it in a funny way.

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.167
Now lean in towards me and look straight at the camera.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.204
I know you don't know what I'm gonna do but don't laugh

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:10.096
because I want people to realize that they can send you to school if they get a audio book.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:10.880
Does that make sense?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.540
Yeah.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.548
So whatever happens don't laugh. OK?

00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:15.463
Look straight at the camera. Ready?

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:16.906
You don't know what I'm doing, do you?

00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:19.759
OK you ready?

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:27.605
(High pitched helium voice) Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day and if you would please download an audio book at audible.com/smarter.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:30.586
Did you know daddy could talk like this?

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:31.308
No.

00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:32.760
You didn't know that happened, did you?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.215
So if you go get a free audio book it'll support Smarter Every Day and it'll help me send these kids to school.

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:41.638
Does that sound like a good idea?

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.506
Yes.

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:45.484
You should never do that, by the way. That's only for adults.

00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:47.021
How'd you do that?

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.102
It's magical. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:53.014
Please subscribe to Smarter Every Day and support our sponsor audible,

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.117
I'll leave a link somewhere and you can check it out.

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:56.382
Thanks, bye.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.380
How'd you change your voice?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.936
OK now we have the sunroof, the side window and the back open.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:06.691
I'm gonna go forward, where do you think it's gonna go?

00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:07.819
Daughter: Forward.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.452
Son: Backwards.

00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:12.451
3.. 2.. 1..

00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.168
Dad: So this is air, not helium?

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.141
Yes sir.

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.621
OK I think it's gonna act like the pendulum.

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.258
Dad: 3.. 2.. 1.. Go.

00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:26.410
(laughs) Backwards.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.627
Oh it does. We're gonna use that one.
