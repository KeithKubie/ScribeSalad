00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.570
Use the graph below
to decide which

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.242
of the following
equations are true.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.950
So before I even look
at these equations,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.900
let's think about
what's going on here.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.490
So I have a line.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.730
And then we've defined all of
these right triangles, where

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.320
the hypotenuse of the right
triangles are the line.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.390
And you could view
this right triangle,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.200
say this one in red, as
really, side C is our change

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.180
in y, our vertical change
as we go from this point

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.250
to this point.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
And side D right over here
is our horizontal change.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.290
Notice we go D to the right.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.540
And then we go C up.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.700
If you're starting at this
point and going to that point,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
side B is your
horizontal change.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.820
And side A is your
vertical change.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.070
And the one thing
we know about lines

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.120
is, if you construct these
right triangles like this,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
your change in y over
your change in x,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.790
the ratio between those two is
always going to be constant.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.825
We call that ratio the slope.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.200
We also know that
these are going

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.110
to be similar triangles,
that the ratio

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.920
between corresponding sides
is going to be the same.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.830
So these are obviously
right triangles.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.009
These are horizontal lines.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.050
These are vertical lines.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.950
And all of these are
similar triangles.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.750
And because they're
all similar, the ratio

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.790
between this vertical side
and this base right over here,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.680
is always going to be the same.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.340
So for example, we know
that the ratio of A to B

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.180
is going to be equal to the
ratio of C to D. Now let's work

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.850
through some of this other
stuff right over here.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.440
So they say y plus 1 over x plus
2 is equal to the ratio of A

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.490
to B. Let's see if that's right.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
So this is the point, x, y.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.702
So what's y plus 1?

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:49.970
Well, y plus 1 is
literally the same thing

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.230
as the length C right over here.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.450
Notice this height-- let
me do this in a new color--

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.410
this height right
over here, this is y.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.040
But if you add 1, you get
all the way down here.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.380
So this right over
here is y plus 1.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.110
And then this base right
over here, once again,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.910
you see this is x plus 2.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.284
This length right
over here, let me

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:20.670
see if you can see if, this
length right here, that is x.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.620
You start at x equals 0,
you go x to the right,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.930
and you get right over there.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.805
But if you want to get
all the way over here,

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:30.630
you have to add 2.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.410
So this right over
here is x plus 2.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.910
And we know the ratio of
this height to this base

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.950
right over here is always
going to be the same.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.730
So the ratio of y
plus 1 to x plus 2

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.200
is going to be equal
to the ratio of C

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.687
to D, which is the same
thing as the ratio as A to B.

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.770
Now, that's what they're
saying right over here. y

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.400
plus 1 over x plus 2 needs
to be equal to A/B. So

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.050
that one's right.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.280
Here they've swapped the two.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.420
And now they're mixing
A and D together.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.970
Now, this is kind
of a strange thing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.760
that they're doing, looking
at the ratio of A to D.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.170
You could swap these
two and say, well,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.010
what's the ratio of x plus
2 to y plus 1 going to be.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.610
If this ratio is
always constant,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.680
then the reciprocal
ratio is always

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.780
going to be constant as well.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.110
We could call that
1 over the slope.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.137
So x plus 2 over y
plus 1 would need

00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:48.970
to be equal to the
reciprocal of this, which

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.687
would be D/C, which would be
the reciprocal of this, or B/A.

00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:55.520
Do we see that here?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.710
No.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.709
They've mixed it all up.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.910
They've mixed the A
and the D together.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.100
x plus 2 over y plus 1
is not the same thing

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.480
as A/D. We're not even
using corresponding sides.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.580
We're mixing up triangles.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.600
So this is not the case.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.850
Now, they say the
ratio of y/x needs

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.390
to be the same as the ratio
of C/D. So what's y/x?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.820
So y is this length
right over here.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.580
That what I did in black.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.080
That is y.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.580
I don't want to
cover anything else.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.590
And what is x?

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.930
x is this length
right over here.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.300
So you could construct
a right triangle

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.310
that looks something like this.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.290
But notice, this is
x right over here.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.726
Its hypotenuse is not the line.

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.100
It's not a
essentially our change

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.560
in x between some starting
point and some ending point.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.070
We're starting at the origin.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.030
And we're getting 2xy.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.340
It has a different hypotenuse
than the actual line.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.790
So this triangle is
not similar to all

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.620
of these other triangles.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.950
So the ratio of y/x is not going
to be the same as the ratio

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.370
as C/D. So this is not
going to be the case.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.580
If this line went through
the origin, then maybe

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.800
we could talk a little
further about that.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.580
But this is definitely
not going to be the case.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.830
Now let's look at this.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.051
C/D, the ratio of this
entire height-- and I

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:24.800
know I'm using too
many colors right here,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.200
it's hard to see-- so C
is this entire length.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.750
The ratio of C to D, so
this is our slope, the ratio

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.090
of our rise over our run,
the ratio of our change in y

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.690
over our change in x.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:44.170
So the ratio of C to D is
the same, is equal to A/B.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.040
Well, that's the
definition of our slope.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.980
This ratio is constant when
we're dealing with a line.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.186
So this is definitely true.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.060
Now let's actually input
it into the exercise

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.540
and make sure that we've got it.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.120
We have that one,
we have that one.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.400
And we can check our answer.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.520
And we got it right.
