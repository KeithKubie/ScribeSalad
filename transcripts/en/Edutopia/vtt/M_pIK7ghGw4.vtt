&gt;&gt;Adrian: I think it is
important to make school fun.

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:10.156
And when school is fun, you don't
get kids waking up in the morning

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:12.356
and saying, "Do I have
to come to school again?"

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:17.496
So we embrace technology, because it
helps us make learning more engaging.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:21.056
I believe that when kids are
engaged, when kids are interested,

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.976
that's where learning takes place.

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:44.066
Ho: The kids are really from
a very different world now.

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:48.376
And really to reach out to the kids,
you need to be savvy with technology.

00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:49.976
If you are not savvy with technology,

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:51.866
you're going to lose
the kids in the school.

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:13.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What you want
to do right now is, okay,

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.796
think of the Socratic questions.

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:18.326
&gt;&gt;Adrian: Ngee Ann Secondary School
is a typical school in Singapore

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:21.886
where we take in students with
different academic abilities,

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:27.106
and we have about 1,512
students in this school.

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:29.656
And they all come from
the neighborhood.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.196
We've got students from
the age of 13 to about 16.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:38.196
Many students want to come to this
school because of its strong program,

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:42.646
especially in the use of
IACT, Infocom Technology.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.266
And the teachers here are known to
produce very good teaching materials,

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.746
and very innovative teaching ideas

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:51.976
to engage the students
in the classrooms.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:02:00.286
&gt;&gt;Lee: In the early 1990s, the
teachers really are the monopoly

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.486
on knowledge, and they are the one
that comes to the class to deliver

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:07.296
that knowledge so that the
students can acquire them.

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:11.706
But today, knowledge is no more
a monopoly among the teachers.

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.296
Because students can get
knowledge from a myriad of sources.

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:19.956
And hence, the role of the
teacher today is facilitation.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:24.286
That means facilitate students where
they could get the right knowledge,

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:26.536
how they could synthesize things,

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:28.976
how they could discern the
information that they get.

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:32.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Velocity defines the
rate of change of the sense of time.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.076
Is it true or false?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.866
So I want you to Tweet me answer.

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:35.816
So this is how you Tweet.

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:37.066
This is the format
that you need to Tweet.

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.716
So you put in "at"
sign, "votebytweet 1."

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:42.906
&gt;&gt;Adrian: We look at
technology very meaningfully.

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:45.516
And we see how can we
leverage this technology

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:49.376
to make a very significant impact
in the classroom instruction.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:50.756
I'll give you an example.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:54.746
In a classroom of 40, it is really
impossible to get 40 students

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:56.316
to ask 40 questions at one go.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:03:01.336
When we use the instant messaging
tool, we open 40 windows to 40 kids.

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.606
They could ask 40 questions
at the same time,

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:05.496
and the teacher could
see their thinking

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.406
on the technology tool that they use.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:11.076
And kids get more excited,
because they are using the tools

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:13.056
that they are very,
very good in using.

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:15.096
Not just a pen and pencil.

00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:19.576
&gt;&gt;Ben: Okay, so same thing, we will
have two students at every terminal.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.286
If you have any issues
through the terminals,

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:25.056
raise your hand, and
I'll come to you.

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:27.296
Okay? All right, let's go.

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.386
&gt;&gt;Ben: What the students are doing,

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:31.446
they are currently exploring
this Second Life Art Gallery,

00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:33.766
which the school has set up.

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.296
And the works that are shown

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:40.016
in this gallery is actually
made up of local works.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:45.866
They have been done by local artists.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.776
Of course, of all the
online platform is very,

00:03:48.776 --> 00:03:51.836
very useful because it's something
that really engages the students.

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:53.856
They will be chatting
with one another

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:57.646
about the works using the
elements, principles of design.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:00.786
As well as reading other
students comments as well.

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.806
If they want, too, they
can actually leave notes

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:04.936
for other students to read.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:11.566
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaking
foreign language]

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:16.096
&gt;&gt;Adrian: Web 2.0 with Wiki,
with your Facebook, your blogs,

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:19.176
you find that it's a very
participatory culture.

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.336
It calls for a lot of collaboration.

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:24.346
They no longer become just
a consumer of knowledge.

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:26.126
They actually produce knowledge.

00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:29.136
&gt;&gt;Patricia: What is one of the things
that you have discovered so far?

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:33.976
&gt;&gt;Student: The electron has a
tendency to lose their actions.

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:37.166
&gt;&gt;Patricia: I find that students
themselves are often on Facebook,

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.976
so instead of looking at
Facebook as a distraction,

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.156
I would rather use it to engage them.

00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:45.296
So even like when they're
stuck with a certain question,

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:48.626
they post up the question to the
class, and you see responses,

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:52.296
and they are learning from each
other, which I think it's better,

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:55.316
because there's more interest
and motivation for them to learn,

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:58.266
rather than, "Okay, I'll
tell you to do this.

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.376
And I'll tell you to do that."

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:02.066
&gt;&gt;Adrian: I would say that
the teachers in this school,

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.826
myself included, we scan the
globe for best practices.

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:25.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now, all that URL,
you will use the [inaudible].

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:30.746
Okay? Using that hook-up,
I want you to see some

00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:33.976
of the things that will help you.

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:34.596
&gt;&gt;Deepa: We are in the process

00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:37.836
of watching a model lesson that's
being run by my colleague here.

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:44.356
And her process of us watching the
lesson is to gain some kind of points

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.216
from her lesson, and also
to provide our feedback.

00:05:48.586 --> 00:05:50.996
We discuss it to come
up with a better lesson.

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:54.826
Because definitely learning grows
with sharing and communication,

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:57.956
and there's definitely in school
for improvement for any lesson.

00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:01.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, first of
all, I understand that the purpose

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.696
of this Skype session, we want

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:04.986
to confirm the suitability
of the pretest.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:08.396
Is this the common
agenda that we have?

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:09.936
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, a common
agenda, yeah.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:10.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:14.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It might be we can
think about it is if we give it

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:19.056
to the children as is, some of them
might actually come up with the idea

00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:19.976
of the steepness of the slide.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.426
&gt;&gt;Muneira: There's always
something new to learn.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:22.786
You're never at a standstill.

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:25.446
You're always moving
ahead, pushing boundaries,

00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:28.286
trying to discover new
things, new ways of teaching.

00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:32.176
So it's exciting, because
even if the pedagogy is sound,

00:06:32.516 --> 00:06:34.676
there's always a technology
that's always challenging us.

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:37.976
And we always have to find new
ways to connect with the kids.

00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:39.976
And to challenge them.

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:50.606
&gt;&gt;Adrian: So I think we do look
at how the world has changed.

00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:53.106
And teaching cannot stay stagnant.

00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:56.606
So the teachers recognize the fact
that they cannot teach the same way

00:06:56.606 --> 00:06:58.996
that they are taught
ten/twenty years ago.

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:02.346
That they have to be very
adaptive in their matters.

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:07.006
And when they do that well, they know
they're going to engage the kids.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:11.536
And when you engage the kids, that
is where real learning takes place.
