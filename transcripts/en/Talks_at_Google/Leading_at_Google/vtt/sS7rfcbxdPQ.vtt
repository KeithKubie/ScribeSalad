RICK JONES: Thank you
all for coming.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.636
It's a real pleasure to see
so many people here.

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:14.140
I've got the absolute privilege
to introduce Brent

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.380
Hoberman to you, who is, well,
a bit of a personal hero of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.750
mine, having been through the
dot-com boom and bust myself.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.070
We almost worked together, in
fact, with a company called

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.270
QXL.com, before Brent left
to found Lastminute.com.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.520
So he probably made quite
a smart move.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.160
Anyway, Brent probably needs no
introduction, but just to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.260
summarize the journey
he's been on--

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.860
obviously, you know, I'm sure,
about lastminute.com and its

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.930
incredible success.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.640
But he's gone on then to found
mydeco, PROfounders.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.360
They're an investment company
who have built the likes of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.430
onefinestay and Made.com.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.350
He sits on the board of the
likes of TalkTalk, the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.390
Guardian Media Group, and
recently, easyCar.com.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
So he continues to be very
much an entrepreneur.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.380
So if you'll join me
in welcoming Brent.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.820
Thank you.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.086
[APPLAUDING]

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:15.570
BRENT HOBERMAN: Great.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.490
Thank you, guys.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820
So I think Rick had suggested
that, first I talk about the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.120
actual-- because many of you are
very entrepreneurial and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.020
an entrepreneurial company,
maybe talk about the actual

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.050
startup bit and what that was
like then, and I guess maybe

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.450
what it's like now, because of
some of the more recent ones

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.470
that I've done.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.400
So it was a long time ago when
we started Lastminute.com.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.040
It was actually, I think, '96
I had the idea for it.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.050
And the idea was based--

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.070
I guess that's important, too,
is where do the ideas for

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.420
these things come from.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.950
And this was very much
based on the fact

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.200
that I'm late today--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.520
I've always been late--

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.000
and literally, procrastination
and the fact of putting off

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.650
tomorrow what I can
do today was a

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.270
personal character trait.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.820
It also started because I was
at a strategy consultancy

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.109
which was not a bad
place to be-- one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.150
called Spectrum Strategy--

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.600
where we just worked on
media and telecoms.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.950
So we worked on, back in '95,
I think a company called

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.730
ViewCall, which was a bit like,
I guess, Microsoft Web

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.740
TV before that, if you remember
Web TV and trying to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.020
put shopping onto TV sets.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.320
It didn't work, but I was very
lucky to be consulting on it,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.940
and then thinking, god, this
e-commerce thing-- this idea

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.370
of shopping online or on a TV
set and electronically--

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.610
to a strategy consultant, it
just seemed so damn obvious

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.510
that it's a good idea.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.540
And then I thought,
in '96, well, why

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.700
aren't I buying online?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.770
Because I'm a classic
early adopter.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.500
Even my kids think I-- basically
every gadget that's

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.450
going, including today
the UP and whatever.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.770
So I thought, well, what would
I do and what would I buy?

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.080
So it really just
started as that.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.990
I just thought, well,
I would do

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.750
everything at the last minute.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.630
And there must be a logic.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.215
And then when you thought about
that more and more, and

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:10.340
I drew that one piece of paper
which one often does with

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.550
bubbles of what could you
do at the last minute--

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.320
everything, actually, including
some stuff we never

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.840
got to, like information,
actually.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.540
But the initial premise
was going away, going

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.410
out, staying in.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.150
So it included ideas like
DVD rental, like

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.240
restaurant food delivery.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.770
We even bought-- it's an
interesting thing.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.616
At many points, we
were too early.

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:35.660
And a good example of that
probably was the acquisition

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.080
of Urbanbite, which
was a restaurant

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.810
food delivery service.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.820
In probably 2000,
we bought them.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.090
And then since then, obviously,
many of you who

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.220
will be familiar with, I guess,
GrubHub in the States

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.620
or Just-Eat here or
Delivery Hero--

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.530
these are $100 million
plus companies.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.470
But probably a lesson that
Lastminute.com did do-- one

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.680
lesson is we tried to do,
probably, too much.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.090
Partly, that sort of worked,
because I was slightly insane

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.410
at the time-- much younger, no
kids for most of it, and no

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.860
wife for a bit of it, so
working obsessively.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.990
And so in the end, we ended up
across 14 countries and going

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.700
public and all that.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.579
But I guess going back to that
early start up bit that's,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.790
again, more relevant--

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.630
so I had the idea, then thought
about it, discussed it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.280
with a friend.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.070
He wrote down a few pages on
it because he was much

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.690
brighter than me.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.850
He was working with me at
Spectrum Strategy Consultants.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.490
He was much brighter, so
he had lots of time.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.156
He didn't need to do the
consultancy work for more than

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:37.620
a few hours a day because most
of his work was done.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.590
And then he wrote down--

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.105
a guy called Rogan
Angelini-Hurll, an

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:42.030
old friend of mine.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.000
And he wrote down some
stuff on it.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.070
And then we decided--

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.250
well, I looked at it and
thought, god, the internet.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.480
This was in '96.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.990
There's hardly anyone on it.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.490
It's a bit of a niche
of a niche--

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.760
in other words, online travel,
online leisure, people aren't

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.660
doing this at all.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.000
And I don't really understand
the internet, either, at that

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.260
point in '96.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.960
I bought a book from
Amazon US, and that

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.590
was most of my knowledge.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.690
And I'd actually also done a
study for cable and wireless

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.100
voice over IP, where I did--

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.090
again, not knowing
any of these.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.180
It's quite important sometimes
not to know anything.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.770
I said, this is really going
to happen and really be

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.820
important, not really
understanding why or the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.100
technologies behind it.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.620
Cable and wireless-- all their
guru technologists said, no.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.780
Here's why it won't happen.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.820
And obviously, the muppet was
right and the guru was wrong,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.990
which I think often happens.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.950
I'm not saying that I'm often
right, but I think too much

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.290
knowledge is one
of my mantras--

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.100
that I think if you know too
much about something, you

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.880
don't do it.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.752
Thomas Cook didn't do
Lastminute.com because they

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:43.460
knew too much.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.310
And that's important.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.840
So what happened is then
we shelved the idea

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.960
for a couple of years.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.580
I then went and thought, well, I
really do like reading about

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.960
the internet and learning about
the internet, so I need

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.410
to go and do it.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.490
So I spent six months at
LineOne, which is the internet

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.350
service provider owned by BT and
News Corp doing biz dev--

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.490
very powerful for somebody
who was 25 years old--

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.750
fantastic in that you could
ring up any company.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.220
So I'd ring up eBay or On Sale--
which was the other big

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.840
online auction site at the
time-- and say, I want to look

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.840
at your model for Europe,
that sort of stuff.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.490
And because it was BT and News
Corp, they would talk--

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.370
not because it was me,
the 25-year-old kid

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.010
who didn't know much.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.270
And so it meant I had this
amazing overview.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.210
I then met Tim Jackson,
who founded QXL, at

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.870
a Red Herring event--

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.950
saw him speak when the company
was just him, thought, hey,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.560
I've been looking at this
online auction thing.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.160
And here's somebody's who's
going ahead and doing it.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.220
So I spoke to him, using, of
course, the initial intro of

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.640
BT and News Corp and why don't
we partner with him?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.060
In the end, we didn't
partner with him.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.830
I just said, well, why
don't I join you?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.900
It ended up I was the
first employee--

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.020
but I'd like to think
part of the

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.950
founding team, I remember--

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.570
searching on some search
engine then--

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.940
It wasn't Google--

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.150
for online and software and
finding Blue Duck software.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.580
So we replaced what he
was trying to write

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.680
with Blue Duck software.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.020
And we had an auction
platform even then.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.240
But then after four months, Tim
and I very quickly fell

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.790
out, which was very lucky for
me, because then I just went

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.530
straight away after that--
having seen four months of

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.500
QXL, seeing that online auctions
were working, seeing

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.860
e-commerce was working, thinking
I knew a lot more

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.770
than I did, I thought, right
now, I'm going back to that

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.810
Lastminute idea.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.520
Lastminute.co.uk was registered,
and was actually

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.620
my non-compete with QXL,
as an exception.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.870
I said, right, I want the
exception to be able to do

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.260
Lastminute.co.uk.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.220
Tim thought it was
a terrible idea.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.410
So he was like, fine,
go for it.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.880
You can have that in
your non-compete.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.550
I actually tried to get Baroness
Lane Fox, as she's

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.290
now called as of today, Martha
Lane Fox, to join QXL.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.540
But Tim had a no poach thing,
agreement there.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.530
So I couldn't go leave
and work with her.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.490
So I said, well, don't come
then, because we might want to

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.740
do something together
afterwards.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.260
But then, after I left QXL, I
asked Rogan Angelini-Hurll,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.940
the guy before I'd mentioned
earlier who I'd done the

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.700
initial idea with--

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.300
I said, Rogan, do you
want to do it?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.160
Do you want to leave your
analyst job and all

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
that sort of stuff?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.910
He was doing very well
and decided not to.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.740
I then had dinner with Martha
and my girlfriend at the time,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.470
now my wife.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.309
And Martha made lots of jokes
about needing a geek--

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.580
geeks weren't so chic then--

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.679
and about what a crazy,
crazy idea this was.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.500
And then the next morning, I
rang and I said, you know, I

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.409
wasn't joking.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.020
You should do this.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.280
And so she left Carlton, and
together, we finished up the

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.230
business plan and raised--

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.140
interestingly, at the
time, this was '98,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.810
we raised $1 million.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.790
And our old boss from Spectrum--
because we were

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.970
both at Spectrum.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.600
And our old boss said to us,
who do you know who's two

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.440
really inexperienced people
under 30 who have raised $1

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.240
million for a business plan?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.220
It's so interesting now.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.075
You think of that question, and
I'm sure all of you would

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:13.080
say, I know 10, 20 people
who had done that.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.740
But in that time, we
didn't know anyone.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.150
And almost no one in the
UK had done that.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.500
So he was like, look.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.650
Quite cute, cute idea, but why
don't you come back to us in--

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.540
you can come back to Spectrum
in six months.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.330
Just set yourself a deadline.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.370
If you haven't raised money in
six month, then come back.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.520
So what we then did--
we wrote 20 people.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.390
One of them, Martha and I, we'd
all declined to work at

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.020
Spectrum-- but a very bright guy
called Thomas Hoegh, who

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.800
has since gone on Arts
Alliance to be behind

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.410
companies like LOVEFiLM
and Lastminute.com

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.570
And I refound him through
Planet All, which is

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.070
interesting-- another example of
where you can be too early.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.000
Planet All was, I guess,
Facebook many, many years

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.910
before Facebook.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.950
And Amazon acquired it
and used the team to

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.700
do something else.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.330
But I refound him
through that.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.190
And so we wrote to 20 people.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.390
It wasn't connections.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.900
We didn't really know them.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.870
My dad, actually, invests
in venture capital

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.340
funds in the States.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.250
But he looked at the
business plan.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.650
And this is-- he hates
it when I quote this.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.425
But he said-- because there were
lots of commas missed out

00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:22.310
and all sorts of stuff-- he's
a real detail guy, my dad.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.130
He said, "The only person who
would invest in this business

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.185
plan is someone who's never
read it," which

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.150
I thought was damning.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.760
But he's been very, very
supportive otherwise.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.680
So we sent the plan off to
20 people, including me--

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.320
I remember chasing some guy down
Brompton Road and saying,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.370
let me drop this in your letter
box and whatever.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.030
So of the 20 we wrote to, 10
agreed to see us, and five

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.620
agreed to invest in the end.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.610
The thing that created them
investing in was--

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.680
Arts Alliance were a typical
investor in those days, where

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.680
they were very-- all HBS--

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.180
very analytical, very much
asking for, look, what is the

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.370
number in year three?

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.720
How do you justify
this assumption?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.050
And I was thinking, I used to
write business plans for a

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.370
living, but I know
this is fiction.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.775
So why are you worried about
that assumption in year three?

00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:11.290
And I understand now, as an
investor, how you want to see

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.500
people's logic and
how they work.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.860
But they were not going to get
there until another guy called

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.650
Tom Teichman--

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.130
and I will just tell this
anecdote, because it is quite

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.300
fun and serendipity.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.330
I had clipped from the Guardian,
when I was looking

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.640
for a job, a little
ad for a company

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.450
called New Media People.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.940
And they said they
did recruitment.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.450
And they also did some
investments.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.470
So that clip, that piece of
paper, was still in my wallet.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.900
I then rang up directory
inquiries.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.490
You remember how inefficient
it was then.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.340
Directory inquiries--

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.730
inefficiently good, I
guess, because they

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.630
got the wrong number.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.670
They gave me the number for New
Media Investors, not New

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.060
Media People.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.350
I then rang, spoke to a guy
called Tom Teichman--

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.240
I got straight through to him--
who ran it, and started

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.420
telling him the idea.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.890
And after a couple minutes'
call, he's like, that sounds

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.620
fun and interesting.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.430
Come and see me.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.290
Martha and I went to see him,
and after five minutes, he

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.270
said, I'm in--

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.600
as opposed to the Harvard
Business School

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.610
guys, who were still--

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.490
and we'd seen them
months before.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.490
And they were still
analyzing and

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.650
stressing us out and whatever.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.940
Once he said he was
in, they were in.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.860
Then we got Innovacom, which is
France Telecom's fund, and

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.000
then one of the other
investors,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.820
[INAUDIBLE], got in--

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.590
North Zone from Scandinavia,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.890
So we had this actually really
bizarrely good roster of early

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.650
stage investors for just
this $1 million.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.540
I asked for slightly less at
the beginning, and then

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.660
halfway through the process, I
realized the technology was

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.440
going to cost more.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.640
So I couldn't raise the price,
so I had to sell 40% of the

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.860
company, I think, instead of 33%
is what we were going for,

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.430
for the first round.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.220
I could go on a lot more
about the process.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.340
But then what happened is lots
of disasters and absolute

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.660
roller coaster of
up and down--

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.510
site that really didn't work.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.825
The first thing Martha and I
used to do every day was try

00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:54.030
and buy something, because
it was such a challenge.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.110
And it would so often be down.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.100
It got me into this
real micro--

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.230
probably put me off running a
big tech company ever again,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.360
because I would start to--

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.650
even as we got bigger and when
we had 2,000 people, I would

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.890
still get the sales every 15
minutes on my mobile by text

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.330
message, sales by product
category and conversion rate,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.160
as a way of mainly, by that
point, making sure that the

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.960
tech team would be very
embarrassed if I got to a

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.480
problem before they did, which
unfortunately still happens

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.270
quite a lot.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.710
So that was how that
one started.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.740
And I won't go into too
much of the next bit.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.360
But then we almost ran
out of money many

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.700
times, did bridge loans.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.980
And I learned what a bridge loan
was and stuff like that.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.800
And then luckily, the ramp
of the growth got there.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.760
And then we actually went public
in 18 months after

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.920
going live and two years after
the company was founded--

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.790
I think faster than any other
European company had done.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.320
We raised the price during the
IPO road show more than any

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.730
other European company had done,
which may not have been

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.120
so good, because then
it went down a lot.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.390
Some of you may remember the
share price went down 95%

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.020
after we went public with
revenues of a small pub,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.150
massive losses, but raised
120 million pounds.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.230
Priced on March 10, the
day the market peaked.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.820
March 10, 2000, the day NASDAQ
peaked, is when we priced.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.640
We went up on March 14.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.260
And the first day, the share
price went up a little bit,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.000
and we knew it was all wrong,
because it was meant to go up

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.300
a lot on the first day.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.990
And that day, everyone thought,
god, you guys must be

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.240
feeling on top of the
world or whatever.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.060
And I remember just thinking, I
just feel the pressure of we

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.710
are priced for perfection.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.030
And I actually wrote an article
on the guy who did

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.810
Facebook's IPO--

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.260
not that it was the
same thing.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.700
They're very different
in a million ways.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.800
But I just felt, again, they
were being priced for

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.370
perfection.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.740
I didn't understand why they'd
done it at that price.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.065
But anyway, for us, what
happened is we did raise 120

00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.400
million pounds, which was quite
a bit of money in 2000,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.030
particularly after no one else
could raise any money after

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.140
the bubble burst.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.380
And then we went on to buy 14
companies, launch in, I think,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.530
12 countries, and sold the
business in 2005 to

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.650
Travelocity for over
$1 billion.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.430
And since then, I've done
a few other things.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.120
I started mydeco.com, which was
based on the premise that

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.150
I'd just bought a house after
doing the cliche thing of you

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.480
sell your company, and
then what do you do?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.850
You buy a nice house in
London, probably.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.390
And I did.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.540
And then I thought, how am
I going to do it up?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.730
And even though my wife was an
interior designer, she would

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.020
describe to me what it
would look like.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.730
And I'd say, I can't
visualize this.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.460
Then I'd go and buy that CD
to try and visualize it.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.370
And it was like a sledgehammer
to crack a nut, and without

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.330
real products, as well.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.320
And I thought, this
doesn't work.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.260
And then I went to
some tech guys.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.960
And I said, could you actually
do a 3D tool that needs no

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.200
download and have
real products?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.850
And what would it cost to model
real 3D products in it?

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:03.120
So we crazily raised money and
built 120,000 items in 3D of

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.980
real furniture.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.600
About 700,000 people have
built rooms in it.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.340
That's good, but not great.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.390
Great would be seven
million, really.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.980
I still think it's the best
tool out there for if you

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.550
really want to do something
very simple.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.020
But it's not quite
good enough.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.140
So what we did is we actually
sold it into a company called

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.865
Floor Planner who just work on
B to B and just work on doing

00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:28.470
that sort of stuff.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.720
So we've got a stake in a
very good company there.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.330
And then the other thing that
happened out of mydeco is--

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.000
another thing in the business
plan-- often, it's the things

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.480
in the business plans I
don't do that are the

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.710
best models, actually.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.516
So the one in the Lastminute.com
business plan

00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:44.720
that got taken out was the
TripAdvisor model.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.550
It was why don't we have a
reviews and rating site and

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.360
all that sort of stuff?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.460
And a couple of people said
to me, Brent, you can't do

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.070
everything.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.690
Cut that bit.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.350
I don't understand.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.040
It's too complicated.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.990
Take that bit out, which
was probably

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.010
still the right advice.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.151
I don't think we could have
possibly done one more thing.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.610
But similarly, in the mydeco
plan was the obvious thing of

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.340
how do you disrupt an archaic
industry like

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.170
the furniture industry?

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:09.290
You go direct to manufacturer
and you crowd source.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.770
Hence, the founding of Made.com,
where I did see--

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.589
I hate copycats, but I did
feel I'd had that idea.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.240
Then I did see that there was
a company in France called

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.319
Myfab doing something related.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.150
I thought I was meeting with
Myfab when I finally got to

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.470
one of the founders, Ning Li,
the Chinese co-founder.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.030
And fortunately, when I met
him, he'd just left.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.400
They'd had a little
bust up at Myfab.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.540
And so I said to him, yippee.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.070
Great.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.190
Let's just do this together--

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.590
50-50.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.590
Mydeco will give you all this.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.230
You do it.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.160
And we'll raise third party
money and do it.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.360
And so that was how we did it.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.940
So it was quite a good story of
that model plus the assets

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.680
mydeco could bring.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.690
And also, mydeco put some
people in there.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.000
Some of the co-founders
came from there.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.840
So it's become a
very good team.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.310
And we've raised quite a bit
of money from some good

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.940
investors for that business.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.200
And it's scaling nicely.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.530
Other ideas recently--

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.730
so the other recent one is
another idea I tried to do at

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.530
Lastminute.com in about 2002
or 2003, but the team said

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.920
you'd be nuts was actually
P2P car rental.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.540
It was pretty obvious.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.600
We owned Holiday Autos.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.620
We did seven million car rental
days a year, and always

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.160
fighting with the margins--

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.190
very tough.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.020
Still, car rental actually has
relatively high margins

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.260
compared to lots of the
other travel stuff.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.730
But I still thought this
business might go the way of

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.200
air one day.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.720
So I thought, right.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.130
I've got my car in my drive.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.380
It's not being used.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.270
Why can't other people use it?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.500
And at the time, I think the
key thing was that-- it

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.260
wouldn't have worked then, so it
was lucky the team said no,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.990
because basically, what's
changed is--

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.900
it's Jason Calacanis who's done
this big thing now on--

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.810
the big Sequoia question,
he says, is why now?

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.290
Why is this the right
moment to do it?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.500
So why is now the right moment
for peer to peer car rental?

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.520
And it's all the stuff that
you guys do every day.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.010
It is because you can unlock
your car with a mobile.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.310
You can walk around, you
see where it is,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.840
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.090
You don't have to wait for the
key holding stuff, all that

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.200
sort of stuff.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.530
So the friction goes.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.600
And I think there's also
something about security and

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.140
knowing who people are and
identity and trust and all of

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.010
these factors.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.920
So I went to Stelios and
said, you've got

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.810
this EasyCar business.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.310
We had been talking for
awhile about it.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.220
Why not do P2P?

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.020
And he and I had many
conversations with Rogan,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.360
who's now PROfounders'
capital.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.950
And we decided we would
try it together.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.560
So PROfounders invested.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.920
And I'm on the board of
that one as well.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.395
We have just confidentially
hired a CEO

00:19:52.395 --> 00:19:53.980
who starts next week.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.620
So we're very excited
about that.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.910
So I think we'll start to see
some more traction there,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.960
because initially, we didn't
really have a CEO of the

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.680
business, for various reasons.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.970
But we do now.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.760
So other stuff we've done--

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.810
another investment I mentioned,
the Jawbone UP, but

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.900
the one the more I use this,
the more excited I am.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.210
Don't get me wrong, I love
the Jawbone guys.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.250
But the more I use this, the
more excited I am with the app

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.920
we've invested in, which is
called Moves, because it's

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.510
just an app.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.290
And it tracks.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.060
It does tracking.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.915
I know Google have actually done
something similar with

00:20:27.915 --> 00:20:29.990
Google Now, I think
it's called.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.330
But that seem to be a good focus
for you guys, which is

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.300
good, because all the privacy
guys will get at you and they

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.550
won't get a me.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.930
Moves has been downloaded a
million times in a month.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.030
And it's still very early.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.097
But as I say, it's an app, uses
the accelerometer, et

00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:50.360
cetera, as to how many steps
you've done every day.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.150
And we're very pleased with
that initial launch.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.110
So that's quite an
exciting one.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.450
So otherwise, we've mentioned
some of the boards I'm on--

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.930
Guardian, Timeout, Talk
Talk, EasyCar.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.880
Shazam is another I just
joined recently.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.520
And one other thing I do is a
thing called Founder's Forum

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.900
where we get entrepreneurs
together to brainstorm--

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.420
top entrepreneurs.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.950
And we've just done an event
in LA where we took 80

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.320
companies from the UK to meet
with the best of Hollywood.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.450
We did a brainstorming
with will.i.am--

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.370
a little brainstorming with
him as the futurist.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.065
As you know, he's actually
very good on it.

00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:31.130
So it was really, really
quite fun.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.810
And then next week,
we're doing Rio.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.830
And then we'll do London
after that.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.286
Questions?

00:21:39.286 --> 00:21:40.536
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:44.170
John.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.484
Hi.

00:21:45.484 --> 00:21:46.734
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:01.680
BRENT HOBERMAN: Yeah.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.730
Sorry.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.680
The question was too much
info can be a bad thing.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.220
And how do we cope with--

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.180
sometime's not.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:09.880
BRENT HOBERMAN: Yeah.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.460
Sorry.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.950
I got it, I've just been
told to repeat the

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.110
question for the mic.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.680
Sorry.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.290
Yeah.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.020
So I first try and say--

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.610
if anyone's pitching us, I think
the first thing is just

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.360
can you convince me to use it,
that I would use it, that I

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.260
need it very quickly?

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.660
Or if I don't need it because
it's targeted at women or

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.990
whatever, can you help me
understand very quickly that I

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.240
know lots of people who would?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.720
And it's amazing the number of,
firstly, ideas that we get

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.520
that don't go through
that very simple,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.610
damn obvious thing.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.030
The second thing is I do think
there is, for entrepreneurs,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.540
there's salesmanship,
there's logic flow.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.260
There's all sorts of other
things that doing those

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.000
spreadsheets do help
with and validate.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.760
So I guess it's having a balance
of who's on the team.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.430
So Rogan, who I mentioned on
PROfounders, is extremely

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.300
numerate, way more numerate
than I, and just loves

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.450
spreadsheets.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.650
I'm allowed to say
that publicly.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.320
He does.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.320
So I think it's a
good balance.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.960
But I always tell him, look, I'm
really not interested in

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.910
what their four year plan
is, because it's wrong.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.580
I want to understand what the
team is, where the passion is,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.840
and where the consumer
need is.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.530
And is it big enough?

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.110
So those are the
sort of things.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.790
But genuinely, so often, I think
the entrepreneur's best

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.240
friend is that blind optimism
and willful ignorance that

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.170
makes you go through stuff and
go overcome challenges.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.600
And the other point is if we'd
known how hard Lastminute.com

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.830
was going to be, how hard it was
going to be to build that

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.080
website, how close we'd be to
running out of money because

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.420
the website didn't basically
work, how hard it would be,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.950
how actually insane it was for
British Airways to say yes to

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.900
us in the beginning
when they had 50%

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.020
domestic market share--

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.260
and a lot of them didn't really
want the business,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.210
didn't want Lastminute inventory
to be boosted.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.520
So if you knew enough about the
industry, you'd say, well,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.380
actually, BA logically
will say no to you.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.500
And therefore, you haven't
got a business.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.770
So you have to just be blindly
optimistic, come

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.790
at it another way.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.780
I guess the way we came out
with them is like--

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.640
this internet thing.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.230
You want to look smart to
your bosses, right?

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.750
Because there's this internet
thing out there and a few

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.490
people are talking about.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.730
So we'll give you free R&amp;D. It's
not going to work, our

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.350
thing, of course not.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.690
But we'll give you free R&amp;D.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.520
And we'll work with faxes,
which people

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.950
criticized us hugely.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.400
I remember lots of people
telling us we were idiots

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.690
because we worked with faxes and
there's this actual online

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.250
company and a fax line.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.200
And I'm like, because it was the
only way to work with BA,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.215
because BA, for tiny a operator,
for example--

00:24:29.215 --> 00:24:30.440
and many of the airlines--

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.590
wouldn't build an EDI link for
you if you were selling 10

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.510
seats a week.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.000
So you have to say, give me
a better rate this way.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.400
So I think that ignorance
helps you

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.070
overcome your problems.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.150
But it's instinct as well.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.780
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.760
This is really weird.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.100
So you said that you'd been
ahead of the market a few

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.580
times as an innovator
and entrepreneur.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.730
When you look at the market
where it is now, from an

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.080
investor's perspective, from a
chairman and getting involved

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.390
on boards, et cetera, how
do you spot and identify

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.400
companies that are ahead
of the market?

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.250
And do you come across ideas
now that you think are way

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.760
ahead of the market but that you
wish you could invest them

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.980
because you know
there's a need?

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.770
BRENT HOBERMAN: Yeah.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:21.510
That's a really good question.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.450
So what ideas are ahead of the
market and do we see that are

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.520
too far ahead that you might
still want to do?

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.930
I guess robotics is
an obvious one.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.720
As I said, I love to meet-- the
reason why I got into the

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.650
internet and the whole thing
was I just love gadgets.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.950
I remember in '96 looking at a
robot hand across the world,

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.410
and you could control it from a
computer, and thinking, wow.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.940
So I still think robotics today
is one where you see a

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.740
lot of these video conferencing
robots that run

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.350
around rooms.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.090
And I get them to present to
things like Founder's Forum.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:55.740
I think it's slightly
nuts, but I love it.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.150
But when you think of what it
means for manufacturing and

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:58.880
all that sort of stuff.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.760
3D printing is another one that
we've had for years, and

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.710
I've been tracking
it for years.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.240
And obviously, we've done 3D
printer products, actually.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.680
We've run competitions for
designers to build products

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.110
that, then, Alessi would
actually make.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.990
So we did that at mydeco.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.510
You'd print it 3D, and
then Alessi would

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.760
then make it properly.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.500
So I think, then, it's just
understanding what do these

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.150
trends really mean?

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.615
So we've looked at-- and there's
mass customization.

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:24.990
There's an ex-Googler, Anastasia
Leng, who many of

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.630
you will know--

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.540
Makeably, looking
at that model.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.170
And when you look at that sort
of model, you say, I love the

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.005
idea of mass customization, but
is it too early for all

00:26:34.005 --> 00:26:35.600
that sort of stuff?

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.880
And then I think you just
have to look at

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.170
the longer term trends.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.450
And in that case,
is the pricing--

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.370
is it disruptive enough
is another thing.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.450
Often, I don't like the
ones which are just

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.340
not disruptive enough.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.840
Other trends, I think, other
spaces we love that we haven't

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.050
done enough-- online
education.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.320
Another thing I am--

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.480
I've got to say this proudly,
because I still

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.160
believe in the brand.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.510
But in this country, you
normally have to be

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.270
embarrassed about it.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.815
But I'm also on the board of
Eton or the governor of Eton

00:27:04.815 --> 00:27:06.810
and looking at their
online strategy or

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.632
online education strategy.

00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:12.460
And I think that's a whole
area which you all know.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.910
And many of the big US gurus
will say, kids, when you look

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.860
at your university, make sure
that they've got enough money

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.830
to last you through that three
or four year course, because

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.810
they might be bust by the
end of it, is, I think--

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.100
I can't remember--

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.760
one of the US guru's
views on it.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.990
So I think these
are areas where

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.220
you'll see massive change.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.510
And med tech is the other one.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.920
I think there was a TED Talk
yesterday I just saw tweeted

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.910
about, which--

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.770
apologies-- but analyzes your
pee through your iPhone and to

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.760
help your health.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.700
I think there's others ones
where you lick something on

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.720
your iPhone and analyze your
glucose levels and all that

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.340
sort of stuff.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.360
So there's got to be incredible
innovation there.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.850
I think both those sectors,
though, are really hard,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.110
because you've got regulation,
governments, and

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.150
philanthropists, actually.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.490
Philanthropy is probably
the enemy of the

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.450
online education model.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.370
We're in two of them.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:08.770
One, Mangahigh, where you learn
maths by playing games,

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.590
and which is a great idea that
the only challenge-- the real

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.840
challenge is, is Salman Khan
or Bill Gates going to give

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.880
that stuff away for free?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.860
And then the other one we're
doing is busuu, an online

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.270
language learning network,
social language learning,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.250
which has got 25 million
people signed up to it.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.270
So those sort of things like
language learning are great.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:31.240
I guess you could look at the
disruptive and say, well, will

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.290
Google Translate do away with
language learning need?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.430
But I don't think--

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.403
I think people will
still always

00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:36.706
want to learn a language.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.260
AUDIENCE: I was wondering to
what extent it's important for

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.630
startups to be able to generate,
quickly, revenue and

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.550
to be sustainable quickly.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.370
Because when you look at the
press, all the startups that

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.750
lose a lot of money, all these
companies go public, they're

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.020
actually not profitable.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.960
So I was wondering if there's
other criteria, or if you

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.870
think the market
is just wrong.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.160
BRENT HOBERMAN: Yeah.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.531
How quickly do you need to
make money as a startup?

00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:11.600
I actually had--

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.580
I don't think it would be too
secretive to say, in the Moves

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.000
meeting-- and I could
be wrong.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.560
So I had the meeting with
the Moves guy yesterday.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.610
And they'd been talking about,
in their product pipeline,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.010
doing lots of premium--

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.930
the old premium model.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.680
You give it away free,
and then premium.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.810
And then they said to me, look,
actually, we think we've

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.780
validated enough of this that
we're just going to go for it

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.470
and not worry about
the premium stuff.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.540
And I said, yippee, because I
wanted them to have 10 million

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.890
downloads before they start
worrying about how to monetize

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.520
it, because monetizing from a
million downloads and the 1%

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.780
who's going to pay for
whatever-- it's

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.630
just not worth it.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.320
And to be honest, there is
something about market.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.620
There are enough--

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.010
the logical thing is if there
are enough investors who will

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.660
pay for traction, then you
should go for traction,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.870
because otherwise,
your competitor's

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.050
going to kill you.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.950
Because the other point is
there's a US company that

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.760
wants to do what these
guys are going to do

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.340
that's after them--

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.780
but if they're starting to price
for key features like,

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.560
say, calorie counting, then the
US company says, yippee,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.590
I'm going to offer
that for free.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.420
And I'll get Sequoia to
give me $30 million.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.330
And I don't need to worry about
money for five years.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.920
So I think you've also
got-- there's

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.970
the competitive dynamic.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.090
Of course, I understand profit
and all that sort of stuff.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.530
And I understand it's
a good thing.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.740
And if you have one of those
rare business models that you

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.550
can do it all, fantastic.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.190
But I think if the market's
going to pay for traction,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.850
then somebody else is going to
get paid for that, and you're

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.330
going to limit your traction
if you're trying to eat too

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.090
much money out before
you're big enough.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.840
And it's not enough money anyway
when you're small that

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.570
it's worth worrying about.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.330
But equally, we have other
businesses like Made.com,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.550
which we run much tighter.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.380
We're not at the old Buy.com
model or Zalando, dare I say

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.420
it, where we try and
lose money on

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.840
every incremental sale.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.920
But we do still pay a lot of
attention to lifetime value.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.742
In other words, do we have to
make money on the first sale?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.490
This PPC is so expensive.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.180
[LAUGHING]

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.210
BRENT HOBERMAN: I know.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.680
I'm glad that Graham from QuBit
is explaining to them--

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.670
or that they're all muppets,
if you've read his article.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.870
Hopefully, that will depress
PPC prices and we'll--

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:24.892
well, some of us will be happy.

00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:27.490
[LAUGHING]

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:27.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, Brent.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.390
Thanks for coming in.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.120
You talked briefly about your
role as an educator and

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.540
evangelizing computer science.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.090
When do you think computer
science will become part of

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.370
the core curriculum alongside
English, maths, and science?

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.860
Because I think it will do.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.140
BRENT HOBERMAN: It's funny.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.585
It's a really good question
about computer science being a

00:31:46.585 --> 00:31:47.665
core part of the curriculum.

00:31:47.665 --> 00:31:49.830
Weirdly, and I was having this
discussion with Sherry Coutu,

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.310
who some of you will know,
yesterday, actually, because

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.550
Sherry is doing something which
Google will probably be

00:31:55.550 --> 00:32:00.660
involved in, I think, to
encourage people who have

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.360
studied STEM to talk to schools
and excite them about

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.700
that career choice.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.600
I think people like will.i.am
can do a lot more than me--

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.360
him going and saying, I'm going
to study programming and

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.105
this idea of geek chic
I alluded to earlier.

00:32:18.105 --> 00:32:21.950
I think people like that,
saying-- and actually,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.650
Christian Hernandez tweeted
it yesterday.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.280
There's a Code.org video on
the web now with Gates and

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.210
people and basketball
players or whatever

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.570
saying, coding is cool.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.450
However, from my ignorance
point of view, I actually

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.260
didn't code.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.380
I coded in Basic when I was 12
or 13 and wrote some basic

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.200
games in Basic--

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.590
very basic.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.780
I wasn't that good
at it, though.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.200
I did it, fortunately,
with another guy

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.360
who was much better.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.410
But I don't know
what he's done.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.290
So my view is I actually went
and studied-- weirdly, I did

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.620
French and German literature and
went to Oxford, where, to

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.610
be honest, I think the only
thing I really learned that

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.840
was useful was being taught to
think laterally and to cram

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.210
incredibly, and to analyze a
huge amount of information

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.330
between midnight and 3:00 AM the
night before very quickly.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.820
So I think those sort
of skills actually

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.940
are also very useful.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.560
However, yes, I still think
learning kids to code--

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.740
but I'm not so obsessed that--

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.090
I have a 10-year-old daughter.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.540
And I haven't--

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.740
at school, they have pushed,
and I've helped them push

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.490
CoderDojo or one of those
into the school.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.760
But my daughter didn't
want to do it, and I

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.580
didn't push her to it.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:33.540
She's definitely good on playing
apps, but less on--

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.040
so I don't think it's key.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.900
I think the other interesting
point about this is going

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.850
back-- sorry to sound starstruck
about will.i.am.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.070
But the other thing he's added
that I thought was very

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.890
interesting is that he is on
this campaign to add to STEM--

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.420
STEM is now STEAM.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.660
So I don't know if you guys
have come across this

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.030
expression, STEAM.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.770
So STEAM is where you
add the A into STEM.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.340
So you say, it's
not just STEM.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.440
You need to put arts
into there as well.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.020
And that's really what
kids need to learn.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.150
And I think that will give
you the creative element.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.870
And I guess if people
want to talk about--

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.560
I guess they mentioned Jack
Dorsey and Steve Jobs as the

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.340
sort of brain that have the
right brain, left brain.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.489
And so I think that saying
that bits of

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:12.400
both sides are good.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.320
But I think the key thing,
actually, for kids is to do

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.030
whatever they're most passionate
about and what

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.442
they're best at.

00:34:19.442 --> 00:34:20.692
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.670
Back in your previous days
when you were pitching

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.550
Lastminute, did you ever go to
an investment or a VC or an

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.580
incubator and say,
this is our idea?

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.460
And then did they ever ask you,
well, what's your value

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.360
add if you're not actually
coding and providing the

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.289
programming?

00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:41.150
Have you ever come
across that?

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:41.650
BRENT HOBERMAN: It's funny.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:42.500
I guess there is--

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.980
I still don't see it, because
I think it's all about

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.080
building teams, right?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.070
And I think the first value add,
I would argue, is can you

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.210
hire the right people?

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.120
So I think the thing that, to
be honest-- not to sound

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.520
self-congratulatory
or something--

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.090
but the thing that got people
about Martha and I at the very

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.380
beginning was just these two
nutters were so passionate and

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.970
excited about what they were
doing that I think they

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.490
thought other people
would follow us.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.040
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.770
BRENT HOBERMAN: And probably,
also, we were smart enough to

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.000
know we didn't know.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.910
So the fact that I wasn't
a techie, but

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.080
actually, I love tech.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:20.100
So I do know how to talk to
techies, mainly that I would

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.760
go to them and say, this can't
take eight months.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.730
It's really a whole load of if
statements, and how does it

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.420
take that long?

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.690
So I was a little
bit dangerous.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:30.510
And I did make--

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.020
I think my real claim to fame
is in CIO Magazine, I was

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:40.190
rated as the third hardest CEO
to work for, for the CTO--

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.410
the third most impatient
and most unreasonable--

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.150
so I think having a level of
unreasonableness, and a

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.130
dangerous enough amount.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.070
But what was it about this?

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:55.000
Also, for me, it was, could
I look at a web page and

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.860
understand a bit about
what's behind it?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.570
What would really need--
and ask the right

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.140
questions of the techies.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.240
So it was very much--

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.870
the dangers that would happen
at Lastminute as we got

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.560
bigger-- we put in these project
management layers.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.000
And then I always cite the
example where I got into one

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
meeting where they told me this
project was going to take

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.580
eight months.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.800
And I was like, it just can't.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.920
It's not that--

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.490
it just doesn't seem
that hard.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.570
And then when I got into asking
the right questions of

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.760
the techies, I was like,
this is obvious.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.030
Which are the bits that
are really so hard?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.430
They described one bit.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.110
And I'm like, OK.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.670
Brilliant, because I
don't need that.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.720
We can get to that later if
it's really successful.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.470
That bit--

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.980
and then what was eight months
became two months.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.580
And then a project that you
would have said the ROI is too

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.025
risky or whatever suddenly
becomes very viable.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.450
So I think that's a lot of the
skill is knowing how to ask

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.600
those questions.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.070
And the problem it becomes
is you get lost

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.320
between all those layers.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.060
So looking at your various
startups, where do you think

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.100
the biggest hurdle is in terms
of number of users?

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.760
Is it from zero to 500, 500 to
1,000, or 5,000 to a million?

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.640
Where's the biggest challenge?

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.450
BRENT HOBERMAN: We often
talk about where--

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.600
it depends on the type
of company, right?

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.420
Is there a natural cap
out in some areas?

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.475
And some of our companies, we've
been looking at what's

00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:21.540
happening on the market
and thinking,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.300
god, does it cap out?

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.040
I still think that if you've got
a really good management

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.205
team, momentum is a very
addictive thing.

00:37:30.205 --> 00:37:31.730
So you can keep building
on it.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.910
So whatever defines momentum in
your space-- it's different

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.890
numbers in different
sectors, right?

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.990
But if you've got momentum and
you've got good enough

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.670
leadership-- so let's take
the Moves example.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.380
They've got to a million.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.500
Now, partly, granted, a lot of
that is that initial burst of

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.730
Apple store promotion.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.910
So can they now build
on the momentum?

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.440
Can they build an Android
app fast enough?

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.520
And can they then get
the right people in

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.300
to build upon it?

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.360
So I actually think that's
still the hardest bit, is

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.080
getting from naught to that few

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.730
hundred thousand or whatever.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.440
And that's the bit where
I'm most relieved.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.030
I still think there will be
a time now where that will

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.100
probably flatten for a bit.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.660
But I think during that time,
they'll have enough of a

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.450
validation story to get more
great people, to get more

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.285
great investors, and to take
it to the next level.

00:38:14.285 --> 00:38:15.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.660
RICK JONES: Thank you
very much, Brent.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:22.513
[APPLAUSE]
