00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.568
As we go to our next game,

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:05.471
Super Hashtag Wars 2:
Turbo Championship Edition!

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:08.641
Yes! Yes!

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.911
It's too intense!

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:14.113
The HashtagWars are
the cornerstone of<i> @midnight.</i>

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.083
All three of you have proven
yourselves time and time again

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.584
to be true hashtag warriors.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.787
That's why we're raising
the stakes with tonight's game,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.391
Super Hashtag Wars 2:
Turbo Championship Edition!

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.261
Very excited about this.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.196
-I don't know
if I'm gonna make it. -Yeah.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.898
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.001
A little something we crafted
in the old<i> @midnight</i> labs.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:37.870
Instead of a single topic, this
will be a dynamic hashtag game.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.473
The hashtag could change at any
time, and you won't know when.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:44.010
So let's get ready to pun-ble!

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.814
Very excited.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.849
We're gonna start with
the very first hashtag game

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.484
we ever played on this program.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.986
Also was a little assist
on this one

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.254
from our good friend
John Hodgman.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.989
So thanks to John,
wherever you are.

00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.626
#FilmPoops.
#FilmPoops.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.862
These are movies that sound like
they could be poops.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.731
Examples might be
<i> 2 Fast, 2 Furious,</i>

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.834
uh,<i> The Brown Bunny,
 Children of the Corn.</i>

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.335
You get it.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.938
Don't forget, the hashtag
will change at any time,

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.774
uh, based on my whims.
So let us begin!

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.075
Start the clock!

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.543
