1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,760
Remember me.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,683
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,890
I am the fallen soldier,
sailor, airman, and marine.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,710
I am the one that held the line.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,700
Sometimes I volunteered.
Sometimes I went because I was told to go,

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,230
but when the nation called,
I answered

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,340
in order to serve,
I left behind the family,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,850
friends and freedom that
so many take for granted.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,100
Over time I use different weapons.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,660
Yeah,

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,150
a sword, a musket, a bayonet,

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,660
a rifle or a machine gun.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,650
Often I marched into battle on foot,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,550
countless miles across all continents.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,170
I had little water and even less food,

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,640
but it did not matter.
We had a job to do.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,610
Other times I wrote a battle
on horseback or in wagons,

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,620
sometimes on trains later in
tanks or jeeps or Humvees.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,950
In early wars, my ships were made
of wood and powered by the wind.

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,890
Later they were made of steel and
powered by diesel fuel or the atom.

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,800
I even took to the air and
mastered the sky in planes,

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,750
helicopters and jets.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,650
The machines of war evolved
and changed with the Times.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,210
Yeah,

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,340
but remember that it was always me,

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,720
the warrior that had to
fight our nation's enemies.

27
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,060
I fought at Lexington and
Concord as our nation was born,

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,650
I crossed the Delaware on Christmas
day in 1776 freedom was on our side.

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,780
Yeah,

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,780
I defended the Chattahoochee river in
the war of 1812 I would stand again

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,220
in the civil war.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I fought with my brothers and against
my brothers at Gettysburg and Shiloh and

33
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,044
bull run.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,470
I learned that we must never again divide

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,320
in world war one. I marched on the
Marne and held the line at Bellwood,

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,500
the war to end all wars.
They called it.

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,290
I just called it hell

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,210
in World War I fought everywhere from
the beaches of Normandy and the battle of

39
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:55,900
the bulge to the sands of Whoa
Jima and the hell of Guadalcanal.

40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,830
I stood against

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,040
and kept darkness from
consuming the world.

42
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,810
In Korea. I landed at Inchon and
broke out of the chosen reservoir.

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,290
They called it the forgotten war,

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,250
but I never forgot.
In Vietnam,

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,840
I went had I fought

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,410
in the Mekong Delta and I drank
and case on and Hamburger Hill.

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,100
Some say my country wavered,

48
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,030
but I did not waver
ever

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,020
in the recent past. I fought
in Grenada, Panama, Somalia,

50
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,300
and other desperate
places around the globe.

51
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,360
Then finally,

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,360
I have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan
in Baghdad and Fallujah and Ramadi.

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:00,630
Yeah,

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,610
in Coonara and Helmand and Kandahar

55
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,920
as technology advanced,

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,160
I use night vision goggles and global
positioning systems and drones and lasers

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,940
and thermal optics,

58
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,520
but it was still me or human
being that did the work.

59
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah.

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,110
It was me that patrolled up the mountains
or across the desert or through the

61
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:31,010
streets. It was me that suffered in
the merciless heat and the bitter cold.

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,720
It was me that went out night after night
to confront our nation's enemies and

63
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:41,330
confront evil face to face.

64
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,240
It was me.
Remember me?

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,050
I was a warrior,

66
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,770
but also remember

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,250
that I was not only a warrior,

68
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,140
I was not just a soldier,
sailor, airman, or marine.

69
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,350
Remember also
that I was a son,

70
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,310
a brother,
a father.

71
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,900
I was a daughter. A
sister. A mother, yeah.

72
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,153
How was a person

73
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,960
like you? A real person with
hopes and dreams for the future?

74
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,590
I wanted to have children.

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,670
I wanted to watch my children grow up.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,460
I wanted to see my son's score a
touchdown or shoot the winning basket.

77
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,590
I want it to walk my
daughter down the aisle.

78
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,440
I wanted to kiss my wife again.

79
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I wanted to grow old with her and be there
to hold her hand when life grew hard.

80
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,460
When I told her I would be with
her until the end, I meant it

81
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,550
when I told my children,
I would always be there for them.

82
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,293
I meant it.

83
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,980
Yeah,

84
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,420
but I gave all that away.

85
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,830
Yeah.

86
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,360
All of it.
On that distant battlefield,

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,310
on some God forsaken patch of dirt
amongst the fear and the fire and the

88
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,144
bullets,

89
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,490
or in the sky above enemy
territory filled with fatal flack

90
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,790
or in the unforgiving.

91
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:55,791
See where we fought against the enemy
and against the depths of the abyss

92
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,180
there
in those awful places,

93
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,590
I held the line,

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,870
I did not waver and I did not hesitate.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,233
Aye,

96
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,500
the soldier, sailor, airman or marine.

97
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,220
I stood my ground and sacrificed my life,

98
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,040
my future, my hopes, my
dreams. I sacrificed everything

99
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,093
for you

100
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,870
this memorial day.
Remember me?

101
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,853
Yeah,

102
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,800
the fallen warrior,
Ben,

103
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,310
remember me? Not For
my sake, but for years.

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,630
Remember what I sacrificed.

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,220
So you can truly appreciate the
incredible treasures you have.

106
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,920
Life,
liberty,

107
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,700
the pursuit of happiness.

108
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,610
Do you have the joys of life,
the joys that I gave up?

109
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,090
Yeah.

110
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,350
So that you can relish in them.

111
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,280
Cool breeze in the air,

112
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,050
the gentle spring grass on your bare feet,

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,180
the warm summer sun on your face.
Family,

114
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,990
friends
that freedom.

115
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,790
Never forget where it all came from.
It came from sacrifice,

116
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,130
the supreme sacrifice.

117
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,353
Don't waste it.

118
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,470
Don't waste any of your
time on this earth.

119
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,930
Live a life that honors the
sacrifice of our fallen heroes.

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,370
Remember them always

121
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,870
and make every day
memorial day.
