00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
I'm Beacher Wiggins,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.270
director for acquisitions
and bibliographic access.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
And we want to welcome you
to another in the series

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.300
of library services LCs digital
future and you that has been

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.490
and continues to be coordinated

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.530
by Angela Kinney
and Judith Cannon.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.940
And this particular one they
had to expend extra energy

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.490
because I confused them with
my timing and my availability.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.040
So I express extra thanks
for today's session.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.470
Today we want to update you
on where we are with BIBFRAME.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.110
We won't have formal
introductions, we'll have each

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.260
of us introduce ourselves as
we speak and there will be four

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.550
of us by the end of the session.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.510
I will be the briefest of all,
you will be pleased to hear.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
[ Phone Ringing ]

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.580
[ Laughter ]

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.880
Excuse me.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.460
Is this being recorded?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.730
BIBFRAME has been underway
now, the BIBFRAME pilot

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.270
and pilot 2 has been underway
now for almost a year.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.090
And we've been, the staff who've
been involved have been using

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.900
the BIBFRAME 2.0 model.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.200
We launched this pilot to
test the library's approach

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.290
to linked open data using
the RDF resource description

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.920
format structure.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.990
We are at a point now where we
are assessing the pilot based

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.070
on the work of the 60
or so staff members

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.940
who have been participating
in this

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.450
for the past 11 or so months.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
These staff have been
cataloguing their materials

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.730
that they received on a regular
basis daily using BIBFRAME.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.420
And in most instances,
they are also continuing

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.510
to catalog those materials
using the MARC format.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.930
So there's been a lot of
contribution on the part

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.770
of participants who
have taken part in this.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.690
Before we depart next week

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.830
for the American Library
Association annual conference

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.310
in New Orleans we
will issue a report

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.130
of what we've learned during
the pilot based on the input,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.110
the feedback and the
output of the participants.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.670
Staff in the network development

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.140
and MARC standards
office net dev

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.930
and in COIN are frantically
now putting together the final

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.960
touches on the report
for my review.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.480
Based on our report and
assessment we also want

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.090
to be able to make some
definitive statements

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.160
about LC's commitment
to BIBFRAME.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.810
Today Nate Trail, Jodi
Williamschen, Les Hawkins

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.340
and I will give you our LC
colleagues an update before we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.190
do similar briefings and updates

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.580
for our external
colleagues in New Orleans.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.500
I'll speak briefly about
the goals of the pilot.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.010
These goals form the framework
of the pilot assessment

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.240
and the report that
will be issued shortly

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.950
that you'll all be seeing.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.990
Nate will address the
BIBFRAME database,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.840
the conversion process,
and related points.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.470
Les and Jodi will focus
on the BIBFRAME editor

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.630
and the changes made
to it for the pilot.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.000
And improvements that were
made during the pilot based

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.960
on the feedback from the
participants engaged in it.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.810
The goals were set from
three perspectives,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.340
mine as the director, net
dev's as the technical lead

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.980
in the project, and COIN
as the training lead.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.270
From my perspective as director
I want us to be to determine

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.210
that BIBFRAME can be applied
to a large participant pool,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.340
i.e. that BIBFRAME will be
scalable and could be adopted

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.830
by institutions of any size.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.100
If the Library of Congress can
do it anyone should be able to.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.960
I want to determine that LC
will indeed pursue BIBFRAME

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.000
as the data pathway and
the ultimate replacement

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.970
for the MARC format.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.260
And lastly, I want to be
able to announce the decision

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.720
to the library and
the vendor community

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.480
because until the
library is able

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.000
to make a firm commitment
we won't get the buy-in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.580
and the system development
that will be needed

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.520
to make BIBFRAME a
viable library community

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.820
format structure.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.250
To reach such a decision
point much work was required

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.380
in the technical arena and the
associated training sphere.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.270
From the net dev perspective
what was desired was a realistic

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.580
cataloging environment
that allow catalogers

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.990
to create bibliographic resource
and authority descriptions

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.620
in BIBFRAME just as
they are able to do

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.980
in the MARC environment.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.770
To achieve this the database
conversion was required,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.970
a database conversion was
required, i.e. MARC to BIBFRAME.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.880
And you'll hear a bit
more about that from Nate.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.370
There are many steps involved
in making this a reality.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.900
The pilot assessment that I
talked about will cover this

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.490
and show how readily
we were able

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.490
to address the various issues
and concerns that were raised.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.230
Associated with the
converted database was a need

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.090
for an input tool,
the BIBFRAME editor

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.690
that will enable catalogers to
handily and easily input data

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.060
for the BIBFRAME descriptions
that they were creating.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.280
Much of the editor improvements
reflected the COIN perspective

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.520
that is from both the teaching
perspective and vantage point,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.380
as well as the ongoing
interaction

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.470
with the pilot participants
and the improvements

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.830
that were made along
the way to the editor.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:59.410
For pilot 2 a lot of
energy and effort went

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.170
into enhancing the editor

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.030
and we hope we'll have a
better tool as we move forward.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.420
And Les and Jodi will talk
more about that shortly.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.980
So now I ask you to stay tuned
for the report and assessment

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.250
that will come out by next week.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:27.920
And now we will hear Nate talk
about the database and some

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.680
of the work associated
with that.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.080
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: Good morning
everyone, I'm glad to see

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.160
that some of us are not
[inaudible] or are we more nerdy

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.460
than we care to admit.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.270
So yeah, I'm going to talk
about the BIBFRAME database

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:04.060
and conversions between MARC and
BIBFRAME, and some other things.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.420
So this is an overview of the
data flow from MARC to BIBFRAME.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.010
First of all, we take
all of our name title

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.610
and title authority records out
of ID and we do a conversion

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.350
from MARC authorities
to BIBFRAME,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.540
convert those to works.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.210
And then we convert all the
MARC records and try to match

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.050
against those name title
authority works and store them

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.720
in the database as well.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.040
And then the BIBFRAME
description circle represents

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.580
where the editor is that you
can natively create a brand-new

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.160
BIBFRAME description or
call something up out

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.240
of the database, edit
it and save it back.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.310
And during all that time
there are links between

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.730
and among the BIBFRAME
database itself and IDloc.gov.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.530
So there's about 1.2 million
title and name title authorities

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.480
that we converted to BIB,
about 17 million BIB records,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.780
and that includes some stuff

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.520
that we don't distribute
outside.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.990
But we wanted to try to
create a catalog just

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.480
like the Voyager catalog
system has so that

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.020
when somebody is doing
descriptions they can call

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.820
up whatever is available
inside the catalog.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.030
We have daily feeds coming
from both ID and the ILS.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.820
And since people are doing
duplicate entry we have

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.120
to be able to block things

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.130
where the cataloger created
it natively in BIBFRAME,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.580
and we don't want the record

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.510
from the ILS to come
back through.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.350
So we're doing a merging
that takes a converted record

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.830
and matches it to
existing BIB records.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.840
And we have also processes
that allow us to validate

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.500
between when a BIBFRAME
description is natively created

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.500
and converted to RDF,
and converted to JSON

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.310
or converted back to XML we
want to be able to validate

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.210
that that is still
a good structure.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.230
So there's a lot of different
processes and workflows

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.600
that we have to maintain
and support,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.310
and places where things can
break all the way through.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.510
So this is a picture of
our cataloging homepage,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.480
it's not the BIBFRAME
database homepage.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.710
It's not particularly meant for
outside users but it can be.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.000
We're focusing on allowing the
cataloger to do their work,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.130
and we're also focusing on
being able to count things for.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.500
When Beecher [assumed
spelling] wants to know how many

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.030
of one thing or how
many of another.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.230
So we want to be able to support
the workflows, but we also want

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.130
to do statistical analysis on
you know what did we get right,

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.670
what did we get wrong,
how can we clean

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.970
up a certain batch of records.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.910
So there's all kinds
of different ways

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.690
of cutting the data once
it's in the BIBFRAME.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.020
Okay so there's keyword
searching,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.580
there's title searching,
name and subject searching.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.980
There are facets once you get
in by language and LC class.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.300
There are all kinds of
filtering by work or instance.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.200
There's is left anchor browsing.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.370
We'll do some of those.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:39.030
So this is a title search for
Babes in Toyland and you can see

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.230
that when you look down the
left these refinements are

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.690
different facets.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.120
So for Babes in Toyland there's
a whole bunch of notated music,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.970
some movies, some
audio, etcetera.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.970
And let's see for left anchor
browsing we can try an imprint.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.090
So these are all the imprints
of Harcourt [assumed spelling]

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.590
and you can see that on
the title page of many

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.240
of these things it's expressed
in a bunch of different ways.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.060
They're probably all the
same publisher but right now

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.660
from the MARC record
this is what we have.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.770
So as we go through these
processes we're probably going

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.380
to go behind the scenes
and say let's see how many

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.860
of these things we can
say are the same publisher

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.860
or from the same
publishing agency

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.250
and link them together better.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.320
But at least this way
we have them in a line

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.610
and you can do quick
analysis of these things.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.370
So the editor is tied tightly
to the database and it allows us

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.090
to take up any description
for editing as long as it's

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.960
within a particular
defined profile.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.430
And the reason for profiles is

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:06.560
that BIBFRAME is a very large
descriptive container set,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.140
but say notated music has a
pretty defined set of things

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.220
that you want to
use to describe.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.030
So the profile allows
us to narrow

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.730
down what we want the
cataloger to be able to do

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.930
and be required to do.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.250
So you can call up the record
and edit its description

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.370
or you can add an
instance or an item.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.450
You can decide that
this particular thing

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.750
that you're working on is linked

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.720
to another description
in the database.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.500
And you can link it to
name authority records

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.390
so that we're not just entering
strings anymore we're actually

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.400
linking to a defined
name authority

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.950
or subject LSH authority,
etcetera.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.670
And then you can store
it back in the database

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.010
and it looks just like
all the other descriptions

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.350
that we already have.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.570
But there are a number of issues

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.050
that we've discovered
as we go along.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.090
We don't have a profile
for every type

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.400
of description that there is.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.890
And when we do a
conversion of a record

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.530
from MARC there isn't really
an exact one-to-one match

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.620
that tells us that this
previously MARC record should

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.330
belong to this BIBFRAME profile.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.710
So when you call up a record
we have to make a decision

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.240
of which profile we're
going to put it into.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.240
And when you do that you make

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.040
that default decision there
are RDF description elements

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.190
that are not available
to be edited then

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.120
in that BIBFRAME profile.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.290
So what do we do with
that information?

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.540
So far, we have said we're going
to keep it and post it back

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.920
but we're not going to allow you
to edit it which is a problem

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.230
for people who want to be able

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.430
to actually edit
the whole thing.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.370
So the editor itself has got
some things that we need to work

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.270
through but we're
discovering these things.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.070
There's a difference
between an IBC update

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.400
and a clone even though it looks

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.130
like you're doing
the same thing.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.440
So if you see an initial
bibliographic control record

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.860
in the database and you want
to call it up and edit it

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.140
and save it back
you're basically trying

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.130
to save the same set
of descriptions back,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.090
a work instance and item.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.420
But if you want to clone
something you want to call

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.750
up that same record but save it
under a different identifier.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.620
So we've had to find ways
to say clone this thing,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.900
give it a new identifier,
probably the LCCN

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.730
and then save it back
completely parallel

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.620
but having basically the same
metadata except for a new title

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.810
or something like that.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.090
And catalogers keep coming up
with new ways of showing us

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.390
that we haven't gotten
it done yet,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.860
so we keep doing new profiles.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.010
So between the database and
the editor then when you call

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.470
up a description we have to
do a little bit of wrangling

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.310
because we store the data in XML

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.300
but the editor wants
to see JSON.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.740
So our RDF has got

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.480
to be expressible in
a variety of ways.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.920
So in the database on any
given record you'll see

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.340
that you can convert it to
all those different things.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:17.400
And I talked little bit
about the profiles being one

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.520
of the mechanisms that are
causing us problems even though

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.040
they let us have a lot
of advantages as well.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.130
There is also a distinction

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.600
between how something is
created natively in BIBFRAME

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.330
versus how it was
converted from a MARC record.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.580
So you can, if you are doing
a mass conversion you make

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.950
decisions about what happens
to the [inaudible], etcetera.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.630
But when somebody is
natively creating it

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.980
in BIBFRAME you can actually
know their intent a lot better.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.230
So BIBFRAME native descriptions
are in some ways better

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.060
but they need to be equivalent

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.970
so that they live
side-by-side in the database.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.380
So there's about
five different ways

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.600
that you can express
a source based

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.250
on whether it was
created natively or not.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.230
But we have to find ways to make
it all look the same so that

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.200
when you push a button to
query it it's queriable

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.500
[phonetic] identically.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:20.700
So when we do the merging what
we're doing is we're trying

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.150
to match basically on
the name and the title.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.030
If we find a match

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.870
when something is
converted we'll take the work

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.620
and instance that's created,
we'll take the subjects

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.490
and the classification data
and put it onto the work

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.230
that we found in the database.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.680
And we'll discard
the work and attach

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.430
that instance to that work.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.190
So this has been
good in some ways

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.980
but it's also been problematic
because some of the times

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.260
when you have a name title
that matches you really want

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.720
to do an RDA expression work
instead of doing a merge

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.020
and saying this is an instance

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.970
of that other work
in the database.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.160
So we're going to have to
go back through the database

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.720
and look for places where the
thing should not be a merge

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.390
onto another instance --

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.580
onto another work but
should actually be a work

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.740
that has an expression-like
relationship to the work

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.140
that was found in the database.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:25.530
So also, on bibliographic
records there's 7XX related

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.650
titles and those we
need to be able to --

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.460
oh no I'm sorry, 7XX names.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.540
So somebody who's an illustrator
of a work when we do a merge

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.220
and we drop the work
the illustrator

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.070
of something also goes away.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.380
Because the original work
does not have an illustrator

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.530
but this particular
edition does.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.720
So the merge in that case
saying that this is an instance

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.550
of that may be true but we've
lost some key information

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.850
about that.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.630
And the illustrator
should not be merged

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.140
onto the original work.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.750
So we really need to
have a work in between

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.030
that says this is a work in its
own right with an illustrator

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.630
but it's linked to
that original work.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:16.100
And sometimes of course there
are no title or untitled things

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.180
so we don't want to merge those.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.600
So the merge specs it's
pretty detailed here,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.120
I'll just let you read it
it's not that interesting.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.320
Here's an instance where
something worked quite well.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.670
And earlier today that image
wasn't working so I'm glad

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.950
to see the cover art
thing got put back in.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:49.060
So this BIB ID 203786 was merged

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.850
with this name authority
work Huckleberry Finn.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.620
And when you look at that
Huckleberry Finn you can see

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.040
that it's related to a
whole bunch of other stuff.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.210
So in BIBFRAME we say
that something is related

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.510
to something else and then using
the sparkle query language were

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.030
able to say that a particular
work has a relationship

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.330
to something else.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.330
But then you can also
say what else is related

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.310
to that other thing, and you
can bring things together

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.610
in much more interesting ways.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.760
Okay so this is an
instance where it worked

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.790
but you know probably the
-- no, that didn't work.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.110
Let's go back to it.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.960
Sorry. Try again.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.820
So Concerto selections is
probably not an actual work it's

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.930
just a colocation mechanism

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.240
but it did bring these
things altogether.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.060
I would say that all of these
instances probably have,

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.610
should be works in their own
right and be somehow related

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.190
to this overall collection work.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.950
So in a future pass we'll
straighten that out.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.890
All right, so when we do
this conversion we've noticed

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:29.050
that the name titles that
were described in ID have lots

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.700
of extra information like
the media and the form,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.710
etcetera that are disambiguated
from previous works.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.040
And so what we're going
to do now is we're going

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.040
to take a work that has some
of these extra subheadings,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.120
chop off that subheading and
say all right can I find a name

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.860
title match with everything
except for this little part.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.550
And if I do make
that match I'm going

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.770
to make a relationship
between those things.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.300
And all of these things
that I've highlighted

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.820
in red are candidates
for such linking.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.070
Bibliographic records have the
same thing, when they have a 130

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.270
with lots of subparts we should
be able to chop off the subparts

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.130
and say there is
some relationship

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.110
between everything
except for that last node,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.920
and so we're trying
to do that as well.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.390
And here's what I was talking
about 7XX related titles.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.830
Those things we should be
able to say formulate the name

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.820
and title and see if you can
find a match in the database,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.650
and make a direct link
between those things.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.300
So here's one where it actually
did work, a vocal score.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.600
So this is a Rossini vocal score

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.860
and the related work does
not have vocal score on it.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.330
Okay here's a translation,
Ultimate Ironman.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.060
So this one is in
Greek and it linked

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.330
to the name title authority work
which has no language on it.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.010
But then it turns out that
because we're asking questions

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.530
of it there's also a
Croatian translation.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.430
And I haven't yet done it

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.550
but the Croatian translation
really should be a sibling

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.340
of the first one that I
started with so that on

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.580
that old work you
should be able to say

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.950
and what other languages
has this been translated

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.890
into without having to go
up to the higher level.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.680
So there are lots of things
down the right-hand side

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.230
that we've just started
exploiting the nature of RDF

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.920
in creating these links.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.180
Okay 130K selections.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.590
So these poems are
related to each other

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.740
and apparently translated
into Romanian as well.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.140
But here are some
of the actual poems

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.840
and not just the
overall selection work.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:11.670
Okay and the bibliographic
record with 7XX-related titles.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:16.190
I've only been doing this
on an experimental basis

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.450
so the whole database has
not been completely converted

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.750
to having all these links.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.740
But this poem I guess
or song is related

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.540
to a lot of other things.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:34.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.990
okay so still to come, I
started this presentation,

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.720
I gave it in California in April
and I had a slide called still

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.900
to come, and it had
all these things on it.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.330
And I realized when I opened it

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.780
up that we've already gotten
started on most of these things,

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.270
so I crossed them off here.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.820
We have exported all the
RDF works and instances

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.810
and stored them at ID for
people who are interested

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.170
in the big libraries to be
able to download and ingest

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.110
into their own databases
and do something with.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.110
We are linking related
titles MARC 7XX.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.090
The name title authority
records on a daily basis,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.830
those things are
linking to each other.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.220
We haven't gone back and
done the whole thing yet.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.660
And we're starting to experiment
with linking instead of merging

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.560
on things that should
be RDA expression works.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.560
So we're still looking for more
ways to link and we're thinking

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.680
about ingesting different
types of data including zip

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.510
and Onyx records, although some

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.810
of those are already
in the database.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.810
So getting the data upstream
a little bit may not be

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.400
that useful but we'll see.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.330
Casellini, the Italian
cataloging partner that we have,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.980
has a conversion of their
own and they've converted all

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.940
of our database and
gave it back to us.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.170
And they can give us
weekly conversions

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.310
of different records
if we want it.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.070
So we're doing an
experiment with how do we look

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.030
at that data, convert it
to whatever it needs to be

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.610
for us, and ingest it.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.510
And that's all I
have, thank you.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:11.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.340
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: So
I'm Jodi Williamschen,

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.090
I joined the library a
year ago from Oakland,

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.920
California where I worked
for Innovative Interfaces.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.460
I'm very happy for the
Capitals, I'm way happier

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.760
for the Golden State Warriors.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.730
And Les and I are going to talk
about using the BIBFRAME editor.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.550
So I'll start out with
just a quick overview

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.840
of selected portions
of the editor starting

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.600
with there's the URI
or URL if you wanted

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.970
to go explore it yourself.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.900
And we've set up a lot of
editor profiles that are based

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.690
on the materials
cataloged in the library,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.880
as Nate said we haven't covered
everything yet but we're trying.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.580
One of the ones that we added
during the pilot is the rare

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.690
materials profile, and it
has some special elements

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.420
that the rare materials
cataloger who's

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.720
in the pilot requested.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:29.140
This is how the editor profile
for a monograph work looks,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.210
there's just a lot of
fields that can be filled.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.390
And a lot of them
underneath that are tied

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.290
to controlled vocabularies so
there's a lot of type-aheads

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.740
and lookups so that you
don't have to remember

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.300
to type everything
in from scratch.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.580
This is an example of
one of the type-aheads.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.320
So for form genre it's
tied to the Library

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.200
of Congress genre form thesaurus
so you can just start typing.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.460
And then you can select the term
that you want, highlight it,

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.840
and it goes into the editor.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.040
And behind the scenes
the URI that's associated

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.480
with that term that's in
id.loc.gov is assigned

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.320
to the field, and then
you get a nice true triple

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.790
on the backend with URIs.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.810
And also, I've been
experimenting

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.090
with different ways to
put subject headings

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.690
in where you can
search each component

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.740
of a complex subject
heading separately

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.560
and get a URI for
each component.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:33.600
And they are all stored
together in the output.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.700
Where possible we've tried to
put a lot of standard values in.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.190
So the language lookup is
searching the MARC code list

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.750
for languages.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.900
And we've added in
other specialized terms

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.500
that are part of
the RDA registry.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.800
We've put them into ID just

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.430
to keep all the terminology
in-house

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.790
but I imagine some day we
would be directly linking

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.170
out to the RDA registry
for these types

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.890
of terms and probably more.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.480
In each profile we've also tried

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.560
to customize standard
values where possible.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.550
So there's a lot of the formats
have a media type of unmediated

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.440
and a carrier type of volume.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.290
But then we also have video and
video disk for the DVD profile.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.600
Audio and audio disk for
all of the CD profiles.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.590
And projected and [inaudible]
for the 35-millimeter profile.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.730
And we've also customized
what fields are included

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.030
in each profile.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.670
So these are the
identifier options

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.540
for four different profiles
based on the number,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.970
the identifiers that are
available for each format.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:42.310
So the monograph profile
has the fewest and the music

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.550
and sound recording
profiles have many more.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.240
So the advantage of this is

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.640
that if you're only cataloging
monographs you don't have

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.860
to sift through a lot of fields
that don't apply to your format.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.920
But if you are cataloging

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.770
in a specific format you have
the fields that you need.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.340
And one thing that we
just started a couple

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.890
of weeks ago is put in the
perform music ontology terms

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.930
for medium of performance.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.690
As prat of the LD for P
[phonetic] linked data project

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.380
that Stanford was coordinating
through a Mellon grant,

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.280
there was a group of music
catalogers that worked

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.550
on a specialized
vocabulary for music.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.310
And their terms for medium

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.850
of performance are
much more detailed

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.760
than what was developed here
for medium of performance.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.780
So we've been working with how
to incorporate their vocabulary

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.240
and their prefix
in the ontology.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.530
And so this is the output where
you can see that BF is used

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.110
as the prefix for the
BIBFRAME terms but PML

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.350
for performed music ontology
is used for their terms.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:51.040
Their ontology for music in this
area is very, very detailed.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.720
I think we've kind of gotten
it to work and I'm eager

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.150
to hear what the music
catalogers have for feedback

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.420
after they've experimented
with it a bit more.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.230
So when you're using the
BIBFRAME there are a lot

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.500
of different ways that you
can catalog the material

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.800
that you have.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.930
So the first one would be
that you have a brand-new work

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.680
and a brand-new instance
and so you start

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.980
with creating the work.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.280
This is how a lot

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.000
of the cartographic catalogers
are doing their mapwork.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.690
So you can go to the editor
workspace, select cartographic

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.220
and choose to start
with the work profile.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.770
And here's an example of all

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.850
of the work level
information being added in.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.430
During the pilot the map
catalogers have been really

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.710
outstanding to work with
because they really looked

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.120
through what the first
profile was that we gave them

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.680
and suggested a lot of things

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.210
that would make it
better for them.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.470
And then here's their instance
level information it's a bit

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.870
more detailed, there's
more fields.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.730
And finally, there's
two local fields.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.100
Admin metadata is sort of all

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.130
of the data only a
cataloger could love.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:05.640
A lot of it comes from
the leader and the 042

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.100
and 040 of the MARC record.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.350
And it's stored in
a separate block.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.860
And then there's the
item record block

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.790
which we have not really
done a lot of work with yet,

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.860
it's fairly generic and not
really Voyager specific at all.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.920
And I think as we go
forward we're going to have

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.370
to make some decisions about how
to treat the items in BIBFRAME

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.540
because if we want this
to truly be a replacement

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.750
for the Voyager ILS are
we going to have to put

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.380
in Voyager specific fields

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.260
or should be looking towards the
next gen ILS and what it needs.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.910
And these are all
decisions to come.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:46.070
And after you input all of this
information then you can preview

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.900
it to see how it looks in
different RDF serializations.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.960
I believe during the
first pilot this was

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.310
like the last proofreading
check before you were done

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.610
with the record.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.930
Now it's just a cute way

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.760
to [inaudible] the date
in a different way.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.410
And then you click on
the post button and back

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.180
in the editor workspace you
have this highlighted area

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.280
where it says that the
description has been submitted

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.830
for posting into the database

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.650
that Nate was just
talking about.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.260
And you can click on that
LCCN and ta-da there it is

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.850
in the BIBFRAME database.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.330
This we got working earlier this
year and it's been really fun

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.420
to watch the records
go in and out.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.660
And then there's also sort
of this moment of panic

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.960
when you hit the post
button and you're

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.940
like please work, please work.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.380
Another workflow is to add a new
instance to an existing work.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.870
This happens a lot with
DVDs of television shows.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.710
So we had the Blu-ray
DVD profile

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.350
and you select the
instance first.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.830
And then you can either search
in the BIBFRAME database

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.600
to find the work that you
need or you can search

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.900
within the BIBFRAME editor

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.510
but you really only get
the name of the work.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.010
If you want to be really, really
sure you want to search first,

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.990
searching in the database
because then you have access

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.740
to the full suite
of data to verify.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.560
And then after you link

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.140
to the existing work you don't
really need to add anything else

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.310
to the work so then you put in
all of your instance level data.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.440
The DVD profile is one of the
longest ones that we've created

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.060
and we've tried to add as
much standard dropdown lists

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.230
as possible so that the
cataloger doesn't have

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.560
to keep typing in the same
bits of data over and over.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.170
And now Les is going to
talk about IBC records

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.740
because this is one of our
big recent accomplishments.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.360
&gt;&gt; Les Hawkins: Hello,
I'm Les Hawkins,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.740
I work in the cooperative and
instructional programs division.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.910
And I am excited about
demonstrating this

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:56.590
but it's not one of
my accomplishments,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.060
it's really our colleagues
in net dev who've done this

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.200
with the searching and the
interfaces for uploading IBCs.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:10.080
The other thing about being
able to work with IBCs is

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.710
that catalogers in the
BIBFRAME 2.0 pilot told us

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.030
that this is very
important to be able to do

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.120
because IBC work is very,
there's a lot of different types

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.960
of records that are coded IBC.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.300
There's a lot of different
workflows associated with it

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.040
and it's a huge part of
LC's cataloging workflow.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.150
So I'm very excited that this,
this is still in development

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.750
from what I understand.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:42.350
I've mentioned a few of the
categories of IBC records

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.810
that catalogers need
to work with.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:49.240
Vendor records, E-CIP record,
ISSN prepublication records,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.870
and I say and others but that
leaves out copy cataloging,

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.700
a huge part of the workflow.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.310
Nate mentioned cloning
IBC records

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.920
to like build another edition
for an existing record.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.630
So there's just a lot of work
that, this is a large workflow

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:14.280
for LC and I'm very happy
that this is being developed.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:21.090
I have an example here and
I want to say that I began,

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.350
I just found this in the Voyager
database and I applied it

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.510
to the BIBFRAME database.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.380
But I started out with a search
in the BIBFRAME database,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.350
I pulled up the record.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.080
And I'm showing here that we
have a link that we can paste

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.880
in to the upload into the
editor, the BIBFRAME editor.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.930
So that's what I've done
here, I've copied the link,

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.280
the instance link here.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.870
A new feature this last week
was added by our colleagues

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.250
in net dev and that is the
ability to choose a profile,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.400
choose the appropriate profile.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.370
Before this feature
was added they just,

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.240
all of these IBCs just loaded
into the monographic profile.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.390
And now if you have,
this is an example

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:15.490
of a rare book being loaded
into the rare materials profile.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:18.670
If you have a serial
IBC, a prepublication,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.200
IBC that you're working
with it can be loaded

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.700
into the serial profile.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.930
The thing about IBCs
is if they're

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.590
in the database they often
need additional work later.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.810
So that's really
what, I forgot to say

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.210
that at the beginning
that's really one

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.970
of the important things that
you need to be able to do

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.780
with IBC records is
update them later.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.200
And so that that is possible
now within the BIBFRAME editor.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:49.490
And so this just shows you
pasting in that instance URI

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.460
that you copied from
the BIBFRAME database

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.100
and submit the URL and URI.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.340
And it brings up the
BIBFRAME instance.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.860
In this case, this is from
the rare materials profile

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.020
because I notice that it
has collective title there,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.510
the other profiles
don't have that.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:17.140
It also mentions here the
RBMS terms that are part

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.490
of that particular profile.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.690
So you can make updates
to this record

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.400
and send this description back
into the BIBFRAME database.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.340
This is just showing
some of the changes

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.730
that you might want to make.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.950
I didn't make any changes
to this to this description

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.780
but maybe you want to update the
extent or add an extent or make

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.920
in the instance profile.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.450
So over here on the
left I'm making a change

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.110
to the instance profile
by changing the extent

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.660
and over there on the right
I'm looking at the work profile

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.800
to add illustrative
content to the description.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.700
And then it's posted back
into the BIBFRAME editor.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:39:00.570
And that's the basic
steps for the IBC.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.980
Do you want to open this
up for questions now

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.120
for all of the speakers?

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.430
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: So we're
open for questions, comments.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:39.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.340
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: Well Stanford
and Harvard [inaudible]

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.160
for people [inaudible].

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:50.060
We're going to be
downloading our stuff

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.140
and figuring out
what [inaudible].

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.060
They're the major
players in this.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.630
There's a bunch of Europeans
that are very interested too,

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.490
Scandinavian National
Library is [inaudible],

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:13.360
but they're not actually
using our records [inaudible].

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.250
But everyone was very
excited to [inaudible].

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.570
&gt;&gt; Have we got any feedback on
anyone using the [inaudible]?

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.890
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: There's one guy
who found some errors in it so.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.240
&gt;&gt; That means they're looking.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.660
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: You know
that they're looking.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.340
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: And the
editor profiles are available

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.380
for download in GitHub
and I know

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.090
that Stanford has
downloaded them.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.380
And made some modifications
so that the lookups will work

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.420
because everything on the
editor profiles is very tied

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.160
to the LC ecosystem which means
it doesn't really play outside

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.460
the network.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.080
And so I'm pretty sure Stanford
has tried to modify the profiles

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.380
to work on their system.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.510
Regina.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:32.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.570
There are a lot of things
about the new RDA toolkit

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.890
that worry me, that's
just one of them.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.610
And I think it's
something we're really going

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.910
to have to figure out.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.660
I'm going to, there's a
program at ALA on Monday morning

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.630
about the toolkit that I'm going
to go to, to get enlightened.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:52.980
I'm also worried about
the loss of rule numbers

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.010
since we have a lot of
hot linking in the editor

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:00.470
that is tied to the
URL for the rule.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.770
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
[Inaudible] thing is

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.780
that we will have a full year

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.890
from the time [inaudible]
toolkit

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.160
and its content are stable

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:18.380
which will be no sooner
[inaudible] input in December

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.790
of this year, so we have a year.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:25.630
And I've made it clear to our
policy specialists that we want

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.450
to determine how we want
to move forward with it.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.710
And whatever linkages we can
make with BIBFRAME [inaudible].

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:38.920
So there will be a
lot, I won't say a lot,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.230
but there will be much
behind the scenes work

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:47.760
to solicit [inaudible] to
make sure we roll this piece

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:53.080
out as appropriately and
as seamlessly [inaudible].

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.020
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: But the impact is
not as large as you might think

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.390
because it's more
of a profile issue.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:02.690
The basic underpinnings

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.810
of the editor will work the same
it will just allow the cataloger

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.350
to produce more individual works

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.780
and then it can be
tied together.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:18.210
So the configuration step
as we call it [inaudible].

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:28.430
But basically what Jodi
and Les [inaudible].

00:43:30.510 --> 00:44:01.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.350
Well I think it's as good
as your MARC cataloging was

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.800
because the history of all
the title changes has got

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.410
to be recorded in the
original MARC [inaudible].

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:13.490
So when you look at Voyager
records you can see previous,

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.320
next, you know, merged
into and all that.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.620
So it'll be just new

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.300
ways of expressing that
information and us being able

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.390
to write a query that says go
get me that history and show it

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.430
to me in the new presentation.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.910
Just like the name title
for [inaudible] browse

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:34.230
that I showed we could do
something like that for titles.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.350
&gt;&gt; And removing the unnecessary
information the display

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:43.150
so you really could configure
I just want title, the dates,

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.220
the publisher [inaudible].

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.720
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: Yeah,
but the thing

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.110
that we're doing is handcrafted

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:53.760
so we could do a
presentation like that easily.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.210
But when you're talking about a
next generation catalog they're

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.680
not going to do [inaudible]

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.410
unless that's the new,
you know, the only new way

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.460
of doing serials or something.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.270
So that might be needed
to put into requirements

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:07.700
and you'd be able to see that
because we're not building the

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:12.350
library's next catalog we're
building a demonstration

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:17.210
that says here how you
could take advantage of RDI.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.750
&gt;&gt; I think I already
talked down in one

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:24.040
of the next gen meetings
about that.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.210
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: There.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.420
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering are there
any plans to move BIBFRAME

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.180
from browser into
[inaudible] application?

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.880
And along with that thinking
of advantages that, you know,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.650
the big one would be may not
requiring a constant internet

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.660
connection but also you know
build [inaudible] new key

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.300
commands and kind
of like navigate

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.600
around more quickly that way.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.620
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: Well the basic
premise of linked data is

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.250
that you're connected to
everything [inaudible].

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:03.040
And so internet connectivity
is kind of built in.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.710
But as far as like
hotkeys for stuff,

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:09.790
anyone can do that right now.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.640
You can do that even
your browser

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.450
to tell your browser this
is what I'm going to do,

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.370
it doesn't have to be a
standalone application.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.940
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: Way in the
back was next, then Jessalyn.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.680
&gt;&gt; As a working cataloger
I noticed

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.890
that a snappy response
time is one of the keys

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.730

about [inaudible] and the

catalog has to be fast.

And two, with the changes

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.900

doesn't get dialed back

That's a big question.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.390
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: Yes.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.410
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: That's
a question [inaudible] all

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.710
of us frankly.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.400
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: Yeah.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.700
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
These things are brought

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.100
up at various meetings

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.960
but I don't think we can
answer that question.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.090
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: And I think
any, if you're a cataloger

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.040
in the current environment
slowness is kind of built

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.770
in because we're building
ourselves all the pieces

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.120
that are necessary to
make something work.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.510
We're not trying to make
a fast machine right now.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.860
So we're in the stage of can
it be done not how do we make

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.190
it seamless.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:48:01.870
So your slowness will be solved
with a vendor supply RDF editor,

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:07.040
etcetera system otherwise
they won't be able to sell it.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.290
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: And some
swap-outs that are going on now

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:16.590
with the desktops and plug-ins
will bring some relief.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:24.740
And certainly our colleagues
in OCIO [inaudible] are.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.250
If not worried very [inaudible].

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.510
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen:
So Jessalyn I saw you.

00:48:34.510 --> 00:49:36.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.020
I can answer the
second question.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.790
It would be great to
have an OCLC gateway

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.340
that dropped data right
into the BIBFRAME database

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.780
but there's a lot of
technological hurdles

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.310
between that happening
now and in the future.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:55.300
The main one is that BIBFRAME
editor and the database are

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:00.010
on test servers internally and
are not open to the outside.

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.110
And to link up to OCLC
there'd have to be a lot

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.480
of port traffic opened up.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.160
And I don't think we're
ready to go there yet.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.970
But we understand
it's very important

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.500
because downloading records

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.480
from any utility is vital
for copy cataloging.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.760
I think if we move more into
a production environment

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.290
that would be one of the
top things to get resolved.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.840
And I'm hoping Les can
answer the first one.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.920
&gt;&gt; Les Hawkins: Well no,
but I mean thin this is,

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.130
in one way this is how we're
able to do some copy cataloging.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.170
We still have to download
the records from OCLC.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:33.150
If you work with serials
you have to do your updating

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.300
and your work in OCLC, then
you're bringing that record

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.480
into Voyager if it's held by
LC or if it's an ISSN record,

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.100
a prepublication record.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.110
Those ISSN prepublication
records are IBC records,

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:48.830
they're coded as such
in the Voyager database.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:53.600
So yes, I have an example
of a prepublication record

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.650
that can be loaded with that
process that I just showed you.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:59.050
So it could be updated
in the BIBFRAME editor

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.560
by loading that IBC record.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.550
Other types of copy
that could be loaded

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:09.920
through the load IBC record
I believe if there are IBCs

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.790
in the Voyager database
that you've downloaded

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:15.660
from OCLC they can be
uploaded and worked

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.180
on in the BIBFRAME database.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.520
Yes.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:51.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.150
If they are, if you
have coded a record IBC

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.250
in the Voyager database yes
you can use that mechanism

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.550
that we just showed you.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:51:59.850
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen:
Actually you can load

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.780
in any record that you want.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.340
&gt;&gt; Les Hawkins: I was going to
say I thought that happened.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.460
So when, you know, we're talking
about serials and there are lots

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.370
of post-publication serials that
we work with, we work with them

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.890
in OCLC and we download them
into the Voyager database.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.120
But I hadn't experimented
with that.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.730
But I'm pretty sure with the
upload IBC you can upload any

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.640
of those records that you've
downloaded from OCLC and work

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.510
with them in the
BIBFRAME editor.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:45.120
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.100
&gt;&gt; Nate Trail: Now I think you
go into the different database,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.100
if the record was in
OCLC and got into the ILS

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:56.600
and then the next day it was
converted into a different.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.730
You can call it up in BIBFRAME
as though it was an IBC.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:05.330
Use whatever profile now
that you think is appropriate

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.370
and it will populate in the
editor, change what you need

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.090
to do and save it back
as though it was an IBC.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:16.750
You don't have to change the
906 or whatever code in order

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.270
to make it work you
just call [inaudible].

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.100

of those records are being,

you've not worked on them

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.230
or not they're being converted
to BIBFRAME, they're available

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.510

why we're excited about this.

&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: If
you can find the record

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.370
in the BIBFRAME database
you can recall it

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:51.510
in the BIBFRAME editor
if it's an instance.

[ Inaudible ]

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.920
&gt;&gt; Jodi Williamschen: Yeah,
I think a lot of the issues

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.450
with the connecting up to OCLC
is on the technology side,

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.300
getting the machines
to talk to each other.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:57.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:58.780
I know what I want to do
we just have to figure

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.530
out if it's going to work.

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:04.720
Because part of the thing
is that it's two bytes

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.740
in the 008 field, and
it's kind of connected

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.100
to one BIBFRAME property.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:14.660
And are we losing anything
else that's expressed

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.880
in that regulatory byte to
just have it say irregular.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.830
But we'll get there because
it's an RDA registry [inaudible]

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:30.220
so we should be following
that model as well.

Jessalyn.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:50.790
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:57.720
Since the editor is browser
based it's pretty accepting

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.790
of Unicode.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:03.530
The challenge has been
character set mapping,

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.480
so if you have a
Chinese keyboard

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.890
or not our Hebrew cataloger

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.110

noted some oddities

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:16.450
in searching depending
on the diacritic.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.410
So there's a few things
that need to be ironed out

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.160
but it's more on a
data input end I think.
