00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.750
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Hello.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.050
Welcome back, if you're back.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.920
And if not, welcome the
first time to the third panel

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.470
on the Copyright Office's
roundtables for its study

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.910
on Section 1201 of the DMCA.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.630
This topic is about renewal of
previously granted exemptions.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.980
And before we get into the
meat of the discussion,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.020
I just want to remind
everyone, sort of logistically,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.880
if you would like to
speak, turn your placards

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.410
up and we'll call on you.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.750
If you can try to limit your
comments to two to three minutes,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.720
that will help us make sure
everyone gets a chance to speak

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.850 position:56%
and we can all engage on the issues.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.610
And the microphones, when you're
done speaking, please turn it off

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.430
to prevent feedback and we
also got a request from AV

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
in the last hearing to make sure
everyone speaks into the microphone

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250
because it's being videotaped

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.290
and that will help it be
picked up on the video.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
So, to start, I think we should
go around and say our names.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.360
I'm Regan Smith, the
Associate General Counsel

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.330

I'm with the Stanford

and I'm representing the Institute

&gt;&gt; Andrew Goldman: Andrew Goldman,

&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.310
Thank you.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.610
I'm thinking for today's panel,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.910
we'd like to roughly
divide the discussion

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.620
into the first half focusing on
the need for some sort of renewals,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.240
whether this is a presumption
of renewal,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.160
a burden shifting towards
someone opposing a renewal,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.310 position:56%
a general streamlining of a
process, whether it's administrative

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.420 position:56%
or statutory reform and then getting
into specific models if possible.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.470
I realized for this topic,
I think it might be a case

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.390
where the devil's in the details.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.150
The Register has stated
both in her recommendation

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.340
to the last rulemaking and
in her testimony to Congress

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.370
that the public record
supports amending Section 1201

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.830
to make it easier to
renew exemptions.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.130 position:56%
She recommended congressional action
to provide a presumption in favor

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.450
of renewal in cases where
there's no meaningful opposition.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.130
And in the comments that the
Copyright Office has received,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.830
there seems to be, you know-- I
hate to jinx myself by saying it--

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.170
but some consensus that doing
something would be permissible

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.160
and advisable to deal with
repeated exemption requests.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.950
But the comment is definitely
diverse in terms of what

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.960
that would look like and
how the concerns are going.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.120
So, again, I'd like to open up
with a pretty broad question

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.570
of what would your proposal would
be or what are your concerns

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.070
with doing something to make it
easier to facilitate the renewal

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.770
of repeated requests
for an exemption.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.070
Mr. Sheffner?

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.370
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Yes.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.830
First of all, I just
want to agree with you.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.780
I don't think it'll
jinx the panel to say

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.500 position:56%
that there actually is a
remarkable degree of consensus that,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.260 position:56%
as to previously granted exemptions,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.320
there should be some sort
of streamlined process.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.470
The-- There's too much of a-- it's
really a waste of time and effort

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.000
and burden on both the proponents

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.160
and the Copyright Office
staff itself to have to go

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.570
through a full process when there's
really no meaningful opposition.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.740
So, again, broad consensus
that something should be done.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.730
And even within the details,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.710
I don't think there are
dramatic differences.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.210
As Bruce and I were talking
over the lunch break,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.110
we were wondering exactly
how even a group

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.710
of opinionated lawyers are
going to be able to fill

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.570
up a full hour-and-a-half
on this particular topic.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.250
But just a couple of points as
to how we think this should work

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.550
and sort of why we think that our
particular proposal makes sense.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.050
As we see it, the way it
would work is that proponents

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.890
of a previously granted exemption
who seek renewal should file some--

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.190
make some very simple filing.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.140
We're talking a page or so stating
that they would like the exemption

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.080
to be renewed and essentially

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.390
to show why they think
it should be renewed.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.140
Again, we're talking about a very
simple one or two-page filing.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.730 position:56%
Then, there's a period of time where
if an opponent wants to come forward

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.540
and say, well, actually
we do wish to oppose this

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.930
and briefly here are the reasons,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.260 position:56%
we think there's still a substantial
debate about whether this would--

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.860
the exemption should be renewed,
then it would go throw it off back

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.180
into the regular process.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.000
But again, if nobody came forward
to offer any meaningful opposition,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.200
the Copyright Office,
under the existing statute,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.190
could then just go
ahead and say, you know,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.730
get out their renewed
stamp and be done

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.500
with that particular
request for an exemption.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.210
The one thing I'll say
before ending is we do think

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.180
that this proposal should
be limited to renewal

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.740
of the particular exemption
that has been granted.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.150
And in practice, that is
actually what's happened.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.510
It's been the exceptional
case, almost a rarity

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.890
where there have been opponents
to previously granted exemptions.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.890
I know from our perspective in
particular, this last round,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.610
there were previously
granted exemptions

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.910
that we had opposed in the past.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.290
Some of those we've lost on.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.340
But if people came back
and asked for this renewal

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.100 position:56%
of the previously granted exemption,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.910
as a matter of fact,
this is no secret.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.350
You could just look in the filings.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.350
We did not oppose any
of those exemptions.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.320
We would not want a proposal,
however, to apply to request

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.020
for expansions of previously
granted exemptions.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.670
If there are new things that
people are wanting to do,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.230
we should go through
the regular process.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.880
And again, the burden should
remain on the proponent

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.290 position:56%
of the exemption to make their case.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.590
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK, thank you.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.890
Mr. Goldman?

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.190
&gt;&gt; Andrew Goldman: Sure.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:08.080
Thanks. So KEI, we believe that
there should be presumptive renewal

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.440
of previously granted exemptions.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.690
I think what we will
say just in response

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.210
to that is it doesn't make sense
to continue to put the burden

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.400
on the party that's already
received the exemption.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.290
Once the exemption exists,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.600
the burden should shift
to the copyright holder.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.620
And I think in the previous
panel, we heard a lot of examples

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.550
of just the waste of
time, the difficulty

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.950
of understanding the
process for the parties

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.940
that are seeking the exemption
and then to continue to have to go

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.130
through that process just
seems wasteful and confusing,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.460
especially where you have
exemptions that have been granted

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.980
that have been unopposed, as has
been the case with the exemption

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.240
for literary works distributed
electronically to be accessed

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.100
by persons who are blind, visually
impaired or print-disabled.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.720
The exemptions, I think,
we've seen over time

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.610
and I think this was referred to
by Krista Cox in the last panel,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.000
we've seen them get increasingly
more complex and lengthy.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.590
In 2010, there was a 100-word
exemption for audiovisual works

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.930
which then went to
752 words in 2013.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.810
And I don't think that
this process should be--

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.500
and KEI does not think that this
process should be so complicated

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.810
and so burdensome for
people that are trying

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.450
to make non-infringing use.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.340
And, you know, this is
a complicated segment

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.020
of the law, even if you have a JD.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.630
And you should not have
to have a JD in order

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.540
to have the exemption
and continue to have it.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.840
Thanks.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.140
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.270
Mr. Band?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.570
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I'd have

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.310
to study what Mr. Sheffner's
proposal in greater detail.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.410
But I think in broad strokes,
there's a lot of, you know,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.280
I would agree with a
lot of what he said.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.150
At the highest level, I agree
that there's an awful lot more

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.950
that the Copyright Office
itself can do right now

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.090
without any amendment
of the Copyright Act.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.980
I think way too much deference
has been placed on one sentence

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.370
in one committee report
that actually was directed

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.960
to a different rulemaking, OK?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.810
It was a rulemaking that
was going to be conducted

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.940
by NTIA, not this rulemaking.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.960
And so, there's no need for
you to pay any deference

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.310
at all to that one sentence.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.020
But even to the extent that
you want to pay some deference

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.020
to the de novo sentence, you know,
it's about a de novo determination,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.980
which is sort of like
what you guys have to do

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.040
or actually what the Librarian
has to do, not what we have to do.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.150
I mean, you could easily say,
OK, if you want a renewal,

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.550
you could just have the
whole administrative record

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.860
from the previous rulemaking just
incorporated by reference and then,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.390
you know, then the process
in terms of the, you know,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.730
what the Register's
recommendation and the NTIA advice

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.620
and the Librarian-- I mean, that
may be have to be somewhat de novo,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.060
whatever that really means.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.600
But again, I don't even
think you need to pay

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.730
that much deference
to that one sentence.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.300
But I think, you know,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.010
so that really could streamline
the process dramatically

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.140
and so I agree with, you know, Mr.
Sheffner's idea that, you know, if,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.560
you know, we, if we want a
renewal, we can just do, you know,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.900
maybe not even a page, you know,
maybe a paragraph or a sentence.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.630
And then if, you know, even if--

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.260
I would disagree that
if there is opposition,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.150
then it kicks back into
the normal process.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.170
I think it should be still
somewhat of a truncated process.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.820
I mean, I think all of the evidence

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.890
that was previously submitted
should be incorporated

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.340
so that no new evidence
needs to be submitted.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.280
And so-- And then, you know,
if we as a proponent want

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.340
to propose additional
information, we can.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.790 position:56%
And if the opponents want to propose
additional information, they can.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:19.540
But still, the whole record
should be included and considered

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.210
by the Register and the
Librarian going forward.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And I think
just to kind of pick up on that

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:31.350
and follow up, we'd be interested,
as others answer this question,

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.620
if you agree that under current
law, there is some flexibility

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.840
for the Office to, for
example, consider evidence

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.730
from the prior proceeding, is
anyone aware of any other sort

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.270
of administrative processes
that might provide an analog,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.250
where the evidentiary record

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.830
from a prior proceeding
could be incorporated?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.730
That would be helpful for us.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.070
I think Professor Decherney?

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.160
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Answer
that specific question.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.460
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Well, that's fine.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: I was just going
to say that it's actually very--

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.810
time doesn't stand still.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.070
Technology doesn't stand still.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.900
Uses of technology
doesn't stand still.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.470
So it's very unusual
to have a renewal

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.270
that would look exactly the same

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.250
as the exemption looked
three years ago.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.290
But I don't think that's a
reason to throw out the proposal.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.250
There may be another way
of saying we want to start

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.960 position:56%
where we left off last time and then
think about additions or changes.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.230
I'm not always sure that there
are even additions or expansions.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.500
So sometimes it's just an
updating of the existing exemption

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.920
so that it accounts for
current states of technology

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.540
and the way that it's used.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.090
And so, maybe there's just
another way of doing it

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.770
so that we don't have the same
conversation from the beginning.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.780
We don't start at the
beginning line.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.730
You know, we start where
we left off last time.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.030
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.330
So I think there's two issues,
what Kevin has followed up on

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.000
and also what you've just raised in
terms of expanding the exemption.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.950 position:56%
But I wonder if we could stick first
to see if there's some consensus

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.950
around roughly what Mr.
Sheffner proposed in terms

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.320
of a short form filing prior
to the rulemaking proper.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.510
And I wonder Mr. Cazares,
is that something

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.360
that would work for
your organization?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.660
&gt;&gt; Gabe Cazares: Sure.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.840
So I think that that proposal
would definitely have to be flushed

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.200
out even more because, as
everybody has already stated,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.010
what we have now is
burdensome and time-consuming,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.470
particularly for the
community that I represent,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.700
people who are blind
and print-disabled.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.860
If you take a look at the record
of the last comment period,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.170
how many comments were
submitted by organizations

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.440
or groups representing
people with disabilities

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.880
and it's demonstrably lower
than some of the other groups.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.040
And it's because of the burdensome
evidentiary requirements,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.380
the inconsistencies that
there have been throughout the

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.750
triennial cycles.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.820
And I think that coming up with
a sensible proposal like the one

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.620
that has been proposed would be an
interesting conversation to have,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.580
I think particularly for
the disability community,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.410
who really does rely
on these exemptions.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.440
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.330
Professor Tushnet?

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:29.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So, I want to
agree with Mr. Band and Mr. Goldman.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.590
I think they're right
about the current law.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.280
There's flexibility
and it's not just

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.960
because of the legislative history.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.330
So, for example, even if
you wanted to take de novo,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.140
as if it were in the statute,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.190
de novo actually has a perfectly
respectable meaning for courts

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.290
that doesn't actually require any
additional factual development.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.040
It just means de novo, right?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.650
We don't do new fact-finding
when courts do de novo review.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.980
And I would think that
at the very least,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.090
that would be free for you to do.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.000
And one thing that I have
often thought about actually

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.880
in this connection is, you
know, what is the difference

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.140
between saying, "We
would like to incorporate

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.420
by reference our submissions
from the past three rounds?"

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.250
I mean, surely that's a legitimate
way of submitting evidence.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.550
I mean, you have it.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.420
I mean, I can give you
another copy if you want.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.810
But it seems like it's
still evidence to me.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.910
And so, I see absolutely no
barrier under the current regime

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.520
to formalizing that and
acknowledging it rather

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.910 position:56%
than requiring us to go through, you
know, because what we did, you know,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.840
we just reprinted everything
and stuffed it in the appendix,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.540
just because what else can we do?

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.160
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And then,
you also updated it too.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.610
I mean, do you think that the
statute does require some sort

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.890 position:56%
of showing of freshness of evidence?

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.190
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Absolutely not.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:57.210
We did it because of the current
interpretation of de novo.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:03.280
And we feared, I think, that
the Office would not see it

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.410 position:56%
as sufficient if we just-- The other
thing I want to point out here is

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.560
that there's interaction here with
the proper definition of classes.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.740
So this is something that
Professor Decherney talked about,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.310
that if you get a definition right
in certain ways, it may not need

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.860
to be updated as often,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.310
and therefore there can be
less sources around the edges.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.610
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.860
Mr. McClure?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.160
&gt;&gt; Sam McClure: Sure, yeah.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.910
Thanks. Definitely broad
agreement with what's been said,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.050
especially with what
Professor Tushnet said

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.960
about how I think the renewal
process can be streamlined

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.630
through both the legislative
history and the statute.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.950
There are definitely
arguments for that.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.850
I think there's a lot
of latitude there.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.580
Two maybe small points that I
think would be really helpful

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.650
to have a discussion
about, one, the filing,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.720
the showing by the
proponent, we actually believe

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.710
that it should just
be presumed renewed,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.280
that there shouldn't
necessarily be a burden on a party

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.710
to file some kind of statement.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.850
I don't know if that's serving
some kind of notice principle.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.440
But I think there's enough notice
throughout the rest of the process

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.130
that if we just say that this
exemption is presumptively renewed

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.700
then we can move forward with
maybe some sort of process

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.200
that mirrors the existing
exemption process for--

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:27.030 position:56%
where opponents would be filing
opposition, a meaningful opposition.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.470
And then, with regards
to the meaningfulness,

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.040
I think there was some
statement made that as soon

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.210
as an opponent files opposition
and is sort of kicked back

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.140
into the original process, and we
just wanted to clarify and ensure

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.930 position:56%
that there's some sense that the
opposition is meaningful, of course,

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.470
and that maybe, you know,
to the point that was made

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.000
by Professor Tushnet, if there
is this prior evidentiary record

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.800
that it's just getting kind of
copy/pasted into the new process,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.660
that the opponents of the old
exemption would have to say, OK,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.480
something significant has changed
in the facts here, you know,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.400
to support an overturning
of that exemption.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.800
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So you've
raised this other idea,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.900
which is as the Register
also suggested looking at,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.680
that there should be a
presumption of renewal

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.980
that would just become automatic.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.250 position:56%
And before we get comments on that--

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.890
or maybe people who comment on
that can compare and contrast

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.910
to what Mr. Sheffner's
proposed, which would be

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.960
that the proponents would
make a very short filing.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.490
But it would still be a mandatory
filing from the proponents to show,

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.890
you know, very briefly why an
exemption was still needed.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.390
So Mr. Turnbull?

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.690
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Yeah.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.180
I think I'm in agreement with my
colleague, Mr. Sheffner, on this.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.150
And to expand a little bit and
capture some of the other comments

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.990
that have been made,
I think the notion

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.060
of bringing forward the evidence
from the record or referring to it,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.870
you all have maintained the
online capability to go back

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.170
and see previous comments

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.680
and previous hearings
and that sort of thing.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.190
And I-- I mean, I don't know
that we'd even need to put people

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.640
to the burden of copying it
with their current filing.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.770
So, I mean, we'd be OK with that.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.850
I do think under the current
statute, you would need

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.810
to have a filing to say, yes, we
want the renewal of the exemption

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.540
as opposed to the presumption.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.290
And it seems to me that that's
a minimal enough thing and I,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.400
you know, whether it's a sentence
or a paragraph or a page, we're--

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.320
none of us are talking
about anything terribly--

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.620
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Billing
by the hour.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.920
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Yeah, right.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.220
By the word, by the word.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.190
But-- So, I don't think
that's a big burden at all.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.130
And I think the other point,

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.120
Professor Decherney talked
about the differences.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.740
Again, we're not-- I think
the notion, at least as far

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.740
as we're concerned,
would be that with regard

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.980
to exactly what was done
before, if there's no opposition,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.830
no meaningful opposition to
that, that simply goes forward.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:57.520 position:56%
And the argument then becomes about
the difference, not about what was--

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.110 position:56%
you don't go back to the whole issue

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.050
if there's opposition
to the difference.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.200
And I think, again, that would
help both to streamline the process

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.300
and also minimize the burden
on either party in terms

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.940
of bringing evidence forward.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.240
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.540
Thank you.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.840
I think next we'll
hear from Mr. Butler.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.900
And I think to put some
more gloss on the question,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.170
the statute requires that the
Librarian makes a determination

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.910
in a rulemaking proceeding
that persons who are users

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.280
of a copyrighted work
are or are likely to be

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.500
in the succeeding three-year
period adversely affected

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.230 position:56%
by the prohibition on circumvention.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.080
So, when I hear questions of
we could have just one sentence

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.350
or one paragraph, I wonder is that
enough under the current statute,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.820 position:56%
taking Mr. Band's comment, he thinks
there's perhaps more flexibility

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.550
permitted to say is that enough
to say this is a determination

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.020
in a rulemaking proceeding.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.640
And also, generally
what are your thoughts

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.270
to what Mr. Sheffner has proposed?

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.570
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Great.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.440
So I just wanted to
raise a couple of points.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.010
One is I think that this
process should be very--

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.070
I mean, as it has been and as
we've heard a few times today,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.670
cognizant of who are
the participants

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.260
and how are they represented.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.580
And so, you know, there's big
collective action problems

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.750
on the proponent side oftentimes.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.950 position:56%
You know, for example, in my clinic,

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.440
it's a different student
team every three years.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.630
And the way that we structure
our retainers with our clients is

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.930
that representation ends the
minute we-- this process ends.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.690
So, there's not a student
attorney that you could--

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.280
that is continually responsible
at sort of I guess faculty

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.390
and then faculty turnover and
staff at nonprofits turnover.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.430
And so, there's a kind of a trap
for the unwary problem I'm worried

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.790
about in terms of having
to even file a one-pager,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.650
if you're a small nonprofit
or if you're someone

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.920
who had the help of a clinic.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.070
You know, what will you do in three
years if the person who supervised

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.910
that student team is
at the University

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.890
of Virginia instead of here?

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.400
And so, so I'm just
worried about that.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.700
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.000
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: And one
option, I think is, you know,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.530
we file trademarks, for example.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.190
And our trademark clients operate
under the same system, where,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.780
you know, we represent you for x
amount of time and then we need

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.830
to let you go because
our students leave.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.130
But we still have a kind

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.380
of institutional email address
that's on file with the PTO.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.190
And when events happen that
might be relevant to the clients,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.180
we make sure that we get--
we're on that notification list.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.070
So maybe there could be a
notification system that is

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.870
where the-- when the
three years comes up,

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.160
you let the representatives
of past proponents know, hey,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.890
the three years are coming up, you
know, and that can be an address

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.800
that everyone would keep alive.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.660
I would think that
would be fairly simply

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.080
and there's no good
reason to not try.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.380
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Right.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.420
So the Office could say, give me
your email address if you want

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.310
to for the form and send
out something in advance.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.620
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.570
Yeah, and then the other thing
I just wanted to point out is

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.040
that there's substantial
reliance on these exemptions

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.420
in pretty big institutions.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.720
You know, at this point,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.760
the educational exemption has been
granted and renewed for long enough

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.660
that we've-- you know,
at universities,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.830 position:56%
they've been buying DVDs and part
of the value proposition of a DVD is

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.270
that we will be able to cut clips.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.770
And so, that's an investment.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.970
I'm told that UVA spends about
$30,000 a year buying DVDs.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.940
So in three years,
that's almost $100,000,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.300
where the hope every time we
buy that DVD is that faculty

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.320
and students can make lawful uses
in accord with the exemption.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.570
So, that's another great reason
to do the renewal is that there's

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.870
so much reliance built up.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.640
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Is that a reason to
do the renewal or is that a reason

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.650
to perhaps like participate
in our fifth panel

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.020
and say there should be a
permanent exemption for education?

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.320
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.620
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: But the reason
I ask is that, you know,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.990
Congress is pretty clear
that this is intended

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.590
to be a failsafe mechanism that
it's intended to allow the Office

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.420 position:56%
to keep their pulse on technological
developments and react.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.660
And so, it cuts both ways,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.180
that an exemption granted
might become ossified

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.340
or overtaken by market events.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.640
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yeah.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.940
No, I mean, make no mistake,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.240
this is sort of a third
best solution, right?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.730
First best is the Unlocking
Technology Act.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.040
Second best is a permanent
exemption.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.750
But third best is a renewal.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.490
And I agree that the
concerns that educators have

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.220
in particular don't tend to
actually become overtaken.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.520
So for example, VHS tapes, there
are tens of thousands of VHS tapes

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.230
that have never been issued
on a subsequent format.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.750
And those tapes are actually still
being used lawfully under fair use.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.390 position:56%
They're being digitized and used in
clips in the same way that DVDs are.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.400
I'm sure, like morally certain
because of the way media works,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.230
that the same thing
will happen with DVDs.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.610
And so, we will always, I think,

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.940
need to decrypt DVDs
in order to make clips.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.110
I think that's just-- that's
in the nature of things,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.750
the way media grows and changes.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.500
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Ms. Castillo?

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.800
&gt;&gt; Sofia Castillo: Yes.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.530
I have sort of three
points to discuss.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.730
The first one is, in general,
AAP is open to some form

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.250
of streamlined proceeding or
in general, we are in agreement

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.400
with most people in the room
seemed to be so far in terms

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:26.790
of favoring some form of--
yeah, oh, I'm out of words--

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.290
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: A presumption of--

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.160
&gt;&gt; Sofia Castillo: No,
not exactly a presumption,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:39.000 position:56%
but some form of improving the
renewal process so that it's easier.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.590
But one of the things that I
think might be problematic is the

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.550
suggestion that there should
be a complete burden shifting,

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.820
so that it is the opponent
who has to oppose the--

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:56.570
an exemption that has been
already granted for renewal.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.580
The problem with that is that the
opponent doesn't necessarily have

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:06.010
all the evidence necessary to show

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:11.190
that the exemption is no longer
necessary-- is no longer necessary,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:16.060
or has been used in the past
three years or what the likelihood

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.840
of adverse impact will be
in the next three years.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:26.410
The other thing is that for any
form of streamlined proceeding

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.990
of previously granted
exemptions, the exemptions

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:36.400
that are renewed should be
the exact same exemption

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.540
that was approved before.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.540 position:56%
If there are any changes, of course,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.300
there can be some form
of middle proceeding.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.580
And I think it has
been suggested before

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.020
that it's not exactly kicked
back to what we have today,

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.790
but something in between
for additions or changes

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.410
to previously granted exemptions.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.230
So, I think it's worth it for
the Copyright Office to sort

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:05.210 position:56%
of contemplate having several tracks
or something along those lines.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:10.450
And then the other issue I've
heard is that there seems

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.540
to be some favoring of an
automatic renewal presumption.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.590
And the problem with that is that
then, that would be very similar

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.740
to having permanent exemptions.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.180
And that is something
for the panel tomorrow.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.020 position:56%
But for purposes of renewal, I think
it's important to take into account

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.890
that having this proceeding every
three years is helpful to account

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.770
for changes in the marketplace.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.930
And if we have an automatic
renewal presumption,

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.250
then that would sort
of take that away.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.530
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.450
Mr. Geiger?

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.340
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So, we hire
a lot of security researchers

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.700
and white hat hackers and we
also work with a large number

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.360
of independent security
researchers that we do not employ.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.250
And most of these researchers are
working either solo or as part

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.110
of some sort of very small shop.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.930
And most of them, the vast majority

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.300 position:56%
of them do not possess the requisite
legal expertise to even deal

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.160 position:56%
with cease-and-desist letters
telling them to stop their research,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.840
often making vague claims about
DMCA, let alone for engaging

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.810
in the temporary renewal process.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.630
So from our perspective, we
absolutely support a presumption

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.490
of renewal and it sounds like
these are the fault lines,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.120
based on what the rest of
the panel has been saying,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.410
and obviously where
we come down on it.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.350
When it comes to the burden
of the initial filing,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.040
Mr. Sheffner had suggested
that it should be the proponent

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.180
of the exemption that
makes that initial filing.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.370
We would support an
automatic renewal.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.310
And the idea that it would just
be one page I'm not sure is going

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.680
to hold for very long.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.650
This is one reason why I
think that the opponents ought

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.830 position:56%
to be the ones that make the filing.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.020
That one page could
very well expand,

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.590
unless it's restricted
to a single page.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.860
And then, every word on that
page is going to get litigated

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.360
and you will once again need
legal expertise in order

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.610 position:56%
to make a good filing, one that does
not trip you up later down the line.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.070
When it comes to the-- losing
that presumption of renewal,

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.890
we've talked about whether there
should be meaningful opposition

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.960
that cancels the presumption
of renewal.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.650
And I don't think that
that's the right standard

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.500 position:56%
because if anybody objects, which is
Mr. Sheffner's original proposition,

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.560
if anybody objects and we shunt
into the original process again,

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.010
but as we have seen in
previous rulemakings,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.790
the same arguments are trotted
out over and over again.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.970
There's no reason why those same
arguments would simply not be

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.230
trotted out again and then cancel
the presumption and shunt you back

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.530
into the original process.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.440
And then, what really is
the presumption worth,

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.720
except for something that
is completely unopposed.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.450
When it comes to-- So instead,
instead of meaningful opposition,

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.320
I think that a better
standard would be whether

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.480
or not there has been some sort of
material change in circumstances.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.090
We've talked about
changes in the marketplace,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.040
changes in technology and so forth.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.740 position:56%
Those types of changes are different
than simply meaningful opposition.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.680
I think that that would
be a better standard.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.980
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: So the-- oh, sorry.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.280
Go ahead.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.580
&gt;&gt; Harvey Geiger: Go ahead.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.390
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: So the presumption
would kick in automatically

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.080
and then just the burden
automatically would be on opponents

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.180
to establish a material
change in circumstances?

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harvey Geiger: Yes, that's right.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.690
And I'll take it a step further,
which is to say that-- two things.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.820
One, if we're talking about
an expansion, you know,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.150
above and beyond the
original exemption,

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.090
we think that the process ought
to then be about that expansion,

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.690
as opposed to the expansion
plus the original.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.320
And lastly, and this goes
to the evidentiary standard

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.550
for the exemption, not just
a renewal, we don't think

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:49.070 position:56%
that non-copyright interests that go
beyond protecting copyrighted works

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.840
or protecting the availability of
copyrighted works ought to figure

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.450
in to the denial of the
exemption, including a rebutting

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.450
of the presumption that you
would get the exemption again.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.140
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: So, I think that
leads right into another question.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.380
As you indicated, the proposal that
Mr. Sheffner outlined, I think,

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.040
as I understand it, is
premised on lack of opposition,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.450
lack of meaningful opposition
or some variant of that.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.370
Do we have another
alternative which would be--

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.130
which would provide that
the presumption would kick

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.590
in automatically.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:28.970
I wonder if panelists have
views about, you know,

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.230
which model is preferable?

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.890
And if the standard is
meaningful opposition,

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.790
what would that mean exactly?

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.740
Would the Copyright Office have
some discretion to sort of--

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:45.730
to make a determination as to
how meaningful an opposition is?

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.990
We'd be grateful for
your thoughts about it.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.290
Mr. Sheffner?

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.590
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Thank you.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.250
So, we do oppose the idea
of a presumption of renewal

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.660
of previously granted exemptions.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.300
And Ms. Castillo touched
on some of the reasons.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.290
But I want to expand a little bit.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.940
First thing I'd say is don't
necessarily listen to my reasoning.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.240
But I would just point you back

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.570
to the Copyright Office's
own reasoning back

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.150
in the rule issued on
October 27th, 2000.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.040
And I won't repeat what the
Copyright Office wrote here.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.360
But in sum, the Copyright Office
looked at general principles

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.890
of statutory construction
and administrative law.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:31.140
And again, summarizing, essentially
what the Copyright Office concluded

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.550
from looking at the legal
authority is that essentially

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.610
when you have a statute and then
you have exemptions to that statute

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.090 position:56%
or exceptions to the statute, again,

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.800
those rules of statutory
construction

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.620
and administrative
law say that, one,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.260
the exemption should be
construed narrowly and, two,

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.430
that the burden should be on the
proponent of those exemptions.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.610
So, again, the Copyright
Office concluded this based

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.710
on sound legal reasoning
back in 2000.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.960 position:56%
And I don't think there has been
any change in the general principles

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.260
of statutory construction

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.320
or administrative law
that have changed.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.680
That said, I want to emphasize

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.160
that the discussion we're having is
largely academic for two reasons.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.180
One is, as I stated previously,
there, at least in the last round,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.780
and I think this is sort
of becoming the practice,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.890
there is virtually no opposition
to previously granted exemptions.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.030 position:56%
Just as a matter of fact, even those

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:34.720
who previously opposed an exemption
are sort of looking at the state

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.910
of affairs once it's been
granted and saying, you know what,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.920 position:56%
for whatever reason, whether we
can't come up with a showing of harm

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.070
or just a sort of political
recognition

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.340
that the Copyright
Office is not likely

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.600
to reverse a determination
they've made in the past,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.780
we're simply not opposing that.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.970
And the other thing I
want to emphasize is

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:58.510
that although the burden should
remain on the proponents, it's--

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.410
we're only talking about
a presumption here.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.100
So if you had no presumption, you'd
assume both sides start at 50/50.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:09.500 position:56%
If there is a presumption-- if
there is a presumption of nonrenewal

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.420
or not a presumption in favor
of renewal, the proponents start

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.920
at 49 and the opponents at 51.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.810 position:56%
But again, as long as they make some
sort of minimal evidentiary showing

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.040
that they are entitled to that
exemption under the statute,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.340
they will overcome that
presumption and therefore,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.230
the Copyright Office
would be entitled to get

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.790
out of their rubber
stamp of renewal.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Turnbull?

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: I think I'd agree

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.680
with pretty much everything
that was just said.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:47.250 position:56%
But let me just add that, I mean,
truly it seems to me that the burden

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:53.060
on making the initial statement,
yes, we want to renew, I mean,

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.460
could be-- I mean, it could
be a checkbox on a form.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:03.130
And if the Copyright Office emails
that form to the prior proponent

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:07.150
and says, do you want to renew
exactly what you got before,

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.060
and you check the box, I
mean, as far as I'm concerned,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.510
that would be a sufficient filing.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.840
I really did not mean this
to be any kind of a burden.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:22.540
I mean, that's the-- but it seems
to me that under the statute,

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.690
you do need to go through
the process

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.580
of actually getting a request.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.920
You can use, as we said before,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.180
the prior evidentiary record
as the basis for that.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.840
That satisfies the
requirement that this be done

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.830
in a rulemaking, it seems to me.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:47.470
And the opposition-- I'm sort
of trying to come up with--

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:51.520
I understand the point about making
the same argument all over again.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.390
I-- That does seem to be a
waste of everybody's time,

00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:02.570
except maybe for the lawyer
who bills by the hour.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:07.200
But the-- So, there is some
kind of changed circumstances,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.590
changed argument, there was a
change in the law that something

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.200
that people thought was fair
use was found not to be fair use

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.010
or there was an abuse
of the prior exemption

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:26.520
or somebody actually came
forward with a circumvention tool

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.450
that would turned out to be a
huge problem in the marketplace.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:35.380
I mean, those are the kinds of
things that I can imagine often

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.130
as an opponent coming
forward and saying, hey,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.540
you really ought to
look at this again.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.850
Those are the kinds of
changes that I would see

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.730
as needing to be brought forward.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.210
That's not a matter of presumptions
or burden shifting in my view.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.580
It's just a matter of
practical, as has been said,

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.220
as a practical matter, you know,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.220 position:56%
DVD CCA has not opposed the previous
exemptions that were granted

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.420
and I don't foresee
doing so in the future.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.930
Again, absent some specific change.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.840
And there, I think we ought
to be able to come forward

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.940
and say there's been a
change and here it is.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.240
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.860
Mr. Band, do you want to speak
following up on this question

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.250
of whether, you know, the ease of
showing whether there's changed

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.720
or unchanged circumstances
as sort of a precondition

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.970
to renewing an exemption?

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.270
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Yes.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:34.240
So, it seems to me that to some
extent this whole discussion of,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.680
you know, presumptions and burden
shifting is not really appropriate

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.980
to a rulemaking.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.190
I mean, you know, those are terms
that are much more appropriate

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.790
to an adjudicatory proceeding.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.740 position:56%
And this rulemaking has, for
whatever reason, has over time taken

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.450
on more and more of this
adjudicatory quality to it.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.740
But it's really not necessary.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.430
And, you know, it seems
that, you know,

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:04.750
getting back to your earlier
question about, you know, yes,

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.540
the statute would require
the Librarian

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.720
to make a determination
that, you know, there's--

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.690
harm is occurring or
is likely to occur.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.880
I mean, to some extent, that
can, in this renewal context,

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.660
can occur if the checked box says
do you want to renew this exemption

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.120
because you are being harmed
or likely to be harmed

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.340
over the next three years.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:35.370
And then, that would seem to
me, you know, just on its face,

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.580
that statement plus
the incorporation

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.710
of the administrative record from
the previous would be sufficient

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:48.320
for the Librarian, on the basis
of sort of making, you know,

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.720 position:56%
looking at-- I mean, I don't-- I
wouldn't-- I'm not sure I would go--

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.640
I think if we just-- the
rubber stamp is probably not--

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.480 position:56%
might not pass APA muster, but that
the Librarian, based on that record,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.980
would say, well, you know, a good
case was made three years ago.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.750
There doesn't seem to be
any changed circumstances.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.970
These people say that they're
likely to be harmed again.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.810
OK, I will approve it.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.850
I don't think we need to
start getting into, you know,

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.240
burden shifting, presumption,
all that kind of stuff.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.750
Now, it is conceivable that someone
will come out of the woodwork

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.250
and say, no, I don't
want this renewed.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.550
And again, we're talking--

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.630
now, I agree that if we want an
exemption expanded, you know,

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.730
that's on us to talk about
why it should be expanded.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:43.720
But if we're just talking about,
you know, the renewal of, you know,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.070
the renewal of the existing
one, you know, then--

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.430
you know, conceivably if someone
comes in and says, no, you know,

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.740
it shouldn't be renewed,
you know, that's something

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:59.000
that the Register would look
at in the recommendation

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.680
to see whether they
made a sufficient--

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.910
you know, whether what they
said was sufficiently compelling

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.210
about changes or whatever.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:15.100
But in conceivably in, you know,
the notice soliciting comments,

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.650
you would explain the
kinds of things

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.950
that you would be looking for.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.530
But again, I don't think
we need to start talking

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.870
about evidentiary burdens
or anything of the sort.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.350
I mean, these would be things that
would be considered in the course

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:31.850
of this determination, in a
rulemaking context as opposed

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.280
to an adjudicatory context.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.610
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, so I
think with the check the box

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.940
and rubber stamp, we've
lightened the workload

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.240
of the Copyright Office.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.700
But I think--

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.000
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Which
is our objective.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.300
That's why we're all here.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.600
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, that's great.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.050
But from a rulemaking perspective,

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:51.030
I wonder if we can speak a
little bit more about, you know,

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.340
whether this-- the Office has
previously said that a declaration

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.390
of unchanged circumstances
could be considered

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.690
in renewing any exemption.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.560
Are there ways we could use that or
build upon that to make the renewal

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.940
of previously granted
exemptions easier?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.210
So Professor Tushnet?

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.790
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So
you asked earlier on,

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.560
and I think this is
another version of it,

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.550
whether a one-page statement
could meet the statutory burden

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.400
as the Office has interpreted it.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.730
And I think the answer
is absolutely yes, right?

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.080
If it says nothing has changed.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.530 position:56%
In other administrative proceedings,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.450
facts that aren't contested
are routinely accepted,

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.210
even without going
back to the bedrock.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.450 position:56%
I mean, certainly, if you do want to
look at the PTO as a model, in fact,

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.210
you can rely on things
like a statement

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.480
of five years of uncontested use.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.600
The PTO can actually rely
on that not just to say

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.800
that there's been five
years of uncontested use,

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.720
but that that has a legal
consequence that the mark

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.630
at issue has developed
a secondary meaning.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:52.660 position:56%
So, it's actually perfectly
standard to accept things like that.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.480
Now, I also would like
to say a little bit

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.720
about the meaningful
opposition question.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.580
So, this is just specific
to our experience

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.020
with the remix exemptions.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:07.770
What we hear in the remix exemption
proceedings is the statement our

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.740
arguments about the facts and
the law apply to both existing

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.240
and proposed exemptions, but
we do not oppose renewal.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.840
And if you go back and look,
you'll see that structure

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.630
in basically everyone's,
opponent's comments.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.410
And one question I would have

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.760
for this meaningful opposition
standard is, how are we going

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.550
to interpret a claim like that?

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.510
Does that represent
meaningful opposition

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.810
to the existing exemption?

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.990
Since it's an argument against
it, would we just not take

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.720
in to its logical conclusion?

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.480
And let me just with my
law professor hat on,

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.030
so if the evidence is
relevant to both the existing

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:45.750
and proposed expansions, then an
adjudicatory model does allow you

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.820
to ignore that fact
because parties are allowed

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.470
to make strategic concessions,
right?

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:57.440
But a rulemaking model might not.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.570
And so, one thing at issue here is

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.360
to decide what this
proceeding will be.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.690
And once we have a
better grasp on that,

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.900
some of the answers will follow.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.160
But I think right now,
we actually are,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.860
as Jonathan was saying,
we go back and forth.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.210
Some is adjudicatory.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.510
Some is rulemaking.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:18.230
You know, and that's part
of what makes it difficult.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.920
And then relatedly, just again
for the remix specifically,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.930
in terms of meaningful opposition,
as a practical matter, you know,

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.760
I expect that the opponents will
always come back saying, hey,

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.980
there's a new screen
cap program out,

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.280
you know, there's a new processor.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.490
It's faster and it's better.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.200
And, you know--

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.830
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: But
you've heard next to you--

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.130
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Yeah.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:41.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: -- the general
opponents saying they don't do that.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.730 position:56%
They don't oppose the existing ones.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.730
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: But if-- I
encourage you then to go back

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.100
and look at the comments
because they're absolutely right.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.600 position:56%
They're saying they don't oppose it.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.200
But the arguments they make--
and they say this too--

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.520
the arguments they make
apply to both the existing

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.210
and the proposed extension
but they are not opposing.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.920
And so, one question for you

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:05.070
as decision-maker is what
consequences ought that concession,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.490
if it is a concession, have?

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:08.790
Right, does that count?

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.370
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Sure, and I
mean, just since our goal is

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.840
to build consensus, I think in
the past, the Office took them

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.930
at their word when they said they
were not opposing and held them

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.520
to that as opposed to saying,
well, some of your arguments

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.620
on the expansions would
apply to the existing.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.290
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Well, so, and I
understand, and my point is simply

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.690
that that makes sense in
an adjudicative model.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.430
But if you're really
thinking about this

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.800
as being a rulemaking fact-finder

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.800
with independent fact-finding
obligations,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.570
then that is an intrusion
into the model.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.780
And at the very least, we
should talk openly about that.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.080
And this is somewhat a statement
against one's interests, I admit.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.840
But, you know, I'd like
to know the answer.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.140
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. McClure?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.600
&gt;&gt; Sam McClure: I'd just like to
make one more quick comment maybe

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.630
about the idea of presumptive
renewal, which is that it's--

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.640
an organization is
tied to this exempt--

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.470
if you don't presumptively renew,
then you have one organization,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.440
the original proponent perhaps,
being tied to this exemption,

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.740
you know, process after process.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.690
And I think the point was made
by Mr. Butler and Mr. Geiger

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.130
that once the exemption
is granted, it's something

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:14.310
that benefits the public at large
who falls within that class, right?

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.210
It shouldn't have to be one
organization that comes back

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.760
and year after year, you
know, sort of lives in fear

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.180
that someone is going to
present meaningful opposition

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.570
and they're going to go
back into this, you know,

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.750 position:56%
hundred-hour, thousand-hour process.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:30.320
So, to the extent that an exemption
would be presumptively renewed,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.810
the burden on that particular
organization would be relieved.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.110
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.080
Mr.-- Professor Decherney?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.450
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: I just
want to expand a little bit

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.650
on Professor Tushnet's point.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:45.140
The structure of the comments
I've seen from the DVD CCA,

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.260
the MPAA is always we're--

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.340
in theory, we're not
opposed to the renewal.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.790
But we think it could be limited
in these 10 ways, 20 ways.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.720
And we actually spend a tremendous
amount of time refuting each

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.860
of those ways in which
it would be limited.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.560
And much of the hearing time
is spent discussing those.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.210
So even though it says
it's not an opposition,

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.620
it is in fact opposition.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.610
Just one other structural
issue, which I know--

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.820
we mentioned it in comments
but it hasn't come up here

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.020
and I just wanted to
bring it up is, you know,

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.310
if you do a brilliant job
drafting the previous exemption,

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.830
then you've actually eliminated
this problem for three years.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.360
And so, it's hard to
show that the harm

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.140
that existed three
years prior still exists

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.500
because the problems
have been solved.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.960
You can show that the exemption
has been taken, made use of

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.730
or caused problems,
led to infringement.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:35.790
But you can't show the exact
same harm that was there before.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.810
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So you think you
can't show unchanged circumstances

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.110
because you made the--

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:42.540
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: I mean, that's
true in life in general, yes.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.660
[ Laughter ]

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.960
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.290
Mr. Turnbull?

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:51.420
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: I think the
point's been made about the nature

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:56.380
of the filing in the
comments and I-- fair points.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:01.540
And I think the Office has
appropriately taken those,

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.240
as was indicated.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.590
I think the procedure
that we're now talking

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:11.170
about would probably eliminate
that approach to the comments

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:14.960
because you'd be forced up
front to either say, you know,

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.820
there are meaningful differences
and there are changes or not.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:25.230
And so, I think that the
procedure would naturally eliminate

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.370
that sort of problem.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.190
I think the-- And then, would
force us to say, well, gee,

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.760
is there really a change that we
want to argue here with regard

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:40.420
to the old exemption or is it
something where we want to say no,

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.590
that we're only going to argue with
regard to whatever the change is.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.290
And I understand that that--

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:53.350
And the points that have
been made are fair on that.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.790
The other thing is,
I mean, throughout--

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.600
sending an email to a previous
applicant with a checkbox,

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.300
I wouldn't rule out
somebody else coming in

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.500
and saying I've been
taking advantage of this

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:08.660 position:56%
and I want this renewed, even if the
organization that originally filed--

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.960
I didn't mean to preclude that.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.380
I was just trying to be
helpful in making it easier.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.750
So, I think, you know,
anybody who can represent

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.400
that they are taking
advantage of the exemption

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.920
and believe it should be renewed as
previously stated ought to be able

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.600
to make that application.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.700
And then, we would have to decide
whether there's a reason to oppose.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Cazares?

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.980
&gt;&gt; Gabe Cazares: So, from
the perspective of people

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.670
with disabilities, I know
that the National Federation

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:42.690
of the Blind fully supports
presumptive automatic renewal.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:46.940
I think many at this table
remember the 2010 cycle

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.960
when another disability
organization,

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.520
the American Foundation
for the Blind, was very--

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.600
came very close to
losing the exemption

00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:02.430 position:56%
that they had previously renewed
because of evidentiary requirements.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:07.560
So I think there's something
to be said for taking

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.030
into account the points that
have already been raised

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.850
by the Copyright staff and other
panelists about the statute

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:19.860
and the limitation that the
Librarian has to keep in mind.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.880
I think it's safe to say,
particularly for blind

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.840
and print-disabled individuals,
that within three years,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.510
our status as blind

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:33.760
and print-disabled people
really isn't going to change,

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:40.460
and that it can be argued that
we would be adversely affected

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.340
by not having an exemption.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.200
So, I think that NFB fully
supports what Mr. Goldman

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.860
and others have already brought up.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:55.210
But there is something to be
said about finding some mechanism

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:59.010
where we can simply say
we're requesting an exemption

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.310
under the given rules.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:07.600
Now, not to bring up another point,
I think it's important to consider

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.810
where the burden of
proof is right now.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.910
I think Mr. Band made a really
good point that this is more

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.580
of an adjudicatory issue.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.820
But because of-- that's-- because
these are the circumstances

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.430
that we have now, I think
there is something to be said

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.390
from shifting the burden
from the, first,

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.570
from the proponent
to the opposition.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.490
So, I just wanted to make
sure that that was clear,

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.870
at least for people
with disabilities.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.190
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.560
Mr. Geiger?

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So, it sounds
like we've heard some more consensus

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.610
than perhaps we had
originally thought

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.860
on what meaningful
opposition ought to look like

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.460 position:56%
and perhaps it should be something
more like a change in circumstances.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.440
So I want to draw back to an
earlier comment that I've made,

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.530
which I know relates to also to the
panel on the evidentiary standard,

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.150
which is that in thinking
about whether

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.160
to renew a temporary exemption,
it's our position that interests

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.820
that do not have anything to do
with protecting rights-holders

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.900
or making copyrighted works
available, we do not think

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.940
that those should be considered
for denying the exemption.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.940
In addition-- Or, you
know, or at least have them

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.870
as a very clearly carrying
much lower weight.

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.700
From the perspective of security
researchers, most of the opposition

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.520
that we have seen so far to
the exemption that we had asked

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.130 position:56%
for relates not at all to copyright.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.140
It is about safety largely.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.240
So we have, for example, a
vehicle practice and we're looking

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.370
at cybersecurity flaws
in vehicles with the goal

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.300
of making those vehicles safer.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.820
We saw opponents talking about
the possibility that owners

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:49.060
of cars would circumvent emissions
controls or modify their vehicles

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.360
in a way that is not safe.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.660
These things are already illegal.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.650
In the last panel, it was brought
up, well, what about the hacker

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.130
that says they want to hack
the nuclear power plant.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:58.430
That's also illegal.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:01.550
That's all illegal under the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.020
By in large, the DMCA we're
talking about are computers

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.430
that the security researcher
already owns.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:12.120
And copyright law and 1201 are
not the appropriate tool to use

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.090
to protect these non-copyright
interests.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.480
There are already specific
government agencies

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.310
with greater expertise and in
many cases already regulations

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:23.000
on the books prohibiting
these very same kinds of acts.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.560
So, that is our position,

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.890 position:56%
not accommodating non-copyright
interests for denying the exemption.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.380
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: In the specific
case of security researchers,

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.440
1201(j) is a permanent exemption.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.770
And I know you're going
to speak tomorrow.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:40.000
I mean, is that perhaps a better
avenue to just sort of update

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.720
that to the extent it needs updated

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.180
so that security researchers can
rely on it as opposed to, you know,

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.820
tinkering with the whole mechanism
of the rule-making process?

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.340
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: One
hundred percent, yes.

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.310
And I mean, I'm in
the same position as--

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:53.610
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Butler.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.910
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: --
Mr. Butler that we think

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:57.680
that this is less preferable than
updating the permanent exemption.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.290
Part of the problem with, you know,
even a change in circumstances is

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:01.590
that technology will evolve.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.070
Security research will also evolve.

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.050
It will present new circumstances,

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.040
probably not new circumstances
related

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.850
to making copyrighted works
available, but new circumstances,

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:11.670
new safety dangers,
things like that.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.040
And those safety dangers should
be dealt with by the agencies

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.490
that are directly responsible
for working on safety.

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:19.010
So yes, 100%, the permanent
exemption.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.610
We have specific ideas on how
to change it and we can talk

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.840
about it tomorrow or
now if you wish.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.140
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Let's
save it for tomorrow.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.440
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Sure.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.740
&gt;&gt; Harley Smith: Go ahead.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.740
&gt;&gt; Jason Sloan: I just have a quick
question going back to relying

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:38.350
on the prior record from when the
exemption was originally granted.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.620
Is there some point
in time when relying

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.560
on that old record would get stale?

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.330
You know, it seems maybe if
you're relying on the market

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.630
from three years ago,
it might still be OK.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.360
But what about when
you're 10 years, 20 years,

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.090
because it keeps getting
renewed without opposition?

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:55.980
At least working within
the current statute,

00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:01.310
it says that the determination is
whether users are or are likely

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.700
to be adversely affected.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.170
So at what point-- Is there
some point when relying

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:11.360
on that old record and a checkbox,
does that become problematic

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.800
within the current statute?

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.400
Mr. Band.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.330
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So what
I would imagine that even

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:25.890
after checking the
box, that those of us--

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.630
someone in Washington will
show up at the hearing.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:29.930
And so--

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.140
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: I don't think
we don't have the hearing

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.440
if you check the box, though.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.740
I think that's what we're--

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.040
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, no, I'm--

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.340
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: -- no hearing.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.640
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, right, or
you could-- I mean, it could be--

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.370
you know, we can meet for
lunch over in the cafeteria.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:47.140
And, you know, but it could
be something very, you know,

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.600
if there's a sense that
there's needs to be refreshing

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.370
of the record, that
can easily be done.

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:56.370
It doesn't need to be-- The
point is it doesn't need to be--

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:59.170
We don't need to make this more
complicated than it needs to be.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.470
Let's keep it simple.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:04.030
And so, I think the idea of, you
know, if you want to say, OK,

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.770
let's have a quick hearing, you
know, I'll come in on behalf of,

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.710
you know, the education
community or, you know,

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.020
I can work on behalf of the blind.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.750
I mean, someone can come in and
we can talk about it and say,

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:15.380
are you still using this exemption.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.680
Yeah, we're still using it.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.790
You know, Rebecca can
come in and say are-- is--

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:21.170
are people still making remixes?

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.550
Yeah. They're still making remixes.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.960
It doesn't need to be, you know--
and the possibility, you know,

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.390
so there's someone who can come in.

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:33.190
This is a question of does
Rebecca have to come forward

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:36.370
with all these examples of
remixes that have been made

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.160
in the last three years or does
the NFB have to come forward

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.500
with statistical data on
the number of blind people

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.390 position:56%
who are making use of the exemption.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.670
I mean, it's that kind of burden.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:54.420
But, you know, it's a problem
that can easily be addressed

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.720
down the road if necessary.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.850
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: I mean, the
only thing I will say is given

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.310
that we have to have these
as a triennial rule-making,

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:06.510
which means every three years,
to have the short and then

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.610
like the medium and then the long
I think could get complicated

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:10.910
very quickly.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.910
So any reform I think the
Office would want to make sure

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:16.950
that it's not increasing
the complexity

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.900
of an already complex rule-making.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.100
So I don't know if you wanted
to speak to that, but--

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.400
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Just to--

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.700
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.000
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Related to
that, I mean, the other way--

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.910
not only is it a matter of
these renewals but you could--

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:34.670
again, in my interest of
reducing your workload, the--

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:40.300
you can reduce the number of
categories or number of classes.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.070
So, you know, we've had--

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.770
we've grown from one class

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.990
that basically covered
all educational uses

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:50.480
and documentary films and
remixes and noncommercial works

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.040
and now there's probably,
I don't know, like eight

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.030
or nine classes covering that.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.410
You know, we could go back to--

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.930
or at some point, come up with one
class and just keep things simple.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.210
Certainly, in the case of if
you look at the, you know,

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.570
the 22 exemptions granted
in this past rule-making,

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:11.260
more than half dealt
with embedded software.

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.150
We don't need to have
11 or 12 exemptions.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:15.610
You could have one, you know,

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.820
properly crafted would
take care of that problem.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.640
And you won't have to worry about
regulating the automobile industry.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.150
You know, let someone else do that.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.450
That's not your job.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:30.660
And so, but the point is, you know,
these things can work in tandem

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.370
to really streamline
this whole process.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.920
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Professor Tushnet?

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.940
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet:
So Jonathan-- sorry.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.410
Jonathan covered almost
exactly what I wanted to say.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:46.270
But let me just reinforce that by
linking it with Mr. Cazares' point,

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:51.080
which is, you know, it's not
just patterns of protected use--

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.420
of classes that persist over
time, but patterns of uses persist

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.100
over time, which is why we talk
about things that are, you know,

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.950
non-infringing or categories
of fair use.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:03.930
So people have really mapped
those pretty well, Pam Samuelson,

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:06.040
Michael Madison, they've done it.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.270
And those can be expected
to persist over time.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.950
In terms of, you know,

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.610
don't complicate an
already complicated rule,

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:18.350
I think what we are saying is, you
know, if you change the definition

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:22.270
so that they're 44 words long,
again, like they used to be,

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:27.090 position:56%
then you wouldn't-- then even having
a short, medium and long form,

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:28.390
which I don't think you should do,

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:31.920
would actually represent
a substantial improvement.

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.220
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.150
So I'll call on Mr. Sheffner
next and I wanted to just tee

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:39.440
up the next question, which
is how should we separate--

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.210 position:56%
whether there's an administrative or
statutory, you know, change dealing

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:49.390
with new exemptions, you know, or
new technologies, the expansions

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:52.570
versus the renewal of a
previously granted exemptions.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.170
Because I think, again, some of
it is that technology does evolve

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.260
and this rule-making process
is supposed to be able

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.640
to accommodate those evolutions.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.940
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Right.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.720
So, I just wanted to address
briefly Mr. Sloan's question

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.630
about sort of stale, old evidence.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:11.960 position:56%
I mean, like Mr. Turnbull, we would
not oppose the ability of proponents

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.640
to incorporate by reference
evidence that has been submitted

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.530
in previous rule-makings.

00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:19.230
So, is it possible that
evidence could get stale?

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:20.530
Yes. It is.

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:24.100 position:56%
But I think that the-- it's
largely a self-correcting mechanism.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.090
This is I would envision a
revised system and it's this.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:31.120
So, if a proponent goes in
there and files their one-page

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.990
or one-checkbox form, however it
turns out, and they say, you know,

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.240
and we hereby incorporate
by reference all the stuff

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.580
that we filed in the
previous rule-makings,

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.920
the potential opponents of that
exemption will look at that.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.410
And in deciding whether
or not they're going

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.660
to oppose this previously
granted exemption,

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:53.630
one of the things they will ask
themselves is has the situation

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:54.930
on the ground changed.

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:57.320
It could be a change
in the case law.

00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.610
It could be a change
in business models.

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:02.580
It could be that there's new
technology that enables you

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:08.040
to do what you want to do
without circumventing DRM.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.730
And it could be that the evidence
that was submitted truly is stale

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.680
and doesn't reflect the
current situation on the ground.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.940
And if it is and that would,
again, what I think is going

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.380
to be a very rare instance

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.760
of opposing a previously
granted exemption,

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.750
they would have the opportunity
to do it and say, you know what,

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.210
we actually do have
meaningful opposition here.

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.120
We think the situation has changed
for the following three reasons.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.800
And, you know, there are actually
the evidence they incorporate

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.730
by reference is indeed stale.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.110
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:39.140
Did you also want to comment
on the second question,

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.950
which should be what about a
new technology, for example,

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.170
if there is a petition for
an exemption for, you know,

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.650
4K versus we're renewing
something for DVDs?

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:51.820
How should the rule-making
process deal with renewal

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.620
of the previous exemption
as well as consider some

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.960
of the issues with a new petition?

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.260
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Sure.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.620
I think I touched on
this in my answer

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.740
to your very first question
this afternoon, and it's this.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:10.700
We would support a streamlined
process for dealing with sort

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.720
of renewal of the exact
same exemption.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.990
To the extent people want to expand
that exemption, I think they're--

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:23.310
in practice, it may be streamlined
because the part of the renewed--

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.720
I mean, if you have an exemption--

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.290
a previously granted
exemption asks for this.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.630
And then, they requested
new exemption is this,

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.300
what I'm saying is we don't
have to fight again over this.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.980
But to the extent that they
ask for this much more, yes,

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.450
we think the burden should remain
on the proponents of the exemption.

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.540
And you know, we'll go through
the regular process about that.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.630
It'll be a lot smaller
of a fight than having

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:47.930
to fight over the whole thing.

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.030
It will just be fighting
over this much.

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:55.970
But again, the sort of streamlined
part should only technically apply

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:59.670
to exactly what was
previously granted.

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:00.970
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:02.270
Mr. Butler?

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:03.570
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yeah.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:08.180
So and I think that's largely true
that certainly the presumption

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.580 position:56%
of renewal, you know, that we've all
sort of agreed on would not apply

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.000
in the same way to an
incremental increase so,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.550
going from the existing
DVD and Blu-Ray to 4K.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:21.590
But on the other hand, I would
hope that some of the logic

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:25.270
that underwrites that presumption
logic that we've all sort of come

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.560
to agree to would mean
that that process would--

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.610
that the arguments about 4K

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:34.230
or whatever the new format is
could be a little bit shorter

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.230
because we would all already agree

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.370
that the planned use
is lawful, right?

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.320
Like if it's fair use with a DVD,
it's also fair use with a Blu-Ray,

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.500
it's also fair use with a 4K.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.630
So, that would already
be established.

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:51.030 position:56%
And the adverse effect, some of the
sense of what is the pedagogical use

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.230
of media in a media class, right,

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.000
all of that stuff would
already be on the record.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.390
So hopefully, it would be a much
shorter argument about, you know,

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:04.990 position:56%
why if anything-- what, if anything,
makes 4K different from DVD

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:10.020
or Blu-Ray in terms of meriting
an exemption or whatever.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.200
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Turnbull?

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.500
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull:
Actually, I think I agree

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.930
with most of what you just said.

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:20.210
I think the-- from the
technology provider, however,

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:23.830
there is a substantial
difference between a technology

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.720
that is 10 years old
and a technology

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.930
that has just been launched
and the considerations.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:34.140
And we think that the Copyright
Office should and has made

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:39.320
with regard to new technologies
and the harm to the development

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.070
of the market-- again, going
back to the original purpose

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:47.480
of the circumvention provision
of the DMCA, which is not merely

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.080
to stem piracy, but also
to enable new markets.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.580
And so, the enabling
of the new market

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:59.650
for 4K may have a different dynamic
than the situation with regard

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:02.270
to Blu-Ray, which is
now 10 years old.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:05.360
So, I think that-- I do think

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.800
that there's a substantial
difference between, you know,

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.100
and you can't just sort

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.620
of automatically apply whatever the
reasoning was with regard to DVD

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.570
and then Blu-Ray and
then, you know, whatever.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:18.870
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.300
So Mr. Band, it seemed like
Mr. Butler and Mr. Turnbull

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.620
at least agreed on something.

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.390
Do you want to undo that or--

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.690
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Oh, no, no, no.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.630
I just want to basically-- and this
is kind of very difficult for me

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:31.620
to be in the situation
of agreeing so much

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.830
with Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Sheffner.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:39.520
But the-- I just think,
you know, getting back--

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.850
one of the things that you can
do in building on, you know,

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:53.740 position:56%
the issues that, you know, Bruce has
identified is that in this process,

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.850
the, you know, the Copyright
Office can help manage--

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:02.230
and again, with the aim of
reducing your workload, OK,

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:07.720
you know by now what the issues are
in general terms with, you know,

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.850
this whole DVD/Blu-Ray, you know,

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.750
educational use, remix
use and so forth.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:20.030 position:56%
So you know, one can easily imagine
that, you know, there's going to be,

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:22.170
you know, we'll make, you know,

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:24.720
say we want to renew
plus we want to expand.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.260
And then, they'll say, well, we
have no problem with renewal.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.840
OK. We have this issue
with expansion.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.530
And then, you know,
there could almost be

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:36.870
like a pre-hearing conference
where you guys say, OK,

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:39.730
this is what we think, you know,
we want to hear this, we want to,

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.710
you know, where you can sort of
iron out, figure out what it is

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.630
that you need to know from us.

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:51.140
And that way, it could ultimately
reduce our burden with respect to--

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.450
but the point is it could
reduce your burden as well.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.150
You know, we're talking-- in
terms of what's being renewed,

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:01.210
we're talking about a relatively
small universe of things

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:06.070
that we know now have been, you
know, so that this cluster of the,

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:12.650
you know, motion picture-related
issues, the issues with respect

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.090
to the, you know, screen readers.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.700
You know, maybe one or two others.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.410 position:56%
And so, there's nothing-- I don't
see why you can't have at some point

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:28.190
in the process a meeting with us
where we kind of say, OK, this is--

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.130
what is it that you
need more and what is it

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:31.500
that we're going to give you more.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.760
And so, that way, it will just,
you know, instead of, again,

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.950
sort of like reinventing the wheel,

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:41.330
we can really move the
process along dramatically.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.330
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So, it sounds
like you're saying short

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:47.220 position:56%
of a statutory reform, if the
Office provided some guidance as to,

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.860
you know, what quantum

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.960
of information we thought would
be useful for the Register

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.650
to make the recommendation to the
Librarian, you know, in advance

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:59.160
or maybe sort of iteratively
working with the parties,

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.260
that that could be helpful to
streamlining this and avoiding

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.360
for the renewals, the type

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.010
of rulemaking process we
had for the new petitions.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.310
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Yeah.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.610
No, I think that that's right.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:17.430 position:56%
But again, it's-- I'm trying to push
you to be a little more informal.

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:22.500
And I think that that could make
the process work a lot better.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.800
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.100
Mr. Butler, anything to add or--

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.950
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: I just
wanted to add that the flipside

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.310
of what Mr. Turnbull was
saying about, you know,

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.760
when a format is young, it's--

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.700
the market realities about that
format will be thus and such.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.590
And there will be a similar-- there
will be, of course, a mirror image

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.170
on the side of the proponents.

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.250
When a format is young, the kinds
of harms that we've typically shown

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.790
for young formats are, you
know, there are these titles

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:50.590
that are not available on the-- you
know, right-- and we're told like,

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:51.890 position:56%
well, that's just one or two titles.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:53.280
Well, it's because
it's a young format.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.490
So, there's an interesting mirror
image thing that happens here

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:59.020
and maybe these young
formats really will benefit

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.910
from getting their own
kind of hearing where all

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.150
of that stuff can come out.

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.450
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:05.750
Mr. Sheffner, did you
want to add something?

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.050
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: No, I'm sorry.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.350
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Oh, nope?

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.650
OK. Mr. Turnbull, good?

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.950
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Yeah.

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:14.030
I mean, I-- we're having this
wonderful agreement session here.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:18.860
And I think that what Mr. Band
was talking about would make sense

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.810
and would be helpful
in streamlining.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:29.220
I mean, I think that, again, the--
and getting and having some kind

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:33.870 position:56%
of process with the Office to sort
of work with the parties to say, OK,

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:40.200
what makes the most sense to have
a hearing about would make sense.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.270
I did want to comment just briefly
on the nature of the rulemaking.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:49.630
And this has always been sort
of a hybrid in a lot of respects

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.740
between sort of the
adjudicatory model

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.320
and the notice-and-comment
rulemaking model.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.270
And it seems to me that that's
sort of inevitable in the process

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:04.800
because I think it's unrealistic
nor do I think Congress thought

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.580
that it was going to happen, that
the Copyright Office would go out

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:12.080
and know what, you know, 200
million people might be doing

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.990
with any given copyrighted work.

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:20.660 position:56%
And so, the people who have the need
and to use something are the people

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.490 position:56%
with the information to come
forward and say, this is how we want

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:26.710
to use it and this is why
this is a problem for us.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.040
And, you know, at the
end of the day,

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.870
the Copyright Office has the
obligation to come out with a rule

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:40.640
that reflects the evidence and, you
know, notwithstanding the comments

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.240
about the Commerce
Department report,

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.800
I think that is very
instructive still.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.590
You know, they talk several
places about evidence

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:51.870
and about a record and
that sort of thing.

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.010
So I think that having evidence

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:58.580
in the record is an important
element of this rulemaking.

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.310
But it is-- In other respects,
it doesn't have the sort

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:03.660
of adjudicatory feel to it.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.720
One of the comments that was made
earlier, I think by Mr. Williams,

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:14.090
about the possibility of then
having a proposed rule, you know,

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:17.850
put forward would then sort
of maybe complete the cycle.

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:21.500
That would then feel more like
the notice-and-comment rulemaking.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.370
But all of the rest of it leading
up to it would be fact-finding

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:30.540
that the Office would need in
order to know what to put forward

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.440
in a proposed rulemaking.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.050
And we would be OK with that
as a process and we're OK

01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:39.310
with the process mostly
as it is but.

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:40.650
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:45.580
So, the next question I feel
will probably spark dissent.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.740
One of the participants--
ESA is not on this panel--

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.100
had suggested a streamlined process
for rejecting a proposal, saying,

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.950
you know, just as we renew
exemptions, we also will end

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:00.600
up rehashing the same
proposals over and over again

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.020
that are consistently
recommended against.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.440 position:56%
Should we have a similar
streamlining proposal for, you know,

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.560
a second bite at the apple
of something that was denied.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.900
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet:
So, a couple of things.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.480
I mean, in general, no,

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.020
in part because the copyright owner
always retains the ability to go

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:26.010
to court and hash that out and win
either on contributory infringement

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:29.030
or infringement, depending
on what the activity is.

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:33.650
And that would end the
exemption and end it next time,

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:36.290
whereas if you lose, you
just don't get that chance.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:40.880
So, it's structurally
unequal in a way

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.790
that makes mirror image
treatment inappropriate.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.650
The other thing though is

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:51.980
that considering this rule again
requires you to consider the way

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:55.970
that all these little
additions have been piled

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.240
on to specific exemptions
over the years.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.660
So, does that mean, for
example, are you proposing

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.970
that we could not go back

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:05.050
to the 44-word initial
educational exemption?

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.520
That seems to me like a bad idea,
just because it's been loaded

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.340
down with other things doesn't mean

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.320
that the initial exemption
was inappropriate,

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.280
even though in some
sense, it's been rejected.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.380
And I think the kind of
line-drawing that you would end

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.540
up doing would be contrary to
the goal of simplifying things.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.840
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.520
Mr. Band?

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.470
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: I guess, I
would add to that that the--

01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:36.280
a problem with sort of like a
streamlined rejection is that the,

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.360
you know, circumstances do change.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:46.530
And I suspect also that
rights-holders get more comfortable

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.270
with certain kinds of activities.

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:57.470
And so, just to-- if a proponent
is willing to go through the work

01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:05.310
of amassing new evidence, then,
you know, the rights-holder,

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:08.920
if they're confident that their
arguments were sound before,

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.530
they can-- I mean, certainly
they can always incorporate

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:13.680
by reference say, well,
all the argument--

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.030
you know, these people
haven't said anything new.

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:20.040
So it's not-- you know, we're
not streamlining the process but,

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.580
you know, once you make it clear
it's OK to incorporate things

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.920
by reference or if they want to,
you know, resubmit the same thing,

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.530
if it really is just the same thing
all over again, then, you know,

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:34.920
the arguments as to why it wasn't
valid before would apply now,

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.320
whereas in our situation,
it's, you know, it's different

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.140 position:56%
because we have to-- you know, right
now, you're basically telling us

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.520
that we have to de novo
show that we're going

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.840
to be adversely affected.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.950 position:56%
So we have to come up with sort of
like new examples of how we're using

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.140
or how we've been using
it in the last three years

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.610
as opposed to previously.

01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.900
So, that's why the
symmetry, you know,

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.150
it is an asymmetrical situation.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:02.730
And, you know, so certainly, it
could be done in a way, you know,

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:06.190
you could make it clear that
there are ways, you know, if--

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:07.980
where they can, if they
want to, incorporate stuff

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.640
by reference, that's fine.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.420
But still, the need

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.000
for a streamlined process
I think is very different.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.850
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr.
Butler, do you agree?

01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:21.150
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Largely, yeah.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.330
Yeah. I think the key thing is
just, you know, the incentive to--

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:29.920
the difficulty rather
of seeking an exemption

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.730
that has not been previously
granted is high enough I think

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:35.170
to deter folks from--
you know what I mean?

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:38.310
That's enough of a burden, that
you had better really want it

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.610
and really believe it.

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.550
And so, you know, I
think at that point,

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:44.680
those folks should be able
to get into the process.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.110 position:56%
And the people who don't have enough
of an interest will be deterred

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:51.160
by the difficulty of doing it.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.030
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: I mean, you
would be surprised sort of.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.040
[ Laughter ]

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.150
We do get a lot of repeat players.

01:14:57.150 --> 01:15:01.070
&gt;&gt; Jason Sloan: I have
a quick question.

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:05.760
I just want to go back to the issue
of meaningful opposition and what

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.600
that would mean and what would need
to be shown in those circumstances.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.610
So, we had talked about,
you know, showing something,

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.310
either that it's-- the
exemption is not being used,

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:19.460
there have been changed
circumstances or harm

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.760
or something to that effect.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:29.550
But I wanted to get your
positions on how much evidence--

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.630 position:56%
how much opposition would be needed.

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:35.730
It seems that if you had something
like a preponderance standard

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:40.630 position:56%
and the proponent is just checking a
box saying unchanged circumstances,

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:44.950
it would be a-- could be a pretty
minimal showing to oppose that.

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:48.060
So, I just wanted to
get your viewpoints

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.280
on where the line should be
that would make the presumption

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.470
of meaningful in that
the opposition needs

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:59.750
to have something fairly
substantive, but not also--

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:03.550
but then, on the other side, not be
a huge burden then on the opponent

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.620
such that you could never
really oppose the presumption

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:12.720 position:56%
where that line might be best drawn.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.020
&gt;&gt; Sam Mcclure: Sure.

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.270 position:56%
Well, I think-- and you can correct
me if I'm wrong, but you were saying

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:20.910
that the proponent, short of a very
short showing, is going to just say

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.830
like the check the box of the
opponent, to kick that back is just

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.100
to have to overcome
the check the box.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.610
&gt;&gt; Jason Sloan: Right, to
get to more likely than not

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:31.970
against a checked box
would seem pretty minimal.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:34.480
So, I'm just trying to see
where the line might be

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.680
to give both sides a chance--

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.980
&gt;&gt; Sam Mcclure: Absolutely.

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:42.250
And I just-- I think certainly,
ISRI and I'm sure many other people

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.570
on this panel would want
the Copyright Office

01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:48.180
to be considering the past
evidentiary record, you know,

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.600
and have that form the basis
of whatever determination

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.170
of meaningfulness the
Copyright Office comes to.

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:57.730
So, I think it's really
hard to decide this question

01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:01.020
without having a super
clear idea of how much

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.960
of that evidentiary record
is kind of just pulled

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.790
into this new discussion
versus the proponent having

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.100
to say affirmatively,
we've shown this before.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.860
You know, here it is again.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.480
But I think our position
would definitely be

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.300
that the meaningful opposition
would have to show some kind

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.900
of significance change
in circumstances

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.220
such that the prior evidentiary
record is overcome to some degree.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.170
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:30.710
I think we're going to
try to do one last round.

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.180
In the spirit of efficiency
that we've been talking about,

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.340
we can maybe end a
couple of minutes early.

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.360
Mr. Band?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.020
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, I
guess the way I would respond

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.100
to that question is I'm
not sure you really need

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.960
to specify the exact
precise level of, you know,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:55.240
how material the opposition
is or how significant it is.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.820 position:56%
You know, if, you know, Mr. Turnbull
or Mr. Sheffner's client, you know,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:04.180
if they make a submission as to why
something should not be renewed,

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:08.060
you'll look at it and you'll
decide whether it is material

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.530
or whether it has weight or not.

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.830
And then, you'll decide
whether to kick it over.

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.780
You know, because this
is all going to be--

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:21.600
and I'm not sure how there
would be a possibility

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.500
of us challenging your decision
whether or not to kick it over,

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.800
right, whether to put it

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.210
in the streamlined process
or the other process.

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:34.210 position:56%
I think it would be very hard for us
to come up with a court challenge.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:38.890
So given that you're going to
have a fair degree of discretion,

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:40.190
it's going to be very
hard for us to show

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:42.860
that you somehow abused
your discretion, you know,

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.360
going one way or the other.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.980
I mean, it would have to be
pretty blatant, like, oh,

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.660
there Band goes again,
let's, you know, screw him.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:55.220
You know, but barring that, I
don't think it would be very--

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.030
you know, so I don't think it--

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.830
again, I think, let's
keep it simple.

01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:04.390
Let's not make it so complicated
that we get tied up in standards

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:09.430
and burdens such that we,
you know, don't move forward.

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:12.250
I think we're in a position where
we could move forward pretty easily

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:19.230
and not worry about those,
you know, those nuances.

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:21.160
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Sheffner?

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.460
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Yeah.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.180
I largely agree with
what Mr. Band just said.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.440
And just to respond to Mr.
Sloan's question about sort

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.410
of what meaningful
opposition would look like.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:34.460 position:56%
You know, we were not terribly
specific in our own written comments

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.700
about exactly how the
process should work.

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.000
But let me just sort of spell it

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
out how I envision in
kind of non-legalese.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.670
I mean, what I envision
is essentially a sort

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:48.960 position:56%
of prescreening process that the
Copyright Office would employ before

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.940
delving into sort of the regular
process that we've all gotten used

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.260
to over the last six cycles or so.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.280
So, the initial step
would be the proponent

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.090
of a previously granted
exemption filing something short.

01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:02.400
We can argue about whether
it's a page or a checkbox

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.430
or a paragraph or whatever.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:07.460
And then, the-- essentially what
the Copyright Office is going

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.600
to be asking itself, or
should be asking itself,

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.310
is do we have a real fight here.

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:16.150
Do we have a real fight between
sort of two sets of arguments

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:20.270
or do we have essentially an
unopposed request for an exemption?

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:25.800
So, the opponent of the
previously granted exemption,

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.100
again in this rare case where
someone is actually going

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.020
to come forward and oppose a
previously granted exemption,

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:33.800
I would just say, again, it's
going to be a one-page form

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.520 position:56%
and they're going to identify why
there is meaningful opposition here.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.260
Is it because that there's,
you know, a short description,

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.610
there is a change--

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.920
they've discovered that
there's actually great harm

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:48.480
or significant harm from
the previously granted--

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.180
from the exception to the
prohibitions in the DMCA?

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:57.130
Is there a changed case law
that would touch on whether

01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:59.550
or not the use at issue
was non-infringing?

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:04.220
Is there new technology that would
make possible what the proponents

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.680
want to do without
circumventing the DRM?

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.980
That kind of thing.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.930
Again, a short form that allows
the Copyright Office to look at it

01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:12.970
and say, you know,
do this prescreening

01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:16.490
and say do we have a real
substantial fight on our hand

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:19.220
or is this essentially a, you know,

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.260
a no-brainer where there's no
significant, no meaningful,

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.940
whatever the right
word is, opposition.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.190
And if there is, then again,
it just gets shunted back

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.730
into the regular process.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:33.390
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And then,
would you think if the Office

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:36.660
in its prescreening determined
it was sort of insufficient

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.500
under administrative law principles
or something, we could go back

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.000
and say give us a little more,
like Mr. Band was saying, or--

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.720
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Yeah, again,
I mean, we haven't specified a,

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.810
you know, a whole set of processes.

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:52.310
And like Mr. Band, I wouldn't
want to make it too complicated.

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:54.620
But I mean, I think at a
high level, that's what--

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.470 position:56%
I mean, I just explained what I
think the Copyright Office should be

01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.100
trying to do is screen
out, OK, are we--

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.200
do we have a real fight
here or do we not?

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.850
And again, in the vast,
vast majority of cases

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:08.520
where somebody has gotten
an exemption already,

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.010
there is not going
to be a real fight.

01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:11.980
There's not going to be an
opponent who has shown up.

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.160
And they're not going to bother
to show up unless they really,

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.700
really have a good reason
that I'm sure they'll be able

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.240
to identify in a page or two.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.690
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: People will
probably hold you to that.

01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:22.990
Just kidding.

01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:24.290
Mr. Turnbull?

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:31.190
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: I would agree
with that and only add that I think

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:34.500
that the nature and quantum
of evidence that would need--

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.800
or argument that would need to
come forward will depend a bit

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.820
on what the previous grant was.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:44.330
If the previous grant is
this is really a close case,

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:48.160
but we think that, you know, it's
OK, you know, and we'll, you know,

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.540
we'll go forward, then you may not
need as much to come back and say,

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.080 position:56%
yeah, there is a real argument here.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.450
If the previous was, you know,

01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:01.390
if it's already been granted three
times and this is the, you know,

01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:07.940 position:56%
the fourth time around and it's just
clear as a bell but that end up--

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:12.430
the opinion, the recommendation
is really clear, then it's going

01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:15.550
to take more to come back and
say, no, there's really now--

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:17.850
there really now is a new argument.

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:20.430
There really now is new
evidence or whatever.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:25.650
I just-- And again, I think that--
I mean, agreeing that it'll take--

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.660
it'll be in your discretion.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:34.280
But, you know, I think that
that-- the level is going to be--

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.030
it'll be a pretty apparent
in any given case.

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:43.210
And your question about if somebody
submits something and you go, well,

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.650
on its face, that really
doesn't do it,

01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:47.970
but we're not quite sure
what you're getting at, yeah,

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:51.990
I think that you ought to have
the discretion to go back and say,

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:54.580
you say that there's
new case law or you say

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.710 position:56%
that there's some new technology but
you're really not describing that.

01:23:57.710 --> 01:24:00.210
If we're going to reopen
this, you know,

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:06.020
into a full evidentiary
hearing, we need more than that.

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.910
And, you know, maybe,
you know, not giving--

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.360
not extending it out a long time
or giving, you know, repetitive.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.350
But it seems to me that you would
have the discretion to do that.

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:18.590
I would hope that the lawyers
representing the opponents would

01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:23.140
come forward and do well
in the first instance.

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.800
But if there was a
question, I think that it's

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.190
within your discretion
to ask for more.

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:29.490
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:30.880
Professor Tushnet?

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.930
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So just
briefly, I wanted to talk

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:36.500
about the characteristic or the
characterization of checking a box

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.000
as like somehow not
meeting your burden.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.210
I mean, I don't think that's
just checking a box any more

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:45.360
than when you check a box
saying you've submitted truthful

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.660 position:56%
information on your tax return, that
that's a meaningless or trivial act.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.160
It's an affirmation that the
conditions at issue continue

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.560
to exist, or exist in the
case of the tax return.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.640
So, it seems to me that in order
to refute the box, the checked box,

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.700
you should have to show those
conditions and laws have changed,

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.440 position:56%
just like the IRS would want to show

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.070
that in fact that wasn't
your income.

01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:08.460
And, you know, and if you want me
to, I will submit the entire record

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.480
from the last three
rulemakings as attachments

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.160
so you can consider them submitted.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.490
But that seems kind of trivial.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:15.670
I mean, I would be happier if
you considered the checkmark

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:17.580
to be me making that submission.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.260
If we all agreed that that was what
I was doing, then it seems to me

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:25.520 position:56%
that we then have a full submission.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.910
It's just, you know, one
that's already in your books.

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:31.210
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.510
Mr. Geiger?

01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:37.150
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So in this
renewal process that we're talking

01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:41.480
about here, we've talked about
having a one-page of why we,

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.400
you know, of meaningful opposition
of why circumstances have changed.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.210 position:56%
And if the Copyright Office then, in
its discretion, decides that it is

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.900
in fact meaningful, then they kick
it over to the normal process.

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.760
I would-- You know, unfortunately,
it would be a more complex process.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.900
But I would suggest that in
between those two actions,

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:02.530
you actually give the proponent
the opportunity to respond,

01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:05.340
the proponent the opportunity
to say, no,

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.530
the meaningful opposition is not
meaningful and here's why because,

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.680 position:56%
you know, otherwise-- and hopefully,

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.280
that will inform the
Copyright Office

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.610
to better exercise its discretion
before beginning the long

01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:18.450
and laborious process of going

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:21.660
through the whole temporary
exemption again.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.960
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.330
Mr. Butler, I think you
may have the last word.

01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:27.630
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yeah.

01:26:27.630 --> 01:26:31.290
So, it's getting complicated
now, isn't it?

01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:34.840
The one-pagers are proliferating,
which is good for those

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.270
of us who bill by the hour.

01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:41.910
But I don't anymore, so-- and I
wonder-- ultimately, I think, my--

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:44.100
I guess this may be
too obvious to say.

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.550
But ultimately, the folks who
oppose I think are going to have

01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:51.110
to come forward with
some real information

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:53.590
to explain why they think
circumstances have changed.

01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:57.040
And so, I don't know-- I
just wonder how useful it is,

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.220
unless the Office is willing, I
think, to say based on a one-pager

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.560
and the opponents are willing to
be judged based on a one-pager,

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.230
like no, we're going no further.

01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.530
That's just not enough.

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:09.610
We're not going to listen.

01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:12.570
Then perhaps, the opponent should
just go ahead and come forward

01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:15.910
with whatever reasons they
have, like the full bore,

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:18.320
because otherwise, how do we
know what those reasons are

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.050
and how do the proponents
respond, right?

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:25.340
So, if there is information
that the opponents have,

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.550
maybe they should go ahead and
disclose it or else, again,

01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.810 position:56%
maybe we can all agree that
sometimes that one page will just be

01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:35.880
on its face lame and
you can reject it.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.020
And then, maybe the one-page
thing is a good idea,

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.610
as long as everybody's OK with
being killed at that stage

01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:44.910
and not going forward
to the full thing.

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.020
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.140
Well, we are two minutes early.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.140
So, I'll consider that
a minor victory.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:54.860
And this panel is concluded.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.530
Tomorrow, we start again
at 9 in the morning talking

01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:00.260
about the anti-trafficking
prohibitions.

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.950
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
