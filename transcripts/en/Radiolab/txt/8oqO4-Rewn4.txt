Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y. S. E. Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Today we have the story of just how hard it can be to be who you actually are, what it seems like the entire world is doing its best to make you who you actually aren't. I guess I could, I mean this could be too many details, but um, story starts for us. We had reporter David Conrad. So for me it was back in late 2014 I was living in Philadelphia as a Grad student and at the time David was applying for jobs and one of the jobs he was applying for was at a radio show that was doing a series about international women's issues. And so I, I had this on my mind and I was taking a bus to the university and I just overheard somebody talking about their recent trip to Venice. And of course the classic tourist thing to do when you go to Venice is to take a ride on the canal boats, the gondolas, you know, go down the canal. Maybe someone sinks to the famous song.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:07          It's very romantic on any case. The person sitting on the bus next to David was telling their friend that they had taken a Gondola ride with this first ever woman Gondola in Venice.

Speaker 3:          01:21          Yeah. And then we were like poking around and we realized like how, how did this become a, we know. Who are you? I'm, I'm Kristen. Kristen Clark, also a journalist and radio producer. [inaudible] and she and David are partners and collaborators. I mean, and this is what was interesting is like we realize like how big a deal it is to be a female gondolier this is like, it's like a 900 year old tradition. 900 years. Yeah. All men. All men. And it's always past father, son, father, son, father, son, or like uncle nephew down the line. So this is like a, this has been

Speaker 1:          01:51          no ladies now, no ladies then no ladies ever. No ladies isn't 900 years. Yeah. Just think about that for a second. Almost a thousand years of all men, men, men, men, men, men. And then one day you get a woman, right? As a headline woman breaks through 900 year old glass ceiling. I thought that sounds like a good pitch and you're kidding. It sounds like God kissed you on the line. Yeah, exactly. It's under the, it's under the like the perfect empowerment story I guess. Yeah. And so we're kind of just like googling it and like it's all over the media. It seems like every outlet from the Guardian to The New York Times to the Financial Times to the Cedar Rapids Gazette. [inaudible] made it all the way to cedar rapids to newspapers in Germany and China and Australia and they all, all the articles laid out the same basic story. It was this Algerian woman from Germany named Alex Hae showed up in Venice 20 years ago, got around a gondoliers association that never wanted to see a woman become a gondolier and eventually became the first ever female gondolier Venice, the whole thing of course, sparking this giant gender war. But that was sort of it pretty much the headline and the picture was the story. Many of the articles didn't actually have all that many quotes from Alex. And so for me it sounded like a great simple opportunity to go back and tell a deeper story. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:08          Just like who is this person? Why? Why would somebody be so hell bent on getting into this club that just so clearly does not want them. Yeah. So we, we emailed Alex

Speaker 1:          03:18          just we're, we're interested in your story. We're wondering if you might be willing to spend a few days with us this summer. And I was hoping it would just be like, yes, I'm happy to meet with you for a couple of hours and that would have been great. But we got an email back right away that said, if you come do the story, you have to spend a week with me.

Speaker 3:          03:36          Yeah. And then there are all these questions about like who we were as journalists, what our purpose was, and a bunch of demands. You have to stay in the city. You can't stay in like one of the suburbs and Margherita, even though it's cheaper, like you have to be in the city. I want you to hear these sounds at this time. I have a vision for things.

Speaker 4:          03:52          It's a little odd. Yeah. And I mean the message was definitely, I want to tell a different story. Right.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Did you have any idea what that meant? No, I didn't,

Speaker 4:          04:03          but we had that echo way. I had that echo into my head. So we flew to the Venice airport. Uh, took a bus to city center really fast, stepped off the bus and you could smell the salt in the air from um, from the grand canal and it was kind of raining a little bit. It was around midnight.

Speaker 3:          04:26          We're kind of getting our bearings, grabbing our bags and we, we look up and across the parking lot there's Alex standing under a lamppost just leaning against it with a cigarette smoke kind of curling up into the light of the street lamp,

Speaker 1:          04:45          short hair dark. It was

Speaker 3:          04:47          flipped back. Do you think you were in a Fellini movie?

Speaker 1:          04:52          Really? I didn't know what to think. This person was legit under a lamp. Smoking

Speaker 4:          05:03          travel. So quick up close. Alex look taller than I expected. The strong belt, kind of a, a face that was a little weathered, like someone who works outside all day. On the water finishing quite late. So when you call it a just finished. Perfect. How was your flight? It was long. It was, you know, we flew to Moscow first, which is, since it was late,

Speaker 3:          05:27          we made a plan with Alex to meet up at 5:45 PM the next day on the steps of left in each Shea Opera House.

Speaker 4:          05:34          Okay. Beautiful. For House. Yeah. I was rushing all to find you. So I left all the mess in the nucleus. So anyway, the plan was to go out on a Gondola ride, which was one of Alex's demands in that first email. So we walked around the corner to where they'd gone to Lewis Parked and oh my God. The boat was just like shining. So the Gonio was made for three people's lawn, narrow jet black. This was where the Nobel couples sitting, Auntie cushions, golden trim, and over there then what was the seventh city? Alex had had it about 12 years already. Quite an old board when I got it. And I had a name. This is called pick us up, like I guess this. And you choose it. Yes, yes. Yeah, of course. All right, so he wanted to come in. So we climb into the boat. Perfect angle there, and Alex stands at the back holding the or and we're down sitting in the, in the lower seats. Kind of just like pointing the microphone up. Alex, I know you were just telling us how annoying it is when people snap pictures is okay if I take photographs and every once in a while, no. Okay.

Speaker 4:          06:57          You came here to study at first. No, that's not what I said and it was pretty much immediately clear that you came here. I mean that it was not going to be an easy interview. You came in a study when you study. I know, I know, but I was wondering the ruling, right. You got to do a lot of practice. Yeah. We had a notebook full of questions and things that we had pulled from all these articles we'd read. That pretty quickly became useless. That's what I was asking you is, is you didn't come. And whenever I asked about being the first female gondolier and there were the first woman in 900 years to do this. Oh, it's a Lodestar. Who that [inaudible] read that everywhere and then let them in so little such an over and over and over. No, it was all set already. Why would we need to repeat things? We've already done. This is very frequent journalism problem. Like you become boring to the person you're interviewing. Right? You start flailing. Exactly. And rework. We were like, uh, you don't have anything. Why are we here? How, what do you do? You know, we just thought maybe we should just be quiet. Probably.

Speaker 4:          08:16          We are about to make the Titus. I haven't received 35 we moved away from the tourist centers of the city and into these smaller canals.

Speaker 5:          08:32          Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 4:          08:38          As we'd go around these tight turns. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          08:41          Hello.

Speaker 4:          08:42          Alex would sing out to let the other boats know that we were coming. So here we have a cross and this is why I showed out my direction in order to avoid accidents because you cannot hear the gun arriving,

Speaker 3:          08:57          you know, we'd go into these beautiful archways

Speaker 6:          09:00          whoa.

Speaker 4:          09:03          Past Hidden Gardens. You don't necessarily need eyes in order to appreciate the Gondola tour in every channel as a defense song. Any, some Jones, you have a lot of birds singing. Does it fly any faces? So this is a beautiful entrance, you know, to, to show you

Speaker 3:          09:29          at one point I'd gone to look cut through this rectangle of light shining from an open kitchen door.

Speaker 7:          09:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:41          it was nice. I mean this side of Venice was unexpected and really beautiful. But the whole time we were sitting on our notepads in, uh, we were definitely quietly panicking. Well, you know, there, you know, I didn't know this at the time, but I thought the some, you know, I was like, hmm, maybe a little too young. And I think

Speaker 3:          10:04          Alex was testing us

Speaker 4:          10:06          and maybe a little bit too, oh yeah, we don't have enough experience. Maybe that was my concern, but I liked the A, I liked the enthusiasm and I liked the, uh, uh, there was an honesty, which I liked.

Speaker 3:          10:29          Did you ever figure out what you were being, um, sussed out for or what was going on there? No, for sure. Not on the boat, but we, we actually made plans to go out to dinner that night and considering how the boat ride went, we thought at this point we should return to square one and leave the recorder at home. Um, and just try and have a conversation anyway. We sit down outside and very few people are in the restaurant where we're the only table outside. They had to open when we all, when we got there too, we should say we met um, Alex's girlfriend, right? Yeah. And we're making, I think we're just kind of making small talk and yeah, it turns out, turns out Alex's girlfriend is a photographer and she done this photo essay of Alex and the photos are really striking. Like one of them, Alex is just like drowning under the water. Um, there's one that's just like Alex's back is to the camera. This ripped and muscular back. Yeah. Like arms splayed, like looking out the window over the city of Venice. Venice as lone defender. Yeah, just like so bad ass and like kind of like superhero style. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          11:33          So we were just chatting about the photos and asking Alex girlfriend, like,

Speaker 3:          11:36          you know, tell me a little bit more about what inspired you to take these photos and you know, like small talk friendly stuff. And she kind of was like, you know, it was just, it's so strange, you know, we thought, we thought it was so clear. We like the photos were so like they emphasized every masculine quality on Alex's body. Um, we, you know, in our artists statement, you know, we used all of the male forms in Italian, you know, like Louis, which means he instead of lay, which means she, but everybody at the photo exhibit was like, Oh, must have been a Typo or you made a mistake. And she was like, which is funny because I'm Italian, so I should know. And I was like, oh, pronouns, pronouns Louie. He, Alex, she used, he, he, Alex is a, he is Alex Trans, like, oh my gosh, Alex is a transgender man.

Speaker 1:          12:34          Wow. What did you, what does that mean to you in that moment? What I thought that meant, um, was Alex was probably born in a body that he didn't identify with. Yeah. I mean mine was, I didn't think transgender. I didn't think, I thought Alex is a guy. Of course Alex is a guy. Really? Yeah. I wasn't surprised. Were you surprised? I wasn't that super, I mean I wasn't, I'm not saying that the, the pronounce it is accurate. I would say that like flipping into he not a thing like, like it was like Alex is, Alex is a he, Alex is, he,

Speaker 3:          13:12          he is sitting at the table with us. Alex and his girlfriend come very quickly. It was like him. I'm looking at him and then I start thinking about the story that we had come here to tell. Um, that was about all of the women things that she had done. Her, her, her, her woman hero, heroine, first female in 900 years, international symbol of female power. You start thinking about that and it's like,

Speaker 9:          13:37          um,

Speaker 3:          13:39          those things are really hard to square in your head. This real person is also these stories. And how did that happen? What has it been like for 20 years to be inside of that story when you're actually a man

Speaker 9:          14:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:04          after who knows how many articles have been written about Alex? This is the first time that he is publicly telling his story as a man, and so we should probably just stop for a second and talk about pronouns because this is really important for many transgender people in moments when Alex was publicly understood as a woman and was getting international press for it, we've decided with Alex's permission to only use his name or his title of First Female Gondolier. While some of the people interviewed for this story were unaware that Alex is transgender and do use female pronouns or do refer to him as a woman. We, when we're talking about him, we will only use male pronouns. So after that dinner, we made plans for the next day

Speaker 4:          14:54          on his motorboat and he would just take us to a quiet spot and we would talk, what's the agreement on the water on the water? Shut up. Stop it. [inaudible] hello? Okay. He speaks a lot of false starts. Oh, well, I don't know. Maybe I can ask it. Has anybody, has anyone ever asked you what Gender Pronoun you prefer?

Speaker 10:         15:25          Nope. Never. Never had ever.

Speaker 4:          15:31          So after getting some of the basics out of the way, you know, Alex kind of started at the beginning. Okay.

Speaker 10:         15:36          Well, you know, it's a long story. I was born transgender. This is in Germany. Alex tells us he was born with a female body, but at a pretty early age. Knew himself to be a little boy. I knew already before I went to school with three years I was standing on the toilet to pee inside Alex is that, you know, for him, he, you know, he had the sense even when he was three that there should just be something on his body that wasn't there. Yeah, yeah. No, I was praying for a penis every night. My, my parents knew about it. His parents were actually both doctors [inaudible] but they, they were not supportive.

Speaker 9:          16:19          [inaudible],

Speaker 10:         16:19          you know, I, I heard them, you know, they were talking about all the weird stuff I did, how you'd ripped the arms off of his barbies, cutting them like, you know, it was a black pencil and like destroying them. And where the way Alex dressed himself when there was a swimming lesson in the school, I was there only with little tents or you'd call them the bet based suit for four boys. And you know, I was of course, very aggressive as a child, a lot of fights. You know, I got quiet. Uh, I was quite a violent as a kid. So now I can off about this. But, you know, it, it, it was a drama at home. It was a drama, the constant, uh, try of my mother to, uh, get this behavior out of me. Alex has pretty early on. His parents basically gave up on him. They ignored me as much as they could, which was, you know, in a way it was saving me because I could wear whatever I wanted. I could do whatever I wanted. And then when Alex was 10, a little brother was born and that was a huge shock.

Speaker 10:         17:33          That was a terrible shock because, um, basically it confirmed that my mother wanted desperately at boy, but she didn't accept me as her son. That's what it, Alex said. Basically, you know, that was the first time he saw what like, like it should look like basically when a parent loves their kid. So, um, when he was 15

Speaker 6:          18:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         18:08          he ran away from home. I escaped one handbook. And in handbook you have a huge, um, district called some Poli where they have all the prostitutes and you know, all the bad sings. And that's exactly where I went. Some people kind of took him under their wing, um, got a job, kinda figured out how to take care of himself. I got lucky, but I know also very unlucky

Speaker 3:          18:32          these stories. But I got lucky. Did he ever think about like transitioning to a male body? He says he thought about it at one point, but in the 80s, when I was 15, the opportunities you're fair to become. A men were very, very, um, poor in particular. If you wanted to go down the road of surgery, what I can remember for my family was constant talks about how operations went wrong, how they went wrong and what went wrong. And so for me to go into hospital to do an operation, this is not going to happen. And of course, many transgender people don't end up having surgery. But anyway, after Homburg at some point, Alex fell into filmmaking and ended up in San Francisco working in, in the film industry. And so 1986, he got involved in a production that sent him abroad to go scope out locations for a film that was going to be shot in Venice.

Speaker 11:         19:29          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          19:33          So shows up in Venice in 1886, 29, I think. Oh, she's older. He's not a kid at this point. Originally he's just supposed to say a few days, kind of just enough time to do some research and scope things out. But somewhere along the way,

Speaker 3:          19:48          he sees these guys rowing their boats down the canal and uh, for reasons he can't entirely explain, he's just transferred,

Speaker 4:          19:58          fixed,

Speaker 10:         20:01          fascinated by this kind of bought. And I was fascinated by the rowing style that you'll go forward so you actually see where you're going. So it was just a fascinated and I just wanted to try it out myself.

Speaker 3:          20:18          Eventually. Um, Alex ends up actually meeting a gondolier and asks like, do you think I could do this? And I actually ended up down at the Gondola station as an apprentice.

Speaker 10:         20:30          Um, did they ask you, did they ask you why you wanted to study? I remember the first day I was introduced by the head boss of the group. Okay. So this is Alex. She's going to be all mascot because they saw Alex as a woman and there had never been a woman gondolier most of them. So

Speaker 4:          20:49          for sure this was like a kind of a joke. There was a very old man who will do the latest set. Now we have gone to Leah with tits for the first seven months. Alex says he basically just picked up after the guys. You were the bus boy for everybody. So you needed to clean the boats and to ship out the water like 10 20 times a day. He says, it's really backbreaking, grueling work for somebody that everybody, everybody sees as a woman, you think this would be like the worst place on earth. But you know, actually those first, those first months in the city, just kind of with the boys dirty jokes. I thought this is great.

Speaker 9:          21:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          21:32          Alex knew all the gondoliers nicknames, walked and talked and acted like them and cursed in the same way and he says he felt like he was part of this tradition of, you know, learning from these old guys who work mentors to him.

Speaker 4:          21:44          I was really like maybe the best time of my, my life

Speaker 9:          21:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          21:54          it was, it was like he was home and then the, the travel began

Speaker 9:          22:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          22:03          it started with the journalist. Yeah. Is that [inaudible] or those reporter Consuelo Turin. We met in a noisy cafe, so you know, started in 99 to six with a translator when consoler was a collaborator. Often will have the names. Yeah. She was a cub reporter in Venice working for a very politically progressive newspaper and she was out looking for her big story and she runs into our, how do they encounter each other? [inaudible] Alex a Consuelo saw Alex at one of the gondolier stations and she was like, Whoa, this obviously this has struck her attention and [inaudible] it looked to her like there was this woman rowing among men and like the seeming kind of blend right in the night. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          22:52          was attracted by this vision, unusual vision for Dennis, so she observed her [inaudible]. I camped out for like a whole morning and basically just watched Alex's behavior. Hey, ultra Couto the [inaudible]. Alex didn't want to talk, told him I can't talk about it. Told her basically I'm just a student. They're teaching me. Don't make this into a thing like get, I mean they see [inaudible]. Consuelo said, listen, I recognize that you don't want to talk to me, that you're apprehensive and that this might be difficult for you to go with that. And I get that this might even damage your reputation with the other gondoliers but needed around the importance. This is an important story. The way to the [inaudible], you're a pioneer. I can't ignore you. And so Consuela said there are two options. I'm going to write the story no matter what. So you can either talk to me and we can do the story together or

Speaker 3:          23:46          I can write what I think that we'll see. Alpha, you know, I said it can't go out now. And she said it will, it will. And why wasn't Consuelo persuaded that she should wait? Well there were journalists coming from all over the place. You know, I think the story was going to get out there and somebody was going to write it and Alex never sort of stopped and was like, listen Consuelo or whoever, let me just tell you the real story. The way out of this is to speak and yet he stays quiet. Do you have a sense of why? I mean, so just to kind of give like some like data points that might be helpful and understanding kind of where we were. So we're talking 1997 just to give you like a corollary thing where we were in our discourse around LGBT issues was like Ellen degenerates, I think that year, this is, this is so hard.

Speaker 3:          24:41          But I came out on her show. I think I've realized that I am, I can't even say the word, why can't I say the word? And like shortly after it was canceled, Caitlyn Jenner was just a few years ago. Like we didn't even really have a grip on what transgender was. That wasn't a conversation that we were having in public. Can you imagine what it would be like to be like guys, guys, guys, don't worry though. I'm actually a man that wouldn't have gone over so well with the dudes at the Gondola station. Yeah. So what ended up happening after Consuelo and Alex had this, had the show down about the article. Well, a couple of days later, Alex was on the way to the Gondola station. I found it in the newspaper Shop, the headline

Speaker 12:         25:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:29          we're not done. No speed. [inaudible] a woman is challenging the gondoliers so I was like, oh my God, it's going to be hell. So it's in the newspaper stand. Alex shows up at the gondolier station and of course there's a big hello, a big unfriendly hello? Yeah, just like, oh, Hello Gondola Sierra.

Speaker 10:         25:51          So far as they got really, really angry, they were like, well, we do everything to teach you well and you know, now you're challenging us. Alex has a lot of the gondoliers stop talking to him. They wouldn't even let him wash their boats and then you know. Then of course there were the ones who said, ah, I told you in the beginning [inaudible] she was just going to Blab to the press and woman. Is that a good thing or did it do to turn the whole thing? You know what's like a little stone becoming a huge, huge thing.

Speaker 3:          26:21          By the way, this is right. This is coming right before Alex is about to take the very first exam. There's actually a series of exams and it gets a little complicated, but eventually anybody who wants to be a gondolier has to take this rowing test. And by all accounts, Alex was good. Like we talked to the guy who was the head of the Gondoliers Association at that time I e. Oh, this Guy Fulvio Scarfo was like, yeah,

Speaker 13:         26:46          Alex or me is a more

Speaker 3:          26:50          good, the other main Gando yeah. And this is the head of the guild. Yeah. And we also talked to this legendary rower named Franco Crayon

Speaker 13:         27:00          [inaudible]. He was also like, she put them into Voila. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          27:03          Alex is better than most of the guys

Speaker 13:         27:06          we talked to was [inaudible] answer that. They call it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          27:09          So anyway, Alex takes the test and I failed the exempt, which wouldn't have been, that by itself wouldn't have been such a big deal cause a whole bunch of people fail the first exam. But the thing was there was a feeling that like something deeply unfair was happening. See, I don't know all that [inaudible] according to Consuelo, a lot of people started to think maybe the fix was it to see what other boys there who failed, who were better than other boys who did not fail Alex's suspiciously. Pretty much all the people that passed were sons of gondoliers or from gondolier families because they have had the right last name. So then I got angry. I got a lawyer, Alex thought this was going to bring attention to how corrupt the licensed practices, how corrupt this association is. I wanted that the exam is repeated for everybody and this lawyer was negotiating and the gondoliers association was like, if we let everyone retake the test, that will basically be admitting that we favor certain families over other families.

Speaker 3:          28:10          That was exactly what I want, but it's not what they wanted. They said, we don't want the bad press of this, but then, and this is another moment according to Alex where his story just gets hijacked. My lawyer negotiated without my permission according to Alex, without telling him the lawyer together with the gondoliers association dug up this old law that says, because Alex is a woman, I mean he's not. He's a man, but they thought he was a woman and this law says that as a woman, he had the right to take the test. Again, this time with women judges in the boat, when she came back and said, okay, here's what we're going to do. Do you remember what you said? I was pissed. I was very upset. That was not what I wanted, has nothing to do with man or woman. Do you think she was your champion because she identified with you? Yeah, for sure. It was not my story. It's her story, but unfortunately for Alex, as soon as the lawyer did

Speaker 4:          29:06          [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          29:07          it became everyone's story. Oh yeah, because press

Speaker 4:          29:11          there. When was it? In the next two months, every paper in town was writing about it, spend it by a Gumbo ears examination. Mrs. Nixon. That got banned from [inaudible]. Then the story went global. Jeremiah catches a crowd in every to become Danny's first woman. Going to the sexist sink first female, good [inaudible] fight, a male to leash, failed gondolier blamed chauvinist

Speaker 3:          29:37          and then things escalate into a full blown gender battle. The are of course, super pissed because of all this press that they're getting. We talked to a couple of key like gondolier guys

Speaker 14:         29:47          Alixandra Hey, well no, no. They have some thoughts and feelings about it and she had to pass a test. She didn't as an disaster, Alex is at one point, things got so bad that one of them was saying, I'm gonna wait for you on a small and street and there's a knife and kill you or I'm gonna. So I grabbed the guy and I said, where's your knife? I'm hit get it out. You know, do it that it was one that this all the many Oz's.

Speaker 3:          30:15          So on the one side, Alex said he has gondoliers wanting to knife him on the other. It was too close. Then feminism kicked in and then Alex said he had all these women rushing in to save him. Wait, where do you want me to like us? They thought he was ashamed. We read in the paper that she had tried to take the test and had failed and had called foul saying that the donations were Maine and the United sexist and wouldn't let women become gondoliers. This is gene capital two is active in the community of Venetian women rowers at the time. Women by the way, like there aren't any, well, so there weren't any women gondoliers at that time, but there's a whole community of female rowers. Um, they have teams and they race, subbing, doing venation Ryan for over 20 years and being a female rower and Venice, um, who was very difficult. Eleanor, this woman rower I was talking to.

Speaker 15:         31:07          Thus the week I was with my a rowing partners,

Speaker 3:          31:10          it was like, I'm routinely when I'm out on the water, like old men yell at me,

Speaker 15:         31:14          Hey, what's your doing? Returned back home in the kitchen, cooking or cleaning your house. Why are you here? You're just a Contorno. You are just a side dish.

Speaker 3:          31:26          They both told me when it comes to racing, there's a big discrepancy in the prize money.

Speaker 15:         31:29          The men are getting like four times as much prize money as the women. We are now trying to uh, convince the city of Venice who gives prices that we are like men, we are not less than them.

Speaker 3:          31:44          You hear all these women who have been, you know, incrementally busting their ass to try to be taken seriously in the sport. We are here, we can do this. And when they saw this press about Alex fighting the Gondoliers, they reached out. I sent one of the other considers down to speak to her, you know, come to our club and come and work with us and help us out. Help us teach people. You've got your back. But she wasn't interested. No, of course not because Alex, there are two problems. First of all, you cannot compare the ganglia rollers with racing rose. There are two different styles of rowing. And second of all, the sense I got was that it was kind of like, I don't want to roll with you. You guys all wear matching white skirts. Like not my thing. So, uh, I remember there was a lot of resentment.

Speaker 15:         32:27          Sure. A woman, how can you be one of us in this battle for the equality

Speaker 3:          32:34          me and then they're convinced that I'm a feminist, that I am one of them

Speaker 1:          32:40          and I'm not. And all of this comes to a head.

Speaker 9:          32:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:45          In October of 2004

Speaker 4:          32:50          when Alex has to retake the test and this time with champion women rowers in the boat judging them, it was a lot of pressure. Everything about this test is supposed to be a secret. The location of the test, the path that Alex is going to row. I've had no clue where we're going to go, but suspiciously, as Alex stepped into the boat, he noticed that there was a huge crowd lined up all the way down the canal under the ears and their friends and they're shouting and yelling. She was screaming all kinds of the roads and all kinds of go home. CanNot imagine the heat. He'd female rowers in the boat glaring at him. There's press lined up along the entire way, plus the tourist plus every, everybody say it was full of people. I felt like I'm in a ring.

Speaker 9:          33:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          33:43          I try to block it all out because I needed to do next. Sam, the I wanted to do a good performance

Speaker 16:         34:01          and uh, I wasn't able

Speaker 9:          34:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         34:10          it was hell, one of the worst, worst days of my entire life and we lead on, I don't wish that that was real hell.

Speaker 9:          34:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         34:35          hello, this is David from Berlin. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          34:49          hi, it's Rachel Martin from NPR news up first is the morning news podcast from NPR. When news moves fast, it's the quick morning update on what happened and what you need to start your day. The most important news in about 10 minutes or so, wake up with up first every day. You can find it by 6:00 AM eastern time on the NPR one app or wherever you listen to your podcast. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we're turn now to a story from Kristen Clark and David Conrad. About Alex Hay, transgender man who became somehow the first female Gondola era in 923 years and thus an international feminist hero sensation. And so we now find Alex being painted by everybody in town in colors the he doesn't particularly agree with. And what's interesting

Speaker 3:          35:38          according to Kristen, is just how easy it is to do that to someone. Okay. So I'll tell you as we were doing the interviewing and the reporting, I'm like, I'm feeling like I have a good grip on Alex's story. I'm feeling like, Oh man, I know what it feels like to be inside of a narrative that feels really icky. And so I feel like I'm kind of getting it and I'm like understanding the full Alex and like it's about all of these other things that have nothing to do with gender. So Alex's story isn't about gender at all. And, and for me that made sense because I was like, in my life, gender has been a box. Like, even even when you're in the right, even when you're in the right box, gender is a box and it can feel shitty to be in that box. And so I was like, yeah, let's bust open those boxes together. We're going to show you, we're going to show people who you are, Alex. But then we would have these moments where I would be like, hmm, wait

Speaker 4:          36:29          second,

Speaker 3:          36:32          like one night when we were in Venice, we were like trying to park our boat on the way to a restaurant and, and like this guy is like trying to parallel park his boat and Alex is kind of sitting there like chuckling at him and you, you can hear like David Chuckling in the background. And so the two of them are like, you know, joking about it. And then Alex says like, he drives like a woman, like an old lady. And I was like, yeah, you know, and kind of rolled my eyes at it. But then later at the dinner he was like, he was like, you know, though, like I don't really think that like a real woman could do this job. And he was like, oh, like macho about it. Yeah, I remember you were shocked that I was saying such a much a thing. I remember that of course a you are very right. A woman can do everything,

Speaker 4:          37:23          but the, this job is this going to be very tough because

Speaker 3:          37:29          uh, it's a real, a cruel

Speaker 4:          37:33          community. Amens is very cool and rough.

Speaker 3:          37:39          But when you said that, but when you said that I got, so I was like, I'm so frustrated. Um, and it was because I think I was attached to the idea of like it being equal, you know? I mean, I was, I was, I was just like super confused. Like, I don't know, I just, I just want to know a thing that's not, tell me what you want to know. I don't, and I'll admit in the moment I asked a kind of clumsy question. Do you feel that it was just because you seem to be almost like prodding me, you know, having fun and winging it, David. And do you feel like you're fundamentally on a different team from me?

Speaker 4:          38:20          Oh, okay. Uh, I am on David's team, but you can't see is it because he's, you identify with me, but that's is not a they, I can't help

Speaker 10:         38:36          that. How can I explain it to you? Let's put it this way. When I'm in a group of woman for example, and they start to talk, I feel uncomfortable. The check things they have, I call it a chicken check. It's not really my cup of tea. You know? I like it. It can amuse me, but the minute they think that I am one of them, it doesn't amuse me anymore and I feel uncomfortable and I don't. I'm, I'm a, I'm a little alien there because they think I am one of them and I'm not. When I'm with the boys, I'd feel comfortable. If it is a nice group of boys, which I liked, then we have the same type of humor on the, you know, the same stupid jokes about woman

Speaker 3:          39:27          for Alex. I think what was really striking is that whatever it is that makes him feel comfortable being seen as a man but not as a woman, it runs very deep

Speaker 14:         39:35          for me. There is a difference

Speaker 10:         39:37          between men and women.

Speaker 16:         39:39          Not everybody or even every transgender person would feel this way, but the way that he sees it, if there were no differences, there would be no, no wish to do transition. And there would be no two on sexuality and six like that. If it would be the same if it isn't

Speaker 9:          40:02          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          40:03          So you were seeing him as like a gender doesn't matter kind of icon. And he was saying, actually it does matter. Yeah, we can I just ask a simpler question. When, when does he actually become the first female gun to Lira? Well, so Alex couldn't get one of these 400 or so special gondoliers licenses because he failed the test. Right.

Speaker 10:         40:25          In 2005, I opened up my own business.

Speaker 3:          40:28          He figured out that if he partners up with businesses in town, like hotels, he can actually refer them privately.

Speaker 10:         40:35          At the time, uh, I was looking at all the Lords and I found that it was possible to open up my own business without having a license. So I did. And so for years he was just kind of doing this quietly. Then

Speaker 14:         40:49          Alexandra, she said, not the Gumbo. There she is [inaudible] she works for a hotel. Some of the gondoliers began to notice that Alex was rowing passengers without a license. And of course they didn't like that she didn't bus it. That's saying like, you can't do that. She's not the part of our team that is not have a driver's license. You have to be a member of this organization. You have to have a specific license in order to practice whether we can say she is not a gondola driver.

Speaker 10:         41:13          I got some threats, verbal threats and and damaging the Gondola and since like that all kinds of stupid little boy shit

Speaker 14:         41:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         41:24          so when they understood they cannot threaten me this way, then the pressure at City Hall

Speaker 14:         41:30          to change the villa city basically said

Speaker 4:          41:34          like you can't row, you can't roll a Gondola with tourists in it without, without a license. And the law passed and was signed and it became the real law. Yeah. And so one day Alex is out on his boat and he just gets pulled over and basically he's told you're breaking this new law. And so I wanted to defend myself. So we went on trial in court. It was Alex is one lawyer, City Hall and the Gondoliers Association there, Ford Lawyers for lawyers. I saw, oh no, this last case any already, but sit the whole, no city hall fights back case goes to the highest court in the land. They lost again in front of a court, uh, with me, a little stranger from out of nowhere. Now technically the decision just said hotels can provide for their customers the way that they need to. So if they want to hire a chauffeur who happens to row in a Gondola, they can do that. But what that actually meant was that now for the first time, Alex could be considered a gondolier

Speaker 9:          42:43          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          42:47          That was a huge deal message along the canal to women and paddles against the tying up times came in, woman bakes on Vinnies, Gondola Cartel, Chicago Tribune came in, there's female gone to live, rock the boat. Female women came in. And so this is where we get all of those articles we read before we came to Venice, Venice, the story went all over the world. And at every single one I have a gun to their bravo. The message was the same. We have our first woman Gondolier,

Speaker 7:          43:16          uh,

Speaker 4:          43:20          Rashad.

Speaker 18:         43:21          Oh,

Speaker 4:          43:24          totally. And not held true

Speaker 9:          43:27          the,

Speaker 4:          43:31          so that was something, it was unstoppable. I could not go in there and say, excuse me, you know, I'm not really, you know, the identifying, no, it was gone. Okay. It was done. Alex, at this point in 2007, doesn't have any other income except for being able to market himself through hotels and eventually online and sold. Of course, I need to have a website. People are actively seeking out this person who has broken the gender barrier and become the first female gondolier inventist so it would have been stupid to try to go against those. This was already written. So Alex decides to make his email, his Facebook page and his website, all premed Gondola era or the first female gondolier. Um, I'm wondering if creating a website with that name. Did that feel like taking control

Speaker 1:          44:32          of that narrative or was that narrative taking control of your decision on that website? It's nothing to do with what I've on. That's a label. You know, I cannot change a label who has, you know, 20 years of history shot up. Alex told us he was talking to his therapist one day at this transgender center they have near Venice and she said, you are like in the cage. This is like a cage for you. You can't get really out of this. You know, it's a, it's a difficult situation. It's a very difficult situation. But, uh, I'm tired.

Speaker 3:          45:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          45:19          no, I thought the nasty

Speaker 12:         45:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          45:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         45:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         45:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          45:38          by the time we met Alex, he'd been living almost 10 years like this, you know, just kind of between these two stories at night out to his close friends. But by day giving these tours as the first female gondolier in Venice

Speaker 20:         45:51          and every few months, every new tourist season, these headlines would just regenerate. First female gondolier first female,

Speaker 3:          45:58          gondolier first female. And when we left Venice, that's kind of where we left him

Speaker 20:         46:03          kind of hanging in the middle of that.

Speaker 3:          46:06          And the impression that we got is maybe that's just going to be how it always is for him. By the way, we didn't see each other. So fast forward six months, we get an email from Alex. He says he's in San Francisco. Uh, things have been happening in your life. Yeah, he had some news.

Speaker 19:         46:32          Well, you know, I remember when we were sitting, when we were last talking in Venice and we were sitting on the terrorists. I remember that. Uh, I was already in, I knew there was something coming, but I've, I wasn't sure what it was.

Speaker 9:          46:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         46:58          it was a very difficult year. I was kind of depressed, which, you know, I'm not, I'm not a depressed person usually. And so I was hanging out. Uh, I was not moving much. I was hanging out on, on my sofa and I was trying to think, and I was a more and more every day I was unhappy about, people are telling me that I was a she and another he, I don't know why I got completely intolerant before I was like, I don't care what they say to me. Uh, I care that they're nice and now I was last leg. I can't do this anymore. I was so wrong.

Speaker 9:          47:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         47:44          Alex was about to turn 50 at this point. And it turns out that part of what was happening was that he was beginning to go through the early stages of menopause. I was hot. That was tired, sweat, breaking out for nothing. After fighting with the Gondoliers, fighting with the feminists. This was like a final insult. So, um,

Speaker 10:         48:10          I have this idea that homeless might help with how I feel. I started to take the, the testosterone that was on the 7th of November, which after six hours, uh, I get the first smile on my face in, in, in nearly a year. Like, you know, I felt, felt good and the mood swings, they stopped. Yeah. So I'm now, I'm like, I, I knew me because I was looking in the mirror every day and I was like, who is this monster? He decided to fly to San Francisco, meet with a doctor. Uh, some people wait like two years or three years before they start to do a surgery. I wanted to do it now because for me it was something like now or never. Uh, so now, uh, I'm here in San Francisco. I've had top surgery on the 24 days. That's about, yeah, four days ago. And I wanted to start this year with a buddy, which is confirming me. People see me as a first woman. I'm going to the end. That means something for many people, it's not fair to them. So you know, I need to, I needed to say something. I changed on the Facebook side or changed the name. Now it's a Alexei Gondola truce and I did already a state.

Speaker 4:          49:37          Then on my, on my old website, there is a statement, it says, dear guests, colleagues and friends, after holding myself back for three decades, it's time for me to depart from my wrong body. I am not changing who I am. I am becoming who I am. And is he, uh, back in Venice now? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          50:03          Huh?

Speaker 4:          50:04          Do you have any sense of what that's going to mean for his job or his life? I have no idea. I have no clue. I don't know how my voice is going to be in a month. It should drop. I have no idea how my face is. Gonna look in my buddies. I'm

Speaker 10:         50:22          gonna look in the three years, three years from now, we all leave it as a surprise.

Speaker 5:          50:29          Hello? Hello.

Speaker 21:         50:40          Well idea. That's scary.

Speaker 9:          50:44          Okay.

Speaker 5:          50:48          Oh, hello. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          51:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         51:29          thanks to report Kristen Clark and David Conrad also, thanks to Alexis Unger and summer and of course a huge thanks to Alex for sharing a very difficult story with us.

Speaker 22:         51:41          Are you worried about what the responses might be to it? Oh my God, David. I love warrior. You think this is boring me? I've been to worst, I guess.
