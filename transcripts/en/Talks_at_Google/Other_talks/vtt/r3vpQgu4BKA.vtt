00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.834
female: Welcome to today's
Authors @GoogleTalks.

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:09.633
I have the pleasure of introducing today's guest

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.734
who is a prize winning journalist,

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:16.934
bestselling novelist and
prolific writer in contemporary Jewish--

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.734
She has authored three bestselling novels
including "The Red Tent",

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:21.633
"Good Harbor",

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.367
and "The Last Days of Dogtown."

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.533
On a more personal note
she is my fellow Washu alum

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.133
and your Massachusetts neighbor.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.233
She is here today to speak with
us about her most recent work,

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.533
"Day after Night"

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.100
We're in for a real treat.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.300
Please welcome Anita Diamant.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.667
[applause]

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.867
Anita: Hi, thanks for taking time
out of your day,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:54.800
or I guess you want to thank me
for the legitimate opportunity to play hooky.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.667
Although I was thinking of Google
as not a place

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.433
anybody wants to play hooky
from in hindsight.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.967
[Laughter]

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:03.000
Anita: As a consumer
and user of Google,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.834
I feel that I belong here on behalf
of everybody who Google's as a verb.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.233
I mean my 84 year old mother
knows what Google as a verb.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.967
And when that happened I knew
the world had changed forever, so.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:17.567
[laughter]

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.100
And it's also nice to be here
in Massachusetts.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.233
I got to visit the New York mother ship;

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.800
although that's not the mother ship
is it actually.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.200
But our New York
office which was,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.967
it took a half an hour
just to walk through it.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.667
So it's great to be here.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.867
And I'm gonna talk to you
about my most recent novel

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.700
which was published in September.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.367
I'm gonna talk about
how I came to write it,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.266
a little bit about the research.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.767
I'll read just a short passage,

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.400
and then hopefully we can do more
of a conversation with a little Q &amp; A.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.266
I'm not sure anybody,
has anybody read this yet?

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.100
Only one person and she's
already [Inaudible].

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah! Ok, so I won't --
well there won't be any spoilers.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.200
No spoilers.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
I wrote this book --

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.000
the way I came to find out about
the story that this novel tells

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.233
is that my daughter who
was spending a semester in Israel

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.667
when she was 15 years old
on a high-school program.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.200
And she lived in Jerusalem,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.633
and she studied math and English
and social studies and everything else

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.400
as she would have in her high-school
here in Newton.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900
But she also did a year course,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.834
a semester course on the history of Israel-
from prehistory through modern times.

00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:36.734
So my husband and I went on the parents' trip
which was our first trip to Israel.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:42.600
This was 19-,
it was 2000, 2001.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.867
And we followed them around on
their field trips basically for a week-

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:50.867
we got on and off the bus.

00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:54.934
We went with them to --
all over the state of Israel.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:55.767
By the time we got there,

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:59.500
they were studying the founding of
the state of Israel so we were inabout--

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.400
we were in the 1940's by then--
late 1940's and a little before that.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.266
End of WWII, prehistory,
then the founding of the state.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:11.767
So we got on and off the bus in Tel Aviv
where there had been a big rally

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:15.433
when the announcement came that the United
Nations had acknowledged the state of Israel

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.200
as a real state.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.367
And we were in prisons
and we were in battlefields.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.900
And at one point we got off the bus
in a place called Atlit

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.767
which nobody had ever heard of--
sort of in the middle of nowhere,

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:33.100
a couple of miles south of Haifa
which is a beautiful coast city.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.066
And it's actually Boston's sister city,

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.233
it looks more like San Francisco than,
than Boston.

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:43.133
It's very hilly,
but it's an ocean, sea side town.

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:45.867
So we got out and we found
ourselves in what was

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:47.500
essentially a prison,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.934
it looked like a prison camp.

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:53.767
It was a very bare-bones kind of place.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.533
It was actually--
it's a place that kids go a lot,

00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:00.266
and Israeli kids go to learn
this particular chapter in Israeli history.

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:04.700
It's a little bit like old Sturbridge village
or Plymouth plantation or Williamsburg

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.533
if you've been to any of those places--
except there's no snack bar,

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.133
there's no restaurant,

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:10.133
there's barely a bathroom,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:12.600
it was very, very basic.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.333
And it had been in service,

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.100
and the reason we were there
is that in the 1940's,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.100
the British who had the mandate
in Palestine--

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.667
they were given
by the United Nations to run,

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:25.934
to administer Palestine--
were in charge.

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:28.333
And there were,

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:32.266
there was a quota on the number of Jewish
immigrants allowed into the land

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:38.867
and when people broke the law and
came in without the requisite papers,

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:42.967
they were thrown in this prison in Atlit.

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:47.900
And in 1944 - 1945
right after WWII,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.300
immigrants from Europe,
immigrants from the holocaust,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.400
survivors got to the land of Israel.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.367
The British nabbed them off the
boats and threw them into Atlit

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:59.133
which is a place surrounded
by barbed wire fences.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:03.567
So to go from-- some of these people who
had been survivors in concentration camps

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:05.467
to get thrown into--

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:07.367
what looked like from the outside anyway--

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:12.433
another concentration camp was
profoundly traumatic and frightening.

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:14.467
Once they got inside,

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:16.400
they learned pretty quickly that
they weren't going to be killed,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.734
that they were going to be fed
and that there were in fact

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:24.233
members of the Jewish community
who lived in Palestine called the Yishu,

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.967
who were there volunteering
and working with the local authorities

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:30.934
to connect them with the head
family members in the land,

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:33.767
to make sure that they had
medical attention and food,

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:37.700
and but it was kind of a weird limbo place.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.000
So we got off the bus,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.266
we learned all of this,

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:42.433
this little chapter
of Israeli history,

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:43.900
American-Jewish history,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.400
world history that certainly nobody
on our bus had ever heard about.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.500
And we had this terrific guy who was also
the principal of my daughter's program.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.233
And he told us this story about
how in 1945, in October of 1945,

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:04.700
the Palmach, which was the fighting arm
of the Jewish community there,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.700
broke everybody out of the camp

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.767
because they were threatening
to send people back to Iraq

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:11.900
in particular where they would have been killed.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.934
And they rescued 200 people, marched them
up the mountains and got away with it.

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:21.033
So here's your [inaudible] rescue which
is-- which Yitzhak Rabin was part of,

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.467
who was the past prime minister of Israel.

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:24.834
So it was a great story,

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:27.133
and I'm sitting there thinking to myself,

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.233
'What a great novel.'

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:30.767
And that was in 2000,

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:33.467
but I really was not in a big rush
to write this novel

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.600
because I knew it was gonna be heavy.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.333
I'd need to spend--
it takes me about 3 years

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.533
from the beginning of starting
to do the serious research

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:46.166
and writing and rewriting and rewriting
and rewriting until a book comes out.

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:49.734
To spend 3 years really thinking
about the holocaust,

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:53.767
thinking about what life must
have been like for people after the war

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.400
trying to find a new life in a new place

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.367
where everything was unfamiliar
to them-- the land, the climate,

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.066
everybody around them.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:05.600
People who were traumatized
in a million different ways.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600
So I wrote three other novels,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.633
books including two novels
and a non-fiction book.

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:14.667
But this story was sort of sitting
at the back of my shoulder and tapping me

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.533
and I didn't want anyone else
to get to it before I did,

00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:18.900
so there was that element.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.266
So about four years ago,

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:26.166
I wrote a brief proposal, got a contract
and started working on this book.

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:30.100
And I went back to Atlit,
back to Israel a couple of times.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.500
Interviewed people there,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.200
and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.600
I'm gonna read you the prologue

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.734
and ask you not to follow along
in your books.

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:42.200
Go back to being a little kid on your parent's lap

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.300
which is how everybody I think
who loves books

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.667
and reading learns to love books and reading.

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.300
It's very short, it's only three pages.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.700
So this is the prologue to
"Day after Night".

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.633
[clears her throat.]

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:58.266
"1945, August.

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:01.633
The nightmares made
their rounds hours ago.

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:04.400
The tossing and whimpering are over.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.033
Even the insomniacs have settled down.

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:09.367
The 20 restless bodies rest,

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:13.300
and faces aged by grief hunger
and doubt relax

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.166
to reveal the beauty and the pity
of their youth.

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:20.100
Not one of the women in barrack C is 21,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.667
but all of them are orphans.

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.867
Their cheeks press against
small military issue pillows

00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:28.266
that smell of disinfectant.

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:31.967
Lumpy and flat from long service
under heavier heads,

00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:34.633
they bear no resemblance
to the goose down clouds

00:08:34.633 --> 00:08:36.900
that many of them enjoyed in childhood.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.133
And yet the girls burrow
into them with perfect contentment,

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.734
embracing them like teddy bears.

00:08:43.734 --> 00:08:47.033
There were no pillows for them
in the other barracks.

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:50.734
No one gives a pillow to an animal.

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:54.800
The British built Atlit in 1938
to house their own troops.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.266
It was one in a group of bases,
garages and storage units

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:01.867
on a coastal plain a few miles
south of Haifa.

00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:03.567
But at the end of the World War,

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:07.266
as European Jews began making
their way to the ancestral homeland

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:10.367
in violation of international
political agreements,

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:13.967
the mandate in Palestine
became messier.

00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:17.233
Which how it came to pass the Atlit
was turned into a prison,

00:09:17.233 --> 00:09:20.433
or in the language of command,
a detention center

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:24.000
for refugees
without permissory papers.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.033
The English arrested thousands
as illegal immigrants,

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.567
sent most of them to Atlit,

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:33.533
but quickly set them free
like fish too small to fry.

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:37.600
It was a perfectly forgettable compound
composed of wooden barracks and buildings

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.834
set out in rows on a scant square acre
surrounded by weeds and potato fields.

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:48.633
But the place offered a grim welcome to
the exhausted remnant of the "Final Solution"

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:52.333
who could barely see
past those barbed wire fences,

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.967
three of them in fact.

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:58.233
Concentric lines that scrawled a
crabbed and painful hieroglyphic

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.100
across the sky.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.100
Not half a mile to west of Atlit,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.000
the Mediterranean breaks
against a rocky shore.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.433
And when the surf is high,

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:12.100
you can hear the stones hiss
and sigh in the tidal wash.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.600
On the eastern horizon,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.033
the foothills of the Carmel
reach heavenward,

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.667
in keeping with their name Karan El,

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.600
the vineyard of God.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.133
Sometime the candles of the village
are visible in the high distance,

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:25.967
but not at this hours.

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:29.100
The night is too old for that.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.934
It is cool in the mountains,
but hot and damp in Atlit.

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:35.700
The overhead lights throb
and buzz in the moist air,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.400
heavy as a blanket,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.033
nothing moves.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:41.934
Even the sentries in their guard towers
are snoring,

00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:45.100
lulled by the stillness and sapped
like their prisoners

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.400
by the cumulative weight of the heat.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.834
There are no politics
in the waning hour of the night.

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:53.066
No regret,

00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:54.066
no delay,

00:10:54.066 --> 00:10:55.266
no waiting,

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:57.800
all of that will return with the sun,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.867
and the waiting is worse than the heat.

00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.467
Everyone who's locked up in Atlit
waits for an answer to the

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:04.633
same questions,

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:06.433
'When will I get out of here?

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:09.433
When will the past be over?'

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:12.400
There are only 170
inmates in Atlit tonight,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.300
and fewer than 70 women in all.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.233
It's the same lopsided ratio on
the chaotic roads of Poland and Germany,

00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:21.667
France and Italy--

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:25.000
the same in the train stations,
and the displaced persons camps,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.333
in queues for water,

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.200
identification cards,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.433
shoes, information.

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:32.800
The same quotient too
in the creaking leaky boats

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.133
that secretly ferry survivors into
Palestine.

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:40.000
There is no mystery
to this arithmetic.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.033
According to Nazi calculation,

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:45.300
males produced more value alive than dead,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.734
if only marginally,

00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:48.400
if only temporarily,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.567
so they killed the women faster.

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:53.100
In barrack C,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.967
the corrugated roof releases
the last degree of yesterday's sun,

00:11:56.967 --> 00:12:01.467
warming the blouses and skirts
that hand like ghosts from the rafters.

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:04.700
There are burlap sacks suspended there as well,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.600
lumpy with random rescued treasures--

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.233
photograph albums, books, candlesticks,

00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:11.400
wooden bowls,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.800
broken toys, tablecloths,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.400
precious debris.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.367
The narrow cots are lined up unevenly
against the naked wood walls.

00:12:20.367 --> 00:12:24.633
The floor is littered with thin wool blankets
kicked aside in the heat.

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:28.333
A baby crib stand
empty in the corner.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:29.433
In Haifa,

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:31.400
the lights are burning in the bakeries

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.867
where the bread rises and the workers
pour coffee and light cigarettes.

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:38.734
On the kibbutz,
among the pine trees high in the Carmel,

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:42.300
Darien are rubbing their eyes
and pulling on their boots.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.867
In Atlit, the women sleep,

00:12:44.867 --> 00:12:46.834
nothing disturbs them.

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:49.867
No one notices the soft stirring
of a breeze--

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:54.533
the blessing of the last
and gentlest chapter of this day.

00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:58.533
It would be a kindness to prolong
this peace and let them rest a bit longer,

00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:02.100
but the darkness is already heavy
with the gathering light.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.934
The birds have no choice
but to announce the dawn.

00:13:05.934 --> 00:13:09.433
Eyes begin to open."

00:13:09.433 --> 00:13:13.967
And then we enter the world
for a bit of Atlit

00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:18.834
and four, four young women in particular.

00:13:18.834 --> 00:13:23.066
Atlit, in what still remains in Atlit,

00:13:23.066 --> 00:13:27.633
which is I said is a tourist attraction
an education center,

00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:30.133
mostly for Israeli kids but also Americans

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.000
who are coming through on one
of these particular historical tours.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.700
And one of the buildings that's still standing
in addition to some of the barracks

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.467
is this giant kind of hangar-like place

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:42.433
which is called the 'delousing shed'
by the inmates,

00:13:42.433 --> 00:13:43.934
and that's what I call it in the book.

00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:46.867
And it's this - it's an enormous space

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.867
which scared the living daylights
out of people

00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:51.934
because as they walked towards the front doors,

00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:57.033
there were these giant machines to steam
people's clothes to get the lice off of them,

00:13:57.033 --> 00:13:59.300
and they were exactly the same make and model

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.033
as the machines in some
of the concentration camps.

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:04.433
So people who had been through that saw this

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:09.300
and fainted and screamed and thought
they were going to be killed.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.800
And no matter how much
reassurance people could give them

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.633
there was this tremendous dissonance between
what they were seeing and remembering

00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:17.467
and then what they were being told--

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:20.633
even by people who spoke in their own language
and were trying to reassure them.

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:24.266
But in this big space now
where you can still see the showers

00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:25.700
where people were sent to take showers--

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:31.333
they were full of lice
and they were filthy after being,

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:36.467
most of them had come over on boats
in crowded ancient creaking leaky boats.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:40.367
So they had to be cleaned and deloused
and given new clothes.

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:41.600
But right now this also still--

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.166
it's a giant empty space
with pictures all over the walls

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:50.934
from the early days-- from the 1940's,
from 1944, 45, 46.

00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:54.367
And there are pictures of a lot
of young men with their shirts off,

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:57.266
with their arms around each other dancing
and mugging for the cameras.

00:14:57.266 --> 00:15:01.100
Very hot, in this place,
especially in the summer.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.166
And there are fewer girls
as I mentioned in this prologue.

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.767
And some of the women,

00:15:06.767 --> 00:15:10.133
the pictures of women are like sort of standing
like this with their faces very closed.

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:11.967
They're not mugging for the camera.

00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:15.333
And I was really intrigued
by what those stories were like.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:19.133
So my book tells the story
in particular of four women,

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:20.700
from four very different experiences,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.400
only one of whom was
a concentration camp survivor.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.367
The others were in hiding.

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:26.800
One of them is actually a partisan fighter,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.567
and what their experiences
were like during the war.

00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:31.967
So it's from four very different directions.

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:34.066
Because there is not just one holocaust story;

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.967
there is not just one arrival in Israel story;

00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:38.900
there are multiple stories.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.600
And over the course of this,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.734
of actually over a summer--
it starts in August and ends in October--

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:48.500
these four women
become friends in a kind of way,

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.600
become family to each other in a kind of way
because they are all essentially orphans.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.967
So they are forced to learn
one another's language pretty quickly

00:15:56.967 --> 00:16:02.500
and make alliances in order to sort
of come back to life after the horrors

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.734
that they had been through in Europe.

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:10.900
I'm gonna stop and invite questions.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.367
I can keep talking for a long time,
but I'd much rather interact. Yeah?

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:16.834
&gt;&gt; I'd love to hear more about
how you did the character research.

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:18.800
Anita: Character research?
female: Yeah.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.033
Anita: Again, I never know how to answer that.

00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.900
Because I knew pretty early on
that I didn't just want one protagonist,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.166
I wanted to tell it
from multiple points of view.

00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:29.400
Because I know that,
even in my own family,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.033
the people who'd been
through the experiences of the war,

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.200
their temperament,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.700
their family constellation
and fate and luck--

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.967
just--, people react differently.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.667
So some people are horribly bitter
for the rest of their lives,

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.934
and some people become remarkably forgiving.

00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.100
And why?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.800
Why does that happen?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.867
So I was sort of curious to explore that.

00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:52.266
So there are four characters
from different countries,

00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:55.467
from different kind of
socio-economic backgrounds.

00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:58.133
And so, once I sort of set them up--

00:16:58.133 --> 00:17:00.633
and what was really important to me
was to come up with their names

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:01.967
and locate where they were from.

00:17:01.967 --> 00:17:06.066
And then I sort of started
to imagine and invent who they are.

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.633
And in my process,

00:17:07.633 --> 00:17:10.300
as I write, I get to know them.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.700
Then as I revise,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.700
I really get to know them.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.867
So, one of the characters,

00:17:16.867 --> 00:17:19.266
Teddy-- her name came to me,

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:22.667
Teddy Pastore who grew up
in Amsterdam--

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:23.867
came to me very early on.

00:17:23.867 --> 00:17:27.433
Some of the other characters names
changed like a year into it.

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:30.834
And then they sort of settled
and it was like that's the right name.

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.600
Names are really hard,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.900
and really important.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.100
So I did research about the Jewish community
in Amsterdam,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.266
so I got a little bit of background in addition

00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:46.333
to what everybody know about Anne Frank.

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:48.233
And I did a lot of reading,

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.500
and I also interviewed people,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.600
a handful of people who had been in Atlit
when they were very young,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.100
like teenagers,
like 14, 15 years old

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:02.834
who had come over after the war
and are now in their 70's remembering back.

00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:04.467
And I also,

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:07.967
I hired somebody who
translated a bunch of,

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:11.367
very short kind of remembrances
of what it had been like in Atlit

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:12.934
in order to move forward.

00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:15.233
One of the really interesting things about,

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:17.433
that I learned doing research
for this book was that

00:18:17.433 --> 00:18:24.400
nobody talked about the holocaust
until about 1965 during the Eichmann trials

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.967
to a broadcast internationally.

00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:29.200
And this was-- Eichmann was one
of the architects of the Final Solution

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.300
of the slaughter of so many millions
of people in Europe.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.767
And it was broadcast internationally
and sort of opened the floodgates.

00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:40.500
And people who'd been through
those years in Europe started to talk

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.700
and be interviewed and people
started to ask questions.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.033
But until then,

00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:48.367
there was this real
reluctance to talk about it.

00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:51.367
There was a tremendous
amount of guilt and shame.

00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:52.500
Why did I survive?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.467
Why did my sister not survive?

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:56.834
And then for people
who hadn't been there,

00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:58.033
'Why didn't I do more?

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.734
Why didn't I stop this from happening?

00:19:00.734 --> 00:19:02.734
How could this have happened?'

00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:05.700
So there was this sort of conspiracy
of silence through all this.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.533
So until pretty recently,

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:10.734
people who had been though this,
people who had landed in Atlit,

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.000
they weren't so keen to talk
about their experiences.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.633
So by the time they got,

00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:17.133
they started to do world histories
and stuff like that,

00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:20.467
a lot of them had died and
some of them had forgotten a lot

00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:23.333
or just didn't want to talk
about it anymore.

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.834
So that's the challenge.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.533
&gt;&gt; I would be an aspiring writer
if Google didn't work me so hard.

00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:35.266
[laughter]

00:19:35.266 --> 00:19:36.500
&gt;&gt; Sidebar.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.900
So I'm curious about your process
when you write.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.600
Do you start with just like a theme
and then you build up to an outline?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.633
Or do you just sort of start writing and see
where that story goes organically from there?

00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:49.500
Anita: Yes.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.767
[Laughter]

00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:54.100
Anita: I usually-- when I--
I've written three novels

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.166
and I'm about to start a fourth one
and I still feel like very much a journeyman.

00:19:57.166 --> 00:20:00.266
I sort of learn how to do it
again every single time I write.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.767
I was a non-fiction writer
for many many years.

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:04.000
I'm pretty
comfortable with that.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.233
I know how to do that.

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:08.166
Fictions always [Small scream]
when I do it.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.500
But I usually have a
beginning and an ending.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.333
Sort of a-- you know sort of a--

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:14.633
the parenthesis of the story.

00:20:14.633 --> 00:20:15.734
I kind of know where it's going.

00:20:15.734 --> 00:20:18.633
That doesn't mean I know exactly
what it's gonna look like.

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:18.967
So,

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.900
every single time I've tried,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.200
I've sort of-- I know
where I'm starting from.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.934
I have some kind of a plot line
which also might change along the way.

00:20:27.934 --> 00:20:29.467
But there's,

00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:32.533
there's a beginning line and
the end line and the dead line.

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:35.033
And having been a journalist
for a long time,

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:38.200
I don't know how anybody does
this without that kind of training

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.333
that you have to meet your deadlines.

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:43.266
'Cause people work on novels for
20 years and they never finish them.

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:44.300
But that would drive me crazy.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.667
So, I know that much.

00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:49.934
I sometimes know about the
main characters a little bit.

00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:52.066
So once I decided on
these four characters,

00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:55.667
there's a bunch of other people
who are important in the book as well.

00:20:55.667 --> 00:21:00.166
Sometimes they develop more into
becoming major minor characters,

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:03.400
sometimes they fade away completely.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.033
And then I start doing research.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.166
Even in the contemporary novel
that I wrote,

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:10.266
I had to do a lot of research.

00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:12.667
And that feeds the writing
a lot for me.

00:21:12.667 --> 00:21:15.967
Because the more I learn about
any given period of history,

00:21:15.967 --> 00:21:19.900
or the climate or the food.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.834
I'm a big-- I'm very interested
in the tactile stuff--

00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:26.667
what people are eating and wearing
and how life is organized

00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:28.633
and how old are you
when you get married.

00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:31.467
And how many kids do
people generally have.

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:35.400
All of that kind of helps me
give shape to what I'm doing.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.133
So I do research while I'm writing,

00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:41.800
pretty much through the first draft.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.533
Although I'll start with a lot of research,

00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:45.333
but then I'll get started.

00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:47.734
Otherwise I can just sort of get seduced

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:50.233
by learning more and more
about any given period.

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:53.000
And nobody really wants to know
everything you learned

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.433
which is a lot of research so you have
to leave a lot outside of it.

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:02.233
It's hard to write and have a real job
at the same time.

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:05.266
It's really challenging.

00:22:05.266 --> 00:22:07.133
And if you're interested in doing it,

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:10.200
I think you need either a writing class
or a writing group

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.100
where other people are waiting
to see what you write.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.166
'Cause it's really lonely otherwise,

00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:17.333
and it's very easy to just say,

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.000
'I'm too tired.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.967
I have laundry to do', whatever.
[laughter]

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:23.000
Whatever you need to do.

00:22:25.934 --> 00:22:29.233
female: Do you ever web your characters
to create names?

00:22:29.233 --> 00:22:30.000
Anita: Web them?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.633
female: Like kind of put the images
of what the person is

00:22:34.633 --> 00:22:38.767
to fill them out as a person?

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:39.867
Anita: No I don't actually.

00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:42.400
That's the more organic part of what I do.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.934
They sort of develop
as I'm writing on the page.

00:22:45.934 --> 00:22:47.567
And then,

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:50.233
I have never written a book
without a computer.

00:22:50.233 --> 00:22:51.900
I don't know how people
did that beforehand.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.133
So it's very easy to go back--
female: Right.

00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:58.100
Anita: --and revise and just sort of
search and change

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.467
everybody's name once.

00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:00.066
[laughter]

00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:02.533
Once you made it,
then not a blonde,

00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:03.266
no no no,

00:23:03.266 --> 00:23:05.667
you can change that back.

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:06.533
But no I don't.

00:23:06.533 --> 00:23:09.066
And I know that's a writing exercise
that a lot of people are given.

00:23:09.066 --> 00:23:10.000
There's that sort of ,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.433
here's the character, what does she look like,
what's her back story,

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:14.700
who's her father, what did he do--

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.967
sort of to map out--

00:23:15.967 --> 00:23:19.934
but I've never taken a creative writing class.

00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:22.233
I was a journalist for a long time,

00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:25.200
and I didn't take any journalism classes either.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.066
And sort of learned,

00:23:27.066 --> 00:23:36.233
I had great editors as a journalist
and learned by doing on the job.

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:41.100
female: What was the most interesting story
you heard while interviewing people early?

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:50.233
Or the most fascinating moment
you had throughout that process?

00:23:50.233 --> 00:23:54.033
Anita: Well I think they all took place
while I was in these very intense little trips

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:54.633
when I was there.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:58.800
I had two kind of business trips
and I spent an extra day

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.934
working on the book while I was there.

00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:05.467
And so one, one of them actually,
if you read the book,

00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:08.166
the epilogue of the book is fictional,

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:11.367
but it takes place in the room
that I describe with the gentlemen

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:13.266
who looks very much the person I describe

00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:16.467
and that was a very powerful experience.

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:19.166
And he-- his story doesn't
really figure in here.

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.233
But he, he was Romanian.

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:23.934
He went back and forth
during the war and after the war

00:24:23.934 --> 00:24:28.667
to try to rescue people and bring people
from Romania to Palestine,

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:29.500
to get them out.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.233
And he was just a remarkably sweet and strong

00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:37.400
and at that point very old and sick
at the same time, personal.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.867
So it was really--

00:24:38.867 --> 00:24:43.834
I felt like I was meeting somebody out of
another chapter of history in a lot of ways.

00:24:43.834 --> 00:24:45.734
So that was very powerful.

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:50.467
And I remember also another trip
hiking around the mountains

00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:54.400
'cause-- so the-
as I described Atlit as near the coast.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.233
But it's not far up to the mountains,
so you actually can walk.

00:24:58.233 --> 00:25:02.200
And they marched people up the mountains
in the dark of the moon,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.400
which is kind of crazy.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.166
Women and children without enough shoes
and stuff like that.

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:07.567
So we, I went there,

00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:10.867
and the people who work at Atlit--
the director and the oral historian

00:25:10.867 --> 00:25:13.500
who's collecting material
of the story in the camp.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.100
So we were, we didn't walk it,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.367
we drove part of the way and we walked
part of the way and had a picnic.

00:25:17.367 --> 00:25:18.600
Everyone feeds you a lot there.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.000
So I asked them a question.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.700
And I had a translator with me too
'cause some had some English,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.667
I have like no Hebrew.

00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:30.867
So I asked a question about
whether it was possible,

00:25:30.867 --> 00:25:34.066
whether it could have unfolded
the way I was imagining it.

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:36.533
So they talked to each other back and forth

00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:40.133
for a good three minutes solidly debating
back and forth.

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:41.967
And then they turned
to me and said "yes".

00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:43.700
[laughter]

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.400
So I remember that, very vividly.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.567
They decided I could tell it that way.

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:53.800
The book just came out in
Hebrew a couple of weeks ago.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.367
It's #2 on the best seller list in Israel
so that's very nice.

00:25:58.367 --> 00:26:01.867
female: How do you separate yourself
emotionally when you're writing

00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:04.333
about something so heavy?

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:08.100
And how do you keep that
from really inhibiting your personal life

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.667
because I can imagine
that's very difficult to write about it

00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:15.834
and then go out
for dinner or meet friends?

00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:17.166
Or do you not, I mean - does it...

00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:18.367
Anita: No I do have a life.

00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:19.567
female: does it flow over?

00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:23.133
Anita: No it's--

00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:28.367
I don't think I was a lot of fun to live with
in the last couple of years.

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:30.700
And, it was challenging.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.100
And there were some days that
were really harder than other days.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.700
But it's work.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.000
It's like I would work
and it would spill over.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.767
But I can to some extent segregate that part
of my work life and my emotional life that way.

00:26:48.767 --> 00:26:50.333
I don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing.

00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:52.633
But otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.500
I certainly don't
want to do it again.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.667
I mean I certainly don't
want to revisit this period.

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:00.567
It was hard, it was really hard.

00:27:00.567 --> 00:27:03.233
So,

00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:09.300
whenever I've had to write really a violent
scene or a really painful scene of loss,

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.533
it lingers.

00:27:10.533 --> 00:27:13.667
And that week, especially the week of--

00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:16.633
and those, since those parts tend
to come later in a book,

00:27:16.633 --> 00:27:17.734
I think I'm ready,

00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:19.867
like there's been a
warm-up before that.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:20.900
So I'm ready for it,

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.400
and it takes less time to write later.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.166
The earlier parts of the book
take longer to write.

00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.767
They just get rewritten over
and over and over again.

00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:30.600
By the time I hit halfway through,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.266
I sort of know what I'm doing
and I'm writing faster.

00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:39.900
So it's, so I'm not quite living in it
quite as intensely.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.734
It's really interesting to have these Q &amp; A's

00:27:41.734 --> 00:27:44.967
because sometimes I don't know
that until I just said that out loud.

00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:46.066
[laughter]

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:49.333
Anita: I didn't realize that,
that that was my process.

00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:52.433
female: So how did you move
from non-fiction to fiction?

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:55.367
Anita: How did I move
from non-fiction to fiction?

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:56.333
I needed a challenge.

00:27:56.333 --> 00:27:57.533
I was kind of bored.

00:27:57.533 --> 00:28:00.600
And so I actually thought
about getting a real job,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.633
but I couldn't do it,
I had been self employed for too long.

00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:07.166
So, I actually did some interviewing
and thought no,

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:08.800
I can't work for anyone else.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.266
So I thought I would try writing a novel.

00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:14.800
And no one was waiting for it.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.867
I did not get a contract.

00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:19.066
It was my little hobby,

00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:20.200
but I also gave myself a deadline

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.533
'cause I didn't want to be one of those people
who's writing a novel for 15 years.

00:28:23.533 --> 00:28:28.266
So I-- that was 'The Book of Dena'
when I was working on it -

00:28:28.266 --> 00:28:29.934
it turned into 'The Red Tent'.

00:28:29.934 --> 00:28:34.867
And it was really hard. It was a challenge,
I'd never done it before.

00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:36.834
But I'm someone who's always read novels.

00:28:36.834 --> 00:28:40.000
I was an English major and a Comp Lit major.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.767
So reading novels is-- I can't remember
a time I didn't read them.

00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:47.166
So--

00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:50.033
and I had a very good friend who was
an editor who said, "Well it does translate,

00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:52.467
but the skills you have as
a non-fiction writer do,

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:55.266
many of them anyway,
do translate into writing fiction."

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:57.633
And I had written a lot of first person stuff.

00:28:57.633 --> 00:29:02.166
I had written columns for the Boston Globe
magazine and other national magazines, so.

00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:04.433
I was used to writing in a variety
of different styles

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:09.867
and that sort of straight
answer in fifteen questions.

00:29:09.867 --> 00:29:11.400
'Cause I was a feature writer,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.433
so I had to write humor as
well as really heavy stuff.

00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:16.934
So, I gave it a shot.

00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:19.667
And I tried to sell it and I tried
to get an agent interested in it.

00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:21.633
And nobody wanted to see it
until it was finished.

00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:25.867
And then I very luckily found somebody
who wanted to publish it.

00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:29.400
And that's how,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.000
it was sort of a transition.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.467
And it's not like I had this inspiration
and I had to do it.

00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:39.767
It was like I really needed to shake up
my writing career and my writing mind.

00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:41.900
So that's why I started.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.867
And if I hadn't been as successful
as I was with the first one,

00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:46.900
I don't know if I would have written
another one.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.433
I certainly wouldn't have had the option
to do pretty much what I wanted to do.

00:29:50.433 --> 00:29:53.734
I was really very lucky.

00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:56.800
female: What sources do you draw
from in creating

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.533
like the personalities of your characters?

00:29:58.533 --> 00:30:02.266
Do you think it's mostly from
the people you interview or do they--

00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:05.233
do your characters reflect people
you actually know or yourself?

00:30:05.233 --> 00:30:06.467
Or is it just like imagination?

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:08.800
Anita: Yes. All those things,
all those things.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.367
I think certainly with this book,

00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:14.633
these characters.

00:30:14.633 --> 00:30:17.834
There's a couple of minor characters.

00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:21.734
There's the cook who's actually
from Palestine.

00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:23.166
She's a local person.

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:27.533
She's based very much on reading
that I did about what people in Palestine

00:30:27.533 --> 00:30:30.266
and how they reacted to this flood
of immigrants

00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:33.667
with these horrible stories and tattoos
on their arms.

00:30:33.667 --> 00:30:36.433
And just how do you?

00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:40.100
And so her reluctance
to talk to them,

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.266
to engage with them was based
on things that I've learned.

00:30:43.266 --> 00:30:46.000
And then I sort of gave her
a personality around that.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.667
The other characters are based
on somewhat on people I know,

00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:51.934
somewhat on books that I read,

00:30:51.934 --> 00:30:53.934
somewhat on interviews.

00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:58.467
Not just the ones that I did personally,
but also pieces that, interviews that I read.

00:30:58.467 --> 00:31:03.767
So it's a real combination
of different things.

00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:07.500
So, it's all fodder.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.233
For me anyway, fiction and non-fiction,
it's all kind of fodder.

00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:16.400
male: So why this specific
point in history?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.000
Because there's a lot
of very interesting,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.900
very complicated,

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:27.133
very heavy stuff somewhere
between 45 and early 50's

00:31:27.133 --> 00:31:32.367
I would say in the history of Israel
as the land and as the state.

00:31:32.367 --> 00:31:37.433
And I've been on the Birthright tour
and they take you to various places

00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:41.667
that leave a big mark sort of in different ways.

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.433
So why that specific place?

00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:46.400
Why that specific story?

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.400
Anita: Well in large measures
because I didn't know and

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.467
I knew that nobody else knew it
certainly in my world.

00:31:54.467 --> 00:31:58.867
I think a lot of Israelis know it
because it's sort of part of the story of--

00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:02.100
the triumphal story of the army,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.033
the Palmach, the pre-army.

00:32:05.033 --> 00:32:06.300
The great success.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.367
Nobody was-- all the inmates got taken
out safely and they got away with it.

00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:14.467
There was only one casualty,

00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:16.233
it was considered a huge success.

00:32:16.233 --> 00:32:20.834
But my novels in particular always
try to tell the stories that are untold.

00:32:20.834 --> 00:32:25.166
So they tend to focus on women's stories
because they tend to be under told.

00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:28.600
Not so much in 'Dogtown' which
includes a bigger cast of characters.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.600
So looking at those pictures of the guys
mugging and smiling at the camera

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.767
and the women standing sort of like this
and looking not at the camera

00:32:36.767 --> 00:32:39.533
made me wonder what their experience
was like.

00:32:39.533 --> 00:32:40.233
So there was that.

00:32:40.233 --> 00:32:44.633
And also the fact that I liked the idea that I
could tell a story that nobody had heard before.

00:32:44.633 --> 00:32:46.467
There are zillions of great stories like that,

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:49.333
but this is the one that got thrown into my lap.

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:53.734
So it's really very much serendipity
why I write what I write.

00:32:53.734 --> 00:32:55.867
It's when I stumble across
a story that I think,

00:32:55.867 --> 00:32:58.133
"Oh, nobody knows this,

00:32:58.133 --> 00:33:00.500
I didn't know this and
because I didn't know it,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.367
it means I'm excited about doing
the research to find out more about it."

00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:09.000
So it's a very narrow view
of that year of that time.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.633
And since it's told mostly
through these characters,

00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:12.700
they can't know everything.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.967
They don't know all the
politics swirling around them.

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:20.200
They don't know about the whole
military complex building up to fight.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.633
And they barely are aware of the presence
of the Arab community around them as well.

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:27.133
So they're focused on surviving.

00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:28.934
And they're thrown into this place.

00:33:28.934 --> 00:33:30.133
And for me in a way,

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:36.700
the book is really about how do you live
through unspeakable horror and continue?

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.834
How do you embrace life?

00:33:37.834 --> 00:33:38.934
How do you keep going?

00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:42.166
How do you manage all of that?

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:45.700
So spending a few years thinking
about and writing is one thing,

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.433
but how do you live
through horrible losses?

00:33:48.433 --> 00:33:50.867
And it's not just limited to the holocaust.

00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:53.567
People whose families are wiped out in Haiti.

00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:55.567
How are those people going to move forward?

00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:58.834
Build families and communities, start over.

00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:00.433
How do you start over again?

00:34:00.433 --> 00:34:05.133
And that was for me the really
interesting question I wanted

00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:09.166
to explore it with these characters.

00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:16.100
female: Were there any points in the three
years that you were really stumped,

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.800
that you really struggled with
a piece of the story

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.233
and you didn't know which way
you wanted to take it?

00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:29.734
Anita: There were a lot of
days I didn't want to do it.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:33.100
So, but no I,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:39.200
since I had the arc of the story and this rescue
and that was going to happen in the book.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.266
And that's not giving anything away, really.

00:34:41.266 --> 00:34:44.000
The things that there are to be given away
are about what happens to the people

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.433
and what their back stories are.

00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:51.000
I had that trajectory to move forward.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.900
It was just the hard part was was really
thinking about what they'd been through.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.467
And figuring out how each character was
going to deal with that in her own way.

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:03.000
So that-- those were the sticking points.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.100
But unlike in some of the other stuff
I've written where I really didn't know

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.900
which way to
turn I did have a sort of line.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.967
I knew sort of when
it was gonna end.

00:35:12.967 --> 00:35:16.033
Although I had a different ending
and a different sort of post script in mind

00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:17.367
when I was working on it.

00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:18.967
Didn't work out though.

00:35:18.967 --> 00:35:20.900
But by then you trust it.

00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:25.333
female: You're obviously very organized
and goal oriented with deadlines

00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:30.000
and getting to that and obviously crunching
out 15 or more giant works.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
But I'm wondering were there any along the way
that fell to the wayside and you've given up on?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.033
Anita: No, no.

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:43.567
I have gotten a contract for every book
that I've ever written, except for 'The Red Tent'.

00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:47.567
So no.

00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:48.667
[laughter]

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:50.333
female: I have never ever failed.

00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:51.834
[laughter]

00:35:51.834 --> 00:35:55.467
Anita: No no I failed a lot, I failed a lot,
but the books,

00:35:55.467 --> 00:35:58.133
it's like it's the job right?

00:35:58.133 --> 00:36:01.233
And having written for newspapers
and magazines for a long time,

00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:04.133
if you don't turn in you piece,

00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:06.633
you don't get paid and you don't
get invited back to do it again.

00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:11.734
So I'm pretty careful about only
doing books that I know that I can write.

00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:15.800
That I have some faith that
I can finish in the allotted time.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.100
So, I wouldn't sign on to do something
that I was really, uh oh,

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.000
I don't know what I'm getting myself into.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.400
So by the time I've signed a contract,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.266
I really have some sense
of the beginning and the end.

00:36:31.266 --> 00:36:34.500
At least some of the characters
and what the point of,

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.900
why am I telling this story.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.533
So that's all in place.

00:36:38.533 --> 00:36:40.900
No, I fail all the time,
but not in this.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.867
female: And now since you mentioned
you have a little bit more creative freedom,

00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:46.633
you can just walk in and say,
"Here's the idea."

00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:50.567
Or is there more selling you have to do?

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:55.700
Anita: Well I have to, no I don't just walk in,
I have to write something

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.567
and my agent walks in and says.
'Do you want this?'.

00:37:01.567 --> 00:37:02.233
So, we'll see.

00:37:02.233 --> 00:37:06.066
So far I've been able to do
pretty much what I've wanted to do.

00:37:06.066 --> 00:37:09.567
Publishing is in a very
weird place right now.

00:37:09.567 --> 00:37:14.166
And don't know, how many books
do you buy in a year?

00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:17.433
Or how many books do
you download in a year?

00:37:17.433 --> 00:37:18.567
So we don't really,

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:20.767
it's all up in the air
what's gonna happen.

00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:23.500
I think with publishing with, publishing,

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:29.934
all print media is trying to
figure out what the next steps are.

00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:33.100
male: So would you be opposed to
your books being available in Kindle?

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.800
Anita: They're all in Kindle,
they're all in Kindle.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.934
I'm not opposed to them online.

00:37:35.934 --> 00:37:39.166
And I own one and I
read it on airplanes.

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:41.266
I don't like it enough to not,

00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:42.300
I love it on an airplane,

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.567
I really do.

00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:45.934
And I feel very cool because
people come over and ask you.

00:37:45.934 --> 00:37:50.266
But still it's getting
much more common.

00:37:50.266 --> 00:37:54.567
But the payout is really complicated
for writers and publishers,

00:37:54.567 --> 00:37:57.133
and if you spend three years on a book,

00:37:57.133 --> 00:38:02.433
and it's downloaded for $7.99
and you get some tiny fraction of that,

00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:07.100
it's the economics of
publishing are really what's,

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.834
the business model is really
what's up in the air.

00:38:08.834 --> 00:38:12.300
People are writing more than ever before,
but getting paid for your work,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.233
for creative work is kind of, nobody knows
how this is gonna shake down.

00:38:16.233 --> 00:38:22.200
And having been a newspaper writer for
a long time too, even more so in journalism.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.700
female: Do you ever get push backs
from your editors

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.600
who will read a couple of chapters and want
you to take something in a different direction?

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.300
And how do you deal with that?

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.100
Do you have to listen to them, or is it,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.133
or do you have enough
clout that you can say,

00:38:37.133 --> 00:38:38.967
'No, this is what I'm gonna do.' ?

00:38:38.967 --> 00:38:43.900
Anita: I generally, I have a good working
relationships with my editor.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.800
And editors,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.934
my editors pretty uniformly
including magazines and books,

00:38:49.934 --> 00:38:51.567
they want to make it a better book.

00:38:51.567 --> 00:38:54.900
It's not like that they want to
change it just for the purpose of,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.233
'I think I can tell the story
better than you can.'

00:38:57.233 --> 00:39:01.367
So when they suggest a change,
or ask a question about where,

00:39:01.367 --> 00:39:04.734
about what a character is saying
or where things are going

00:39:04.734 --> 00:39:08.700
or the way that time is put together
in the story telling.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.633
I take it seriously that they're really trying
to improve what I'm doing.

00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:14.867
So I see it as a collaboration.

00:39:14.867 --> 00:39:18.266
And there are times that I say,
'No this is really, this is the way I want to go.'

00:39:18.266 --> 00:39:19.467
But generally,

00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:21.900
especially if you get it
from more than one person,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.166
you gotta take it seriously.

00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:25.500
If nobody knows what
you're talking about here,

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.233
then it's time to take a look at it.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:32.300
And I sometimes when I see books
that are this thick,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.867
and I start reading them I think,

00:39:33.867 --> 00:39:35.734
boy this person really did not,

00:39:35.734 --> 00:39:40.600
nobody tried to edit or the writer didn't
want to hear about editing.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.834
So I think editing is good, I like editing.

00:39:43.834 --> 00:39:45.500
[Laughter]

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.000
It feels good.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.200
If it's a respectful relationship,
it's really terrific.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.233
female: Did you mention that you
have another book in the works?

00:39:54.233 --> 00:39:55.266
And can you share anything?

00:39:55.266 --> 00:39:59.633
Anita: I just, I mean like yesterday
sent the proposal to my agent

00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:01.500
to have it given to the publisher.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:08.033
It's set on American soil
and it would probably be a,

00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:10.667
I'm not gonna tell you,
it's not ready yet. [laughter]

00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:14.734
Anita: Soon, so I hafta,
I'm waiting to hear from them.

00:40:14.734 --> 00:40:19.800
But it's not,
it's an American story.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.834
female: So you mentioned that
this book was translated in Hebrew.

00:40:21.834 --> 00:40:24.367
And I'm assuming other books
of your have been translated.

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:25.433
I've always been really curious,

00:40:25.433 --> 00:40:28.367
what is the process like to have your work
translated into another language?

00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:31.500
Especially if you don't speak it
to like maintain the integrity of the book?

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.000
Anita: You know, it's out of my hand.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.600
What happens is that publishers,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.400
publishers from other countries
can buy the rights to translate and sell.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.700
And they buy them through--
I mean I will get an e-mail that says,

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.033
"The Croations want to
translate this into Croat.

00:40:48.033 --> 00:40:49.867
Is that okay, and they're gonna give
you a thousand dollars."

00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:52.734
And it's really,
that's about what it is.

00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:54.166
What am I gonna-- great,

00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:58.667
I mean you just keep your fingers crossed
and hope that it's a decent translation.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:02.233
I actually met the Israeli
woman who translates.

00:41:02.233 --> 00:41:04.934
She's translated all four
of my novels now.

00:41:04.934 --> 00:41:06.633
And she's really lovely,

00:41:06.633 --> 00:41:10.734
and people tell me
she's a good translator, but...

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:14.600
female: So you don't really have that, they don't
e-mail you and they're like, "Hey is this?"

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.533
Anita: No I do get questions.

00:41:15.533 --> 00:41:17.934
So like really interesting,
she e-mailed me.

00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:19.467
If they don't know
what something is.

00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:22.867
She didn't know what a 'GI' was.
And I thought wow I thought,

00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:25.567
"God, I thought the whole world knew
what GI's were."

00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:30.333
General enlisted,
General Infantry during the way.

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:33.166
But that was not a term
she was familiar with.

00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:36.433
Soldiers, she knew soldiers.

00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:37.567
So in all of them,

00:41:37.567 --> 00:41:39.800
it's really fun to get
questions like that.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.834
What is really not is really idiosyncratic
to American English in particular.

00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:50.367
I don't even know that a British person
would know that right now.

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:52.834
In the 40's everybody
must have known what a GI was,

00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:57.433
'cause it was in newspapers everywhere.

00:41:57.433 --> 00:41:59.867
female: I'm wondering if you draw
on your own experiences

00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:03.200
to develop the emotional content
of your characters.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.166
And in particular as a mother
and a daughter,

00:42:07.166 --> 00:42:12.367
how you address the kind of orphaned
nature of these four characters?

00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:18.767
Anita: Oh sure, I mean my emotional
life is in here.

00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:23.767
And I think the emotional life
of all my friends and relatives as well.

00:42:23.767 --> 00:42:25.333
When I was writing a column
for the Boston Globe,

00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:27.600
it was like all my friends
were like on alert.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.934
You know, "Are you gonna use this?"

00:42:29.934 --> 00:42:31.100
But I use everything.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:39.233
So, so certainly I think all writers are mining
their own emotional lives and histories

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.100
for what they write.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.800
And they can pretend that they
aren't but that's not true. [laughter]

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.767
There's no way around it.
Yes?

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:48.166
female: I am an avid reader,
not a writer,

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:53.300
and I never want the books to end
if it's a good story, if it's a good character.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.467
How do you know where to end?

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.133
Anita: You know,

00:43:01.133 --> 00:43:04.800
it's really clear when it's an end
for me 'cause I'm really looking for,

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.433
I really believe in that kind of,

00:43:07.433 --> 00:43:08.533
I don't know the musical term,

00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:12.000
but there's sort of a resolution
at the end of a symphony.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.567
It's like TAH DAH.

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:16.633
And Beethoven writes 20 of them
at the end of one of those.

00:43:16.633 --> 00:43:18.467
But there's a resolution,

00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:22.500
there's almost a musical resolution
that the hand comes off the piano keys

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.467
and it's, that's the last note.

00:43:25.467 --> 00:43:26.767
A lot of people with this book have said,

00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:29.333
'It's too short and I want more
and I want the sequel.'

00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:30.033
And that's good,

00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:35.100
I mean leaving them wanting
more is always a good thing.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.567
Beginning and endings are really hard.

00:43:36.567 --> 00:43:39.433
Beginnings are really super hard
and endings are very hard too

00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:42.600
but by then at least I sort of know
what the melody is

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.600
so I know where and how I want
to do the resolution.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.533
Books that end badly are really frustrating.

00:43:48.533 --> 00:43:52.033
I mean as a reader to it's like,
what happened.

00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:54.367
I want things,

00:43:54.367 --> 00:43:57.467
not everything has to be
tied up in neat little knots.

00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:59.600
You don't have to know
what happens to everybody.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.767
But there has to be some resolution,

00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:04.567
and for me there has to be
some kind of redemption.

00:44:04.567 --> 00:44:05.767
Certainly in what I write.

00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:11.767
And I prefer books that have some kind
of modulated minor key major resolution.

00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:13.200
It can't be like ugh,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.166
I don't like books
that leave me completely flat,

00:44:15.166 --> 00:44:17.033
novels anyway that leave me completely flat,

00:44:17.033 --> 00:44:19.300
so I don't write novels that way.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.066
I don't think, I mean this is not a happy book,

00:44:21.066 --> 00:44:28.033
but not everybody is [ inaudible] at the end,
life goes on.

00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:30.066
female: Who are some of
your favorite authors?

00:44:30.066 --> 00:44:34.000
Anita: My favorite authors.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.667
I love MFK Fisher who you
probably have never heard of.

00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:39.100
She was a food writer for the New Yorker

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:43.600
and she wrote beautiful funny smart prose.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.000
And I reread her books all the time.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.300
And I'm a big poetry fan.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:59.467
I read Naruta and Mary Oliver
and Billy Collins and Walt Whitman.

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:02.166
Fiction, I read sort of
what my friends tell me to read,

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.700
like everybody else I think.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.400
So I think the last novel I read was The Help

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.400
which was at the top of the best seller list,
which I enjoyed very much.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.033
One of the books that really changed
my life was 100 years of solitude

00:45:14.033 --> 00:45:18.300
by Gabriel García Márquez
which I read when I was in High-School.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.867
I've read it many times since then.

00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:24.934
Just, it was really new at the time,
and it continues to be new.

00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:26.400
So if you haven't read that one,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.533
the other ones are--
that one's just beautiful.

00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:31.333
It's the first one,
I think it was his first novel,

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:33.066
I think he'd written shorter pieces, no?

00:45:33.066 --> 00:45:34.500
male: No I think he had a couple.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.100
Anita: Before, that was his big success?

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.633
male: That was his first big success,

00:45:37.633 --> 00:45:41.367
the earlier stuff is very hard to read.
[laughter]

00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:42.333
Anita: So I'm glad
I didn't read it.

00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:45.200
'Cause that was-- I remember it
was a big success in the states to,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:45.900
so I read that.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.033
So I would recommend
that to anybody.

00:45:51.033 --> 00:45:51.400
So yeah,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.767
sort of like what people hand me
is what I read.

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:56.333
People that I trust is what I read.

00:45:56.333 --> 00:45:58.633
Sometimes they're wrong,
and I don't like it.

00:45:58.633 --> 00:46:00.433
But often they're right.

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:04.100
And I like reading what other people
are reading in a given moment.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.800
I read my first Trollope
actually a couple of months ago.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.533
I'd never read Trollope,
it was one of the early novelists.

00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:15.300
It was fun, it was hard,

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.767
you had to slow down to read
that sort of thing.

00:46:19.767 --> 00:46:21.333
I'm always trying new stuff.

00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:24.233
I like to read internationally too.

00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:26.667
male: Have you read Marquez's latest piece?

00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:28.934
Anita: I don't, which is the latest one?

00:46:28.934 --> 00:46:31.600
male: 'Memory of My Melancholy Whores"
I believe it was called.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.600
Anita: Is that the autobiography?

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.667
&gt;&gt; No, not quite.

00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:38.934
Anita: No, I couldn't get through
the autobiography, I really couldn't.

00:46:38.934 --> 00:46:40.100
So no I didn't read that,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.100
I sort of stopped, I have to say.

00:46:44.066 --> 00:46:46.800
I read a lot for a long time,
but then I stopped.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.533
So what are you reading?
[laughter]

00:46:50.533 --> 00:46:52.567
female: Really?
Anita: Yeah.

00:46:52.567 --> 00:46:54.200
female: Well I'm reading your book.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.433
Anita: Yes yes, that's the right answer.
[laughter]

00:46:57.433 --> 00:46:59.500
female: My book club recommended this.
Anita: Oh, you're in a club?

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.266
female: Yeah, which is good.
Recommend book clubs,

00:47:03.266 --> 00:47:08.767
forces you to read
and creates deadlines.

00:47:08.767 --> 00:47:11.900
female: Have any of your works been considered
to be translated into movies,

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.734
and is that something that you would consider?

00:47:13.734 --> 00:47:16.867
I love 'The Red Tent',
like that could be a good movie.

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.333
Anita: It's been really interesting.

00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:20.734
The book was optioned for a few
years when it first came out.

00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:23.767
It takes such a big stack
of money to make a movie.

00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:25.300
You can't begin to imagine.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:32.533
It means a lot of backing and it means
a big star and it means, you know

00:47:32.533 --> 00:47:34.834
on and on and on.

00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:37.233
So, I'm not constitutionally opposed
to the idea of it,

00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:42.133
but I dare you to think up a biblical movie
that is worth sitting through.

00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:43.300
[laughter]

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.033
They're pretty bad.

00:47:44.033 --> 00:47:47.967
I think actually
they're really bad.

00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:49.066
Can you think of them?

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.433
female: No.

00:47:50.433 --> 00:47:53.900
Anita: I mean, 'The Ten Commandments'
comes right to mind, right.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.066
Have you seen that lately?
[laughter]

00:47:57.066 --> 00:48:04.166
Right, at least twice a year or something.
People get so -

00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:06.400
I would love if someone took
'The Red Tent' and sort of deconstructed it

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.233
and made it into something filmic.

00:48:08.233 --> 00:48:10.200
And I know it's sort of cinematic,

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.767
but people get too pious about the bible
and they just worry too much.

00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:16.200
And I think that's a problem.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.367
And I really did not,

00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:24.700
I didn't novelize the bible like
Thomas Mann did in the Joseph novels.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.934
He wrote like this
whole series of novels.

00:48:27.934 --> 00:48:30.800
So it's not faithful to the text
in a certain kind of way.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.600
I fear that if somebody took 'The Red Tent'
and tried to make a movie out of it,

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.100
they would be faithful and that
would be the kiss of death.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.400
It would be great if somebody
like Spike Jonez wanted to do it.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:48.266
Somebody really wanted to take it
and make it their own vision.

00:48:48.266 --> 00:48:51.233
It's also that there aren't enough
explosions in it to really make it a

00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:54.266
To get the funding. [laughter]

00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:55.767
Anita: So not yet.

00:48:55.767 --> 00:48:58.233
I think this book is very cinematic actually.

00:48:58.233 --> 00:49:02.934
It's got lots of nubile young women in it.

00:49:02.934 --> 00:49:05.033
It's also got a military rescue.

00:49:05.033 --> 00:49:10.533
But, we'll see if that happens.

00:49:10.533 --> 00:49:16.667
female: [Inaudible] So I was told a long time ago
that if you're reading a new book,

00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:18.333
read the last sentence

00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:18.900
Anita: Ouch.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.934
female: And that's no, just the sentence
and that's like a good indication

00:49:22.934 --> 00:49:25.133
of if you're probably gonna
like the book or not.

00:49:25.133 --> 00:49:25.900
Anita: Did you?

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:32.633
female: I did, the last sentence.
[laughter]

00:49:32.633 --> 00:49:35.567
Anita: It's the first thing I always check.

00:49:35.567 --> 00:49:39.600
female: But I was wondering if you have
any tidbits of advice like that.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.400
Anita: No, I will give any book
about 50 pages,

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.633
but if I'm not in love with at least
somebody in those 50 pages,

00:49:47.633 --> 00:49:48.900
I'll stop.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.600
At some point in the last 10 years,
I just-- life is too short,

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.033
I'm not reading it if it
doesn't really grab me.

00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:58.233
And that's including
some of the greats,

00:49:58.233 --> 00:49:59.800
contemporary great writers.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.900
It's just like I don't
like this writing,

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.133
I don't like the style of it,

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:07.767
and people who are very hot
aren't necessarily people who...

00:50:07.767 --> 00:50:08.400
But that's okay.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.734
I mean there should be lots of flavors
and lots of different styles.

00:50:11.734 --> 00:50:14.667
But I stop after awhile.

00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:16.033
male: What about non-fiction?

00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:17.867
Anita: I like them, I read them.

00:50:17.867 --> 00:50:21.100
male: But they're not necessarily
characters that you can like or not.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.033
Anita: Oh, no, well if it's well written
and it's compelling,

00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:26.467
I really enjoy non-fiction.

00:50:26.467 --> 00:50:30.433
I'm reading a fair amount of history
again in preparation for this book

00:50:30.433 --> 00:50:31.533
that I'm hoping to write.

00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:34.633
And I enjoy that too.

00:50:34.633 --> 00:50:41.834
So, last summer I loved the Julia Child
biography by her nephew.

00:50:41.834 --> 00:50:43.333
If you saw 'Julie and Julia',
you should really read the book,

00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:44.967
it's really fun.

00:50:44.967 --> 00:50:46.533
Really nice writing, really non-fiction.

00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:48.467
And I got to meet Julia Child
and talk to her,

00:50:48.467 --> 00:50:52.800
so I could hear her voice when
she lived here many years ago.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.200
So that was fun.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.300
It was my last really fun non-fiction book.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:04.900
The rest has been history,
but interesting.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.600
So that's what I'm reading.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.300
I'm up to here with
American history right now,

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:14.000
so that's why it's hard for me to reach out
for the novels that don't [inaudible].

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.767
male: You went in one of these camps,
and so what happens to you internally.

00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:20.266
It seems like there were people
popping up on the shore all the time.

00:51:20.266 --> 00:51:21.667
200 people in this camp.

00:51:21.667 --> 00:51:26.700
It's going to be way too full,
in a day, a week, a month,

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.834
so they gotta do something.

00:51:28.834 --> 00:51:32.567
They can't take them out,
the boat's gone.

00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:33.600
Anita: Well what happens.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.233
male: They essentially let them go.
Anita: They let them go.

00:51:35.233 --> 00:51:36.200
male: They all tell the same story basically.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.967
Anita: They do let them go,
for the most part in Atlit.

00:51:37.967 --> 00:51:40.633
But what happened is
so many people started coming,

00:51:40.633 --> 00:51:43.266
they built an enormous camp in Cyprus.

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:47.767
So that's if you saw the movie 'Exodus',
or read that book.

00:51:47.767 --> 00:51:51.333
That's not a great book by the way,
a terrible book. [laughter]

00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:56.133
Anita: It's a better movie than a book.
They took the dramatic part of it.

00:51:56.133 --> 00:52:00.200
They built this enormous
internment camp in Cyprus.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.266
And people were there for years.

00:52:02.266 --> 00:52:07.500
And it was hot and miserable, and also,
for all of that there were millions,

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.533
there were many many marriages,
there were many children born.

00:52:11.533 --> 00:52:13.700
People taught school to the children,

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.100
they taught music to the children.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:20.667
So, they made life happen
in this incredibly hot miserable place.

00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:23.500
So that's what happened to a lot of them.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.934
I mean it was at relatively
[Inaudible] this whole coast line.

00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:27.800
So a lot of people did get in and...

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.800
male: Yeah, like maybe catch one
in three or something.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.600
Anita: Right, so the people
who were in camp.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.667
And at least some of them
actually wound up having family,

00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.333
so they got released to family.

00:52:36.333 --> 00:52:38.734
If they were sick,
they got sent to hospitals.

00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:42.433
Children in particular if they were orphans
would get sent to orphanages.

00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:46.500
So the British were a real mixed bag
as occupiers.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.066
They were both compassionate and jerks.

00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:51.967
I mean, and it depended on the individual
as much as anything else.

00:52:51.967 --> 00:52:56.033
But, they were-- I remember Barak
who gave this tour talking and saying,

00:52:56.033 --> 00:52:59.800
"You gotta have, if your prison camp is gonna
be run by anybody, you want the British,

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.800
because they believe in rules."

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.967
male: So did the Germans?
Anita: Huh?

00:53:03.967 --> 00:53:05.000
male: So did the Germans.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.100
Anita: Well, in a different--

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.033
but they also believed
in the Geneva conventions

00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:10.734
and that these were not prisoners,
these were in fact internees.

00:53:10.734 --> 00:53:12.333
And they knew that they were.

00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:16.300
And they were-- and there was a lot of guilt
among some of the British as well.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.433
They were not all happy
about being put in this position.

00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:23.734
There were anti-Semites who were very happy
about being put in this position.

00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:30.367
So they were, they were just human beings
in ultimately an impossible situation.

00:53:30.367 --> 00:53:32.934
As it still is to this very day.

00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:35.467
male: So this seems like actually
the British had a fig leaf

00:53:35.467 --> 00:53:38.900
and they made some treaty or something
and promised that they would stop immigration.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.967
Anita: Right.
male: Clearly they can't.

00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:40.600
Anita: They can't exactly.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.700
male: And clearly they can't shoot them
at the water's edge,

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.000
or they're not prepared to.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.700
Anita: They're not prepared to.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.633
And at the same time they had to
keep the Arab population at the same saying,

00:53:48.633 --> 00:53:51.166
"We are, we are enforcing these quotas."

00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:54.333
male: They're making some show
of doing their best.

00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:57.400
Anita: Right.
And they did their...

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.266
And then they opened Cyprus
which really was this big holding camp

00:54:01.266 --> 00:54:03.000
which became an international embarrassment.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.533
Because people got sick there
and people would die there, it was.

00:54:08.533 --> 00:54:10.133
male: So many people in squalor.

00:54:10.133 --> 00:54:11.266
Anita: Yes, too many people.

00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:12.367
male: And you can't park them there forever.

00:54:12.367 --> 00:54:14.133
Anita: Right, exactly. But they were there--
it felt like forever.

00:54:14.133 --> 00:54:15.633
They were there for years.

00:54:15.633 --> 00:54:18.233
In Atlit, people were there
for weeks or months.

00:54:18.233 --> 00:54:20.567
In Cyprus they were stuck for a long time.

00:54:20.567 --> 00:54:23.867
And it was an island,
it was hard to escape.

00:54:23.867 --> 00:54:25.300
male: Whenever I think about it,

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.734
it just reminds me of
our own southern border.

00:54:27.734 --> 00:54:30.967
There are people trying sneak
across in the dark of night.

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.266
Hope of a better life.

00:54:32.266 --> 00:54:34.433
A community up here
if they can make it,

00:54:34.433 --> 00:54:36.266
that they can thread right into.

00:54:36.266 --> 00:54:38.400
And I mean some fraction they catch.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.367
Of course we're not shooting them
at the water's edge either.

00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:43.233
Anita: We're not shooting them.

00:54:43.233 --> 00:54:47.333
male: But neither do we make it pleasant
enough that they are excited about.

00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:52.367
I suspect actually that 9 out of
10 make it clean and clear over time.

00:54:52.367 --> 00:54:55.633
Anita: Probably. Fewer now
because the economy is so bad.

00:54:55.633 --> 00:54:58.567
But yeah, I think this is sort of
an international classic story

00:54:58.567 --> 00:55:04.467
about trying to get into a place that you're
sort of not legally supposed to be part of.

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:07.767
And the world is more porous
than it's ever been before.

00:55:07.767 --> 00:55:10.166
Or at borders anyway.

00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:13.400
No matter what we try.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.800
female: We're just about out of time.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.967
Thank you so much for coming,
this is wonderful.

00:55:16.967 --> 00:55:17.767
Anita: Thank You.

00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:22.033
[applause]
