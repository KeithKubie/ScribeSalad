00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.269
Hello.
Welcome to our stage.

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:04.604
Just want to show you
Bingo there.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.706
Our Art Department recreated
these real apartments

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.107 line:92%
that we shot in initially.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.510
Check this freaking
apartment wall out.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.145
You know in Seinfeld
they were like,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.180 line:92%
"Look at our clean apartments."

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.516
Or whatever.
It's like nothing like New York.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.652
This is like New Yorkers
made this apartment.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.755
When we shot on location
they found these two doors

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.524
next to each other
and one was normal.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.125
And one was like
a sticker collage.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.529
That would be Ilana's.
And then when that dirty asshole

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.766
got elected it became
all activist stickers.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.736
Which is sad,
but funny and informative.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.404 line:92%
It's Angelique Clark everybody.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.638 line:92%
Hello.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.076 line:68%
Yes. I love these wig heads.
They're so funny, Ilana's wigs.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.711
Cracks me up because this like
reminds me when I was twelve.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.814
You better believe
I have a metal weed box.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.682 line:92%
So some cool PA found these.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.584
These are made out
of old plastic bags.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.653 line:92%
And also our PA made these,

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.488
these plant holders
out of like plastic bags.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.756 line:92%
Just like Thank You bags, right?

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.124 line:92%
Yeah.

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.159
It's fun when we have
real pictures.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.796
We took this at like the season
one wrap party I think.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.634
Arturo Castro and Abbi,
who plays Abbi and me.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.172
And that's real.
Oh my god, maybe I'll take this.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.273 line:92%
Yeah. You should take it.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.875
Today's
our last day on set.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.144
And it's going to truly
go away forever.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.280 line:92%
It cracks me up.

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:26.452
I've never seen on TV
a more disgusting bathroom.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.621 line:92%
I mean absolutely grotesque.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:29.822 line:92%
Yeah, it's pretty gross.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.259
It's pretty fucking gross.
Okay. So let's show you my room.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.496
It's funny, it's like
forced processing.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.365
I'll just take
this off a second.

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.634
I still need to get
the pictures after.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.804
In the web series,
Abbi made this cardboard trumpet

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.773
for some weird thing
we did out of tampon boxes

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:49.542
and then it was recreated
for the show.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:52.612
These I had hanging in my room.
These boobs ...

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.682
oh it was from a fucking
sketch show I did at UCB.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:00.520
To mature the tits on the wall,
we framed them.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:05.725
This is Ilana's work station.
She is a professional now.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.194
Since you're like
an eco warrior,

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.630
these are all made
from milk cartons,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.434
you know,
recycled water bottles

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.436
and of course you have
your condoms

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.273
and your tampons
and your vampire teeth.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.474 line:92%
The credit goes to us

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.777
but it's John Cox and Angelique
Clark and Jess Petriselli

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.245 line:92%
but it's also like literally

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.447
like a dozen queer
young people of color

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.483
who are really
the new Broad City

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.585
who are actually
executing this shit.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.755
The fucking clothes
organization cracks me up.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.756 line:92%
It's like so organized

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.592
and this is my real life
of like being visual.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.430
This is weird because this like
used to be my sweater

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.232 line:92%
but it's like....

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.568
I felt like I had to give it
to you for your room.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.670 line:92%
It's so funny. It's so funny.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.207
The show ending is like,
it's ending for all of us.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.408 line:92%
It's not just me and Abbi.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.910
We've been doing the project
since 2009.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:00.479
It's good to keep
moving forward.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.782
With every ending
there's a new beginning.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.584 line:92%
I can't get enough of that.

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.754 line:92%
Well, damn.
