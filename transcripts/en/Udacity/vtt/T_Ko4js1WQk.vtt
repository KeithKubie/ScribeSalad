00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To answer this, let me make the scatter plot.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here is my x-axis, which measures size.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here is my y-axis, that depicts price.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If I graph the different sizes, I get those 6 data points over here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I graph the different prices, I get the lines over here.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Sure enough, connecting those things get's me a data set that happens to be exactly linear.
