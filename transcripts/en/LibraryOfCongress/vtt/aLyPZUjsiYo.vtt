00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.690
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.730
&gt;&gt; I'm Karen Jaffe.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm head of the Young
Readers Center.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.360
And how many here are
from JO Wilson Elementary?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.900
All right, fifth grade, right?

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.200
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; Have any of you been to the
Library of Congress before?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.150
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.730
&gt;&gt; Great! We're very
glad to have you today.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.950
So you're in for several treats.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.910
The first is, you're at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590
The second is that you're in the
Young Readers Center at the Library

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.580
of Congress, which is a
special library just for kids

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.240
up to about 16 years old.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.150
We were started about seven
years ago because it was--

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.590
lots of people felt that
it wasn't fair that kids

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.760
under 16 couldn't come and
read a book at the library.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.690
Because to get a book, you have

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
to have a reader's card,
and you have to be 16.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.770
So we have three rooms, we have
lots of books, we have games,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.640 position:56%
we have special programs like today,
we're open Monday through Friday,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.920
9:00 to 4:30 and some
special holidays.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.730
So we hope you'll come
again, maybe with school,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.870
maybe with your families, okay?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.760
Today is part of a special
celebration at the Library

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.520
of Congress in honor
of Alice in Wonderland.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000
Who's heard of Alice in Wonderland?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.530 position:56%
Okay. Alice in Wonderland, the book,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.700
is celebrating the
150th anniversary.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.750
Now, believe it or not, the Library
of Congress is older than that.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.740
The institution is 215.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.500
So we're a little bit
older than Alice.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.200
But that's okay.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.950
So we've been celebrating Alice
in Wonderland the month of April.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.950
And with us today is a very special
organization called The Lewis

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800
Carroll Society.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.930
And some of the people
are sitting behind you.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.760
And two of the people are
sitting up here that I'm going

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.370
to introduce in a minute.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.430
And we're going to
have a special read

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.300
from a very popular
chapter in the book.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.700 position:56%
But also at the end, if you have
some questions, you might ask about,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.920
ask our readers, what is
The Lewis Carroll Society?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.520
I think I'll ask them to do that at
the end and not at the beginning.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.720
And what is a book collector?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.220
Because some of The Lewis Carroll
Society members, many of them,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.560 position:56%
I think, collect books and collect
things related to Lewis and Carroll.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.050
And that's a very interesting
either vocation or avocation.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.430
It could be a career,
it could be a hobby.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.410
And one of the things we do with
our Everybody Wins D.C. programs,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.430
which is our other partner
here today, who organized you,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.300
is we try to introduce
students to different careers,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.370
different things they can think
about doing when they grow up.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.210
So today, we're combining a book
and a very special celebration,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.760
and we're also talking about
the career and the avocation

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.010
of being bill collectors, okay?

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.000
So the two readers
for you today are Ken

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.970
and Ellie Salins, and
they are members.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.530
They're also related.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.950
And they're members of
The Lewis Carroll Society.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.720
And they are going
to start the read.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.030
And one more important thing.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.240
At the end of this program,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.440
The Lewis Carroll Society has
purchased a copy of the book,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.690
a special copy of the
book, for each of you.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.410
And the reason it's special
is because there are many,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.700
many versions of Alice
in Wonderland,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.340
and you've probably seen a movie or
television or other kinds of books

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.030
that some of them look
different from others.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.520
But the one they're giving you
has the original illustrations

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.450
by John Tenniel.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.130
So that's very special, as well.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.620
So now I'm going to
introduce the Salins.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.110
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Thank you.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.410
Hi, everybody.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.710
Thank you for coming.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.330
I wanted to first explain that
this is the Maxine Shaffer memorial

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.620
reading, and The Lewis Carroll
Society has this memorial reading

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.080
every time we have a meeting.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.740
So we have meetings twice a year.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.260
Usually once a year
to New York City,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.540
and then the other time it's
anywhere else in the country.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.680
Or it could be out in the country.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.200 position:56%
We've had readings in Canada before.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.490
So this time, it's in
Washington, D.C. in Maryland.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.790
And this is the Maxine
Shaffer memorial reading.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.030 position:56%
And Maxine Shaffer was the secretary
of The Lewis Carroll Society

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.150
from when it started in 1974.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.920
Thank you, 1974.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.850
Until about 1994 when
she decided to retire.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.580
And then she died shortly
after that in 1996.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.600
But she really ran the society.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.320
She did a whole lot to
get the society started.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.040
And we have these readings
in her memory.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.810
And she was my mother.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.760
My father is in the back there.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.850
Wave. And so we're here in
honor of her, but also in honor

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.830
of Alice and Lewis Carroll.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.990
So what we're going to do--
and this is my husband, Ken,

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.010
so it's all in the family.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.750
We're going to do a reading from
the Mad Hatter's tea party chapter.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.840
Do you all know that
chapter of the book?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.140
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.440
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: No?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.740
You will learn it soon.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.050
But we're going to-- there's about
a couple different characters,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.580
and there's only two of us.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.590
So I'm going to be a narrator.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.320
And I'm also Alice,
and I'm the Dormouse.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.640
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And
I'll be a narrator

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.160
and the Mad Hatter
and the March Hare.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.500
It might get a little confusing.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.930
We'll try to do maybe a
little different voice.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: We'll make it work.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.810
Okay, and here we go.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.360
Thank you for being here.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.800
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: There was a table
set out under a tree in front

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.910 position:56%
of the house, and the March Hare and
the Hatter were having tea at it.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.500
A Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.230 position:56%
and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.850
and talking over its head.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.190
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Very uncomfortable
for the Dormouse, only,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.380
as it's asleep, I suppose
it doesn't mind.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.680
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: No room!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.980
No room!

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.280
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: They cried out.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.580
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: When
they saw Alice coming.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.890
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: There's
plenty of room!

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.190
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Have some wine.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.490
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I
don't see any wine.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.790
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: There isn't any.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.730
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Then it wasn't
very civil of you to offer it.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.250
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: It wasn't
very civil of you to sit

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.550
down without being invited.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.120
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I didn't
know it was your table.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.490
It's laid for a great
many more than three.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.520
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Your
hair wants cutting.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.790
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Said the Hatter.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.540
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: He's been
looking at Alice for some time

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.120
with great curiosity, and
this was his first speech.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.220
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: You should learn
not to make personal remarks.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.250
It's very rude.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.960
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.200
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Come, we
shall have some fun now!

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.300
I'm glad they've begun
asking riddles.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.970
I believe I can guess that.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Do you mean that you
think you can find the answer to it?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.530
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Exactly so.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.770
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Then you
should say what you mean.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.070
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I do.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.530
At least I mean what I say.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.430
That's the same thing, you know.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.820
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Not
the same thing a bit.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.090
You might just as well say

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.990
that I see what I eat is the
same thing as I eat what I see.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.580
You might just as well say that I

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.180
like what I get is the same
thing as I get what I like.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.420
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: You
might as well say--

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.720
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Added the Dormouse,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.230
who seemed to be talking
in his sleep.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:39.590
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: That I breathe
when I sleep is the same thing

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.490
as I sleep when I breathe.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.350
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: It is
the same thing with you.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.410
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Here,
the conversation dropped,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.240
and the party sat silent for
a minute, while Alice thought

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.610
over all she could
remember about ravens

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.780
and writing desks,
which wasn't much.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.080
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: What
day of the month is it?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.710
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: The Hatter had
done his watch out of his pocket.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.100
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And was looking at
it uneasily, shaking it every now

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.550 position:56%
and then, and holding it to his ear.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.170
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: The fourth.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.750
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Two days wrong.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.850
I told you butter wouldn't
suit the works.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.570
It was the best butter, yes,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.890
but some crumbs must
have gotten in as well.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.500
You shouldn't have put it
in with the bread knife.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: The March Hare took
the watch and looked at it gloomily.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.270
Then he dipped it into his cup
of tea and looked at it again.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.600 position:56%
But he could think of nothing
better to say than his first remark.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.650
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: It was the
best butter, you know?

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: What a funny watch.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.060
It tells the days of the month, and
it doesn't tell what o'clock it is.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.360
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Why should it?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.770
Does your watch tell
you what year it is?

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.070
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Of course not.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.350
But that's because it stays here
for such a long time together.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.980
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Which is
just the case with mine.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.680
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I
don't quite understand.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.460
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: The
Dormouse is sleeping again.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.760
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Said the Hatter.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.510
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And he poured a
little hot tea upon its nose.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.120
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Of
course, of course,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.050
just what I was going
to remark myself.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.040
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Have you
guessed the riddle yet?

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.340
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: No, I give up.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.640
What's the answer?

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.930
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: I haven't
the slightest idea.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.230
Nor I.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.610
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I think you might
do something better with the time

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.830
than waste it looking for
riddles that have no answer.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.070
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: If you
knew time as well as I do,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.100
you wouldn't talk about wasting it.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.400
It's him.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.780
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I don't
know what you mean.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.080
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Of course you don't.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.240
I dare say you never
even spoke to time.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.870
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Perhaps
not, but I know I have

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.710
to beat time when I learn music.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.210
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Ah,
that accounts for it!

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.920
He won't stand beating.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.410
Now, if you only kept
on good terms with him,

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.510
he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.380
For instance, suppose it
were 9:00 in the morning,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.520
just time to begin lessons.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.070
You only have to whisper a hint
to time, and around goes the clock

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.840
in a twinkling, half waste
one, time for dinner.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.400
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: That
would be grand, certainly.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.610
But then I shouldn't be
hungry for it, you know?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.960
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Not
at first, perhaps.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.120
But you could keep it to half
past one, as long as you'd like.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.370
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Is
that the way you manage?

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.670
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Not I.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.420
We quarreled last March just
before he went mad, you know?

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.560
And it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.720
and I had to sing twinkle
twinkle little bat,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.530
how I wonder what you're at.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.790
You know the song perhaps.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.190
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I've
heard something like it.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.580
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: It goes,
when you know, in this way,

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.720
up above the world you fly
like a tea tray in the sky.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.770
Twinkle twinkle.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.770
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Here,
the Dormouse shook itself

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.180
and began singing in its sleep.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:04.020
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.720
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And went on so long.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.080
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: That they had
to pinch it to make it stop.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.780
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Well, I had hardly
finished off the first verse

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.710
when the queen jumped up and bawled
out, "he's murdering the time!

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.260
Off with his head!"

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.560
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: How
dreadfully savage.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.940
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And ever since
that, he won't do a thing I ask.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.410
It's always 6:00 there.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.710
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Is that
the reason that there's

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.860 position:56%
so many tea things are put out here?

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.160
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Yes, that's it.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.490 position:56%
It's always tea time, and we have no
time to watch things between whiles.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.880
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Then you
keep moving around, I suppose.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.580
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Exactly so.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.460
As the things used up.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.160
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: But what
happens when you come

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.670
around to the beginning again?

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.990
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Suppose
we change the subject.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.700
I'm getting tired of this.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.940
I vote the young lady
tells us a story.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.280
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I'm
afraid I don't know one.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.910
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Then
the Dormouse shall.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.650
Wake up, Dormouse.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.630
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And
they pinched it.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.300
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: On both
sides at once.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.600
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I wasn't asleep.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.590
I heard every word,
every word you believe,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.570
every word you believe,
you were saying.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.870
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: You are sleeping.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.300
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I am sleeping.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.600
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Tell us a story.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.900
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Yes, please do.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.310
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And
be quick about it,

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.970
or you'll be asleep
again before it's done.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.780
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Oh,
once upon a time,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.530
there were three little sisters,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.890
and their names were
Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.510
And they lived at the
bottom of a well.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.520
What did they live on?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.390
They lived on treacle.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.870
They couldn't have
lived on that, you know?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.440
They'd have been ill.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.700
They were very ill.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.160
But why did they live
at the bottom of a well?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.630
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Take some more tea.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.200
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I've had
nothing yet, so I can't have more.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.990
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Then
you can't take less.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.900
It's very easy to take
more than nothing.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.270
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Nobody
asked your opinion.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.560
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Who's
making personal remarks now?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.080
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Alice did not
know quite what to say to this,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.120
so she helped herself to some
tea and bread and butter.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.780
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And then
turned to the Dormouse

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.030
and repeated her question.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.500
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Why did they
live at the bottom of a well?

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.840
It was a treacle well.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.240
There's no such thing.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.980
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Shh, shh.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.030
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: If
you can't be civil,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.550
you better finish the
story for yourself.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.570
No, no, no, please, go on.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.870
I won't interrupt again.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.790
I dare say there may be one.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.090
One indeed.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:52.240
So these three little sisters, they
were learning to draw, you know?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.010
Oh, what did they draw?

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.190
Treacle.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.490
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: I want a clean cut.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.660
Let's all move down one place.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.960
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: He
moved as he spoke,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.260
and the Dormouse followed him.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.240
The March Hare moved into the
Dormouse's place, and Alice,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.450
rather unwillingly, moved to
the place of the March Hare.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.480
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: The Hatter is the
only one who got any advantage

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.560
from the change, and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.620
as the March Hare had just unset
the milk jug onto his plate.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.920
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: But
I don't understand.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.920
Where did they draw
the treacle from?

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.100
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: You can draw
water out of a water well,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.060
so I think you could draw a
treacle out of a treacle well.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.170
Eh, stupid?

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.360
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: But
they were in the well.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.500
Of course they were.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.460
Well in.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.790
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: The answer
so confused poor Alice

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:49.070
that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.300
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: They were learning
to draw, and they draw all manners

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:58.930
of things, everything that
begins with an M. Why an M?

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.230
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Why not?

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.720
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Hmm.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.910
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: The Dormouse had
closed its eyes by this time

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.410
and was going off into a doze.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.680
But on being pinched by the
Hatter, it woke up again

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.260
with a little shriek and went on.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.770
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: What begins
with an M, such as mousetraps

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:30.410
and the Moon and memory
and muchness.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.560
You know a few things
are much of a muchless?

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.060
And ever so much a thing
as drawing a muchness?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.780
Really now you ask
me, I don't think.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.080
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Then
you shouldn't talk.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.380
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: This piece

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.680
of rudeness was more
than Alice could bear.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.540
She got up in great
disgust and walked out.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.410
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: The Dormouse
fell asleep instantly,

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:57.560
and neither of the others took
the least notice of her going.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.220
Though she looked back
once or twice,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.440
half hoping that they
would call after her,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.910
the last time she saw
them, they were trying

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.370 position:56%
to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.540
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Well, at any
rate, I'll never go there again.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.510

I was ever at in all my life.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.300
And treacle is sort
of the same thing.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.720
In England, it's sort
of a thick syrupy thing.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.910
So these three sisters
were in a well

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.030
with syrup, treacle sticky stuff.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.560
That's what the story was about.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.150
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Kind of silly.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.450
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Yeah, very silly.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.850
Lots of silly things in the book.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.150
Anybody know what a muchness is?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.940
Much of a muchness?

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.240
I don't know what a
muchness is either.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.170
Or why is a raven like
a writing desk?

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.850
Does anybody know?

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.490
A raven, what's a raven?

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.790
&gt;&gt; A bird.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.090
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: A bird.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.390
What color is it?

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.690
&gt;&gt; Black.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.990
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And what football
team has ravens as a mascot?

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.290
&gt;&gt; Baltimore.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.590
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Baltimore.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.890
You guys got it.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.190
Okay, so they're asking, why
is a raven like a writing desk?

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.380 position:56%
So a writing desk is a desk that
Lewis Carroll would write things on.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:41.600
So why could a raven
be like a writing desk?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.380
So in the back, we have lots
of people from Lewis Carroll.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.160
Does anybody have an
answer to that one?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.410
There never was an
answer in the book.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.400
But there's been some
studies about it.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.020
So they wonder if it has
to do with the black ink

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.510
on the writing desk
and the black raven.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:05.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.970
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Were there any
questions about the chapter,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.500
about Alice, about Lewis Carroll?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.110
Does everybody know that
Alice was a real girl?

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.410
Do you all know that?

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.870
Yes? No? Alice was a real girl.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.410
And she knew Lewis Carroll.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.960
So Alice was-- Lewis
Carroll, let me back up,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.670
Lewis Carroll was a math professor

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.070
at a university called
Oxford University in England,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.940
and the college of the university
was called Christ Church,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.860
which is a college, not a church.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.930
And Lewis Carroll was
a math professor there.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.880 position:56%
And his boss, the dean of the
college, had a daughter named Alice.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.180
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Dean is
kind of like a principal.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.030
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Yeah, the dean
of a college is like a principal.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.100
So his boss's daughter was Alice.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.420
And her name was Alice Little.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.420
And he took Alice and two of her
sisters on a boat ride and made

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.240
up the story on the boat
ride that was in 1862.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.460
And then in 1865-- well,
Alice really liked the story

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.840
on the boat ride, and she asked
him to write the story down.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.620
So in 1865, he wrote it down,
and he handed it to her,

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.040
and it became published, and
it became Alice in Wonderland.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.640
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: She was
very close to your age.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.940
How old are you all?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.240
&gt;&gt; 11.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.540
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: 11.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.840
She was 10.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: She was 10 in 1862.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.430
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: Pretty close.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:31.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Was she 10 in 1862?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:38.370 position:56%

on her adventure just a year ago?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.150
Meeting all these strange
people [inaudible].

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.430
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And the
book was first written,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.490
it was called Alice's
Adventures Underground.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:53.530
And then when they went to publish
it and make it a much, you know,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.600
larger publication that all
sorts of people would read,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:05.480
they changed the title to
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:12.690
So the real title is Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.050
And it was published in 1865.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.030
So that's 151 years
ago, or 150 years ago.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.330

They used the dining hall from

He died in 1898.

So the collection was first
started by my grandfather,

mother took it over.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.000
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And
a mathematician.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.280
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: So the people
get together and share stories

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.120
about what they learned

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.510
or how they've been
inspired by Lewis Carroll.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.720
And so it's kind of a fun
thing to do, to get together

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.790
with other people who have a
hobby, the same hobby you have.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.550
It's pretty much that, right?

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.850
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Right.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.500
But we all have a little bit
different spin on our hobbies,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.800
like different interested.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.790
Some people like Lewis Carroll
because he was a mathematician.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.090
He wasn't an English teacher.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.390
He was a math professor.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.690
So some people like him for that.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.390
Some people like him
for his writing.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.170
Some people like him for
all different things.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.910
He was a very interesting,
very intelligent man.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.430
And there's a lot of
interesting stuff he did.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.740
He was one of the first
photographers.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.300
And he photographed a lot of
famous people back in the 1800s.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.370 position:56%
And so there's a lot of interest in
all different pieces that he's done.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.790
&gt;&gt; Is there anyone in the room

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.680
who can tell them a little
bit about Jabberwocky?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: About Jabberwocky?

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.280
What would you like to know?

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.580
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: So he wrote more

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.080
than just Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.780
Jabberwocky was a poem
that he wrote.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.080
You could probably do it.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.380
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: I can do it.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.590
Do you guys know the
poem Jabberwocky?

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.890
&gt;&gt; No.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.190
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Do
you want to hear it?

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.490
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.790
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Oh, man.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.090
Are you guys going to
help me in the back there?

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.390
No? Oh, come on.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.540
Okay, so Jabberwocky is from
Through the Looking Glass.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.750
There were two books that
had to do with Alice.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.230
One was Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland, and one was Alice

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.000
through the Looking Glass.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.500
So all right, let's
see if I can do it.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.150
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.780
All mimsy were the borogoves,
and the mome raths outgrabe.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.760
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.200
The claws that bite,
the jaws that catch!

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.720
Beware the Jubjub bird, and
shun The frumious Bandersnatch!

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.840
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Long time the manxome he fought.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.670
And rested he by the Tumtum tree
and stood awhile in thought.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.490
Oh, no, I missed a part.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.010
You guys aren't helping me.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.100
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: So now you've got
to go to the library and read it.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.400
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: So yeah,
you'll have to read it.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.960
It's hard in front of an audience.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.260
But that's the Jabberwocky.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.920
And it's a very, very famous poem.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.220
And a lot of people do it.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.120
A lot of actors you can
find on YouTube and stuff,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.330
a lot of actors are doing it
much better than I just did it.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.110
Actors from England like to
do that poem there in England.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.320
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: It has a
lot of made-up words in it

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.620
that he just thought, that sounds

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.170
like it should be a word
and he put it in there.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.670
And now some of the words that he
used just for playfulness are part

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.700
of everyday language,
which is really kind of a--

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: 'Twas brillig, and
the slithy toves did gyre and gimble

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.210
in the wabe, are any
of those English?

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.510
&gt;&gt; No.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.160
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: But some of
those words have become words.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.940
You hear people talk about--

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.240
&gt;&gt; Galumphing is a word.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.970
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And he
came galumphing back, yes.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.270
&gt;&gt; And he chortled.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.570
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: And he chortled.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.930
He chortled as he came, yep.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.740
I didn't say all those words.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.360
So you had a question back there.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.940
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering if
[inaudible] had any descendants

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.070
that are a part of The
Lewis Carroll Society.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.400
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: So Lewis
Carroll never married

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.390
and had his own children,
but there are members

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.540 position:56%
of The Lewis Carroll Society of
England that are nieces and nephews.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.330
So a lot of his nieces and nephews,
yes, are part of the society.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: As a member of Christ
Church, he had to take his vows

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.050
of celibacy because he
was part of the church.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.610
So he didn't have that.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.950
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: When you
were a professor back then,

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.500
you weren't supposed to marry.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.940
But I think when he was about
age 50, the rules changed.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.200
But he was about 50,
and never married.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.950 position:56%
But yes, there are nieces and
nephews around, and they still have,

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.310
own some of his things,
and it's very interesting.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.270
When you meet them, it's
kind of like meeting royalty.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.520
So other questions?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:18.990
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little
bit about his childhood,

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:25.630
Lewis Carroll's childhood, and how
that seems to be the background

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.590
of what he was able to create?

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Well, Lewis Carroll
was one of how many children?

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.190
&gt;&gt; 11.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.490
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: 11 children.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.830
And he was the oldest boy.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:43.430
And so in order to keep 11 children
busy back in the early 1800s,

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.080
this is before any electronics.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.880
There was nothing electronic.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.620
There were no, you
know, cell phones,

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.390
iPhones, none of that back then.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.260
So he did a lot of games.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.130
He invented a lot of games that he
did with his brothers and sisters,

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.930
a lot of word games, a lot of
number games, a lot of, you know,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.720
he would write plays,
he would draw pictures,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.560
and did a lot to keep his
brothers and sisters busy.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.520
&gt;&gt; Ken Salins: And he
made a little newsletter.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.310
He started writing
at a very young age.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.690
He made a little like newsletter
thing that he would publish.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.080
And then they would have something
to read and they would sing games

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.380 position:56%
and that would be the entertainment.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.510
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: You had
a question back there.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:35.180
[ Inaudible ]

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:40.530
&gt;&gt; Lewis Carroll, in the
original manuscript that he gave

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:45.100 position:56%
to Alice Little in November of 1854,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.610
and actually illustrated the book
himself, but he was concerned

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:55.460
that his drawings weren't good
enough for a published book.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.250
So on the advice of friends,

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.970
he approached the punch
cartoonist John Tenniel.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.780
He didn't become Sir John Tenniel
until much later in his life.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.490
And Tenniel was a very famous man.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:15.540
Lewis Carroll [inaudible]
was an unknown man teacher.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:22.180
And Tenniel cooperated with him
and followed, to a great degree,

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:27.750 position:56%
the original drawings that Lewis
Carroll had done, and those chapters

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.830
that are repeated from the original
manuscript in the published book.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.590
And you can look at
them and see differences

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.920
and a great deal of similarities.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.060 position:56%
But Carroll was a little too modest.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.450
Because some of his
illustrations are really brilliant,

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:48.230
especially the one when
Alice shrinks down so far

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.660
that her chin touches her shoes.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.990
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.450
&gt;&gt; Ellie Salins: Did you all hear?

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:00.400
So Tenniel, the illustrations
that you're going to see

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.280 position:56%
in the book we're going to give you,

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.890
was the original published
illustrations, okay?

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.080
But Lewis Carroll drew his own.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.380
And they were beautiful.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.680
They're really nice illustrations.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.980
But then after Tenniel,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.770
lots of different people
have now illustrated it.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.430
But the other thing that
[inaudible] said was

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.490
that Lewis Carroll
was not his real name.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.790
Lewis Carroll is a pen name.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.090
Do you all know what a pen name is?

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.500
No? So some authors don't-- do you
want to explain what pen name is?

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.460
No? Okay, because you can
probably explain it better than me.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.550 position:56%
Some authors don't want people to
know they're the ones that wrote it.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.220
So they could have one name.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.270
So his real name, Lewis Carroll's
real name was Charles Lutwidge

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.570
Dodgson, okay?

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.930
Charles Dodgson.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.520
And he was this famous
math professor.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.830
And he's writing these
children's books, and he's like,

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.600
I don't want people to know I'm
writing these children's books.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.270
So he came up with the name
Lewis Carroll as his pen name.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.820
So that's the name he
used for children's books.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.560
But sometimes when he
published other books,

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.970
because he published math books, he
would use the name Charles Dodgson.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.500
But then he did other books

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.340
about symbolic logic
and all sorts of things.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.490
And he sometimes used
Lewis Carroll for those.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.510
But that was his pen name.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.580 position:56%
So his real name is Charles Dodgson.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.110
So the person that had-- was one
of 11 kids was Charles Dodgson.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.200
Then the writer of Alice in
Wonderland, Alice's Adventures

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.890
in Wonderland, is Lewis Carroll.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.540
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
