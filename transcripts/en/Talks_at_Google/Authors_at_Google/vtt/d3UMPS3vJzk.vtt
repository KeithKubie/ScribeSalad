CARMEN MARIA MACHADO:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.950
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.454
It's really lovely to see you.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:18.870
I'm incredibly
excited to be here.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.470
If anyone is hiring a fiction
writer here at Google,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
please email me.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.660
I like your kitchens.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.650
And I want just an endless
supply of seltzer water.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.540
It's, like, my absolute
dream in this world.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.150
So today I am
going to be reading

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.859
from "Her Body and
Other Parties,"

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.900
and I wanted to briefly
talk about the collection

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.950
before I started reading.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.324
And I'm actually going to read
you an entire story, which

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:49.980
I'm extremely excited about
because at readings I almost

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.450
never get to read
an entire story,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.010
and it makes me real cranky.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
I hate doing excerpts, so
I'm very excited to give you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.720
an entire story.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.810
I'm stoked.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.459
I haven't done that in ages.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.000
So yeah, "Her Body
and Other Parties"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.200
is a collection of
short stories that

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.150
does a lot of sort of
genre-bending material,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.799
or has a lot of
genre-bending material.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.340
The story I'm going to read you
the only sort of pure science

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.990
fiction story in the collection.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.500
Most of the stories
are sort of fabulist,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
kind of deal with sort of
surrealist, subliminal fantasy,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.110
that sort of area.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.620
This one just happens to be
my science fiction story.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.630
And I'm really interested
in using fiction

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.000
to sort of explore and examine
questions about women's lives.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.080
And that includes sex, gender,
sort of intellectual problems

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.170
that women experience uniquely
in their lives in terms of,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.150
how do we tell stories
about women that

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.760
talk about mental health without
falling into traps of, say,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.420
writing a crazy woman story
or like a crazy lesbian story,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.994
for example?

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.660
So this is just really
interesting to me

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.910
and is really important to me.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.670
And I've been working on these
stories for about five years.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.470
And then I finally
had a book's worth,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.294
which is pretty exciting.

00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:05.460
Yeah, so the story I'm going
to be reading you today

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.136
is called "Inventory."

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:11.340
"Inventory."

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.080
One girl.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.070
We lay next to each other on
a musty rug in her basement.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.840
Her parents were upstairs.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.650
We told them we were watching
"Jurassic Park," "I'm the dad

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.750
and you're the mom," she said.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.510
I pulled up my shirt
and she pulled up hers,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.760
and we just stared
at each other.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.430
My heart fluttered somewhere
below my belly button,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.370
but I worried about Daddy
Long Legs and her parents

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.630
finding us.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.330
I still have never
seen "Jurassic Park."

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.450
I suppose I never will now.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.400
One boy, one girl.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.780
My friend.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.210
We drank stolen wine
coolers in my room

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.490
on the vast expanse of my bed.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.355
We laughed and talked and
passed around the bottles.

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:56.580
"What I like about you," she
said, "is your reactions.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.710
You respond so
funny to everything,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.450
like it's all intense."

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.490
He nodded in agreement.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.920
She buried her face
in my neck and said,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.910
"Like this," to my skin.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.860
I laughed.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.810
I was nervous, excited.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.170
I felt like a guitar and someone
was twisting the tuning pegs

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.420
and my strings were
getting tighter.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.610
They batted their
eyelashes against my skin

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.530
and breathed into my ears.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.840
I moaned and writhed
and hovered on the edge

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.260
of coming for whole minutes even
though no one was touching me

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.080
there, not even me.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.770
Two boys, one girl, one
of them my boyfriend.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.400
His parents were out of town, so
we threw a party at his house.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.170
We drank lemonade
mixed with vodka,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.440
and he encouraged me to make out
with his friend's girlfriend.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.870
We kissed tentatively
and then stopped.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.580
The boys made out
with each other

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.730
and we watched them for a
long time, bored but too drunk

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.480
to stand up.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.650
We fell asleep in
the guest bedroom.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.500
When I woke up, my bladder
was tight as a fist.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.630
I padded down to
the foyer and saw

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.420
someone had knocked a vodka
lemonade onto the floor.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.890
I tried to clean it up.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.860
The mixture had stripped
the marble finish bare.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.470
My boyfriend's mother found my
underwear behind the bed weeks

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.220
later and handed them to him,
laundered, without a word.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.860
It's weird to me how much
I miss that floral chemical

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.720
smell of clean clothes.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.500
Now all I can think
about is fabric softener.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.980
One man-- slender,
tall, so skinny I

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.430
could see his pelvic bone,
which I found strangely sexy.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.770
Gray eyes, wry smile.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.510
I had known him
for almost a year,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.200
since the previous October when
we met at a Halloween party.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.580
I didn't wear a costume.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.860
He was dressed as Barbarella.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.510
We drank in his apartment.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.730
He was nervous and
gave me a massage.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.640
I was nervous, so I let him.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.900
He rubbed my back
for a long time.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.820
He said, "My hands
are getting tired."

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.510
I said, "Oh, and
turned toward him.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.300
He kissed me, his face
rough with stubble.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.140
He smelled like yeast and the
top notes of expensive cologne.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.870
He lay on top of me and
we made out for awhile.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.720
Everything inside of
me twinged pleasurably.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.310
He asked if he could
touch my breasts,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.260
and I clamped his
hand around it.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.720
I took off my shirt and I
felt like a drop of water

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.640
was sliding up my spine.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.730
I realized this was
happening, really happening.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.200
We both undressed.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.990
He rolled the condom down
and lumbered on top of me.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.090
It hurt worse than
anything ever.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.680
He came and I didn't.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.080
When he pulled out, the
condom was covered in blood.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.030
He pulled it off
and threw it away.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.560
Everything in me pounded.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.780
We slept on a too-small bed.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.730
He insisted on driving me back
to the dorms the next day.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.250
In my room, I took
off my clothes

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.930
and wrapped myself in a towel.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.690
I still smelled like him,
like the two of us together,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.280
and I wanted more.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.360
I felt good, like an adult who
has sex sometimes, and a life.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.930
My roommate asked me
how it was, hugged me.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.857
One man, a boyfriend--

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:53.190
didn't like condoms, asked
me if I was on birth control,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.240
pulled out anyway.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.430
A terrible mess.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.150
One woman, on and off again
sort-of girlfriend, classmate

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.370
from Organization
of Computer Systems,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.470
long brown hair
down to her butt.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.450
She was softer than I expected.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.186
I wanted to go down on her,
but she was too nervous.

00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:11.310
We made out and she slipped
her tongue in my mouth.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.620
And after she went
home, I got off twice

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.080
in the cool stillness
of my apartment.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.990
Two years later, we had sex on
the gravel rooftop of my office

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.070
building.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.230
Four floors below
our bodies, my code

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.080
was compiling in front
of an empty chair.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.270
After we were done, I
looked up and noticed a man

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.890
in a suit watching
us from the window

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.710
of an adjacent skyscraper,
his hand shuffling around

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.260
inside his slacks.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.410
One woman, round
glasses, red hair.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.240
Don't remember where I met her.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.610
We got high and fucked, and
I accidentally fell asleep

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.470
with my hand inside her.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.322
We woke up pre-dawn and walked
across town to a 24-hour diner.

00:06:47.322 --> 00:06:49.530
It drizzled, and when we
got there our sandalled feet

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.090
were numb with chill.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.620
We ate pancakes.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.270
Our mugs ran dry, and when
we looked for the waitress

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.290
she was watching the breaking
news on the battered TV hanging

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.730
from the ceiling.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.040
She chewed on her lip
and the pot of coffee

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.730
tipped in her hand,
dripping tiny brown dots

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.540
on the linoelum.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.540
We watched as the newscaster
blinked away and was replaced

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.610
with a list of
symptoms of the virus

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.210
blossoming a state away
in Northern California.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.330
When he came back, he repeated
that the planes were grounded,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.520
the border of the
state had been closed,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.160
and the virus appeared
to be isolated.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.085
When the waitress walked
over, she seemed distracted.

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:27.210
"Do you have people there?"

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.660
I asked her, and she nodded,
her eyes filling with tears.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.960
I felt terrible having
asked her anything.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.690
One man-- I met him at
the bar around the corner

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.040
from my house.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.780
We made out on my bed.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.580
He smelled like sour
wine, though he'd

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.380
been drinking vodka.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.050
We had sex, but he went
soft halfway through.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.310
We kissed some more.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.130
He wanted to go down on me,
but I didn't want him to.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.560
He got angry and left,
slamming the screen door

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.140
so hard my spice rack
jumped from its nail

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.880
and crashed to the floor.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.950
My dog lapped up
and nutmeg, and I

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.890
had to force feed him
salt to make him throw up.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.810
Red from adrenaline,
I made a list

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.670
of animals I've had in my life--

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.429
seven, including
two beta fish who

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:08.970
died within a week
of each other when

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.330
I was nine, and a list
of the spices in pho--

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.420
cloves, cinnamon, star
anise, coriander, ginger,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.570
cardamom pods.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.364
One man, six inches
shorter than me.

00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:22.280
I explained that the
website I was working for

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.710
was losing business rapidly
because no one wanted

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.020
quirky photography tips
during an epidemic,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.150
and I'd been laid
off that morning.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.500
He bought me dinner.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.570
We had sex in his car,
because he had roommates

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.460
and I couldn't be in
my house right then,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.080
and he slid his
hand inside my bra

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.380
and his hands were
perfect, fucking perfect,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.789
and we fell into the
too-small backseat.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.159
I came for the first
time in two months.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.437
I called him the next day
and left him a voicemail,

00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:48.020
telling him I'd had a good time
and I'd like to see him again,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.600
but he never called me back.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.210
One man, did some sort
of labor for a living.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.910
I can't remember what exactly.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.500
And he had a tattoo of a
boa constrictor on his back

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.170
with a misspelled
Latin phrase below it.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.810
He was strong, could pick me
up and fuck me against a wall.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.480
And it was the most thrilling
sensation I'd ever felt.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.760
We broke a few picture
frames that way.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.662
He used his hands and I dragged
my fingernails down his back,

00:09:10.662 --> 00:09:12.620
and he asked me if I was
going to come for him.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.000
And I said, "Yes.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.560
Yes, I'm going to come for you.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.750
Yes, I will."

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.400
One woman-- blonde hair, brash
voice, friend of a friend.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.282
We married.

00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:25.490
I'm still not sure if I was
with her because I wanted

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.040
to be or I was afraid of
what the world was catching

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.450
all around us.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.550
Within a year, it soured.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.790
We screamed more than we
had sex or even talked.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.250
One night we had a fight
that left me in tears,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.290
and afterwards she asked
me if I wanted to fuck

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.420
and undressed before
I could answer.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.700
I wanted to push
her out the window.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.830
We had sex and I started crying.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.800
When it was over and she was
showering, I packed a suitcase

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.890
and got in my car and drove.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.902
One man, six months later
in my post-divorce haze--

00:09:55.902 --> 00:09:57.860
I met him at the funeral
for the last surviving

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.630
member of his family.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.680
I was grieving.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.090
He was grieving.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.680
We had sex in the
empty house that

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.290
used to belong to his brother
and his brother's wife

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.810
and their children, all dead.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.120
We fucked in every room,
including the hallway,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.810
where I couldn't bend my
pelvis right on the hard floor

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.790
and so I jerked him off in
front of the bare linen closet.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.400
In the master bedroom, I caught
my reflection in the vanity

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.800
mirror as I rode him,
and the lights were off

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.960
and our skin reflected
silver from the moon.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.150
And when he came in
me he said, "Sorry.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.350
Sorry."

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.720
He died a week later
by his own hand.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.000
I moved out of the city, north.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.700
One man, gray eyes again.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.220
I hadn't seen him
in so many years.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.200
He asked me how I
was doing, and I told

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.700
him some things and not others.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.460
I did not want to cry
in front of the man

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.000
to whom I'd given my virginity.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It seemed wrong somehow.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.210
He asked me how many I'd
lost and I said, "My mother.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.980
My roommate from college."

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.185
I did not mention that
I'd found my mother died,

00:10:55.185 --> 00:10:57.690
nor the three days afterward
I'd spent with anxious doctors

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.600
checking my eyes for
the early symptoms,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.720
nor how I'd managed to
escape the quarantine zone.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.810
"When I met you," he said,
"your were so fucking young."

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.600
His body was familiar,
but alien too.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.019
He'd gotten better
and I'd gotten better.

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.810
When he pulled out I
almost expected blood,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.540
but of course there was none.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.000
He'd gotten more beautiful
in those intervening years,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.470
more thoughtful.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.470
I surprised myself by crying
over the bathroom sink.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.610
I ran the tap so he
couldn't hear me.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.132
One woman, brunette, a
former CDC employee--

00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:31.340
I met her at a community
meeting where they taught us

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.290
how to stockpile food and manage
outbreaks in our neighborhood

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.620
should the virus
hop the firebreak.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.780
I had not slept with
a woman since my wife,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.520
but when she lifted
her shirt I realized

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.330
how much I'd been craving
breasts, wetness, soft mouths.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.670
She wanted cock and I obliged.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.590
Afterwards, she traced
the indents in my skin

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.150
from the harness
and confessed to me

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.007
that no one was having any
luck developing a vaccine.

00:11:53.007 --> 00:11:54.590
"But the fucking
thing is only passing

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.300
through physical
contact", she said.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.330
"If people just stayed apart."

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.750
She grew silent.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.150
She curled up next to
me and we drifted off.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.090
When I woke up, she was working
herself over with the dildo.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.820
I pretended that I
was still sleeping.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.911
One man-- he made me
dinner in my kitchen.

00:12:10.911 --> 00:12:13.160
There weren't a lot of
vegetables left from my garden,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.780
but he did what he could.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.370
He tried to feed
me with a spoon,

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.140
but I took the handle from him.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.030
The food didn't taste too bad.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.230
The power went out for
the fourth time that week,

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.020
so we ate by candlelight.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.231
I resented the
inadvertent romance.

00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:27.980
He touched my face
when we fucked and said

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.960
I was beautiful, and I
jerked my head a little

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.462
to dislodge his fingers.

00:12:31.462 --> 00:12:33.920
When he did it a second time,
I put my hand around his chin

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.480
and told him to shut up.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.980
He came immediately.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.622
I did not return his calls.

00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:40.080
When the notice
came over the radio

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.995
the virus had reached Nebraska,
I realized I had to go east

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.570
and so I did.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.610
I left my garden, the
plot where my dog was

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.300
buried, the pine table where I'd
anxiously made so many lists.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.890
Trees that begin with M--

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.880
maple, mimosa, mahogany,
mulberry, magnolia, mountain

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.710
ash, mangrove, myrtle.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.120
States that I'd lived in--

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.720
Iowa, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, New York,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.460
leaving unreadable
jumbles of letters

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.530
imprinted in the soft wood.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.620
I took my savings and rented
a cottage near the ocean.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.620
After a few months, the
landlord, based in Kansas,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.480
stopped depositing my checks.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.630
Two women, refugees
from the Western states

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.580
who drove and drove until
their car broke down

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.207
a mile from my cottage.

00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:24.540
They knocked on my door and
stayed with me for two weeks

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.880
while we tried to figure out
how to get their vehicle up

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.180
and running.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.814
We had wine one night and
talked about the quarantine.

00:13:30.814 --> 00:13:32.730
The generator needed
cranking, and one of them

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.050
offered to do it.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.410
The other one sat down next to
me and slid her hand up my leg.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.880
We ended up jerking
off separately

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.440
and kissing each other.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.110
The generator took and
the power came back on.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.380
The other woman returned, and
we all slept in the same bed.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.030
I wanted them to
stay, but they said

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.650
they were heading
up to Canada, where

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.450
it was rumored to be safer.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.980
They offered to
bring me with them,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.438
but I joked that
I was holding down

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:56.190
the fort for the United States.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.530
"What state are we in?" one
of them asked, and I said,

00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.391
"Maine."

00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:01.140
They kissed me on the
forehead and turned.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.660
and dubbed me the
protector of Maine.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.300
After they left I only used
the generator intermittently,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.670
preferring to spend time
in the dark with candles.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.760
The former owner of the cottage
had a closet full of them.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.865
One man, National Guard--

00:14:14.865 --> 00:14:16.490
when he first showed
up to my doorstep,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.300
I assumed he was
there to evacuate me.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.259
But it turned out, he'd
abandoned his post.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.050
I offered him a place
to stay for the night

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.520
and he thanked me.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.670
I woke up with a knife to my
throat and a hand on my breast.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.449
I told him I couldn't have sex
with him lying down like I was.

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:31.740
He let me stand up, and I
shoved him into the bookcase,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.312
knocking him unconscious.

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:34.770
I dragged his body
out to the beach

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.360
and rolled it into the surf.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.550
He came to sputtering sand.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.245
I pointed the knife at him
and told him to keep walking,

00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:44.817
and if he ever looked
back I would end him.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.400
He obliged, and I
watched him until he

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.140
was a spot of darkness on
the gray strip of shore,

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.340
and then nothing.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.630
He was the last person
I saw for a year.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.930
One woman, a religious
leader with a flock of 50

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.445
trailing behind her,
all dressed in white.

00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:01.070
For three days, I
made them wait around

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.360
the edge of the property.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.870
And after I checked their
eyes, I permitted them to stay.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.000
They all camped around
the cottage on the lawn,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.819
on the beach.

00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:10.610
They had their own
supplies and only needed

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.860
a place to lay their
heads, the leader said.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.130
She wore robes that made
her look like a wizard.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.460
Night fell.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.580
She and I circled the
camp in our bare feet,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.010
the light from the bonfire
carving shadows into her face.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.820
We walked to the water's edge
and I pointed to the darkness

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.230
at a tiny island
she could not see.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.910
She slipped her hand into mine.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.110
I made her drink.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.720
"More or less moonshine," I
said as I handed her the tumbler

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.500
and we sat at the table.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.950
Outside I could hear people
laughing, playing music,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.900
children romping in the surf.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.700
The woman seemed exhausted.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.710
She was younger than
she looked, I realized,

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.780
but the job was aging her.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.330
She sipped her drink,
made a face at the taste.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.610
"We've been walking
so long," she said.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.430
"We stopped for a while,
somewhere near Pennsylvania.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.200
But the virus caught up with
us when we crossed paths

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.370
with another group.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.970
It took 12 of us before we got
distance between us and it."

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.240
We kissed deeply
for a long time,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.060
my heart hammering in my cunt.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.680
She tasted like smoke and honey.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.590
The group stayed for four days,
until she woke up from a dream

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.740
and said she had an omen and
they needed to keep going.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.750
She asked me to come with them.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.060
I tried to imagine myself
with her, her flock

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.040
following behind
us like children.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.240
I declined.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.360
She left a gift on my
pillow, a pewter rabbit

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.610
as big as my thumb.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.050
One man, no more than
20, floppy brown hair--

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.890
he'd been on foot for a month.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.200
He looked like you'd expect--

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.300
skittish, no hope.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.270
When we had sex, he was
reverent and too gentle.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.940
After we cleaned up,
I fed him canned soup.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.460
He told me about how he'd
walked through Chicago, actually

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.010
through it, how they'd stopped
bothering to dispose bodies

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.360
after a while.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.860
He had to refill
his glass before he

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.420
talked about it further.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.420
"After that," he said, "I
went around the cities."

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.490
I asked him how far behind
the virus was really,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.410
and he said he did not know.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.710
"It's so quiet here," he said,
by way of changing the subject.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.359
"No traffic," I explained.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.770
"No tourists."

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.190
He cried and cried, and I
held him until he fell asleep.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.780
The next morning, I
woke up and he was gone.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.609
One woman, much older than me--

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.520
while she waited for
three days to pass,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.344
she meditated on a sand dune.

00:17:20.344 --> 00:17:21.760
When I checked her
eyes, I noticed

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.859
they were green as sea glass.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.020
Her hair grayed at her
temples, and the way

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.110
she laughed tripped pleasure
down the stairs of my heart.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.330
We sat in the half
light of the bay window,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.640
and the buildup was so slow.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.530
She straddled me, and
when she kissed me

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.560
the scene beyond the
glass pinched and curved.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.780
We drank and walked the
length of the beach,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.990
the damp sand making pale
halos around our feet.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.350
She told me about her once
childrens' teenage injuries,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.660
having to put her cat to
sleep the day after she moved

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.280
to a new city.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.650
I told her about finding
my mother, the perilous

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.440
trek across Vermont and New
Hampshire, how the tide was

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.050
never still, my ex-wife.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.610
"What happened?" she asked.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.710
"It just didn't work," I said.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.930
I told her about the man
in the empty house, the way

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.239
he cried and the way his cum
shimmered on his stomach,

00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:09.280
and how I could have
scooped despair from the air

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.110
by the handfuls.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.350
We remembered commercial jingles
from our respective youths,

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.000
including one for an Italian
ice chain that I went to

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.090
at the end of long
summer days, where I

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.610
ate gelato drowsy in the heat.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.160
I couldn't remember the last
time I had smiled so much.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.720
She stayed.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.610
More refugees filtered
through the cottage,

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.000
through us, the last stop before
the border, and we fed them,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.730
played games with
the little ones.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.140
We got careless.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.150
The day I woke up and
the air had changed,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.580
I realized it was
a long time coming.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.380
She was sitting on the couch.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.750
She'd gotten up in the
night and made some tea,

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.165
but the cup was tipped and
the puddle was cold, and

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.040
I recognized the symptoms
from the television

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.080
and the newspapers,
and then the leaflets,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.260
and then the radio
broadcasts, and then

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.760
the hushed voices
around the bonfire.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.500
Her skin was a dark purple
of compounded bruises,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.890
the whites of her eyes shot
through with red and blood

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.530
leaking from the misty
beds of her fingernails.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.300
There was no time to mourn.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.130
I checked my own
face in the mirror.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.900
My eyes were still clear.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.750
I consulted my emergency
list and its supplies.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.300
I took my bag and my tent,
and I got into the dinghy

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.660
and I rode to this where
I had been stashing food

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.830
since I got to the cottage.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.300
I drank water and set up my
tent, and began to make lists.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.270
Every teacher beginning with
preschool, every job I've ever

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.720
had, every person
I've ever loved,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.510
every home I've ever
lived in, every person

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.640
who's probably loved me.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.530
Next week, I will be 30.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.470
The sand is blowing into my
mouth, my hair, the center

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.400
crevice of my notebook, and
the sea is choppy and gray.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.330
Beyond it I can see the cottage,
a speck on the far shore.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.340
I keep thinking I can
see the virus blooming

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.530
on the horizon like a sunrise.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.080
I realize the world will
continue to turn even

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.760
with no people on it.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.600
Maybe it will go
a little faster.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.566
Thank you.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:01.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.159
So I'm happy to take
questions if anyone has any.

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:11.950
AUDIENCE: One of the
things that's actually

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.449
what you referenced
at the beginning

00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:16.150
about having to not write the
crazy lady story or something--

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.275
I feel there's always a
balance, that it feels more

00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:20.450
with women writers that
there's more pressure there.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.075
I think of the balances
that you struck

00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:25.660
incredibly was this balance
between intimacy and honesty

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.180
about oneself, and not
being like "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.512
narcissistic.

00:20:29.512 --> 00:20:30.970
And I don't know
if you can explain

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.180
a little bit about your approach
there, and if it's intentional,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.894
and how you handled
those things.

00:20:35.894 --> 00:20:38.060
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: That's
a really good question.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.770
I mean, I'm--

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.030
I always tell my
students, you have

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.160
to write the books you
want to see in the world.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.319
You need to fill the gap
that's not there, right?

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:49.360
And so the book that I
wanted to see in the world

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.580
was I really wanted
something that dealt

00:20:51.580 --> 00:21:01.890
with the realities of being
a woman in our society,

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.400
and having the female body
and dealing with that.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.150
And so this book has a lot
of viscera in it-- a lot

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.992
of liquids, a lot of guts, a
lot of sex, a lot of fluids.

00:21:14.992 --> 00:21:16.200
Just, there's a lot of stuff.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.980
And there's also a lot of very
honest discussions of things.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.270
I have a story in here
called "The Resident," which

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.820
is about a woman who goes
to a writer's colony,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.770
an artist's colony
to work on a novel,

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.580
and kind of has a mental
breakdown of a sort.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.070
And it's physically like
me, but turned up to 11.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.475
So I was like, this is me kind
of but it's not actually me.

00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:39.600
It's a fictional character.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.570
But it's a lot of my
vulnerabilities and anxieties

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:43.320
and thought loops.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.630
And all the things that
make up my weird brain

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.405
just went into her.

00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:49.530
And there's something very
scary about that, right?

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.270
Just being like, I'm going
to put this out there.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.811
I'm going to write all the weird
shit that happens in my head

00:21:53.811 --> 00:21:55.230
on a daily basis in a character.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.896
People are like, that
character's crazy.

00:21:56.896 --> 00:21:57.900
And it's like, oh great.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.852
Thanks.

00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:00.299
[LAUGHING]

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.340
People get really-- people
have a lot of feelings

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.560
about her particularly.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.370
And I'm like, well, that's the
person who's most like me, so.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:08.970
But yeah.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.857
And so I feel like I just
wanted this collection that

00:22:12.857 --> 00:22:14.940
dealt with that in a way
that felt honest and felt

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.290
like I was--

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.810
I mean, honestly,
I'm only one person.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.020
I can only portray sort
of one type of experience

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.130
or one person's
perception of experiences.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.099
But yeah, I just
wanted that honesty.

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:30.640
It was really
important to me to have

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.510
that sort of immediacy
and viscerality,

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.879
and not sort of move around it.

00:22:35.879 --> 00:22:38.170
Because I feel like that's
the thing people like to do,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.840
is they get close to it and
they get afraid to dive in.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.270
And I was like, no, I
just want to be in there.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.487
So yeah.

00:22:48.487 --> 00:22:50.320
AUDIENCE: Once in a
while you read something

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.190
where the text just hits
you in a certain way that

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.180
couldn't be described to
you in sort of cold logic,

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.142
and you just get
an emotional punch.

00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:02.850
In the beginning of
"The Husband Stitch,"

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.176
you talk about the voices.

00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:06.550
"If you read the story out
loud, please use the following

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.110
voices."

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.893
And the first one is Me--

00:23:09.893 --> 00:23:12.820
you, as a child,
high-pitched, unforgettable.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.460
As a woman, the same.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.330
And the last one is listed
as, all other women are

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.910
interchangeable with my own.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.270
And to me, that
was quite a punch,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.860
just to hear it that way,
to hear your experience

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.329
and women's experience
expressed that way.

00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:34.120
And I would just love
to hear what more you

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.990
have to say about that.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.540
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Yeah.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.970
So did anyone here
ever read book

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.960
"The Scary Stories to
Tell in the Dark" books?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.459
OK.

00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:44.290
So if you've read my book or
if you haven't, "The Husband

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.409
Stitch" is a retelling of a
story that actually is not

00:23:47.409 --> 00:23:47.950
in that book.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:48.750
People think it is.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.502
It's like a weird false memory.

00:23:50.502 --> 00:23:52.210
So Alvin Schwartz,
who wrote those books,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.569
also had another book called
"In a Dark, Dark Room"

00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:56.860
that was actually for younger
readers-- like not teens,

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.844
but it was I Can
Read book that was

00:23:59.844 --> 00:24:01.510
like equally scary
stories with slightly

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.280
less horrifying illustrations.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.749
And there was a story called
"The Green Ribbon" in there,

00:24:05.749 --> 00:24:07.540
about a girl with a
ribbon around her neck.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.310
And her husband is always
asking her about it,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.890
and she won't talk to him about
it, and then on her deathbed

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.390
he unties it and
her head falls off.

00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:18.070
And I wanted to do a
retelling of the story,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.653
and the first story
in this colleciton

00:24:19.653 --> 00:24:20.770
is a retelling of that.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.505
It's sort of an urban legend.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.410
And in the Alvin Schwartz
scary stories book,

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.770
there was a lot of
stage directions.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.780
Because the stories are meant
to be-- they're folk tales.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.280
They're meant to be performed.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.440
And so when I was a kid,
I was in Girl Scouts

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.610
and I did a lot of camping,
and we would tell stories.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.190
And I learned really
quickly that this book

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.590
was a great way of freaking
out my fellow Girl Scouts.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.560
And I could read the
story, and then there'd

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.380
be a command at the end,
like who has my liver?

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.130
Like that story.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.930
And then it would say, like,
grab the person next to you

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.240
and be like, you have it!

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.781
And I did and it made my fellow
Girl Scouts cry hysterically,

00:24:54.781 --> 00:24:57.760
and I was super into it because
people were having a reaction.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.670
Anyway, so I was really into the
idea of having stage directions

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.240
in my story.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.656
But of course, I didn't want
them to be like regular stage

00:25:03.656 --> 00:25:04.300
directions.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.899
I wanted them to sort
of have some quality

00:25:06.899 --> 00:25:08.440
that reflected the
themes of the book

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.104
or what I wanted to talk about.

00:25:10.104 --> 00:25:11.770
So in the opening
section of that story,

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:12.722
I'm sort of saying--

00:25:12.722 --> 00:25:14.430
because in the actual
scary stories book,

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.190
they'd be like, if you
read this story loud

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.210
uss a squeaky voice
or a booming voice,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.920
or whatever sort of
reflects whatever

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.080
the character's supposed to be.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.070
And I sort of wanted to make
a little nod to my experience

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.710
as a person who
consumes a lot of media.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:30.530
I love TV.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.180
I love films.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.638
But a thing that frustrates
me, especially in genres that I

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:36.437
love-- which is science
fiction and horror--

00:25:36.437 --> 00:25:38.770
is that female characters are
often very interchangeable

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.170
and completely unmemorable.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.500
And so I wanted her to be
sort of slightly referring

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.060
to the fact that
we sort of think

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.202
of these female
characters like each

00:25:48.202 --> 00:25:50.410
of the women being described
in that opening section.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.618
It's like the men have these
very distinctive voices,

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:55.000
and then the women are all
sort of interchangeable.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.541
The irony being that when I read
it aloud, it's me reading it

00:25:57.541 --> 00:26:00.450
and it's all the
same voice, right?

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.070
But yeah, so I think it
was something I had to do,

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.290
which is take a formal
constraint or a formal conceit

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.350
in my work and use
it to just create

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.940
some kind of narrative energy.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.610
And in that case, making
a point about a thing

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.020
I have a thought about
about women in media.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.605
Yeah.

00:26:18.605 --> 00:26:22.970
AUDIENCE: Through my years of
seeing Carmen and her friends

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.590
online and on
Facebook conversing

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.760
about all manner
of topics, there's

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.710
some equivalent to the
stages of grief, which

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.230
is my stages of disagreement
with whatever Carmen

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.825
and her friends have written.

00:26:34.825 --> 00:26:37.229
[LAUGHING]

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.270
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: OK.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
on this one, which is--

00:26:40.662 --> 00:26:43.120
well, I don't know exactly what
they are, because they just

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.720
made this up.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.660
But it starts with denial, like
I don't agree with that point.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.640
And then it eventually
comes around to agreement.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.570
Not 100% of the
time, but usually

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.990
if I sit and read
and think I realize

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.330
there is a point being
made that I had not fully

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.880
understood before.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.050
But one very
interesting disagreement

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.560
in the last couple of weeks
was about what fiction is for.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.990
And one writer said
in an interview

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:25.710
that, I believe he
said, my fiction is not

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.900
meant to be political.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.000
I believe that.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.640
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Oh, yeah.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.450
AUDIENCE: Yes, I know.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.830
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: I'm going
to be real controversial when

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.780
I answer this question.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.155
AUDIENCE: And some people, I
think, took it as his saying

00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:38.250
that no fiction
should be political.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.350
So there's this debate
on what exactly he said.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.140
But I thought it was
an interesting topic.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.130
Is there room for fiction that
isn't intended to be political,

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.680
with the understanding
that in the end everything

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.910
must be political?

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.150
But if you write something
that's just, oh, here's

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.520
a person in a boat
who has an adventure,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.850
and you're not trying to be
political about it, is that?

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.150
Is there room for that?

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.400
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: No,
it's a really good question.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.410
I'm gonna blow up
his spot, because it

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.220
was in "The New York Times."

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.969
So it's not like it's
private or anything.

00:28:10.969 --> 00:28:13.601
It's Andy Weir, who
wrote "The Martian"

00:28:13.601 --> 00:28:15.100
and whatever his
new book is called.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.570
"Artemis," I think.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.649
Yeah, had this incredibly
infuriating interview

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:20.440
in "The New York Times"
that just filled me

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.790
with a blinding rage.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.330
I lost the ability to
see for like a minute.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.865
I was just like so
stressed out by it.

00:28:26.865 --> 00:28:28.240
"The New York
Times" has a series

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.976
called By the Book where they
talk to writers about the books

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:31.850
that they're reading.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.430
So it's really
cool, because you're

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.170
sort of getting like, OK,
that's a writer that I like.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.628
Here's stuff they're
interested in,

00:28:36.628 --> 00:28:38.280
books that are
important to them.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.750
It's a really cool way to
sort of get, a, as a writer,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.867
amping other writers' voices,
and also helping your readers

00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:47.200
learn about other books that
they should be checking out

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.000
that you like.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.355
And his answers were just--

00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:54.880
they were very
frustrating to me,

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.630
because everybody he mentioned
except for JK Rowling,

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.220
was an old white man.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.690
Most of them were dead.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.830
There was almost zero
contemporary fiction.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.550
It was all like Asimov--
which is like, not bad

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.220
but like, I was like, have you
not read a book in the last 30

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:10.720
years?

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.720
I mean, it was literally
like that kind of list.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.270
And one woman, and it's like
the most famous female writer

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.560
that we have right now, right?

00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:22.000
And I was really angry about it.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.950
And then also in the
interview he said--

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.230
someone asked him some
question and he was just like,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.190
my fiction is not political.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.130
I just don't believe in, like--

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.080
I just don't want my
fiction to be political.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.600
Answered question.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.094
And my answer is, I don't
actually think it's possible.

00:29:37.094 --> 00:29:38.260
I don't think it's possible.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.350
Because even thinking that you
can write apolitical fiction

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.481
is in itself political.

00:29:44.481 --> 00:29:44.980
Right?

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.430
So even a guy in a boat
having an adventure or person

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.000
in a boat--

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.380
who is that person?

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.054
That's still a political
choice of a kind.

00:29:54.054 --> 00:29:55.970
So no, I actually don't
think those things can

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.210
be separated from each other.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.270
And it's infuriating
to me that he

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.995
is so uncurious about his
own craft and about the world

00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:05.320
that that is his response.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.285
It just really bothered
me, that with that platform

00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:12.040
he just wanted to
talk about Asimov.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.330
Which again, Asimov's great.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.590
But like, come on.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.170
[LAUGHING]

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.430
And yeah.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.080
So no, I actually don't think--

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.690
I mean, and I love a good,
exciting, pulpy piece of art

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.430
as much as the next person.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.140
They give me a lot of pleasure.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.260
But also, that still
doesn't mean that-- like,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.230
I still come away from
the stupidest movie

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.284
that's kind of just like a
very simple sort of pleasure

00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:41.450
thinking a lot about like
the choices that have been

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.040
made at every level, right?

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.170
And who gets published
is a political decision.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.130
Whose work gets
published and who's

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.713
work doesn't get
published, whose work

00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:49.130
gets amplified in certain ways.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.755
Who the characters are.

00:30:51.755 --> 00:30:53.630
Who is allowed to tell
what kinds of stories.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.540
These are all really
inherently, really fraught

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.410
political positions.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.290
And the idea that you can just
write, make a piece of art

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.390
or make a story that is
not political-- to me,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.300
it's just utter
folly and reveals

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.400
a deep sort of misunderstanding
of what art is.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.830
Yeah, sorry.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.260
I went to that place again.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.760
I was, like, flashing back
to reading that article.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.490
But thank you, it
was a great question.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.615
AUDIENCE: Actually, similar
to something I was wondering,

00:31:25.615 --> 00:31:26.990
would love to hear
about from you

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.500
about how your work exists
in the outside world,

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.900
like outside of the
scope of the work itself,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.730
and what people's
reactions have been

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.060
and what impact you've had.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.684
So I read your book
a few weeks ago

00:31:38.684 --> 00:31:40.100
when I happened
to be on vacation.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.850
I've also been going
through this really weird--

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.460
I have like one little
thing that's just mine

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.424
that I do in the
mornings that's for me,

00:31:48.424 --> 00:31:50.090
sort of echoes of the
green ribbon story

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.590
and like just having one thing
for you, that I'm currently

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.550
rewatching the
entire "West Wing"

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.749
and listening to a "West
Wing" revision podcast.

00:31:58.749 --> 00:32:00.290
It sounds horrible,
but it's actually

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.490
surprisingly interesting.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.890
And the show in some way,
and like Aaron Sorkin being

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.960
this ridiculously
talented writer,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.530
watching it with 2017 eyes--

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.760
for a show that started
filming in 1999,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.549
and how ridiculously
chauvinistic it is.

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:14.840
And it's funny, because some
of the themes are really--

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.360
and don't even get me started on
the racial stuff, because, oof.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.635
Anyway.

00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:22.010
But even there is this amazing
moment in the first season

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.630
that the people in the podcast
go into looking back and saying

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.630
where the president and
Leo were standing there,

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.245
and they're our heroes.

00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:28.310
They're like the
heroes of heroes,

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.260
the top of the cream of
the crop of the people,

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.384
and they're saying, they're
going, boys, the things

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:33.482
we do to women.

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:34.940
And they're sort
of acknowledging--

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.170
like, a lot of your stories
are the other side of it,

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.150
like yeah, these are the
frickin' things we do to women.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.420
And hearing it from the
males, they'll be like, yup.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.419
And then they go and say
something inappropriate

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:44.930
to a woman.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.910
So I totally agree that
you can't separate--

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.070
like, it is hard for me
to listen to Aaron Sorkin

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.980
and be like, man, you're
brilliant but why can you--

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.430
you have one strong
female character,

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.050
and you're constantly sexually
harassing her on the screen.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.250
Like what the-- what
is wrong with you?

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.535
I'm curious how your work, being
such the opposite perspective

00:32:59.535 --> 00:33:01.160
and being so strong
voiced in that way,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.710
like how have you found it
has impacted other people

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.600
and impacted the literary
world that you live in?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.320
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Yeah, "The
West Wing" does not age well.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.640
I've also discovered this.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.290
It is true.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.600
Yeah, the sort of idea--

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.030
I think what's been
really hard, again,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.240
as a person who consumes media--

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.790
like, the media that I'm
most interested in absolutely

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.350
not made for me.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.920
The genres I'm interested in are
genres where my demographic is

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.390
an utter afterthought, right?

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.540
And so that sort
of idea of, wow,

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.967
I'm not even being considered
in any way in anything

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:43.550
about this-- even
artists that I love.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.720
I like Aaron Sorkin.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.760
I love Joss Whedon.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.029
Lars Von Trier is a
filmmaker who I adore,

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:50.570
even though like
literally every film

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.720
is him taking a woman apart
on the screen for three hours,

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.060
and that's like his entire
project over and over again.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.960
And it's really
hard, because those

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.150
are artists that mean
a lot to me, whose

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.314
work has meant a lot to me.

00:34:03.314 --> 00:34:04.730
"Buffy" is really
important to me.

00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:09.650
So at some point, I had to
come to this sense of peace

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.959
where it's like, OK,
the art that I most--

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:15.500
not all the art that I love,
but a lot of the art that I love

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.550
is absolutely not made with
me in mind, and also at times

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:26.150
is actively destructive
in certain ways

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.030
and is very harmful
to women, for example,

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.710
or people of color or
queer people or whoever.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.710
And so that's been a thing
I had come to terms with.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.239
But in terms of my own book--

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:43.034
I mean, I'm really lucky because
the work that I write is--

00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:44.659
I was like, I want
to write a book that

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.179
has all-female protagonists.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.860
Most of them are queer.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.600
I want lots of sex.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.067
I want weird genre stuff that
doesn't really have a category.

00:34:54.067 --> 00:34:55.650
I want all these
things for this book.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.470
And I was really
lucky that I just

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.450
managed to find a
publisher who kind of got

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.530
the vision of that project,
because I feel like--

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.380
I mean, I once had a story
rejected by an editor.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.130
He gave me this content
where he was like,

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.761
there's just no
men in this story.

00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:09.385
There are none.

00:35:09.385 --> 00:35:10.850
And I said, I know.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.490
I know there are none.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.580
It's about a mother.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.065
She's got sisters.

00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:16.190
Like, there was just like--

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.690
I was like, I don't--
there's just--

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.029
I mean, they just don't--

00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:20.695
because it would at
least get mentioned.

00:35:20.695 --> 00:35:22.100
They would mention the father.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.850
And I was like, why?

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.130
And I feel like that sort
of reversal of perspective

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.930
is intense.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.440
It's intense
[INAUDIBLE] deal with.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.273
And I think the reason
people respond really

00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:36.000
strongly to my book is
this sense of utter relief

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.810
that that is being
sort of inverted,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.270
because we're just so used
to seeing the opposite.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:45.230
And so in that same way
that I'm also queer,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.030
and whenever I see a
queer character on TV

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.330
or hear a song that could be
thought about as a queer song,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.260
I'm just all over it.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.370
I'm like, I will
give it all my money.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.970
I will watch it.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.678
I will follow it.

00:35:53.678 --> 00:35:55.890
Because I'm seeing this teeny--

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:56.940
whoops, sorry.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.670
I'm seeing this
tiny place where I

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.120
feel even slightly represented.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.620
Or like "Jane the
Virgin" is a show.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.120
I Like, how many liquids
can you see on TV?

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:11.009
So when I see that, I respond
to it really strongly.

00:36:11.009 --> 00:36:12.800
And I feel like people
are feeling that way

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.910
about my book,
where they're like,

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.860
I'm seeing a thing that
I didn't see before.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.620
I'm hungry for it.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.720
I didn't even know
how hungry I was.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.150
Or maybe you did know how
angry you were, but seeing it

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.190
is this really exciting thing.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.450
So the response to my book--

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.209
and honestly, I
think the political--

00:36:25.209 --> 00:36:27.500
even though I've been writing
this book for five years.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.784
Women's lives have
always been garbage.

00:36:29.784 --> 00:36:30.950
They continue to be garbage.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.680
But right now it's
particularly bad.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.151
But we're in this
political moment

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.400
where suddenly my book is
like extra weirdly relevant,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.050
even though that sucks.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.160
I wish it wasn't.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.074
I wish it was less relevant.

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:43.490
But yes, I think
that's why people

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.436
are responding so strongly to
the book, is because of this.

00:36:46.436 --> 00:36:47.810
Because not only
are people like,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.518
that's familiar to me
from my whole life,

00:36:49.518 --> 00:36:52.880
but also in terms of
just what's happening

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.750
right now politically.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.160
AUDIENCE: I just want
follow up a little bit.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.850
I'm curious about how you
think about the line between,

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.700
here are the stories that
I've published so far

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.160
and a book as a thing that sort
of exists in and of itself.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.970
What was the process like
of putting it together

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.156
as a whole package?

00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:23.280
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Sure.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.775
I see you have the short
story advent calendar.

00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:26.400
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.525
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Yeah.

00:37:27.525 --> 00:37:29.000
[LAUGHING]

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.350
Yeah, so I've been publishing
fiction for five, six years now

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:34.975
professionally.

00:37:34.975 --> 00:37:37.474
And I've published a lot more
stories than are in this book.

00:37:37.474 --> 00:37:39.594
There are only eight
stories in this book.

00:37:39.594 --> 00:37:41.010
And it's weird,
because when I was

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.200
sort of talking to editors
in the process of trying

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.540
to publish it, there was someone
who was sort of interested

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.770
and was saying,
well, I feel like you

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.144
could add all
these other stories

00:37:48.144 --> 00:37:51.500
that I know you've published
but aren't in this version

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.142
of the book.

00:37:53.142 --> 00:37:55.350
And I feel there's two
philosophies about short story

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.030
collections.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.250
A short story collection
is like the last 15

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.833
stories you've published, or the
last 10 stories you published

00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:06.060
or whatever, or it has
a strong thematic heart

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.400
and a strong thematic link.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.000
And for me, when I read
short story collections

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.055
I prefer the latter.

00:38:12.055 --> 00:38:13.680
I don't like a bunch
of random stories.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.679
I want them to feel like
they're in conversation

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:17.450
with each other
in some capacity.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:21.800
So when I was in grad
school, I published my--

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.486
my thesis, which had the
same title as this book,

00:38:24.486 --> 00:38:26.360
only had three common
stories with this book.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.776
And there's a lot
of other stories

00:38:27.776 --> 00:38:30.070
that are since retired
in the Disney vault.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:34.190
I've tied them away and
no one will ever see them.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:39.150
But I wanted-- because
I sort of realized, wow,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.970
some of the stories I really
like, and other stories--

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.716
it's not that I don't
like them, or they're

00:38:44.716 --> 00:38:45.590
about something else.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.490
Like, they're not about
women's bodies and sex.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.710
There were themes that
I had for this book

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.740
that I wanted the
stories to be a part of.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.944
And if they fell outside those
parameters, I was like, well,

00:38:56.944 --> 00:38:57.860
it's for another book.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.360
Or maybe it's a
one-off story that's

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.024
not going to go in a book.

00:39:01.024 --> 00:39:02.690
And what's really
interesting about that

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:06.110
is as I was wrapping
this book up,

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.270
I sort of was writing
brand new stories

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.020
and was realizing like, oh wow,
I have a second book in me.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.540
I have another set
of interests that

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.780
is related to these
stories in certain ways,

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.510
like still lots of sex,
still queer women, et cetera.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.220
But I have different interests.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.520
I'm writing this book now where
memory is a central theme.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.650
And that's not really a
theme that exists in here,

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.396
but it's this new
idea that I'm having.

00:39:29.396 --> 00:39:30.895
And so it was
actually pretty cool--

00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:33.214
because I feel like
when you're trying

00:39:33.214 --> 00:39:35.630
to put together a debut book,
it's like that's your focus.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.580
You're like, this is my book.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.300
This is a thing in my brain.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.841
And then you have
it and you're like,

00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:44.060
oh, I have other books in
my brain about other things.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.880
And it's a very odd
feeling when you've

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.940
been really focused
on publishing

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.170
a book for your whole life.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.730
So now I new projects.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:57.650
And these stories just get--
my editor really wanted

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.439
a tight, lean collection.

00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:00.980
Two of these stories
are really huge.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.840
"The Resident" and "Especially
Heinous" are massive.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.970
And so yeah, so it ended
up being two novellas,

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.100
six short stories.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.957
It's a fairly
average-sized collection.

00:40:12.957 --> 00:40:15.290
Yeah, and I just didn't want
to add anything else to it.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.870
And these felt like they
were very tight, and sort of

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.857
in conversation with each other.

00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:20.690
So yeah, that's why.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.030
But I really like the
result. I feel like this

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.721
was the book I needed it to be.

00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:26.720
I'm glad I didn't publish
earlier versions of it

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.880
with more stories that
weren't as connected.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.820
AUDIENCE: So I was curious
when for you or what

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.790
was the book when you
first felt like you

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.659
saw yourself represented?

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:41.450
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO:
Oh, like that I read?

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.210
AUDIENCE: That you read, yeah.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.790
And when that
happened in your life,

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.883
and how long it took
for that to happen.

00:40:45.883 --> 00:40:47.940
For me, it took until
I was a teenager.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.430
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: Yeah.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.370
Yeah, I mean-- there have
been bits and spurts sort

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:53.380
of throughout.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.160
I was a voracious
reader as a teen.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.710
I read a lot of books--

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.660
I mean, books like--

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.370
I read, like, "Animorphs."

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.450
I read all those.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.000
I mean, I read a lot of series.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.830
But I really loved
"Wrinkle in Time."

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.410
That was a really
formative book for me.

00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:14.480
I mean, I didn't
really get to read--

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.020
I grew up in the '90s, so
I wasn't really reading

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.570
many books about queer teens.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.925
But in terms of
female voices, there

00:41:19.925 --> 00:41:21.300
was like "Behind
the Attic Wall,"

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.010
which was a novel that was
really important to me.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.760
You know it!

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.870
You know it!

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.030
It's so good.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.790
Yes, it's so good.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.222
OK, we could talk it after,
because it's so good.

00:41:29.222 --> 00:41:30.930
And whenever I say to
people who know it,

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.220
they get incredibly excited.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.150
It's such a good book.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:37.100
So that was a really formative
book for me, where I--

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.780
I mean, every teenager and
every pre-teen is like, oh,

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.864
I'm so gawky and awkward.

00:41:40.864 --> 00:41:41.530
No one likes me.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.790
So it's easy to identify
with a character in a book,

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.819
because they're all
like gawky and--

00:41:47.819 --> 00:41:49.860
they're like, oh, I have
problems making friends.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.810
It's like, yeah, we all do.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.700
Welcome to the club.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.200
Yeah.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.300
And then as I got older--

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.110
the work that sort
of really kicked off

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.410
what I say is sort
of my voice, or where

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.480
I felt like I was
reading work that I

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.550
wanted to respond to
with my own work, which

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.470
was a very distinct sort
of moment in my life.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.050
I was reading people like
Kelly Link, Karen Russell,

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.740
Helen Oyeyemi, George Saunders.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.250
Mostly female writers.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.880
And yeah, it was like short
stories and weird stuff,

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.510
and just like felt weird and
had a lot of women in them

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.670
and were just really
weird and interesting.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.730
So I feel like there were
sort of multiple steps.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.300
And then also like
in high school,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.040
I had this teacher who gave me--

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.107
it was public school,
so we were constantly

00:42:39.107 --> 00:42:40.190
learning, like, Hemingway.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.520
And I really, really hate
Hemingway still to this day.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.130
And I would just
yell at every class--

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.747
poor Mrs. [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:47.747 --> 00:42:50.330
Every class, she'd be like let's
talk about-- and I'd be like,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.625
he's an alcoholic.

00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:52.250
I had thoughts.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.920
I was like, he's
horrible to women.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.270
I hate everything
happening-- oh my gosh,

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.030
I pulled my mic down in
my rage of Hemingway.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.400
And I was really mad, and
she stopped calling on me

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.234
for awhile.

00:43:04.234 --> 00:43:05.900
My hand would be like
seriously raising,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.566
and she'd be like,
Carmen, I didn't even

00:43:07.566 --> 00:43:10.430
want to hear what you have to
say about Ernest Hemingway.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.977
But she could tell that
I was frustrated by what

00:43:12.977 --> 00:43:14.060
we were reading in school.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.420
And we only ever read like one
book by a woman my entire--

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.990
we read "Jane Eyre"
and that was like it,

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.380
and then everything
else was men.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.057
So I was very frustrated, even
though I loved English class.

00:43:26.057 --> 00:43:28.640
And so one day, my teacher Mrs.
[INAUDIBLE],, bless her heart,

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.550
came in with a pile of books
from her personal library

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.300
and she said, I think
you will like these.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.050
You need to read them.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.800
And it was "One Hundred
Years of Solitude"

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.510
by Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
Gloria Naylor's "Mama Day,"

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:48.110
Henry James' "What Maisie Knew,"
Kate Chopin's "The Awakening,"

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.600
and a handful of others.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.930
And I suddenly was
also able to just see

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.597
what was possible in
literature and what

00:43:55.597 --> 00:43:57.721
it was like to write from
all the different places.

00:43:57.721 --> 00:43:58.710
And like, I don't know.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.210
I just really-- so
I feel like I had

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:03.470
these stages of self-discovery
as a young person

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.990
because of what I was reading,
this very directed thing

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.150
to happen to me
like in high school,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.700
and then when I was in grad
school I had a lot of friends

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.580
who were sort of like, you
need to be reading these people

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.810
because that's what you want
to be doing as a writer.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.810
And then I felt like my
mind was like blown open

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.350
and I was like, oh my god,
everything is amazing.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.700
Literature!

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.760
It was just so exciting.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.343
So I think it's been
different phases.

00:44:28.004 --> 00:44:29.420
AUDIENCE: You
talked about the way

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.620
that the stories
here go together.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.430
And I wonder if you'd talk
about the name a little,

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.604
"Her Body and Other Parties."

00:44:36.604 --> 00:44:38.270
You mentioned "Jane
the Virgin" earlier.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:43.440
I feel like there's this group
of subversive and thoughtful

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.540
media with this sort
of like, yeah, I

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.790
know you think of me meme.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:47.540
"Jane the Virgin."

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.926
"Crazy Ex Girlfriend," yeah.

00:44:50.926 --> 00:44:52.900
I wondered if you'd talk
about that a little.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.150
CARMEN MARIA MACHADO: That's
a great question, and one

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.270
that I have a lot
of thoughts about.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.472
Yeah, I really-- it's funny.

00:44:58.472 --> 00:45:00.930
I actually did not watch "Crazy
Ex Girlfriend" for a while,

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.830
because the title was
so off-putting to me.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.564
And then something who knows
me was like, no, no, no.

00:45:05.564 --> 00:45:06.730
You really need to watch it.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:07.320
You will love it.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.690
And I did, and I think it's one
of the best shows on television

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.190
right now.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:11.070
I absolutely love it.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.380
"Jane the Virgin"
also, I was like,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.390
what a weird title for a show.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.150
But yeah, I mean, this
story collection--

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:20.260
there's a few reasons.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.335
So I wanted--

00:45:24.846 --> 00:45:28.290
I asked a friend, how do people
name short story collections?

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.210
And he was like,
well, oftentimes

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.010
it's the title of
one of the stories,

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.690
but it's a title
that sort of embodies

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.589
the themes of the whole book.

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:38.130
If you read a short
story collection,

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.780
you'll notice that
usually the title is

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.970
a title of one of the stories.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.760
But none of the titles
were working for me

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.630
in that capacity.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.963
I was looking at all the titles.

00:45:46.963 --> 00:45:49.287
I was like, none of these
feel like a book title.

00:45:49.287 --> 00:45:50.370
But I love titling things.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:54.212
It's like a weird hobby I have.

00:45:54.212 --> 00:45:55.920
So yeah, I was sort
of thinking about it.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.824
And then I also was
thinking about this book

00:45:58.824 --> 00:46:00.990
that I really love, Ted
Chiang's "Story of Your Life

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.044
and Others," which is a book
which if you haven't read,

00:46:04.044 --> 00:46:06.210
you absolutely must, because
it is literally perfect

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.335
and Ted Chiang is a genius.

00:46:07.335 --> 00:46:11.673
It's science fiction, and
it's gorgeous and amazing.

00:46:11.673 --> 00:46:13.415
So that title has
that sort of pun,

00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:15.040
where it's like
"Stories of Your Life,"

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.710
which is the name of
one of his stories,

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.751
"and others," which can
be like "and other lives"

00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:19.860
or "and other stories."

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.550
So using that sort of structure
of "and other stories,"

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.810
sort of riffing
on that structure.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.020
So then I had that in mind.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.940
And then I started mashing
my titles together.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.900
I was like, let's see what
key words from my story titles

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.040
could be put together
in this structure.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.020
And I came up with--

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:44.280
I think like "Bodies
and Other Parties,"

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.000
because women have bodies.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.159
That's in the title.

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:49.200
And then I was, but I feel
like I want the gender

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.030
element to be in there.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.321
So then I was like, "Her Body."

00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:52.470
"Her Body and Other."

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.678
"Her Body and Other Parties."

00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:55.170
And I just really liked it.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.160
And then it just stuck.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.010
It's been the title of this
book even before this book

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.774
even remotely looked like this.

00:47:00.774 --> 00:47:02.190
And I feel like
it also helped me,

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.100
because it was something
to work toward--

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.060
it was like a
lighthouse that I could

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.160
sort of be moving toward with my
work and the way I do my edits.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.720
So yeah, that was just--

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.052
I mean, that was just
how I kind of came to it.

00:47:17.052 --> 00:47:18.385
But titles are really important.

00:47:18.385 --> 00:47:20.630
And yeah, I do think that
sort of quality of like,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.460
fuck you for what you
think of me, right?

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.200
That title is such a good--

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.080
it's really fun.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.740
And I think that
level of subversion

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.170
is really important
and really interesting,

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.140
and I think that both those
examples that you gave

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.330
are female-driven
properties, one of whom

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.770
was a woman of color.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:41.270
I think that's
important, that sort

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.060
of very, very self-aware title.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.610
So yeah.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:46.660
That's it.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.300
Yeah?

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.133
All right, well thank
you so much, everyone.

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:50.820
It was so lovely to talk to you.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.170
[APPLAUSE]
