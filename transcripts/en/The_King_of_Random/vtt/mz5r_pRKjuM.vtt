Hey guys!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.080
If you've been hoping to get
the Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.680
today is your last chance.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.900
Contest is closing.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.160
There's a link down in the description.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.080
This self filling pet water dish
is super easy to build,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440
and is made of very low cost materials.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.820
Today, we're gonna be showing you
how to build a self refilling pet water bowl,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.420
and it's a very simple build.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.700
It goes together quickly,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.000
and is easy to use.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.260
To get started, we've got
a scrap of half-inch board,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.600
a piece of 2x4,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.940
an empty soda bottle,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.280
a pet food dish,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.200
and a little patch of velcro.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
The basic idea is that
our pet dish will hold water,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.180
and will be refilled by
a reservoir in our soda bottle.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400
Piece of 2x4 will be
attached to the board,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.860
and our soda bottle will be
able to attach and detach from there.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.420
The board doesn't really have
specific size requirements

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.300
other than being big enough to hold
the food container and a board behind it.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.520
For this design, we're also
going to use a piece of 2x4

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.640
as a support behind the pillar.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.520
So we'll cut that,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.039
and then measure how big
we need our board to be,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.600
to hold all of the pieces together.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.380
[Music]

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.800
From our scrap of 2x4,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.280
I cut a wedge with a 90 degree angle
that should nicely support our pillar.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:39.600
[Music]

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.100
This is going to be around pets,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.780
so just to make it a little bit safer,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.280
let's sand down all of the edges,
sharp corners, and splinters.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.840
[Music]

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.460
With our board measured and cut,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.940
we can now see where the bowl,
pillar, and support piece will fit.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.359
Now, let's attach our support pillar

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120
to our board with a few screws.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.340
I have marked off where
our support pillar was sitting,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.740
and we'll now drill
down through the top,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.260
three different spots
where our screws will go.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.960
After we have those drilled out,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.300
we can put our board back in place,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.820
and drill from the other side.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.160
This will help us know that
we're drilling in just the right spot

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.720
as we drill the pilot holes into the 2x4.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.220
[Music]

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.440
With three screws attaching
our pillar to the board,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440
it's pretty sturdy.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.260
But just to be sure,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.060
let's use a few more and
add a support piece on the back.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.920
Don't split, don't split, don't split.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.280
[Music]

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.200
The support pillar is now very sturdy,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.040
and can handle just about
whatever we throw at it,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.590
which is just what we want it to be.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.660
We need a way to attach
the soda bottle to the support pillar,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.560
but still be able to move it up and down,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.660
and to remove it,
so we can refill it.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.600
This is where our velcro
patches come into play.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.200
These patches will hold
themselves together

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.520
with quite a bit of force.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.100
It should be enough to hold even
a full soda bottle without falling.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.680
The level of the water in the dish
will be determined by how high,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.840
up or down,
our bottle is placed.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.060
The water will fill to the level
of the bottom of the bottle.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.080
So if we have our bottle near the bottom,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.140
there will only be a little bit of water.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.800
If we have it near the top of the bowl,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.680
the whole bowl will fill.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.440
The velcro patches
come with an adhesive side,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.080
and we'll stick one
of those onto our soda bottle.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.640
For the matching fuzzy side of our velcro,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.680
we can figure out a spot
that will let us put it both

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.280
at the lowest point
and the highest point.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.280
That height looks like a good point.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.460
Mark that.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.820
[Music]

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.800
It's very sticky.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.220
[Music]

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.860
After attaching both sides of the velcro,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.900
we want to give it at least 15 minutes

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.560
for the glue to really settle
before we add any weight,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.000
or try and put the pieces
together and pull them apart.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.680
In the meantime,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.040
let's see if we can secure
our bowl to the base,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.120
a little bit more than
just letting it rest there.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.780
With this particular design of dish,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.760
the middle bottom portion of the bowl
isn't making contact with the board.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.040
I've got a little scrap of thin board,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.370
and I think we can trim
that to the right size,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.090
and have that make up the difference
between the edge of the bowl and the center.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.300
We can then use another piece
of velcro to attach onto that spot,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.160
as well as the bottom of the bowl.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.060
This way, the bowl will
stay where we want it,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.320
until we try to peel it up.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.080
A little bit of wood glue should hold
this piece down in place forever.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.660
[Music]

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.600
Add a little bit of weight,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.480
and let it sit for about 30 minutes.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.320
[Music]

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.740
Velcro patch part one and two,
our bowl should now stay nicely in place.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.280
[Music]

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.360
That's not coming off.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.140
With our bowl attached,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.420
and our velcro having
had time to cure in place,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.160
we can now attach the bottle
onto the side of our post.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.520
And it should stay just exactly in place.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.500
All we need to do now
is refill this bottle with water,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.220
and start filling our bowl.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.900
[Music]

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.860
To start filling,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.480
let's turn our bottle upside down,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.520
and quickly lower it to
the level of the bottom of the bowl.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.860
We can then raise it higher
to the level we want the water to fill.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:31.180
[Music]

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.740
At this point, with the neck
of the bottle under the water,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.400
no additional air can
get into our soda bottle.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.480
Because no air is able
to take the place of the water,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.360
no more water will flow out

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.980
until more water
is removed from the bowl.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.120
This way, when your pet
drinks water from the bowl,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.460
it will refill itself out of the soda bottle.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.980
And if you want to start with
the bottle all the way full

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.280
so there's a maximum capacity of water,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.360
just make sure you fill the bowl
before putting the soda bottle in.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.520
Now, it may be obvious that this bowl
is probably bigger than it needs to be

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.220
for this size of dog.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.600
I did want to make sure that there
is room for him to drink out of the water,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.760
and not hit his head on the bottle.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:17.260
[Music]

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.760
Hey guys.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.140
Grant jumping back in for just a second

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.580
to remind you we're giving away
a Nintendo Switch and Mario Kart 8.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.919
There's a link down in
the description right now

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.389
where you can click and get
your name on the list.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.060
We're doing a random drawing
for subscriber appreciation,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.720
and we're also sending
you the gift receipt,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.120
because if you don't want the Nintendo,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.100
you can take it back
and get the cash instead.
