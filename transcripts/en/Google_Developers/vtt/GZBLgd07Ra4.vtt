RETO MEIER: Good afternoon,
everyone, and welcome to

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.380
Google Developers Live.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.180
My name's Reto Meier.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.440
I'm the tech lead
for the Android

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.390
developer relations team.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.040
And today, I have the very great
pleasure of interviewing

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.600
Hiroshi Lockheimer, VP of
engineering for Android, and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.830
Hugo Barra, VP of product
for Android.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.840
So congratulations on a great
keynote yesterday--

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.800
a lot of really exciting
news for

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.550
developers that we all heard.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.680
I think probably the most
exciting thing which

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.962
developers have been talking
about to me is the new Android

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:35.230
Studio IDE.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.700
Can you tell us a little bit
more about what meditated

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.440
those changes?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.250
Why have we gone in this
direction, and what's the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920
future there?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.880
HUGO BARRA: So as we said
yesterday, we're listening.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.040
This is one of the most common
pieces of feedback that we get

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.480
from developers is that they
want more options.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.260
There's a lot of people who
love Eclipse and will be

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.090
Eclipse die hard fans for
the rest of time.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.300
But there are people who
want different options.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.320
There are people using IntelliJ

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.570
already in the community.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.230
So we thought, why don't we join
forces with JetBrains,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.410
and starting from their
community edition product,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.460
which is open source, can we
build something that's even

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060
more customized to Android
developers?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.860
And I think we're there with
this early preview.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710
But there's so much
more to come.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.300
RETO MEIER: It's a really
exciting time.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.860
I think from a developer
perspective, it's great to

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.130
have this whole suite of tools
that we can use, depending on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.347
whatever your preference is.

00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:26.690
So it will be exciting to see
how that continues on.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.665
One thing which we get tend to
get asked a lot-- and it would

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.950
be interesting to get your
opinion on this-- is, do you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.640
think we're ever going to get
to a point where we can all

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.050
sit down with an Android device
to do our Android app

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.810
developments?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.796
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Self-targeting?

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:39.192
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:01:39.192 --> 00:01:40.910
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Like being
able to compile on the device.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.985
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:41.510
On the device.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.130
So open up your Android, start
writing some code, deploy it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.610
to yourself.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.810
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, that
would be a cool feature.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.250
What do you think?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.410
HUGO BARRA: That would
be pretty cool.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.410
It's a hell of a project.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.570
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I want
to see people doing that,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.290
writing some code.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.330
Yeah, that would be cool.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.395
RETO MEIER: That's always
his excuse, right?

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:54.710
You want to give him
a real computer.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.080
He only gets the tablet.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.090
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: It's
very Inception-esque.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.960
RETO MEIER: So one of the other
big announcements which

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.060
is really exciting-- slightly
less developer focused, but I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.000
think a lot of interest to a lot
of people-- is the music

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.402
on demand, or Music
All Access, if I

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:10.729
remember the name.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.050
So I got to ask, what is
your seed for your

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.930
current radio stations?

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.230
What track is generating
your radio?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.780
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Mumford
and Sons for me right now.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.190
I'm kind of into
them right now.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.630
I don't know about you.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.410
Some sort of Brazilian
bossa nova thing?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.160
HUGO BARRA: I have several
different music

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.530
personalities in one.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.000
RETO MEIER: What's your
developer personality?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
When you sit back and you start
writing out some code,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.410
what do you put on then?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.590
HUGO BARRA: I would say
probably Daft Punk.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.620
Definitely that would
be my seed.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.860
And yesterday, I started
a radio station with

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.220
Supertramp's "Dreamer." It's
a little weird, right?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.460
RETO MEIER: Keeping it real.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.500
I was pleased they had Daft
Punk playing in my session

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.525
room before I went
up on stage.

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:54.180
It was kind of the perfect
way to start.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.320
HUGO BARRA: Daft Punk seems to
be an omnipresent theme here

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.615
at I/O.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:58.010
RETO MEIER: It's hard to
get away from, yeah.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.810
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
What's your seed?

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.820
RETO MEIER: It's Daft Punk--

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.773
the Daft Punk track, "Get
Lucky." I'm all

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:03.505
about that right now.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:04.250
Perfect.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.000
So again, we heard a lot of
really impressive numbers

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.930
around Android's growth.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.070
It seems like it's all really
exploded over the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.780
last couple of years.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780
People are asking me,
what is the future?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.785
How does the next phase
of Android growth

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.300
and development look?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: You
want me to handle it.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.560
OK.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.220
Well, I think we can talk
about device growth, the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.970
number of devices and
things like that.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.850
But really what we want to focus
on is business growth,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.630
the opportunities for the
developers out there.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.800
So as you saw today, or
yesterday, I guess--

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.365
and today and tomorrow--

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:36.300
RETO MEIER: All week.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.000
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
All week, yeah.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.820
Our focus is going to be around
how to make developers

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.400
more efficient.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.600
This goes back to your first
question about why are we

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.380
doing an IDE.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.990
Well, we want you to be more
efficient and more tailored

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.040
tools for you.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.330
And we want you to be more
efficient so that you can run

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.490
a more efficient business
and things like that.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.700
So a lot of what we do--

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.380
Google Play services, also
similar things, bringing the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.950
power of Google into
your application--

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.810
it's all about that.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.700
Making developers more
productive, making it a

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.690
fruitful business
for everyone.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.460
I think that's where the
growth is going to be.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.110
RETO MEIER: Very nice.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.820
And it happens that tomorrow
is all about business.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.220
All the Google Play sessions are
going to be all tomorrow.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.800
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
That's cool.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.400
RETO MEIER: There should be some
really exciting stuff for

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.930
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: By the way,
I was really excited by

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.920
the developer console stuff that
Elie showed yesterday.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.319
RETO MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.044
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: That stuff
is really cool-- the

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:20.959
translations, and the staged
rollouts, and all that stuff.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.170
RETO MEIER: Yeah, it's been
really impressive

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.260
working with that team.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.340
Because we're on developer
relations, we're right on that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.755
cutting edge.

00:04:25.755 --> 00:04:28.100
And to see Elie and her team
come in and really engage with

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.430
developers and find out,
what do they want?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.860
Let them get yelled at for a
little while instead of me.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.070
It's kind of nice.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.220
They actually can do something
about it, which is fantastic.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.330
So it's really exciting.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.903
HUGO BARRA: How do you feel
about all the things that

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.800
you've been asking us to do
for the last three years

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.270
suddenly starting to
come to fruition?

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.220
RETO MEIER: It's kind of nice.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.250
HUGO BARRA: You're going
to have to come up

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.695
with some new ones.

00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:45.020
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.750
RETO MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.930
And that's why we've got
Office Hours upstairs.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.200
It's been great to finally be
able to talk to some of the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.990
people who have come to I/O year
after year and are asking

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.660
us these things.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.460
And we can finally say, well,
yeah, actually we launched it.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.610
What else do you want?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.430
Changes the conversation.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.660
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: What
else do people want?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.480
RETO MEIER: What else
do people want?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.660
They want all kinds of things.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.395
I think it's really more
along the same lines.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:09.390
I think people want to have
richer tools, particularly

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.210
around design.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.780
I think that's one of the most
exciting elements of Android

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.290
right now, and mobile, and
computing in general, is

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.190
trying to move beyond apps which
do what you want them to

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.950
do to apps which are delightful
and create this

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.640
experience that people
really love.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.120
Which leads me into
another question.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.180
What are some of the Android
apps that you guys love from a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.790
design perspective?

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.830
We have design all
afternoon today.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.570
We're talking about design,
telling people what they

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.780
should be doing.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.790
Do you have any apps that you've
been playing with which

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.740
really encapsulate that spirit
of design that you'd

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.674
like to call out?

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:39.430
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: All the apps
that I'm using right now

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.820
are pre-release stuff that I'm
really excited about, but I

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.630
probably shouldn't say.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.110
I'll get in trouble.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.810
I'm really excited about
a lot of the designs

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.175
that are coming up.

00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:48.660
Existing apps, I don't know.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.200
You're a big app fan.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.540
RETO MEIER: You've always got
the cool stuff, Hugo.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.130
HUGO BARRA: I'm a pretty
big fan of Currents.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.100
I'm a pretty big fan of
the new music app

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.860
with the new design.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.020
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, All Access?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.890
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.760
HUGO BARRA: I'm a pretty big fan
of Hangouts, because it's

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.030
very focused on just very quick
messaging, and things

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.240
get out of the way.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.150
But it still has some cool
features like the parallax

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.210
when you slide the compose
panel over the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.810
conversation list.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.080
But Play Store is my
current number one.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.230
I'm actually completely in love
with the new Play Store

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.865
experience, particularly on
my Nexus 7, actually.

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.540
RETO MEIER: They've done a
really great job there.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.690
You mentioned the
Nexus 7 as well.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.100
So I think tablets are something
which represent a

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.450
huge opportunity, I think,
for developers.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.710
Are there any tips that you
guys would suggest, as big

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.340
tablet users, for developers who
are just sort of starting

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.930
to make that transition into
building apps for tablets--

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.360
sort of guidance that you might
want to suggest to them?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.830
HUGO BARRA: Well, I would
say, first of

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.740
all, look at the data.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.400
It's pretty clear to everyone
now that Android tablets are

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.090
in a major tear.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.990
If you look at the data that
we've released, the data that

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.170
comes from third parties,
it's pretty insane.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.140
And the tablet explosion,
curiously, is not US-centric,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.815
like the initial smartphone
explosion was.

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:08.260
It's actually happening
all over the world.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.440
So as a developer, I would think
very carefully about the

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.140
markets that I could
go into first.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.090
But there are markets like
Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia,

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.030
where more than 50% of the
tablets that are sold, from

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.860
what we hear, are
Android tablets.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.650
So clearly, these are
exploding markets.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.090
And in these countries, what's
really interesting is that a

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.550
tablet is actually sometimes
the only computer that a

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.140
person has.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.860
It's actually very common.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.120
So I think there's a lot of
opportunity there that

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.770
developers aren't yet attuned
to, and which I think they

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.140
should take a closer look at.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.610
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: And really,
tactically, I think

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.870
following the tablet design
guidelines, you saw yesterday

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.630
that we're starting to do some
stuff with that now, with the

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.860
targeting where all apps
are designed for

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.780
tablets in Play Store.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.285
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:53.950
RETO MEIER: You do
the right thing.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.530
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Exactly.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.310
So following those guidelines
actually has some merit now.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.960
There's some benefit to you.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.550
RETO MEIER: Can actually
see it.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.450
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.160
So I think that's a really
tactical thing that developers

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.560
should start doing.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.360
RETO MEIER: So the transition
has been from more and more

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.120
powerful smartphones to we've
started to see tablets.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.330
So do you think we've kind of
started to plateau now in

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.850
terms of that rapid growth
around mobile technology?

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.550
Or do you think there's
still more to come?

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.730
Are we going to see new
features in chip sets?

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.300
Are we going to see new
sorts of devices?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.231
Or are we kind of done now we
got phones and tablets?

00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:22.680
What do you think?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.410
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I
think we're just at

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.760
the beginning, honestly.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.040
I'm excited about
all the sensors

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.730
that could be in your--

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.530
I think Larry talked about
this yesterday, right?

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.549
All the sensors that could be
combined and put into phones

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.179
in a more battery
efficient way.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.480
New kinds of use cases that we
haven't even imagined yet.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.260
I don't know what they are.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.150
That's Hugo's job to figure
this stuff out.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.039
HUGO BARRA: You get
the easy job.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.880
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I think
we're just getting started.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.990
HUGO BARRA: We're just
getting started.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.540
Sundar opened with some cool
lines yesterday in his keynote

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.850
speech where he was talking
about 900 million Android

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.210
devices activated, but then 7
billion people in the world.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.510
And you look at markets that
are growing so quick, like

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.430
India for example.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.220
He didn't specifically break out
India, but India has less

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.450
than 2% of penetration from
an Android perspective.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.910
So less than 2 out of
maybe 100 people

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.520
actually have an Android.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.640
And it's a booming economy, so
it's obviously clear that that

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.460
market is going to do so well.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.880
So we haven't even scratched
the surface I think is

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.400
probably the way to look at it
from the point of view of

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.590
growth worldwide.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.750
So I really think that there's
a lot more to come.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.730
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
there's growth.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.130
But there's also, I think,
technically just so much more

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.540
that could happen.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.614
Even just a few years ago, you
couldn't have imagined some of

00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:32.500
the things we're doing today.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:32.730
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.400
I remember when you guys put
a barometer into the zoo.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.810
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
that's right.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.670
RETO MEIER: That's
interesting.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.360
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Exactly.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.740
RETO MEIER: So seeing what
developers can come up with

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.910
more newer sensors.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.590
Particularly some of the stuff
around location has been

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.470
really, really exciting.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.610
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.870
And the Google Play services,
those APIs, the location APIs

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.810
that Hugo talked about.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.340
RETO MEIER: So I think we're
just about ready to wrap up.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.580
So I wanted to ask you, flip it
around, go the other way.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.510
So we're talking about
the future.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.350
Android's been around for about
5 years now, thousands

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.390
of devices.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.020
What's your all time
sentimental

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.800
favorite Android device?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.430
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: For me, it's
got to be the G1, because

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.400
that's what started it all.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.560
That's old school, but that's
what really started it.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.140
And it had that wacky fold
out display, which was a

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.760
real pain to build.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.975
But HTC did a great
job, I think.

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:14.780
And just a lot of sentimental
value for me.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.940
I don't know about you.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.240
HUGO BARRA: For me, it's
got to be the Droid.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.192
Droid.

00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:22.851
Because that's when we came
out with voice search and

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:25.900
turn-by-turn navigation and
all those cool things in a

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.820
really, really big way.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.230
So I think to me, that was the
big water divider from an

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.180
adoption perspective.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.400
RETO MEIER: I remember when we
were dogfooding the Droid.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.890
So you had 100 people on the
floor in building 44, and

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.500
every two seconds,
Droid, Droid.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:41.780
Yeah.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.690
And for me, it was the same--
the Droid and the Nexus 1.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.820
Because I gave away a bunch of
Nexus 1s at that point to

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.880
developers to help get
them kick started.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.070
And so yeah, that has a special
place in my heart.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.150
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
That's cool.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.280
RETO MEIER: Well, thank you guys
very much for taking time

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.040
out of your busy schedules
to chat to us on Google

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.640
Developers Live.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.980
Congratulations again,
and good luck for

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.200
Android in the future.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.520
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Thank you.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.870
Likewise.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.840
HUGO BARRA: Thanks
for having us.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.090
RETO MEIER: Thank you.
