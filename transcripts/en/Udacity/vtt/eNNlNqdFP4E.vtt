00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.770
Now that we have discussed a few foundational aspects

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.410
of software architectures, and we have looked at some real

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.900
world examples that help us to illustrate some of these

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.560
points, to discuss some of these aspects. I want to

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.730
introduce and define the different elements that compose a software

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.700
architecture and also talk about architectural styles. So let's start

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.190
by discussing a software architecture's

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.880
elements. A software system's architecture

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.690
typically is not, and should not be, a uniform monolith.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.770
On the contrary, an architecture should be a

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.910
composition and interplay of different elements. In particular,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.510
as we quickly mentioned at the beginning of

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.970
the lesson, there are three main types of elements

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.160
in an architecture. Processing elements, data elements, and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.580
interaction elements. Processing elements are those elements that implement

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.260
the business logic and perform transformations on data.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.760
Data elements, also called information or state, are those

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.180
elements that contain the information that is used

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.440
and transformed by the processing elements. And finally,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.030
the interaction elements are the glue that holds

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.760
the different pieces of the architecture together. Now,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.030
the processing elements and the data are contained

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
into the system components, whereas the interaction elements

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.900
are maintained and controlled by the system connectors.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.100
And components and connectors get all cooked together

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.980
into a systems configuration, which models

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.940
components, connectors and their relationships. So

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.850
now, let's look at components, connectors

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.770
and configurations in a little more detail.
