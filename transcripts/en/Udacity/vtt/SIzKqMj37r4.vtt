00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.469
Let's take a deeper look at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and that's the need to

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.729
belong. Humans have a need for social contact and belonging, and this is both

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:13.816
powerful and universal. Indeed, as we've said throughout the course, humans are

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:18.409
social creatures and we need interaction. Perhaps remember the lesson on

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:23.625
development with Terry Harlow and his research with the baby monkeys. Those

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.017
monkeys needed contact comfort, and they chose among them the most resemble

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:27.842
their own over the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.592
mother, even though she had the food. Now, we too as humans have a need for

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:37.362
others in order to thrive, and this need for social contact and belongingness

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.780
is called the need for affiliation.
