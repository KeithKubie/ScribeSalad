00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.170
Now, recall in the previous lecture, I
talked about the whole process of how we

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.790
think corners are an important
type of a feature.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.070
And we actually looked
at this entire equation,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.740
that basically gave us a way of looking
over an image by shifting it and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.160
using that shifting to be
able to find a corner.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.240
And again,
these were shifting the gradients.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.770
Being able to move an image or
move a region over and

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.440
seeing if there's a change
in different directions, and

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.880
we computed all kinds of
information to support it.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.100
So use it in this equation for
corner detection.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.940
Just leverage the quadratic
approximation,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.060
using the Taylor Expansion which
gives us another equation.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.090
Which results in this simpler form,
and again it's not in a matrix and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.850
vector form.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.570
And M is the matrix that we
now actually want to compute,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
because that'll allow us to do the
computations that we wanted to do here.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.501
Just recall again,
M is the second moment matrix,

00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:00.854
computed from an image using
derivatives Ix and Iy.

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.226
So again, we compute
the derivatives of an image and

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:07.842
using that we can actually
now compute a moment matrix.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:11.680
And that allows us to now do this
computation in a much simpler manner.
