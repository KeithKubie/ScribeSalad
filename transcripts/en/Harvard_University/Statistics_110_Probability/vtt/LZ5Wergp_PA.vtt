00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:04.786
So I wanted to do one of the most famous
problems in probability to start with, and

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:07.663
then we'll go back into
the non-naive definition.

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:11.723
At the very end of last time,
we started the non-naive definition,

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:14.176
so we'll get back to that in a little bit.

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:19.149
But first, this is a problem that
everyone who studies probability

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.960
should be familiar with,
that's called the Birthday Problem.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.910
It's a very natural problem,
some of you have seen it, I'm sure.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.212
But it's very,

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:34.895
very surprising to most people the first
time that they see this result.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.724
Even if you've seen it before,

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:40.062
I wanted to talk more about how
to think about the problem.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:44.025
So the Birthday Problem
is very simple to state.

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:48.997
The problem is just, you have a group
of people at a party, or something.

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:53.753
And you wanna know how likely is it
that two people have the same birthday.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.049
Maybe three people will
have the same birthday,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.850
maybe there are several pairs
that have the same birthday.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.244
But how likely is it that you can
find at least one pair of people who

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.613
share the same birthday?

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.356
Because, of course, if it's a large party,
then no one would be surprised.

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:09.596
But if it's a small number of people,

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:13.382
most people would think that
that's a pretty big coincidence.

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:17.576
All right, okay, so we wanna know,
for example, we might want to ask.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:22.065
How many people do you need in order to
have at least a 50/50 chance that two

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:24.184
people will have the same birthday?

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.400
We want to answer questions like that,
okay?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.383
So that's called the Birthday Problem.

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:33.601
So just to state it in general,
let's say we have K people, and

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:38.827
we wanna find the probability
that two have the same birthday.

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:41.308
Not a specific two, of course, but

00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:45.378
in that group that you can find
two with the same birthday.

00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:50.758
Well, we need to make
a few assumptions about

00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:56.291
birthdays before we can
actually solve this.

00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.080
Was anyone here in this room
born on a February 29th?

00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:04.502
Okay, you were?

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:09.852
Yeah, okay, well, will you be
offended if I exclude February 29th?

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:10.768
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:14.896
we have permission to exclude
February 29th, it's a hassle.

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:17.788
We can do this problem dealing with
leap years if we really want, but

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:18.510
it's a hassle.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.574
February 29th is less likely
than any other day, so

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.378
I don't want to treat it
as 366 days in a year.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:28.570
But, we want to use 365, it's not
gonna make that much of a difference,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.336
it's pretty rare,
we have a large enough class.

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:35.106
At this point, you know how to compute the
probability that at least one person in

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.611
this room has February 29th.

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.871
Now we know the probability is one,
but before that, we didn't know.

00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.676
You can compute that probability if
you know how many people are here,

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:44.849
it's a large class.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.157
Okay, well, anyway, but
I got permission to exclude February 29th,

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:52.364
so we're gonna assume
there's 365 days in a year.

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:58.574
Just for simplicity, and
we're gonna assume that the other-

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:06.527
365 days- Are equally likely.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.368
So, I mean,
that seems like a plausible assumption,

00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:25.280
it sounds plausible to assume
the other 365 days are equally likely.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.047
That's an empirical question,
on a mathematical question,

00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:28.940
is that true or not?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.671
If you look at data on this,
it's actually not exactly true.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:36.901
There are seasonal effects,
which kind of strangely differ, and

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:40.539
different countries have
different seasonal effects.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.539
There are more babies born nine
months after a holiday, and

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.544
you can try to figure out why.

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:52.774
Not a huge difference, but
there are some small differences.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.716
But anyway, we're gonna assume
they're equally likely, okay?

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:58.687
And we're also gonna assume independence.

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:04.358
Later we're gonna talk more about
the formal definition of independence,

00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:07.378
I'm gonna say independence of births.

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:10.383
Later we'll talk more about the formal
definition of independence, but

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.424
right now I just mean that
in the intuitive sense.

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:15.500
Like, for example,
if we knew that in this group of K people,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.830
if we knew that we had twins,
then that's going to change things.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.174
But we assume that everyone,

00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:23.203
one person's birthday has no
effect on anyone else's birthday.

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:27.559
So using the word independent
kind of in an intuitive way here.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:33.207
So those are our assumptions, and
now we want to find the probability.

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:37.460
Well, a lot of the challenge of this
course is recognizing pattern and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.765
structure, right?

00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:42.498
And this problem sounds like
something we haven't done, but

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:46.674
it should start reminding you of
some of the homework stuff, right?

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:51.344
The courses, the robberies, this is
pretty similar to the robberies problem.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:56.555
Just a different application, different
setting, but it has a similar structure.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:05:01.070
So, therefore, you're all kind of
experts at this kind of problem now, and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.676
I can do it pretty quickly.

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:07.340
Okay, so, first of all,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.428
if K is greater than 365,

00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:17.521
then the probability is 1.

00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:22.279
To visualize that, we can think of this as
like a balls and boxes kind of thing, but,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.239
remember, I was talking
last time about labeling?

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.815
We should think of these
people as labeled from 1 to K,

00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:31.410
we're not going to treat people as
indistinguishable particles, right?

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.748
They're people,
they have individuality, okay?

00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:39.487
So if I want to draw a picture, I'm gonna
draw 365 boxes, but I'll put a dot,

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:42.999
dot, dot, so
I don't actually have to draw 365 boxes.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.964
This is the January 1st box, or
bucket, or whatever you wanna call it,

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:50.214
this is the January 2nd one,
this is the December 31st.

00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:55.774
So imagine I have these 365 boxes,
and then each person,

00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:59.820
I'm assuming that the people are labeled.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.674
But I'm just gonna put dots for now.

00:06:03.674 --> 00:06:08.396
So this would be the case where three
people are born on January 1st.

00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:13.684
One on January 2nd, two on December 31st,
and however many are in between there.

00:06:13.684 --> 00:06:17.768
So we'd imagine a situation like this,
okay.

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:22.532
Now if you have more than 365 people but
you only have 365 boxes,

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:27.161
then clearly there must be a box
with more than one dot in it, right?

00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.458
Does that seem like intuitively obvious?

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:32.101
There's more people than
boxes in that case,

00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:37.001
that's called the Pigeon Hole Principle
in math, it's a very simple fact, right?

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:43.271
If you have more dots than boxes then you
have to have a box with multiple dots,

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:47.427
but it's a useful principle,
simple but useful.

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:54.775
And okay, so that's the answer
when K is bigger than 365.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:56.202
And I also wanted to mention,

00:06:56.202 --> 00:07:00.213
by the way, that this kind of problem is
extremely important in computer science.

00:07:00.213 --> 00:07:04.202
Because often you have problems
where you have to have clever ways

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:07.840
of storing information in
the different data structures.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.176
And problems happen when two things
try to store them in the same way,

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.476
that's called a collision.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:19.451
And you wanna know what's the probability
they are gonna have collisions like that.

00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:24.173
So it's a fun problem to talk about, but
it also has a lot of application in CS and

00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:25.947
engineering and elsewhere.

00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:29.623
Okay, well, that was an easy
problem of Ks bigger than 365, but

00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:32.025
now let's do K less than or equal to 365.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.583
Now I've asked a lot of people,
over the years,

00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:46.232
I've asked a lot of people who have
never seen this problem to just guess.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:50.826
Just to guess intuitively, how many
people would you need in order to have

00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:54.099
a 50/50 chance that there
is a birthday match?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.594
A typical guess is like, 150 or 180,

00:07:57.594 --> 00:08:02.794
maybe take 365 divided by two,
definitely well over 100.

00:08:02.794 --> 00:08:06.160
Everyone I've ever asked this question
to If they hadn't seen it before,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.670
it says something over 100.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.561
Okay, so
that's the intuition of almost everyone on

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.723
this before they've studied it.

00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:17.635
The answer is 23.

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:24.903
So that says if you have 23 people,
here we have hundreds in this room.

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:27.110
Just take a couple rows here.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.440
I'm not gonna spend 20 minutes
surveying all your birthdays.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.780
But if we just took a few rows here,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.560
it's extremely likely that there's
gonna be a birthday match.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.318
So we want to just see mathematically,

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.426
first of all we want to see
mathematically, how do you compute that?

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:43.570
And then secondly, what's the intuition?

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.620
How can it be 23 when there
are 365 days in a year?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.815
But if you have 23 people,
which is a small fraction of 365,

00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.657
why is it already 50 50?

00:08:53.657 --> 00:08:59.949
It's slightly over 50 50, I think it's
like 50.7% chance if you have 23 people.

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:03.670
Okay, so
let's find the probability of a match.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.890
Now, it's a little bit easier to
work with the compliment first, so

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.050
let's find the probability of no match.

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:17.180
Then we can always do 1 minus that to get
the probability that there's at least

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.430
one match.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.246
So that's often a useful strategy.

00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:23.035
You want to think about, is it easier
to find the probability of the event or

00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:24.156
the complement of the event?

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:26.830
In this case,
it's easier to do the complement.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.720
Now this is really similar to homework,
so I'll just do this quickly.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.380
We're just gonna use the naive
definition of probability

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.390
that's justified because I
assumed equally likely, okay?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.840
So the denominator, we immediately
know the denominator is 365 to the k.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.930
It's just immediate from
the multiplication rule.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.220
Numerator is just,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.570
imagine the people coming in, assume that
we've given each person an ID number, and

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.760
imagine that they're coming to the party
one by one, in order of their ID number.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.180
That's the easiest way to think about it.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.930
The first person could have
any birthday that is in 365.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.460
Second person could have any birthday
that's not the same as the first person,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.430
so that's 364.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.910
Multiplication rule again.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.890
So this is very, very straightforward
from what we've done already.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.750
The next person could be any
birthday except the first two.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.780
So 363 and so on, so you just multiply.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.520
And then the only thing you have to be
careful about is to make sure we have

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.840
the correct number of terms here.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.400
If k equals 1,
the probability of no match should be one,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.610
because there's only one person
that there's no one to match with.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.504
So this is going to be 365- k + 1.

00:10:34.504 --> 00:10:37.232
It would be really messed
up if we forget the + 1.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:41.601
That's another one of the most common
mistakes in programming is to be off by

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:44.618
one and not being careful
about the number of terms.

00:10:44.618 --> 00:10:48.780
So I wanna have k terms here,
because there are k people.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.467
So that's gonna be 365- k + 1.

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:55.640
Okay, so the probability
of a match is 1 minus that.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.920
So we're already done with the problem.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.810
So this is easy.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.085
I did it quickly because you've
done similar stuff at this point.

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:07.958
Well, there are ways to compute this
to approximate this in terms of

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.326
an exponential and

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:14.211
we'll talk about some of
the approximations in the later lecture.

00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:16.979
But for now, this is something
obviously you wouldn't do by hand, but

00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:20.020
something you could do very easily
on a computer or a calculator.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.501
And if you do the computation, what you
get for the probability of a match.

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:33.942
In a few cases, well, as I mentioned,

00:11:33.942 --> 00:11:37.481
it's a little above 50%.

00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:38.850
So this is 50.7% if k = 23.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:47.414
So that's the first case
where it exceeds 50%.

00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:50.961
Now, let's just look at
a couple other cases.

00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:55.767
If k = say, 50, so
little more than double of 23,

00:11:55.767 --> 00:12:00.170
so obviously it's gonna mean more likely.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.299
The question now is how much more likely?

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:06.589
Well, if you do the computation,
you'll find that with 50 people,

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:08.250
there's a 97% chance.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.350
So it goes way up.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.793
Now 50 people, again,

00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:15.990
most people's intuition was that with 150
people it's still not even gonna be 50 50.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.625
This says that with only 50,
not 150, it's 97% likely.

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:23.350
And suppose that we had 100 people.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:32.577
Well, 100 is a fairly large number, but
it's still less than a third of 365.

00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:34.610
It's not an enormous number.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:39.798
With 100 people, it's 99.999 something,

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:44.430
I'll just say, greater than 99.999%.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.185
I think it's 99.9994, but maybe there's
another 0 in there or something.

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:51.732
It's at least 99.999% likely,
with 100 people.

00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:56.666
Okay, so
that's the result of the birthday problem.

00:12:56.666 --> 00:13:04.420
But, mathematically, this is basically
something that's hard to argue with.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.808
If anyone wants to argue, feel free,
but your argument will be futile.

00:13:08.808 --> 00:13:10.393
This is-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:13:10.393 --> 00:13:12.830
&gt;&gt; This is unobjectionable, but

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.680
it's not that intuitive yet, how could.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.510
This is just correct, and
you've done similar problems now, but

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.575
how could it get 100
people 99.999% likely?

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:26.508
Well, how could that be?

00:13:26.508 --> 00:13:29.850
So I want to talk a little
more about the intuition.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:38.922
The basic intuition is that
looking at K is intuitive.

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:40.316
It's just like how many people.

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:43.990
That's actually not the most
relevant quantity here.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.418
The more relevant quantity is not K,
but K choose 2.

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:53.437
There are K people, but
there are K choose 2 pairs of people.

00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:56.758
So that's the more relevant
thing to be looking at.

00:13:56.758 --> 00:14:00.754
K choose 2 is K(K- 1)/2.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.716
And, for example, if we do 23, choose 2.

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:10.267
So we said that it's just about
50% if you have 23 people.

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:16.691
23 choose 2 is 23 times 22 divided by 2,
23 times 11.

00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:19.619
Does everyone know how to
easily multiply by 11?

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:22.582
Add the 2 and the 3 and
then put it in the middle 253.

00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:28.022
Okay, so with 23 people,
there are 253 pairs of people and

00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:32.680
now it's sounding a little more plausible,
I think.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.885
23 is a fairly small number but 253,
that's a lot of possible pairs.

00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:42.860
Any one of those pairs,
they may have the same birthday, right?

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.412
So now this is getting
closer to the order of 365,

00:14:46.412 --> 00:14:49.824
where it seems more
plausible at that point, so.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.928
We'll come back to, later in the course,
some more complicated versions of this.

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:02.990
So this one is straightforward
at this point.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.677
But suppose we asked another question,
because we're talking about

00:15:07.677 --> 00:15:12.364
coincidences and if two people have
birthdays that are one day apart,

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.633
they also might find that
a bit of a coincidence.

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:17.856
It's not as surprising as
having the same birthday but

00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:20.043
it's like,
my birthday is the day after yours.

00:15:20.043 --> 00:15:22.920
That's a little bit surprising.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.530
So, if we asked the same question,
where instead of saying

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.360
they have to have the same birthday,
it's the same or off by one.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.109
Then the 23 reduces to 14.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.870
And that again surprises most people,
I think.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.920
With 14 people,
there's a better than 50 50 chance

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.720
that two of them have the same birthday or
just one day apart.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.800
Now if you wanna prove that,
that result about the 14,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.850
it's much more complicated than this.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.767
You can try to do this, and say, well,
this should be 363 instead of 362, or

00:15:56.767 --> 00:16:01.268
something, cuz I'm avoiding that day and
the day before and the day after,

00:16:01.268 --> 00:16:05.660
so I guess you'd try to subtract 3
from that but then, it doesn't work.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.446
Because you're like filling in the year
and you kind of have these gaps.

00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:12.880
You can't just multiply all this
That's a much harder problem, and

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.970
later in the course,

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.830
we'll come back to ways to approximate
more complicated problems like that.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.940
So the basic idea here is coincidences,
there's a saying

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.910
that the biggest coincidence of all would
be if there were no coincidences, right.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.240
If you think of all the possible
coincidences that there could ever be

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.948
in the world.

00:16:32.948 --> 00:16:36.740
There's a mind-boggling number
of possible coincidences, so

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.390
some of them are gonna happen.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.210
And what this is saying is,
it's only 23 people,

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.520
that's 253 coincidences that
could have occurred, right?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.186
So it's not at all surprising, all right,
so that's the birthday problem.

00:16:49.186 --> 00:16:52.910
And I also wanted to mention,
there's a very nice applet.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:58.126
There's a link on the course website
with probability by surprise applets

00:16:58.126 --> 00:17:02.940
developed at Stanford, that you may
want to play around with later.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.980
It kind of helps to build intuition, I
think, by running a little simulation, or

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.840
you can easily find birthday
problem applets online.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.000
Try it for yourself,
run some little simulations,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.200
and just see how the matches are coming.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.190
Cuz it still seems, only 23 people,
but you can start to build

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.090
some intuition that way, but
that's one way to think of it, all right?

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.060
So that's the birthday problem, so

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.190
now let's come back to the non-naive
definition of probability.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.500
And I'll just remind you, cuz we only did
it quickly, and it's easy to state again.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.100
We only need two axioms, one, so

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.975
we're defining this, remember,
we have the sample space.

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:52.670
And we have a function P, P stands for
probabilities, pretty good notation, okay?

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:58.170
And there are only two axioms, one is that
probability of the empty set is 0, and

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.860
the probability of the full
sample space equals 1.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:09.600
And secondly,
this says that the empty set is an event.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.680
If you're not yet
clear on how to think of events as sets,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.320
then you really wanna master
that as soon as possible.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.040
The empty set is an event, but

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.190
it's an event that can never occur,
we give it probability 0.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.230
The full sample space is an event
that always occurs, it's guaranteed.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:30.570
So, just by convention, we say we want for
impossible events to have probability 0.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.774
And events that are certain, we want to
have probability 1, by convention, okay?

00:18:34.774 --> 00:18:38.015
And then there's only one other axiom,

00:18:38.015 --> 00:18:42.030
which is the fact that
the probability of a union,

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:53.760
This could be a finite union where I go
from n = 1 up to m, or up to infinity.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.160
Either way, I'm just going to write it
this way because it's more general.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.010
But you should know that this also
applies in the finite union case.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.320
Equals the sum of P of An,
n = 1 to infinity.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.640
And then there's a very,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.442
very important condition that this
is if the A1 through A2 and so

00:19:14.442 --> 00:19:19.520
on are disjoint events,
that is, they don't overlap.

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:25.930
So that's the key condition and
this should be pretty intuitive.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.870
If you think about a Venn diagram,
this is our sample space s.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.810
And I'm not going to try
to draw infinitely many,

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.340
but let's just draw three events.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.840
So here we have A1, A2, A3,
just three blobs or three ovals.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.400
As a first intuition of probability,
we can think of probability as area.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.430
Later, we'll see more sophisticated ways
to think about it, but that's fine for

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.110
now to just think of it as area.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.440
So suppose that this rectangle, it's
a little too curved to be a rectangle, but

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.000
it doesn't matter.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.990
Suppose that the area of this region is 1,
think of probability as area.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:12.630
Then all it says is that
the union is this, this and this.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.655
The area is this area plus this area,
plus this area, that's it.

00:20:16.655 --> 00:20:20.535
So that's what the whole thing is saying,
and it says we also wanna extend that,

00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:24.065
too, if we have infinitely many of them,
but it's the same idea, okay?

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:28.582
So that's the axiom, these are the axiom,
I'll write the word axioms here, but.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:35.266
It's just, these are the two
conditions that P has to satisfy,

00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:37.920
and this was a big breakthrough.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.268
I mentioned before that a big breakthrough
in probability was to think of it in terms

00:20:42.268 --> 00:20:46.071
of sets and events and unions and
intersections, and things like that.

00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:50.576
And the other big breakthrough
mathematically speaking was just writing

00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:52.035
down these two axioms.

00:20:52.035 --> 00:20:56.589
And exploring that Kolmogorov was
a famous mathematician is one of

00:20:56.589 --> 00:21:00.250
the people most responsible for this.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.690
Because before we just had these axioms,
it was harder to

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.510
say what's a correct argument in probably,
what's an incorrect argument.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:15.120
There were a lot of philosophical debates
about, what is the meaning of probability?

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.490
And those debates continue to this day,

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.380
those debates in philosophy have
continued for hundreds of years.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.050
And I think, in statistics,
it's important to think about

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.930
these foundational issues, right,
what does probability really mean?

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.990
Okay, in the real world it's important,
but

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.040
that's not the main subject for
this course.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.480
And it didn't lead to as much
progress as just having these rules.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.550
Because basically,
from a mathematical point of view,

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:49.330
as long as you have a sample space, and
you a function P satisfying this and this.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.270
And you know P is a function
that takes events as input and

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.940
returns a number between 0 and
1, satisfies this and this.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.890
As long as that's true,
then we consider P a probability, and

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.310
every theorem about probability
that we do then is applicable, and

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.920
we don't have to worry
what does it really mean.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.494
Okay, there are different interpretations
of probability that people can debate and

00:22:11.494 --> 00:22:12.378
people can use.

00:22:12.378 --> 00:22:15.942
But as long as the interpretation
satisfies this and this,

00:22:15.942 --> 00:22:17.240
then we'll be okay.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.484
So, just from these two simple rules,

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:23.770
we can derive every theorem that's
ever been derived about probability.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.245
Okay, so
let's start with something simple, so

00:22:28.245 --> 00:22:32.972
let;s just develop some simple
consequences of these axioms.

00:22:32.972 --> 00:22:41.081
So let's start with something that
should also be very intuitive,

00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:45.500
so I'll just call this properties.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.654
Some properties of probability that we
can develop quickly using these axioms,

00:22:50.654 --> 00:22:53.470
okay, so
our first one is very very simple.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:03.870
The probability of A complement
equals 1 minus the probability of A.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.725
Okay, so we've already used this
fact before because this fact is

00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:13.950
something you can see immediately in
the case of the naive definition.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.710
Because we are looking at favorable and
unfavorable.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.380
So the total number of outcomes
equals number of favorable,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.480
plus number of unfavorable.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.410
This is always true,
whether using the naive definition or not.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:31.810
In the picture, it should be intuitively
clear because, let A1 equal A.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.760
A complement is everything that's
outside of A1, or outside of A, okay?

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.820
If the total area is 1, then if
this is 0.3, outside has to be 0.7.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.580
So that's intuitively obvious,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.710
once you look at the Venn diagram,
but how do we prove it?

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.570
Well, the proof is very short as well,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.896
we know that 1 equals
the probability of the whole space.

00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:02.870
That's axiom one, okay,

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.790
we also know that we can write
s as A union A complement.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.690
s is the same thing as A cuz
that's everything that's inside A,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.930
that's everything that's outside A.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.870
Put those together,
that's everything, okay, now.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.470
P of A union A compliment is P
of A plus P of A compliment,

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.860
because A and A compliment are disjoint.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.150
In set notation, we'd write that as just
saying that there intersection is empty.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.320
There's nothing that could be in A and
its compliment by definition.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.500
So, they're disjoined,
so I'm using axiom two.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.400
That equals that plus that and that's
the same thing we were trying to do.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.510
So the proof is just the media for use
axiom one, use axiom two and we're done.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.230
All right, so that's property one,
I'm calling it,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.150
no one else calls it property one,
but property one for today.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:00.010
Property two, another useful fact

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.480
if a is contained in b so a and

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.460
b are advanced but
this event is inside this event.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.890
In words we would say that what
this relationship means is that

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.430
If A occurs, then B occurs, okay?

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.050
So this is a larger event.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.410
Then, P of A is less than or
equal to P of B.

00:25:32.409 --> 00:25:37.125
Again, this is obvious, intuitively in
terms of the Venn diagram because B is

00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:39.995
like a bigger oval
containing the smaller one.

00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:41.205
It has a bigger area.

00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:43.825
That's obvious from the picture.

00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:46.855
But that's not a formal proof and
we want to prove this fact.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.540
Okay so let's just quickly
prove this using the axioms.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.540
So the proof would go, I'm still
going to draw a little picture for

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.150
some intuition here's a and here's b.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.450
B is B is this bigger thing
that contains A, okay?

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.920
Now, I'm going to think of B
as being split into two parts.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.060
There's A, and then there's ring of
stuff that's in B, that's not in A.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.540
Okay?
So, I'm going to decompose B into

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.040
two parts.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:20.800
So I'm gonna think of B as A union,
union with this ring.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.950
This ring is the stuff that's
in B that's not in A, so

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.350
I'd write that as B
intersect A complement.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.300
The stuff that's in B that's not in A,
okay?

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.910
And this is disjoint.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.260
That is A is disjoint from this,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.970
that's just saying that A is
disjoint from this ring.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:49.250
So these are disjoint, so
therefore we know that P(B) = P(A).

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.450
Just immediate from axiom two, P of B is
P of A plus P intersect A complement.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.690
And probability by definition probability
has to be none negative, so you're adding

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:06.450
something here, adding something none
negative so this is at least P of A.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.260
So that's the end of the proof.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.650
So it's just almost immediate from,
from the axiom two, question?

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.000
&gt;&gt; Where did you find
the fact that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.170
&gt;&gt; Probability's not
supposed to be negative.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.090
Well, I didn't write that,
I wrote that yesterday.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.350
P is between,
you could call that an axiom if you want.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.370
In that case, call this axiom zero.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.020
I stated that last time.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.010
I didn't write it again this time.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.770
The reason I didn't write it as one of the
axioms is if you're writing out in full

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.420
you would say, p is a function
from defining known events and

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.370
taking values between zero and
one, such that this and this.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.470
But if you wanna consider that an axiom,
you can.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.369
It's assumed that probability is always
between zero and one, by assumption.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.640
Okay, so those are two simple properties.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.930
Let's do one that's a little
more complicated, and also,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.290
very very very useful.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:08.010
And that's, the question is,
how do we get the probability of a union?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.740
Sorry the boards are pretty squeaky.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:18.210
So this is property three how do
we get the probability of a union?

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.070
Now we know that if a and b are disjoint,
we can just do p(a) + p(b) okay.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:30.520
But if you think about the Venn
diagram again here's B.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.380
And here's the intersection if we

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.350
want the area what we should do is you
add the area of a plus the area of b But

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.680
then we double-counted the stuff
in the intersection, and

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.670
we subtract that off again.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.510
So, we're gonna prove that that is in
fact the correct way to do it, whether or

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.250
not the Venn diagram picture
is applicable or not,

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.950
that suggests the intuition,
and let's prove the result.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.480
And then I'll do an example
of how you use this.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.220
We'll be using this kind of thing a lot.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.030
Because we often want the probability
of a union and we're not necessarily so

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.160
lucky as to have disjoint sets.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.360
So we wanna know what happens
if they're not disjoint.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.080
Okay, and the result is that we
can add up the probabilities, but

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.550
we've double counted the intersections so
we subtract.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.000
The probability of the intersection, okay?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.338
So let's prove that.

00:29:23.338 --> 00:29:29.648
Well again, let's think of it,
kind of the strategy here,

00:29:29.648 --> 00:29:35.961
you know when you're confronted
with a problem like this and

00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:41.405
you don't know how to prove
it A strategy to use would

00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:46.860
be we know we have to
somehow apply these axioms.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.720
But this,
axiom two is the most important one,

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.230
but this only applies
when they're disjoint.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.950
So somehow we have to make
things disjoint, right?

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.960
So that's the strategy.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:04.632
So I'm gonna write P(A union B), In
a different way, right here I can't apply

00:30:04.632 --> 00:30:08.880
axiom two, because they're not disjoint,
so I'm gonna write it in a disjoint way.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.630
I call this disjointification.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.280
And I think I coined that word,
but I don't know.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.930
So we're going to do disjointification.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.990
And I'll write the word, and I'll probably
regret this because it's a long word.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.950
I'll try to write it fast.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.650
So we're gonna do disjointification.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.000
We're gonna take a union b and
we're gonna try to write it disjointly.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.800
So how do we do that?

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:34.640
Well we take A and then we take everything
in B we did not already have in A.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.652
So it's A good union B union
intersect C complement.

00:30:40.652 --> 00:30:45.170
All right, so that looks similar to that.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.760
The only difference is their way we're
assuming that A is contained in B, and

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.520
here this is completely general, A and
B are just any two events, okay?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.120
So that just says we take A, and
then everything in B we need that, but

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.010
we don't need the stuff
that we already had from A.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.390
So we're excluding it.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:05.182
All right, now this and this are
disjoined, so we can immediately apply 2.

00:31:05.182 --> 00:31:09.492
And we get P(A)+ P(B

00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:14.230
intersect A compliment),

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.810
now that's still not yet
clear why is that the same as this?

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.706
So here we use another proof strategy,
that I call wishful thinking.

00:31:24.706 --> 00:31:26.573
So-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:31:26.573 --> 00:31:27.790
&gt;&gt; I wish.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.300
I'm gonna put a question mark here.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.620
It is very very bad practice to just
start writing things you wish as

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.100
equality without justification, But
it's okay if you put a question mark.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.975
Okay?
So I'm gonna put a question mark here.

00:31:40.975 --> 00:31:46.085
P of A plus P of B minus
P of A intercept B.

00:31:48.055 --> 00:31:51.365
I wish this is true.

00:31:51.365 --> 00:31:55.575
Now I know this is true but
I'm pretending yet know this and

00:31:55.575 --> 00:31:58.065
I want to see whether it's true.

00:31:58.065 --> 00:32:00.165
So that's my wish.

00:32:00.165 --> 00:32:03.820
Now I'm going to try to compare this and
this Well,

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.360
let's see P of A is the same
of P of A that's okay.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:13.170
This will be true if and only if this
term is the same as this difference.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:19.780
So this is equivalent to,
I'll just rewrite that as This equals this

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.690
minus this, but it's going to be easier
to write it without the minus signs.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.750
So I'm going to move the P(A
intersect B) over there.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.820
So that's the equivalent of saying

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.214
that P(A intersect B) + P(B

00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:40.640
intersect A complement) = P(B).

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.645
I just said, for this to be true, what we
want is for this to equal this difference.

00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:48.202
And then I just moved that to
the other side of the equation.

00:32:48.202 --> 00:32:53.071
Okay, now we just have to check, is this
true, well, yes it is, this is true.

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:58.212
It's immediate by axiom two because,

00:32:58.212 --> 00:33:05.081
this is true because A intersect B and
A complement.

00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:09.832
And I'll write it this way, A intersect B,
and A complement intersect B,

00:33:09.832 --> 00:33:15.518
are disjoint,
Because if you had an element

00:33:15.518 --> 00:33:20.680
in both of these sets, it would be in both
A and A complement, that's impossible.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.806
So they're disjoint, and their union is B.

00:33:23.806 --> 00:33:32.125
Because what we did was chopped B up into
two parts, we split B into two cases.

00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:36.145
We have the part of B that's in A, and
we have the part of B that's not in A.

00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:41.526
So there's two disjoint cases,
so that's the end of the proof.

00:33:41.526 --> 00:33:46.038
So this rule is a simple case of
what's called inclusion and exclusion.

00:33:48.005 --> 00:33:52.537
And let's do a more general version
of inclusion-exclusion, and

00:33:52.537 --> 00:33:56.360
then I'll talk a little bit
about why it's called that.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.866
And then we'll do an example
of inclusion-exclusion, okay?

00:34:01.866 --> 00:34:06.218
So here's the general inclusion-exclusion
formula, it looks ugly, but

00:34:06.218 --> 00:34:07.783
the idea is pretty simple.

00:34:10.443 --> 00:34:15.732
So I just want to extend that to
the case where we have more than

00:34:15.732 --> 00:34:20.755
two events, so
let's do a case with three of them first.

00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:26.510
P(A union B union C) equals, and
I'll draw another little diagram.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.851
Now we have three events, A, B, and C,

00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:37.240
draw a linking rings kind of thing.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.653
And I want the probability of the union,

00:34:40.653 --> 00:34:43.151
okay, so we're gonna start
out just like we did there.

00:34:43.151 --> 00:34:46.364
By adding the individual probabilities,
and then we're gonna adjust for

00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:48.000
double counting, things like that.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.830
So we're gonna do P(A) + P(B) + P(C).

00:34:54.830 --> 00:35:00.550
But it's clear just from thinking about
the picture that we've added too much,

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.690
right, that we've over-counted stuff.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.970
So what we have to do is
subtract off the intersections.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.692
So we're gonna subtract off A intersect B,
and

00:35:08.692 --> 00:35:13.464
we're gonna subtract off A intersect C,
and we're gonna subtract B intersect C.

00:35:16.617 --> 00:35:19.749
Okay, well, now we've subtracted too much.

00:35:19.749 --> 00:35:22.536
If you think of this,
think carefully about this picture,

00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:26.110
what happened to the stuff
in the triple intersection?

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.320
Any stuff in the triple intersection,
we added it thee times,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.400
then we subtracted it three times,
now we haven't counted it at all.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.190
Everything that's not in the triple
intersection is correctly accounted for.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.830
Stuff that's in the triple intersection,
we have not counted yet.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:47.492
So we fix that just by adding this back,
A intersect B intersect C.

00:35:47.492 --> 00:35:50.635
Okay, so that's inclusion-exclusion, and

00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:53.470
you can prove this in
a similar way to that.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.170
It's more tedious, and
I'm not gonna write out the whole thing.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:02.493
There's also some more clever ways to do
it, that we might come to another time.

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:06.840
It's completely analogous,
just a more tedious version of that, and

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.095
in general, you can use induction.

00:36:09.095 --> 00:36:11.562
And I'm not gonna write
out the whole induction,

00:36:11.562 --> 00:36:14.040
because the idea is exactly
the same as this idea.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:20.624
The general case,
when we have the union of n events,

00:36:23.817 --> 00:36:29.224
The general form of inclusion-exclusion,
If you remember this,

00:36:29.224 --> 00:36:33.680
then it's really easy to write this down,
it looks ugly, but it's the same idea.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:40.910
First we add up the individual events,
then we subtract the intersections.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:47.509
So I'll just write it this way, subtract
i less than j, P(Ai intersect Aj).

00:36:47.509 --> 00:36:51.977
I wrote i less than j because then
we don't have A1 intersect A2, and

00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:55.250
A2 intersect A1,
we only want to have that once.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.740
And then you add the triple, so

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.700
it's alternating,
just like this is plus minus plus.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.190
We then have triple intersections,
let's say i less than k less than j,

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.180
Ai intersect Aj intersect Ak.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.500
Minus, dot dot dot, and then the last
term is the intersection of everything,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.760
and so it's either gonna be a plus or
a minus.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.620
And I think it should be (-1) to the n+1,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:28.020
because if we think about the case when
n is 2, then we stop by subtracting.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.200
And in the case n equals 3,
we stop by adding.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.908
So it's (-1) to the n+1, and
then the intersection of everything, Okay,

00:37:35.908 --> 00:37:40.169
so hopefully you can see kinda what
the intuition is for this, and

00:37:40.169 --> 00:37:42.893
why is it called inclusion-exclusion.

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:46.857
Because, just think of this case with
three of them, we started by including all

00:37:46.857 --> 00:37:50.555
of these, but then we've overcounted,
and so we start excluding stuff.

00:37:50.555 --> 00:37:53.016
But then have to adjust the other way,
so we start including and excluding.

00:37:53.016 --> 00:37:57.187
And it keeps alternating, including and
excluding, and it all works out.

00:37:57.187 --> 00:38:06.430
Okay, here, this one does not have
a summation because there's all n of them.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.380
So this is all of them,
there's only one of these,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.940
the rest of them will have summations.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:17.055
Okay, so let me do one famous
interesting example of

00:38:17.055 --> 00:38:23.111
inclusion-exclusion, how you
can apply this to a problem.

00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:28.427
This is a very old problem,
it goes back to,

00:38:28.427 --> 00:38:34.765
what's the guy's name,
de Montmort's problem.

00:38:38.611 --> 00:38:43.198
Which was from 17 something, I think 1713,

00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:47.380
I wrote it down somewhere, 1713, yeah.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.888
And this goes by different
names in the literature,

00:38:49.888 --> 00:38:52.232
sometimes this is called
the matching problem.

00:38:52.232 --> 00:38:54.906
Usually I'll just call it
the matching problem, or

00:38:54.906 --> 00:38:56.930
I'll call it de Montmort's problem.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.010
I don't actually care if you
know the name of the problem,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.860
I care that you know the concept.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.730
It goes by other names because it's
a pretty natural problem that comes up in

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.710
different contexts.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.730
There are many different ways
we could phrase this problem.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.039
Different forms of the same thing
in different disguises, but

00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:18.003
I'll tell you the original one.

00:39:18.003 --> 00:39:24.178
Not surprisingly, this originated
from considering a gambling game.

00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:28.992
de Montmort was interested in a lot
of different gambling problems.

00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:32.408
In 1713,
probability was still in its infancy, and

00:39:32.408 --> 00:39:35.409
he was studying some of
these gambling problems.

00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:38.566
Which had real practical consequences for
gamblers,

00:39:38.566 --> 00:39:42.860
there's lot of money at stake in this,
that was the motivation.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:50.420
So here's the problem, so
consider the following card game.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.840
We have a deck of cards, now, rather
than thinking like ace of spades and

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.838
7 of clubs, it's simpler to just assume
that the cards are labeled 1 through n,

00:39:59.838 --> 00:40:00.940
so imagine that.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.496
You have a deck of n cards, and each card
just has a number from 1 to n on it, okay?

00:40:05.496 --> 00:40:10.639
One number per card, so
we have n cards labeled 1 through n.

00:40:13.836 --> 00:40:17.390
Here's the problem, so
I'll describe the game.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.460
And I think they actually
played this game back in 1700.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.181
Shuffle the cards, okay.

00:40:27.181 --> 00:40:31.490
Now basically I'm gonna flip
over cards one at a time,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.220
okay, and
you're gonna count from one n, okay.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.990
So I'll flip over
the first card you say one,

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.160
I flip over the second card you say two,
flip over the third card, you say three.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.670
We'll continue that way.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.930
Now if it ever happens that
I flipped over a number and

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.060
you said that same number, you win.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.500
Otherwise, you lose.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.370
That's the game.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.870
That's why I call it matching,
because it's like, you win if for

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:56.970
example the seventh card
is card number seven.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.664
That is, the card that's seventh in the
deck has the number seven written on it.

00:41:00.664 --> 00:41:02.960
Okay, does everyone
understand what the game is?

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.460
So I want to know what the probability
that that will happen,

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:09.170
that there will be at least one
card whose position in the deck

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.530
is the same as the number
written on the card.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.610
So I'm not going to write out that
whole description just now cause

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.240
hopefully you'll understand
what the game is now.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.580
So lets find the probability.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.540
Well, to find the probability,
we need to define some events.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.820
Right?

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.340
By the way you can try, there's more
than one way to solve this problem.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.580
And you can try to do direct methods, but

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.420
it's pretty hard to find a way to do
this without inclusion-exclusion.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.520
Not impossible.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.140
But inclusion-exclusion is the easiest
way to solve this, I think.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.560
And it's also a good example of it.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.970
So, we need to define our events.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:47.930
So, let's say,
let's call it Aj be the event

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:56.910
that, I'll just say it in words,
the event is that card Jth card matches.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.300
In other words, the Jth card in
the deck is numbered as card J.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.010
Okay.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:10.270
So what we are interested in is
the probability of the union.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.317
That is just a mathematical expression for

00:42:18.317 --> 00:42:20.800
the probability that at
least one card matches.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.390
That's probably that you wouldn't win the
game by having at least one match, okay.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.870
So it's pretty hard to do directly but
inclusion,

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.680
exclusion you know it looks kinda ugly.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.880
So I usually try to find,
when I'm trying to solve,

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.540
I usually try to avoid
inclusion exclusion at first.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.540
But if I don't think of another method
then I'm going to try this because it's

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:46.585
just a very powerful general technique for
finding the probability of a union.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.530
Well, we need to do inclusion and
exclusion, right?

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.260
So let's just start writing this out.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.240
Luckily, in this problem,
we have a lot of symmetry.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.140
And we should take advantage
of symmetry whenever we can.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.540
So initially,
I would have to write out this sum.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.980
But actually, the probability of aj.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:17.020
Well let's just kind of do some
kind of scratch calculations.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.032
Do some scratch work over here.

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:27.890
P(Aj), P(Aj) is the probability
that the jth card in the deck

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:33.190
is card j Now you can do this using
a naive definition of probability

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.790
because we're assuming...there's
two ways to think of this.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:39.490
One way would be to have N factorial
as the denominator because we're

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.600
using a naive definition,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.040
we're assuming all permutations
of the deck are equally likely.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.380
So that would be fine, but

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.550
an easier way to think of it
is just that it's one over N.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.200
It's one over n because all
positions are equally likely.

00:43:56.174 --> 00:43:59.300
All positions are equally likely for
the jth card.

00:44:05.162 --> 00:44:08.100
I'll say for the card labeled j.

00:44:13.332 --> 00:44:17.975
Right, so if the card, I'm looking for
the ace of, imagine I have 52 cards and

00:44:17.975 --> 00:44:20.260
I'm looking for the ace of spades.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.390
Ace of spades is equally
likely to be anywhere so

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.460
there's a one in 52 chance
that in any specific position.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.510
So, that's immediately one over n,

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.410
you can also derive this using naive
definition with an n factorial.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.920
Either n minus one factorial over n
factorial, you get the same thing.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.940
Notice this does not depend on j, okay?

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.530
That's what saves us here.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.610
If we had like some complicated
thing involving j and

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.570
n here then we're gonna
have to do a summation.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.900
But there's no j here, so that means
we're just gonna multiply this by n.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.240
All right,
now let's do P of A1 intersect A2.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.400
So I'm using symmetry.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.110
I could have written AI intersect AJ where
I not equal J, but I may as well for

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.690
concreteness pick one and two.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.210
Let's just think about what this is.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.930
Here I will do the naieve definition.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.850
They're N factorial possible
permutations of the deck of cards,

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:15.690
now what is this event say,
it says that the card

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.760
on top of the deck has a one on it,
the card that is second has a two on it.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.220
The other n minus two cards can be
in any order whatsoever, so for

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.340
the rest of them its n
minus two factorial.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:32.240
And we could either leave it this way,
or we can cancel some stuff out and

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.385
write this as one over n(n- 1).

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.840
Because everything else cancels, okay?

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.030
And continuing in this way if
we want P(A1) intersect blah,

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:54.350
blah, blah Intersect, let's say, Ak.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:58.360
Well, what that says is that the first
k cards are exactly one up to k.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.740
The remaining (n- k) cards can
be in any order whatsoever.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.260
So the denominator is still n factorial,
the numerator is n minus k factorial.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.290
All right?

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:14.290
So that looks kind of messy, but
the nice thing is that we have symmetry,

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:20.130
so this will work whatever
choices you put there, okay?

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.010
So now let's just quickly apply inclusion,
exclusion.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.590
We start by adding up these ones,
and there's N of them, so

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.061
it's N times one over N.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.340
Now, we add the next ones.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.240
How many of these are there?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.649
Well, there's N choose two of these terms.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.810
Except we're subtracting now,
because we alternate.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:49.966
And there's n choose two, but I'm gonna
write n choose two as n(n- 1)/ 2,

00:46:49.966 --> 00:46:55.350
times that thing, one / n(n- 1),
so it's one-half.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.908
And well, let's just do one more term,
and then you'll get the idea.

00:46:57.908 --> 00:47:02.560
N choose three,
I can also write it as this way.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.680
N choose three is n(n- 1)(n-
2) over three factorial.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.640
I can think of this as
two factorial if I want.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.920
Times, and then whatever this thing is.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.380
In this case, well,
it looks like n(n- 1)(n- 2).

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.489
So you actually see,
something really nice happens.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.720
Which is you have n and n- 1.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.410
N and N cancels.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.520
n and n- 1 cancels.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.070
n, n- 1,
everything is basically cancelling here.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:38.260
The only thing that's left is these
numbers, this minus dot, dot, dot.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:44.680
So what this then works out to,
it's gonna look like this alternating sum.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.500
But I'll just say what
it is approximately.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:54.676
Is one minus one over two factorial,
plus one over three factorial,

00:47:54.676 --> 00:48:00.770
minus one over four factorial plus blah,
blah, blah.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.180
This is actually equal at this point.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.312
And then the last term
is whatever it is -1 to

00:48:08.312 --> 00:48:12.700
the something over one over n factorial.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.620
Whatever the pattern is for the last one.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.108
Let me make sure I got
the last term right.

00:48:18.108 --> 00:48:24.260
And so yeah so, this is plus negative
one to the n, one over n factorial.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.040
I'm just following the same pattern here.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.060
Okay.
This looks messy.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.220
That's the exact answer.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.450
I know we're out of time, but

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:34.710
this is the end because this we can
immediately say, this looks familiar.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.750
This looks ugly, but
looks familiar." Right?

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.110
This should remind you of
the Taylor series for e to the x.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.260
So, in fact, this is approximately
one minus one over E.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.870
We're going to see this number
one over E a lot in this class.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.680
Seems like this problem has
nothing to do with E, but

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.180
here E comes up just
cause we have this sum.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.360
Okay, so have a good weekend.
