00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.050
Let's say that you don't
like company ABCD that's

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.870
right now trading
for $50 a share.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.287
But you don't have the
stomach to short the stock

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:11.870
because there's a
possibility that you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.710
could lose an infinite amount
of money if you short it.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.000
You still have an option.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.970
Quite literally, you
still have an option.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.190
You can buy a put option.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.060
Once again, we're dealing
with the American variation.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.230
And just like an
American call option,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.550
an American put option
gives you the right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.150
to exercise the option any time
before the expiration date.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.480
A European call
or put option, you

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.590
can only exercise on
the expiration date.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.720
And the situation with a
put option, a call option

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.800
gave you the right to buy the
stock at a specified price.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.470
A put option is the opposite.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.100
It gives you the right to sell
the stock at a specified price.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.810
So this little
made up put option

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.760
I've constructed right here.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.200
It's maybe being sold on an
exchange for $5 per option.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.860
And it gives you the
right to sell company

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.500
ABCD at $40 a share any
time over the next month.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.130
And let's see how, if you were
to buy this, how this really

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.594
is a bet that the
company would go down.

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:20.760
So let's imagine the scenario
where the company does

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.630
what you expect, it goes down.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.554
And one month later, it
just keeps going down.

00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:27.220
You're like, well, I
better use it today

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
because it's going to expire
if I don't use it today.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.820
So you exercise the
option right over there.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.810
And so what this allows you to
do is sell the stock at $40.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.310
And if you don't
own it, that's OK

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.429
because you could go and buy the
stock right now on the market.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.970
You knew it was
going to get cheaper.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.520
So you can buy it for $20,
and then exercise your option

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.930
and sell it for $40.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.530
So you're buying at $20 and
immediately selling for $40.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.250
So you're going
to be making $20.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.970
And then if you
subtract out the price

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.150
that you had to
pay for the option,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.510
you're going to
have a $15 profit.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.350
You're going to have a
$15 profit over here.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.050
Let me scroll over to the
right so you have some space.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.820
And this is, of course, the
situation with the put option.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.340
This is the put option.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.070
And if your bet goes against you
and the stock actually goes up,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.820
it's not going to be
like a short position

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.970
where you can lose an
unlimited amount of money.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.850
In that situation,
let's say the stock just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.850
keeps going up and
up and up and up.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.530
Well at any point
above $40, you're like,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.390
there's no point in me
exercising the option.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.980
So you just let it expire.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.470
So in that situation, you
just wasted your money

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.170
buying the actual option.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.640
So you just lose the actual $5.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.550
Even if that stock were to
go up to a gazillion dollars,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.010
you're not required to
buy it back like you would

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.050
if you were shorting it.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.370
You can just let
the option expire.
