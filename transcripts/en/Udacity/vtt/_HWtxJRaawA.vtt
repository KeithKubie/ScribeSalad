00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.390
Indeed we can see that the prices for diamonds are pretty

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.960
heavily skewed, but when you put those prices on a log

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.029
ten scale, they seem much better behaved. They're much closer to

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.297
the bell curve of a normal distribution. We can even see a

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:15.260
little bit of evidence of bimodality on this log ten scale.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.410
Which is consistent with our two class rich buyer poor buyer

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.540
speculation about the nature of customers for diamonds. You actually saw

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.220
a sneak peek of this in problem set set three when you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.370
looked at the log ten of price by cut.
