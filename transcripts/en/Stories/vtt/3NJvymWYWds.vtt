00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.380
SUBJECT: I think, for
me, being outside,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.979
there's always been
some connection.

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.270
I don't want to be on my phone.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.320
I don't like being in
front of a computer screen.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.230
I like being outside,
and the trees,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.221
and I just feel really at
ease and very happy out there.

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.720
The hardest part
about tree climbing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.514
is definitely getting
the rope in the tree.

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:22.930
As I'm walking
through the forest,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.096
I'm kind of scoping out the
different trees looking,

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.220
how tall they are, and if
there's good branches to climb.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.875
And once I find a nice candidate
tree, I'll get my slingshot,

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.538
and I'll shoot a line over.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.170
It's given me a lot
of opportunities,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590
not just with science,
but also with television.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.630
People want to be able
to film in the canopies.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.070
So I can do rigging for that.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.160
It's also allowed me to
travel around the world.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.394
I've worked in Borneo.

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:47.310
I've worked in Africa.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.682
I've worked in central
South America and Europe.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:52.140
So there's classes
around the world

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.510
you can take that will
teach you how to efficiently

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.264
and safely get into the canopy.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.055
I didn't take them.

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.530
I was drunk in a bar in Panama.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.560
So I just bribed somebody $40.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.010
They showed me how to
do it in 10 minutes.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.960
It's really easy.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.030
You have to understand
the equipment

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.870
and constantly monitor
the usage of it.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.380
So you want to make sure
everything's really safe.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.930
You want to protect your ropes
because every single piece

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.540
that I have is mission critical.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.360
If one piece breaks,
I fall and die.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.526
So it's very important to
really inspect your stuff.

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:22.670
The most common reaction I
get when I'm on a flight,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.460
sitting next to somebody,
and they ask what do I do,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.050
and I tell them I study sleep
in sloths, and I climb trees,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.030
they think it's a joke.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.613
And then I tell them,
no, I'm serious.

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:31.309
And I show them
pictures on my phone,

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:33.850
and they're like, that is the
coolest job I've ever heard of.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.720
And how is that really job,
and how do I get to do that?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.782
INTERVIEWER: What
do you tell them?

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:41.852
SUBJECT: I tell them to
go to bars in Panama.

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.466
I think it's
important that people

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.060
realize they can do whatever
the heck they want to.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.930
So don't just accept
the fact that I'm

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.630
going to have an
office job, and boring.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.130
No.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.900
Do something fun.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.970
You only live once.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.220
Do something awesome.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.890
Once you get 5, 10,15 feet
up, it's really nice and calm.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.827
And you kind of sit down for
a second and look around,

00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.910
and it's really beautiful.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.230
It's really peaceful.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.810
I think people climb
a tree, it makes

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.020
some sort of tangible connection
between them and the outdoors.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.640
It's not just
walking on a trail,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.370
or seeing a picture,
or something.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.575
But actually physically
getting involved in climbing

00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:14.620
and the motion of that
is a powerful thing.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.832
NARRATOR: Please check
out this next video.

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:25.040
SUBJECT: I first started
experimenting with taxidermy

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.950
when I was a little kid.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280
People sometimes
think it's creepy.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
I don't think it's
creepy at all.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.130
NARRATOR: Thanks for watching.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.588
