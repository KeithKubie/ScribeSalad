00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.270
In this segment of the
lecture, we'll examine

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.450
the rules that determine
how long US copyrights last.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.990
You're probably thinking, well,
this will be a short segment.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.230
How complicated can it be?

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.100
The answer, unfortunately,
is quite complicated.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.990
The reason for the complexity is that
the relevant rules in the United States

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.430
have been amended several times.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.350
But the amendments have been
only partially retroactive.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.280
The result is that there are several
subsets of copyrighted works that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920
are governed by different
sets of duration rules.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.420
Here's how I'll try
to untangle this knot.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.812
I'll begin by reviewing the
history of the pertinent laws.

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:03.575
I'll then start over and consider
the impact of that history

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:06.120
on the duration of
different groups of works.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.980
The slide in front of you
should by now be familiar.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.800
This shows the way things worked
under the original version of the 1909

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.410
copyright statute.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.080
As we've seen, the first term of
federal protection lasted for 28 years

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.480
after the date of publication.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.250
If the copyright was
properly renewed, it

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.390
lasted for another 28-year term,
commonly known, for obvious reasons,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.430
as the renewal term.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
Here are a few more details
we have not yet discussed.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.470
The application for renewal
could be filed any time

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.150
during the year preceding the
expiration of the initial term.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.610
If the author was still
alive at that time,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.340
he or she was the person
presumptively entitled

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.470
to apply for and receive
the renewed copyright.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.010
If the author had died, his or
her surviving spouse or children

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.630
could do so.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.830
If there were no
surviving spouse or kids,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.200
the author's executor had the right,
if the author had left a will.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.479
If he or she had not left a
will, then his or her next of kin

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.770
had the renewal right.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.280
A technical point that,
as we'll see later

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.380
had some important practical
effects, the renewal term

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.590
was not thought of as a
continuation of the initial term.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.950
It was said to be a new
term-- a new estate-- that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.970
belonged to the person who
applied for and received it.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.940
With respect to works first published
under the auspices of the 1909 statute,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.320
this basic structure
has remained intact.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.140
But the length and mechanics
of the renewal term

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.170
have been adjusted several times.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.330
In 1976, the renewal term was
extended from 28 to 47 years.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.280
In 1998, as part of the
Copyright Term Extension Act,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.220
it was extended from 47 to 67 years.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.030
In 1992, the renewals of works that at
the time were still in their first term

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.480
was made automatic
rather than voluntary.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.830
The result is that
copyrighted works ceased

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.230
falling into the public domain at the
end of their initial 28-year terms.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.770
The 1976 general reform
of the copyright statute,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.380
which became effective as we've
seen at the start of 1978,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.800
instituted a radically new regime.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.010
As we've seen, works created thereafter
acquired federal copyright protection

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.300
immediately, which lasted for the
life of the author plus 50 years.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.510
The Copyright Term Extension
Act in 1998 extended that term

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.370
to its current duration-- the
life of the author plus 70 years.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.570
Measuring duration by
the life of the author

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.960
would not work for anonymous works,
pseudonymous works, and works for hire,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.760
so these were given
terms of years that were

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.190
meant to approximate the
duration of regular copyrights--

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.020
a century from the
date of creation or 75

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.860
years from first publication,
whichever happened first.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.260
The Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998
also extended those terms by 20 years.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.070
Lurking in these details
are two general themes.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.460
The first, I've already mentioned--
the gradual transition from an opt-in

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.290
to an opt-out system.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.110
The second, probably obvious, is
that copyrights keep getting longer.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.110
They never, even
prospectively, get shorter.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.840
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.700
OK, now let's adopt a precedents stance.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.910
It's 2013, how long
do US copyrights last?

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.990
The answer depends upon
when and how they were born.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.640
More specifically, you
need to differentiate

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.460
five different categories
of copyrighted works.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.030
The simplest group consists of
works published before 1923.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.260
Some of these got the benefit of
the extension of the renewal term

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.270
from 28 to 47 years.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.360
But all of them fell
into the public domain

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.090
before the Copyright Term
Extension Act could rescue them.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.690
And the Copyright Term Extension
Act did not lift them back up.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.620
The upshot is that the copyrights
on these works have expired.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.030
The second category consists of works
published between 1923 and 1963.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.950
These were rescued
before their expiration

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.710
by the Copyright Term Extension Act.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.440
The most famous and influential
member of this group

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.600
is Mickey Mouse-- a
copyrighted character,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.370
who first appeared publicly in the
1928 cartoon, Steamboat Willie.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.860
Copyrights in these works will
begin to expire in 2018, 95 years

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.360
after their first publication.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.910
Mickey Mouse, himself, will
fall into the public domain

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.790
on or about 2023, unless yet
another amendment of the statute

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.810
rescues him again.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.360
Not all works published during this
interval is still alive, however.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.870
Only those who were properly renewed,
by people eligible to renew them,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.970
survived.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.380
As we've seen, the large majority of
works registered during this interval

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.210
were not renewed.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.280
The net effect is that most of the work
copyrights in this category of works

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.110
have expired.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.360
Not so with respect to works first
published between 1964 and 1977.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.470
These get the benefit of the change from
voluntary renewal to automatic renewal.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.270
Who owns these copyrights?

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.820
Presumptively, the same
person or persons who

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.000
are eligible to apply for
renewal onto the previous regime.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.820
Another important footnote, just
because these copyrights are subject

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.070
to automatic renewal doesn't mean that
they cannot be voluntarily renewed.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.600
And the system contains
some important incentives

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.510
for people who voluntarily renew.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.060
The upshot, as you might imagine, is
that voluntary renewal remained common

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.890
after 1992.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.140
The key point for our present purposes
is that works in this third category

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.730
have not yet fallen
into the public domain.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:35.690
They will begin to do so in 2018,
like their surviving older cousins.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.000
Works in the fourth category
overlap the fundamental change

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.090
in the copyright system caused by the
general reform of the statute in 1976.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.920
These were created but
not published before 1978.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.200
Federal copyright protection for these
last for the lives of their authors

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.440
plus 70 years or the end of
2002, whichever is later.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.960
In addition, if they were
published by the end of 2002,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:09.047
they got an extra lease on life
until, at a minimum, the end of 2047.

00:08:09.047 --> 00:08:10.880
The purpose and effect
of this provision was

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.690
to nudge the heirs of the authors
of such things to publish them.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.360
We come, finally, to the newest set of
works, those created in 1978 or later.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.380
These, as you now know, last for the
life of the author plus 70 years.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.330
That means that they will start
expiring in 2048 at the earliest.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.020
As we've seen, anonymous works,
pseudonymous works, and works for hire

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.960
get treated differently.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.960
They will begin to expire
in 2073 at the earliest.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.900
So that's where things stand.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.840
The bottom line, if you need to know
the status of a particular US work,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.680
first ascertain which of these
five categories it falls into.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.700
Works in the first box
are in the public domain.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.960
Works in the second box probably
are in the public domain,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.850
but you need to check whether the
copyrights were timely renewed.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.400
Works in the third box are most
likely not in the public domain,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.780
unless of course they were published
without the required copyright notice.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.770
But their copyrights will
begin to expire in 2018.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.650
Works in the fourth box could
be in the public domain,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.780
unless they were published before 2002.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.450
You need to check.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:32.070
And finally, works in the fifth box
are probably not in the public domain.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.980
The exceptions to this
last proposition are

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.890
those published between 1978 and 1989,
without the required statutory notice

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.290
and that defect was not
cured within five years,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.890
and works published recently
subject to cc-zero proclamations.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:58.570
Otherwise, these works will not begin
to fall until 2048 at the earliest.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.970
Messy, very messy.
