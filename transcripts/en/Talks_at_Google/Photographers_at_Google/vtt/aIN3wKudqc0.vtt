MALE SPEAKER: Great to welcome
Rodney here to talk to us

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.010
about landscape photography and
his work in that field and

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.690
some of these great images.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.550
I've got a number of them
scattered around my home.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.970
And some of you may as well.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510
But it's great to have
Rodney here.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.982
Thanks for coming.

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.710
RODNEY LOUGH JR: You might want
to save your applause

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.570
until the end, because you never
know what you're going

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.820
to get, right?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.200
My name is Rodney Lough Jr. I'm
apparently the most famous

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.450
guy you've never heard of.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990
I have--

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.270
I want to first thank Google
for having me out here and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.820
John Nile--

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.470
no, it's really Neal.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.630
It's not Nile.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.850
I did that on purpose--

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990
and Chris James from the
legal department.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.560
Well, I better start my little
starter, my little clock.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.950
And a lady by the name of Lisa
Brewer, who is one of my

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.660
people at the gallery I
have in San Francisco.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.900
It's a 14,000 square-foot
gallery.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.180
It's the single largest
photographic artist

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.940
gallery in the world.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.190
Feel free to visit.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.410
I've got some ground rules.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.790
It's OK to laugh.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.550
It's OK to clap.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.170
Not so OK to boo.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.030
OK?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.690
Hopefully that won't happen.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.380
I was born in 1960 in
Jacksonville, Florida.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.480
My father was in the
Coast Guard.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.450
And we moved around quite
a bit, because

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.410
he was in the military.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.250
About every three years we
found ourselves in a new

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730
location, in a new
exciting place.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.350
And it's sort of a negative
and a positive, right?

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.290
When you move around a lot, you
have the opportunity to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260
make new friends,
meet new people.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.580
It gives you this sense of
exploration that you don't get

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.120
normally anywhere else.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.940
But by the same token, you don't
really have a whole lot

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.190
of lifelong friends.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.699
My dad was an avid
outdoors guy.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.220
He grew up in Colorado.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.970
They used to take pack
mules out into

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.890
the middle of nowhere.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.950
They'd spend two or three weeks
as a family on vacation.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.390
I know that sounds completely
foreign to us today that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.400
somebody would do anything with
a pack mule, but that's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.370
what they used to do.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.980
And so he instilled in
me this sense of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.240
exploration, which is fun.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.790
Honestly, it's fun.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.440
Sweat is a good thing.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.860
I got my first camera when
I was 12 years old.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.720
And it was an old
Olympus OM-1.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.730
If you're wondering why I'm
only walking from here to

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.770
here, it's because that's
the total width that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.330
this camera can see.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.550
I would normally walk way over
there just to watch all your

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.270
head's turn, like at a tennis
match or something.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.110
But my dad's best friend,
Uncle Bill, he loved

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.260
photography, absolutely
loved it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.960
And Uncle Bill saw my passion
for following him around and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.830
seeing what he was doing.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
And he gave me his
old Olympus OM-1.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.020
I started doing black and white

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420
photography with Uncle Bill.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.730
And my very first darkroom
was the bathroom.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.750
I'm not joking, the bathroom.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.110
I'd mix my chemicals
in the sink.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.990
I would have a little teeny tray
that I would do the one

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.930
thing and then the
other thing.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.380
And I would hang it up.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.110
I would literally turn
on the light switch

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.030
to expose the material.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.320
That was my first darkroom,
the bathroom, literally.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.750
And I shot black
and white film.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.890
Oh man, well, I still
do, right?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.380
But about eight or nine years,
when I was 20, 21, somewhere

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.570
in there, I discovered that
black and white photography

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.690
became easy.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.120
I don't know.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.170
Is that heresy to say that in
the heart of Ansel Adams land?

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.090
I don't know.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.790
But color--

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.860
OK, think about--

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.600
well, I should ask.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.680
Can I ask a couple
more questions?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.280
Any photographers in the room?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.790
Oh, quite a few.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.269
Any of you actually
know who I am?

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.720
Oh, a couple.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.480
Sweet.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.850
Hey, that Google stuff's
working.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.430
How many people shooting film?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.810
All right.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.060
How many shooting digital?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.703
Film is not dead.

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:40.360
I'm just saying that.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.250
How many shooting digital,
thinking of going to film?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.950
One guy.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.870
Really?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.250
Look, I'm not counting an iPhone
as a digital camera.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.710
Are you guys?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.000
I hope not.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.740
I hope that's not what you're
counting, because

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.990
that doesn't count.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.570
Not realizing I had any talent
for photography whatsoever, I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.590
took the traditional route
and went to college.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.650
I was always good in math.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.070
Do I have any math majors
in the room?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.560
Sweet.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.990
My kind of people.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.250
I left my pocket protector
at home today.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.200
When I was going to school, I
met my wife at a dance during

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.470
the summer, a church dance.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.980
Went back to school.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.650
Missed her a lot.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.320
Left my last semester of my
senior year to go back and ask

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.060
my wife to marry me.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.820
She was stupid enough
to say yes.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.910
I was lucky enough
that she did.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.750
When I came back to school, I
got called in after a couple

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.560
weeks into the dean's office.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.710
Anyone ever get called into the

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.795
dean's office for anything?

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:03.670
Yeah, I didn't think.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.976
None of you.

00:06:04.976 --> 00:06:06.580
You're smarter than I am.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.380
And they sat me down and they
said, you know, something

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.190
about you is different.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.800
We're not sure what, but you
used to be a C student.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.730
You're getting straight A's.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.855
What's the deal?

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:20.276
I don't know.

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:22.566
I don't have a clue.

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:25.950
A couple more weeks go by, maybe
almost a whole month.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.060
I get called back in to the
dean's office, and he says,

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.820
something's different,
because your

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.660
professors, they love you.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.770
And quite frankly, they didn't
really used to like

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.600
you all that much.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.990
And I get called in another
three weeks, and he says,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.370
would you stay on for
a master's degree?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.380
You've got to take this
applications test.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.020
You've got to take a
theory test just

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.440
to get in the program.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.000
But we'd like you to get in.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.860
And I'm like, oh no.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.700
I'm pff--

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.750
are you kidding?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.290
I'm so far in debt.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.470
Anyone still in debt
for the college?

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.000
Yeah, me too.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.270
The cheapest money
you'll ever get.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.740
Take forever to pay that off.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.010
Finally he says, look,
just take the exams.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.020
So I took the exams.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.020
I got like a 98 on the theory
and a 99 on the application.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.420
And I was feeling pretty good.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm in the statistics
department, minoring in

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.020
mathematics.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.970
I was so smart, I could
float across campus.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.430
That's how smart I was.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.440
Or at least that's
how smart I felt.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.680
So they call me back in and they
say, have you ever heard

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.640
of the BYU outstanding
achievement scholarship?

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.520
Like I'd ever heard of any kind
of scholarship before.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.460
Not-- no way.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.310
They said, well, we applied
for it in your name.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.030
Can you do that?

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.360
Are you--

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.880
what do we call that today?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.130
That's like identity
theft, isn't it?

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:03.300
They said, well, you got it.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.090
You just got the Brigham Young
University Outstanding

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.640
Achievement Scholarship.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.054
I said, that's wonderful,
but what is it?

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:13.330
Oh, simple.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.310
It pays for everything.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.320
Everything?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.230
Everything.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.010
And we'll even give you
a job at $12 an hour.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.750
Now realize, way back then, $12
an hour in the research

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.870
center was a lot of money.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.710
So after I got through
school, I went in--

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.630
I did graduate, just so you
know, a master's degree in

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.380
statistics with a minor
in mathematics.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.320
So from one geek to the rest
of my fellow geeks in the

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.539
room, you don't have to remain
the way you are.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.950
There is life outside
of geekdom.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.330
Because I'm not--

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.010
well, how do I put it?

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.660
Because I can speak
corporate--

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.290
and you all know what
I mean by that--

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.690
actually, no.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.230
You guys have a pretty cool
atmosphere here, don't you?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.440
It's not too back-biting,
I hope.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.100
But because I could speak
corporate, and because I could

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.070
speak geek, I went up the
ladder pretty quick.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.960
And within seven years I was
director of database and

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.390
research for an international
direct mail marketing company

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.015
in New Jersey.

00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:22.680
Now, I'm from Oregon.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.740
New Jersey is about as far away
from where I wanted to be

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.250
as I could possibly get.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.610
Any managers in the room,
people who manage?

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.330
A few.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.520
Well, the rest of you
are lucky, trust me.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.140
Because managing is not easy.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:44.680
It's kind of like wrangling
cats, managing kindergartners.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.640
All right?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.190
You do realize that we
haven't changed.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.770
When you were in the sandbox at
four or five years old, and

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.070
you were a yanking that toy
away from that other kid

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.080
because it's mine, you
haven't changed.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.060
You've gotten sneakier, but
we haven't changed.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.580
Basically, we're
still the same.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.190
Anyone know any Germans, I mean
born and bred, honest to

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.160
goodness Germans?

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.590
These people have no sense
of social space at all.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.380
One day--

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.630
OK, write this down.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.430
You're going to need
this later in life.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.260
An hour--

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.680
I can't do this in an hour.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.680
It's crazy.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.330
I'll speed up a little bit.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.810
Write this down.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.570
If you want to run a successful
business, here's

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.820
how you do it.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.660
You're going to have problems,
so you have to

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.590
identify the problem.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.250
Then you have to fix
the problem.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.970
Then you have to not do
the problem again.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.590
That's it.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.500
That's how every successful
company on the face of the

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.870
plant operates, including
mine.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.800
Identify the problem.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.720
Fix the problem.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.480
Don't do the problem again.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.500
Every day as a manager,
I would have people

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.030
coming into my office.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.620
We have a problem,
and Susie did it.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.480
What are you going
to do to Susie?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.350
Oh, come on.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.000
Really?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.460
So one morning Jens--

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.610
born and bred, Munich--

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.160
comes in.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.760
And Jens is like this
close to my face.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.630
He's so close.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.270
And he's screaming about
something Susie has done, so

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.430
violently that the little
spit balls are

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.680
hitting me in the face.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.120
I snapped.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.330
I did.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.610
Jens, can you hold that
thought for a minute.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.680
I'll be right back.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.930
I marched down to the senior
VP of marketing, who I

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.780
reported to.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.720
She reported to the owners.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.450
Now realize that this time
I was in charge of

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.280
$164 million in sales.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.900
I know that means nothing to
you guys being from Google.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.310
That's like your budget,
isn't it, $164 million?

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:58.980
I had 30 people reporting to me
in 13 different countries,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.150
and I snapped.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.850
I went down to her and I said,
I'm going to be leaving.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.900
She goes, what happened?

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.880
I told her the spit balls.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.045
She said, no, you can't leave.

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:14.575
I'm like, it's still America.

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:16.195
I'm pretty sure I can.

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:18.916
She goes, how much more
money do you want?

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:20.365
What?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:24.740
Is that all I had to do to get
a raise, threaten to leave?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.280
Holy crap, I wish I'd learned
that lesson sooner.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.290
I said no, no, no, no.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.830
I can't do this.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.520
Well, when are you going
to leave, she asks.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:45.140
About five minutes,
because I'm done.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.820
I helped them find
a replacement.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.920
On the drive home--

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.340
oh, I should back
up a little bit.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.790
When you manage people, you're
sort of expected to do social

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.310
events of some kind, right?

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.655
We love to barbecue.

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:01.620
If you ever come up to Oregon,
you want a good barbecue, just

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.500
call ahead so we can vacuum and
get the barbecue ready.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.170
People would come over
to the barbecue.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.240
They'd see something hanging on
a wall, and they'd be like,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.510
oh, that's amazing.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.890
Where did you buy that?

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.830
Buy it?

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.490
Are you kidding me?

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.780
I'm Scottish.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.820
I made that.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.990
That's what us Scottish
people do.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.360
We don't really buy stuff.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.680
We just make it, because
we're that cheap.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.870
I'm sorry, frugal.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.160
More of a Scottish
word, isn't it?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.800
Frugal.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.050
Get in my belly.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.660
So on the drive home I'm
thinking to myself, what am I

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.310
going to tell my wife.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.140
We got three kids.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.610
They were paying me
$120,000 a year.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.712
This is back in '95, OK?

00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:53.540
That's a lot of money
back in '95.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.720
And since I was in charge of
all the budgets and the

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.990
performance and the bonus
structure, guess

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.070
what else we made?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.310
Bonus every time.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.580
So that was like another
$30,000.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.180
I'm at $150,000 a year.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.500
We're living in the big house.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.225
We got the sports
car, everything.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.690
Pull in the driveway.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.240
I get out.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.540
I walk up the--

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.180
in the front door.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.000
My wife hears the door
shut and she

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.346
says, you're home early.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:25.172
Did you forget something?

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:29.570
I'm like, yeah, forgot
my life.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.604
What do you mean by that?

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:36.670
Well, are you in a good mood,
because I just quit my job.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.920
She goes, really?

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.460
So what are you going
to do now?

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.480
Well, thought I'd work on my
photography for a while.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.390
Now, I knew I'd married the
right woman long ago.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.520
But this just nailed
it for me.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.230
And she can pretty much do
anything she wants--

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.630
I hope she doesn't see
this, because then

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.080
she'll know she can--

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.620
and I'll still stick with her.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.740
Because she walks up, and
she gives me a big hug.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.460
And remember how we talked
about being interactive.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.380
You're going to have to
say aw in a moment.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.920
She gives me a big hug, and she
whispers in my ear, it's

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.170
about time.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.450
AUDIENCE: Aw.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:29.310
RODNEY LOUGH JR: It took us a
whopping week to pack the

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.620
house and get out
of New Jersey.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.870
And we moved to Colorado.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.670
Now within the first five
minutes of this talk, you've

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.500
probably decided whether
you love me or hate me.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.350
And I've got to be honest,
either way, I don't care.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.570
Because I like me.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.730
I like me.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.160
I like the fact that I left
the corporate world.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.970
I like the fact that I'm doing
what I love to do.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.720
I even like the fact
I keep winning all

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.230
these ridiculous awards.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.900
I've got so many awards
it's sick.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.910
You've heard of sick
money, right?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.870
People who have sick money.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.120
I have sick awards.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.370
People shooting photography,
more questions.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.060
Anyone shooting medium-format
camera?

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.280
How about large format?

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.640
One dude.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.340
You guys don't even know what
I'm talking about, do you?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.740
You saw that picture of me
with the camera, right?

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.640
Imagine a camera so large that
the film is that big.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.370
That's how big my film is.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.780
Have you ever seen the old
camera with the bellows on

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.260
them, and you've got to put
your head under the hood?

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.120
Everything on the back
i a ground glass.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.490
It's upside down
and backwards.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.280
Have you guys seen this
kind of camera before?

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.880
That's what I'm using.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.180
They still make them, but
they've stopped making my

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.490
film, which is kind
of unfortunate,

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.040
but I have a stash.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.950
Because I'm on the Fuji film
talent team, I saw it coming.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.920
I have hundreds of sheets of
film sitting in the freezer to

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.310
use down the road.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.730
In order to be successful in the
business I do, you have to

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.510
have passion.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.369
I think to be successful
in any business, you

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.329
have to have passion.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.069
So my passion, what drives
me is I'm a soloist.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.510
Right?

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.810
I love being out in the middle
of nowhere by myself.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.220
Why?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.950
Well, let me ask.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.270
Anyone ever do that?

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.730
Show of hands.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.710
Out in the middle of nowhere,
by yourself.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.530
Nothing else like
it, is there?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.460
Pure silence.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.010
So quiet you can hear the
ringing in your ears, which is

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:52.180
the onset of tinnitus, which
comes with age unfortunately.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.900
Most the time I'm about
11 miles or so back.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.060
Oh my gosh, I'm only
halfway through.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.630
This is crazy.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.970
How am I going to
pull this off?

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.690
Does Google have a mission
statement?

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.910
Anyone know it?

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.540
Show of hands, who knows
it by heart?

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.940
Managers, you're going to want
to take note of the people who

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.190
didn't raise their hands.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.540
My mission statement--

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.400
now realize, if I had wanted
to make money, becoming an

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.730
artist was probably not
the smartest move, OK?

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.420
My mission statement is to
enrich people's lives by

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.520
bringing Rodney's nature-based
art into every home and office

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.770
in the world.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.330
It's one sentence.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.000
It's a long sentence
and probably not

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.280
grammatically correct.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.950
I'm a math guy, not
an English guy.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.850
But if you get rid of the
rhetoric, Rodney, Rodney,

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:03.260
Rodney, and you boil it down to
its simplest form, enrich

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:10.510
people's lives through nature,
that's what I'm seeking to do.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.280
I've been fortunate enough that
it seems to be working.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.390
But it only works because
I have the passion.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.390
I think I have time to
tell you this story.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.750
No I don't.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.080
I'm sorry, I don't.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.150
I don't.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.080
Normally I give convention
talks at Las Vegas or

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.240
something, and they're two
hours, three hours.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.390
So to try and smush into
an hour is hard.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.540
My son--

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.070
I'm Rodney Lough Jr. That means
there was a senior.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.380
And that means, unfortunately,
there's a "the third."

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.160
So uno, dos, tres.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.790
We called him Trey.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.270
He doesn't even know how to
spell Rodney, because we've

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.510
called him Trey his
whole life.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.770
Trey's 19.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.710
He's got a fourth-degree black
belt in taekwondo.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.690
He's the youngest master to ever
receive that honor in the

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.800
United States.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.310
Even I don't mess with
him, and I'm a lot

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.330
bigger than he is.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.150
But that's probably because
I love him, right?

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.220
It's a father thing, I guess.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.100
Trey comes to me the other day,
and he says, dad, you're

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.540
considered the best in the
world at what you do.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.620
Why?

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.490
How is that?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.030
No one had--

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.720
I'd been asked--

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.740
I've been interviewed gobs.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.330
No one's ever asked
me that question.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.230
I thought, that was
a great question.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.310
Why?

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.770
I thought about for a little
bit, and I thought, hm,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.240
because I don't think I am.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.450
Now that sounds crazy, right?

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:50.330
A piece in the Smithsonian, an
award from the United Nations.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:57.180
I got something from the
US Senate, sick awards.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.870
But why?

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.710
Why am I the best in the
world at what I do?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.435
Because I don't think I am.

00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:06.330
It constantly means that I'm
improving and looking at not

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.000
what's right but looking
at what's wrong.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.010
It's easy to stand in front of
a large mountain at sunrise,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.430
with the thing just going off
and the stream in the

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.710
foreground and everything's
perfect.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.150
And it's yelling at you,
photograph me.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.080
Please photograph me.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.240
Look how magnificent I am.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.020
Those are easy.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.350
The in-between stuff, kind of
not the big mountains, just

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.670
sort of uh, a little
more difficult.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.690
The intimate stuff,
really hard.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.850
But in every one of those cases
I don't look at what's

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.040
right with it.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.900
I'm constantly examining
what's wrong.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.720
I don't know if that makes
me weird, but it's got

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.970
me where I'm at.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.610
Oh my gosh.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.090
OK, my studio--

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.380
I have an 18,000 square
foot studio.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.280
It's just a teeny little
photography place.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.380
I've got a tango drum scanner,
where I convert my film from

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.950
analog to digital, because you
can't even get print film for

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.110
enlargers these day.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.960
Everything has to be switched
over and converted to digital.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.370
I have two backup scanners.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.460
I've got a 52-inch Colex
type C processor.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.110
Is this going over
everyone's head?

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.970
Anyone know what I'm
talking about?

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.280
I got some over my heads.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.760
And I got a couple people
saying, I don't understand.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.870
But that's OK.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:39.070
It basically allows me to go
like this, [WHISTLE], huh,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.704
that's magnificent, get out my
camera, come back, [WHISTLE]

00:22:44.704 --> 00:22:46.180
too-doo-loo.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.070
Put it on the wall and
we all go, ahh.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.100
Because that's it, right?

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.190
Hah.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.440
Hah.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.700
That's what I do, try
and enrich people's

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.930
lives through nature.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.640
The only way I can do that is
when I have that sensation,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.020
try and get it on the
wall so you guys

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.270
can have that sensation.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.070
Long story short, I got
a remarkable studio.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.570
You guys are welcome to
come up and visit.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.890
Like I said, just call ahead
so we can vacuum.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.090
I do have time for one story.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.860
When I do these photography
workshops every year--

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.810
people come on these photography
workshops.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.300
They pay me, I think, outrageous
sums of money to

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.540
come and hike along.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.466
People say, what do I get
for my 2 and 1/2 days?

00:23:31.466 --> 00:23:33.950
Get to hang out with me.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.190
That's what you get for
2 and 1/2 days.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.480
Now I will tell you,
I wear you out.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.740
Every night you're like
oh, I'm exhausted.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.800
But it's so much fun.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.860
Well, in order to do these
workshops up in Glacier

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.750
National Park in Montana, you
have to have taken this bear

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.030
encounter course.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.900
And they teach you how to deal
with bears, when you come up

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.740
on them in the wilderness.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.280
You take a submissive posture.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.100
You're not loud.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.470
You kind of talk
to them softly.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.100
When they're not watching you,
you back away slowly.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.085
The moment they take
interest, you stop.

00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:06.280
They give you all
these scenarios.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.050
I was up in British Columbia,
by myself, on this teeny

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.580
little island called
[? Mala Illa Coola. ?]

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.070
And I'm pretty sure I
just butchered it.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.300
And I've moored my boat
on the beach.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.540
I'm hiking down this one little
trail that's got about

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.650
this wide, blackberry bushes
going off on either side.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.995
And every, I don't know, eight
feet is a pile of bear scat.

00:24:28.995 --> 00:24:30.760
And I'm a guide in Glacier.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.800
I know how to handle bears.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.470
Never had to really, but
I've been trained.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.980
Come around this little-- and
I'm doing all this stuff.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.910
I'm clapping my hands.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.350
Hey bear, here I come.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.310
Come around this little corner
and right there is the butt

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.380
end of a little black bear.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.530
And I'm thinking to myself,
this is not something that

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.220
they teach you in the bear
encounter course.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.460
What happens when you come up on
the butt end of the little

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.480
black bear?

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.350
Because if you turn and go the
other way, and it hears you,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.320
the whole fight/flight
thing kicks in.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.060
The bear attacks you.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.190
It kills you, rips
your jugular out.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.440
I might be exaggerating a
little bit for effect.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.320
But it's probably not good.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.220
So I'm thinking to myself,
what can I do?

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.390
I know--

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.280
true story--

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.980
as loud as I could, I
yelled, hey bear.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.190
And at the same time I slapped
it in the butt.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.440
The bear went, oh,
his eyes huge.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.730
[SCRATCHING]

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.040
Now I'd gone to
[? Mala Coola Ola ?]

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.640
to photograph this old totem
that had fallen down.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.090
And I found the totem,
and it was really--

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.670
didn't look that great.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.920
So I thought, all right, I'm not
going to photograph this.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.720
And I don't know how--

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.440
Is the mama bear around, because
this bear wasn't that

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.340
big, but it was big enough.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.420
And I decided that I was
not going to go back

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.440
the way of the trail.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.130
I actually went around the
outside sandy, rocky edge of

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.160
the island to get back
to the boat.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.350
All right, single biggest
difference between me and

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.170
other photographers is that
I don't fake anything.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.150
I'm actually famous
for not faking it.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.200
My goal is to get back
to what I saw.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.620
Now listen carefully, because
it's been interpreted many

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.330
ways, but you've kind of got the
horse here, so you can ask

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.270
the horse directly.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.370
My goal is to get back
to what I saw.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.470
How I get there, I don't care.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.420
I just want you guys
to see what I saw.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:45.150
People ask me all the time,
did you Photoshop that?

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:50.890
Now Photoshop, just so you
know, is not a verb.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.770
OK?

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:57.000
What they're really asking
is did you fake it.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.080
No, I didn't fake it.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.000
Anyone know what a crescent
wrench is?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.255
Show of hands.

00:27:02.255 --> 00:27:03.560
A crescent wrench?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.300
It's the wrench where it's got
the little dial on it, and you

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.180
twist it left--

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.690
up or down, and it gets
wider or smaller.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.200
And they make little
teeny ones.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.230
And they may gigantic ones.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.590
Very, very useful wrench.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.350
Now the guy who designed the
crescent wrench probably never

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:24.460
thought that it would be used
as a murder weapon, but I'm

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.945
pretty sure it has been.

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:29.800
Oh.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.170
Oh.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:36.860
The guys who designed Photoshop
at Adobe probably

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:42.280
never thought it would be used
as a murder weapon, but I

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.480
personally have seen it be
used as a murder weapon.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.650
So the question is, is the
crescent wrench, the engineer

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.540
of the crescent wrench
the problem?

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.720
Or is it an issue of the
integrity of the user?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.070
The guy who uses the crescent
wrench like it was designed to

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.940
be used, the same could be true
about Photoshop, right?

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.330
Is it Photoshop that's
the problem?

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.650
Did you Photoshop that?

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.660
Well, technically I had to.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.610
I have to use Photoshop to
color balance it and get

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.460
things back to the way I saw.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.640
No different than being in a
traditional darkroom where you

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.270
change the color wheels, or
you dodge or burn, or you

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.290
create contrast masks or--

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.640
I'm going over your
heads, I know.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.100
It's OK.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.320
No difference.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.330
It's just you're doing
it digitally.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.940
That's the only difference.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.310
So is Photoshop the issue?

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.230
Or is it an issue of the
integrity of the user?

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.130
How many people think
it's Photoshop?

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.950
Sweet.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.950
I've got converts already.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.130
I can tell.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:53.290
How many think it's about the
integrity of the user?

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.790
It's a really stupid
question, right?

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.990
If you went to college, you
can't get that one wrong.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:05.450
My definition of a lie is any
communication given from one

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.480
to another with the
intent to deceive.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.760
Right?

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.320
That's a lie.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.200
That's its most simple,
basic form.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.070
It can be any kind
of communication.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.300
It could be verbal.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.510
It could be nonverbal.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.820
It could be video.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.150
It could be written.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.530
There's gobs of commun--
their body language.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.880
Does that make me look fat?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.650
Does this dress make
me look fat?

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.900
No.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.840
I wouldn't touch that with
a 10-foot pole, ever.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.050
But see, I think that when you
die there's an up escalator

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.450
and a down escalator.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.670
I'd kind of like to be
on the up escalator.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:52.470
So lying's not really high
on my to-do list at all.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:56.930
Do you know you have talent when
your friends and family

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:58.456
tell you you have talent?

00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:01.230
Does that count?

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.440
Probably not.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.490
What about when someone
pays you and you can

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.310
make a living at it?

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.830
You think maybe then
you have talent?

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.440
I think that every one has
been given talents.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.180
Not everyone knows what
their talent is.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.970
They haven't discovered
it yet.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.920
But I think we've all been
given different talents.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.250
Imagine a world where you wake
up one day, and you've been

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.470
working in the produce
department at some grocery

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.590
store, and you decide, I want
to be a school bus driver.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.140
Now I would never do that.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.880
But in this Utopian world of
mine, you give your notice and

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.990
you go to the school bus driving
school, which is what?

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.380
Being taught by people who love
nothing better than to

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.610
teach other people how to
drive school buses.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.640
I think everything would
still get done.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.890
I think there are people who are
natural born tidy uppers,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.260
if that's even a real word.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.220
I don't even know.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.780
Is that a real word,
tidy uppers?

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.990
People who walk around picking
garbage up off the ground or

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.580
straightening the papers
on your desk.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.580
You didn't ask them to.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.970
Every mother-in-law in the
world is a tidier upper,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.990
because they come in to the
house and they clean all of

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.260
your shelves.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.500
They stack all your plates and
your dishes in a certain way.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.150
It's not the way you want it.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.530
And you can't say anything.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.780
They're tidier uppers.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.350
Oh my gosh.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.390
This is ridiculous.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:35.300
OK, how many people in the room
are good at what you do?

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.200
Keep those hands up, because I
don't want to see the people

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.400
changing their minds.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.550
How many of you are great
at what you do?

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.500
Put your other hand up.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.270
Great.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.760
Higher, so I can tell.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.670
These are people who are
great at what they do.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:58.590
For the rest of you, good
is the enemy of great.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.620
Don't be good.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.030
Be great.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.390
Anyone ever hear of a guy by
the name of Jim Collins?

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:09.500
He wrote a book called "Good to
Great." Jim Collins wrote

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.030
this book, and he said, hmm, I
wonder if there's a way to

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.590
determine how businesses just
kind of go along, and then

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.820
they just shoot up at
a 45-degree angle.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.180
And they've been doing
this for years.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.830
And it's just within
the market trends

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:22.990
and blah, blah, blah.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.120
What happened at that juncture
to cause them to go

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.390
from good to great?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.335
And he thought, well, we could
design a research study, but

00:32:30.335 --> 00:32:33.180
that would take 50 years, 50
years to come up with the

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.610
analysis and see what
the results were.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.910
So instead he said,
you know what?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.580
Let's go to the stock
exchange.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.450
Let's look through that data.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.660
We've got gobs of data.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.450
And let's just see if
anyone did that.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.510
Sure enough, they had.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.360
Over all the years, they went
in and they looked at

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.590
different categories of
companies in different years.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.850
And sure enough, boom.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.550
So they asked a very
simple question.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.280
What happened at
that juncture?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.100
What took these companies
from just doing

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.360
whatever to being great?

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.440
I'm going to summarize a bit.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.980
Normally I'd stretch this
out, but we don't

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.760
have much more time.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.880
I want you guys to get it
though, "Good to Great."

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.950
They came up with what they
call the three circles.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.510
I don't know why they call
them the three circles,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.400
because they got nothing to
do with circles really.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.620
They were three questions
put in a circle.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.700
First question, what are you
better at than anyone else on

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.840
the planet?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.700
This is important stuff.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.860
You guys want to know how to
run a business and make

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.820
success in your life?

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.040
This is how you do it.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.340
I wish somebody had demanded
I read this book

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.410
when I was like 12.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:48.810
Of course, it hadn't been
written then, but you know.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:53.000
What are you better at than
anyone else in the world?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.135
So for our little company,
we sat around and

00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:56.280
we discussed it.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.080
And we came up with a very
simple statement.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.930
We create the finest landscape
wilderness

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.070
artwork on the planet.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.830
From click to ship, nobody
does it better.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.199
And I know, because we get
all of our materials

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.469
from the same suppliers.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:15.889
And I know what other
people are using.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.889
And I know that I'm the only
one crazy enough to lug 120

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.679
pounds of camera gear up over a
12,000 foot mountain pass to

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.690
maybe get a shot.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.949
No one's doing it
at our level.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:32.120
Nobody on the planet is
even coming close.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.880
So I'll stand on my soap box,
and I'll say, bring it on.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.370
You want to put your piece
next to my piece,

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.835
come on, I dare you.

00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:41.870
I've got my fourth-degree black
belt son backing me up.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:47.679
Second question, what drives
your economic engine?

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.989
In other words, if you could
put a little box, which has

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:55.370
got profit in it-- and profit
is created through x.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.940
x is the label on the box.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.190
What would that x be?

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.290
So what drives your
economic engine?

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.120
We thought about it.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.170
Didn't take that long
to figure out.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.140
For us it's profit
per piece sold.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.990
Every piece that we sell, the
most profit we can get out of

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.460
it, better for us.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.600
There's lots of ways
you can do that.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.420
I could trim my expenses
in payroll.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.750
No one wants to hear that.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.570
I know, times are tough.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.270
I didn't do it.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.070
Haven't done it.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.940
You could beat up your suppliers
and get a better

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.770
deal on your raw goods
materials, right?

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.880
That will help increase
your profit.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.960
Maybe you don't discount.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.090
That would affect your profit.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:41.290
So for us the answer is, what
drives your economic engine?

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.950
Profit per piece sold.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.790
For us, pretty simple.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.320
The last question that they
asked was they said, what are

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.150
you passionate about?

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.550
Because you have to have
passion in what you

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.360
do, or forget it.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.130
Go home.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.220
Choose something else.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.220
For us it boiled down to our
mission statement, to enrich

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.000
people's lives by bringing
Rodney's nature-based art into

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.560
every home and office
in the world.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:05.870
Great.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.890
Now what do you do?

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.410
What they determined was if you
can take all those three

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.090
circles with questions in them
and overlap them into a little

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:18.300
Venn diagram in the middle, you
get this sort of little

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.620
not quite triangle.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.920
But you know what I'm talking
about, right?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.050
Come on, you guys are geeks.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.540
Keep up.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.720
Circle, little thing
in the middle.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.780
If you can figure out what that
one thing is that ties

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.980
all the rest of what you
do together, you can go

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.580
from good to great.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.640
So for the last four years we've
been sitting around,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.760
figuring out, what
the heck is that?

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.500
What is it?

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.690
I don't know.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.200
Well, we came up
with something.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.230
We came up with what
I call Stand Here.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.430
OK?

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.610
I have watched in horror, over
the years, where places I've

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.860
photographed that are
truly sanctuaries--

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.890
anyone that does the hiking
ever been to one of these

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.190
places where you just
sit there and

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.020
you know it's special?

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.710
It's special.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:06.430
You just know it.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.010
All you have to do--

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.560
If you haven't been there, I
can tell the rest of you,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.140
stand-here.com.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.070
You're going to want to go
there after you leave.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.310
And then you're going to want
to Google all your people

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.250
through Gmail--

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.010
because I'm pretty sure that's
what you guys use--

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.120
and tell people about it.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.980
The places I photograph
have started to

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.370
be trampled to death.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.530
All right?

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.970
Anyone been to a
national park?

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.530
Sweet.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.020
The first time you went to a
national park, you probably

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.810
went because your friends
told you.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:41.570
Oh, you've got to go.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.130
It's amazing.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.870
So let's say it's Zion
National Park.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.870
You drive to Zion
National Park.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.320
And you're sitting in the
parking lot, underneath the

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.490
Cottonwood trees, looking at all
the other cars, and you're

00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:01.310
like, what's so great about
this Zion National Park?

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.750
They go into the visitor's
center, where they got the

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.980
bookstores.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.470
And you look through the
postcards and the note cards

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.760
and the posters and the picture
books and maybe even

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.020
spend a few bucks and
get some of them.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.010
And then you walk over
to the ranger.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:19.110
And you lay them on the table,
and you go, where are these?

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.260
You guys know what the
ranger's job is?

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:23.930
No one.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.030
All right, let me tell you.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:31.180
The ranger's task is to
protect the resource.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.620
That's what their mandate
is, right?

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.100
They want to protect it.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.000
Why?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.270
So it can be there for our

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.350
childrens' childrens' children.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.340
I think it's a great mission.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.570
So he's going to say to
you, I don't know.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.060
I'm sorry.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.310
I don't know.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:58.290
I'm not going to say he's lying,
but he's lying because

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.420
of his mandate.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.110
And I don't blame him really.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.060
Not too much.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.260
But he's going to
give you a map.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.820
And on that map is going
to be like 80 spots.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:08.830
Oh, this one's great.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:09.430
And that one's great.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.260
You've got to go here.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.650
Check this one out.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.980
I'm here to tell you that out
of those 80 places, there's

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.550
like four of them that
are truly special.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.360
And there's another five
or six that aren't

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.350
even on that map.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.940
And I know it from spending
my entire life hiking and

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.100
exploring and whatnot.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.850
On one of these chat rooms, a
friend of mine sent me a link

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.940
to it, and it said,
Rodney Lough is--

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.255
he wastes all of his time
hiking around in

00:39:38.255 --> 00:39:39.530
the middle of nowhere.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.950
And maybe he finds something.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.880
And maybe he doesn't.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.150
That's incredibly inefficient.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.040
I thought to myself, that's
kind of a ridiculous

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.330
statement, isn't it?

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.290
I mean, how do these
people think that

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.180
these places get found?

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.290
Google Maps?

00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.010
Maybe, but how did
that get found?

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.810
Oh, right, your feet.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.890
That's how they got found.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:12.070
All right, Stand Here is
a social media website.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.610
It's a mobile app.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:20.250
It's a monthly syndicated
column.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:23.490
And with our fingers crossed
and our toes crossed, it's

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.620
also going to be a TV show.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.010
That's what we're working
on right now.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.710
Because our mission is
to enrich people's

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.560
lives through nature.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.860
If I can tell people where
these places are--

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.680
I believe that this concept of
keeping them secret and keeps

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.770
them safe is a false.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.680
It's false.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.860
I've watched it destroy
places.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.970
I think the only way to protect
them is to create a

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.750
community of people who
understand how beautiful they

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.730
are and work and seek to protect
these few places that

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.070
are really out there in the
gigantic national park.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.660
I'm not saying that the whole
park isn't pretty.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.630
It is, but there are
special places.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.810
Those are the ones we
need to protect.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.170
So that's what Stand
Here is all about.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:17.500
So if you guys have the ability
to help create Stand

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.940
Here, in the public awareness,
so we can protect the

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.400
beautiful places in our national
parks, by all means,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.240
please help us do so.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.870
Because we're taking all
of our funds and--

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:30.550
well, not all of them.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.860
We have bills to pay, right?

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.050
But we're going to take money
and donate back to each one of

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.120
these places to protect them.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.200
Did you know that when you
donate money to a national

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.980
park, you can tell them exactly
how you want them to

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.570
spend the money?

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.080
You can.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.890
On this trail I want you to take
this segment right here

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.890
and I want you to improve
the trail.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.440
Here I want you to make sure
that duh, duh, duh.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.040
You can tell them exactly
what to do.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.510
And that's what we're
going to do.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.950
We're going to create a
community of people who care.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.780
Being highly-educated,
intelligent people that you

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.600
are at Google, you must
certainly understand the

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.530
importance of what I'm
talking about.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.540
Because guys like me are
going to die someday.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.570
And the knowledge will die too,
unless it gets passed on,

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.220
and it's carried on from
generation to generation.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.670
I know, it's something we've
heard before, but it's true.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.260
You get to a point in your
life and you go, oh, if I

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.950
don't share this, it
could be lost.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:32.170
I don't want to see
that happen.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.730
Thank you, guys,
for having me.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.980
Appreciate it.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.210
I did it.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.080
Any questions?

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:44.480
Yes, sir.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.671
AUDIENCE: Have you been film all
your life, or do you also

00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:48.820
mix in with digital techniques,
like capture

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.700
techniques?

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.820
RODNEY LOUGH JR: I've been
shooting digital--

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.650
or, I'm sorry, film since I
was 12, all the way up to

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.500
about three years ago.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.280
A company had asked me to take
out a 65 megapixel digital

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
back and play with it.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.010
I think what they wanted was--

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:08.720
they wanted me to say
it's as good as the

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.120
8x10, click for click.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.720
And it wasn't, so I
couldn't do it.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.370
And I gave it back to them.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:17.940
And then about a year and a half
ago, they came out with

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.590
an 80 megapixel digital back.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.540
And they asked me to go out
and do the same thing.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.780
And it does not match, click
for click, with the 8x10.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.050
But because of all the
techniques that are available

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.350
now, where you can take multiple
pieces and put them

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.070
together, I can actually
get something that is

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.490
very close to 8x10.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.060
We're not quite there yet.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.720
The moment they can give me
something that captures a gig

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.630
in a single shot, and it's
like the size of a credit

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.470
card, I'm all over it.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.920
So I have started to switch,
because they

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.030
stopped making my film.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.750
I've got no choice, sadly.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.670
So I've got about 400
sheets of 8x10

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.570
film left in the freezer.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.690
And then I've got this 80
megapixel digital back that I

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.980
put on a 4x5 pancake technical
field camera, because the

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.990
lenses have what's called
an image circle.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.820
Basically what it can see.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.050
And I can move that back within
that image circle, even

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.660
though I've applied a tilt or a
swing or a shift, which, for

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.600
most of you, doesn't
mean anything.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.300
Anything else?

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:23.540
Yeah.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.510
AUDIENCE: You've got-- how many
sheets of film do you

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.420
shoot on a typical
hike for a day?

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.671
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
the question?

00:44:29.671 --> 00:44:31.760
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Yeah, the
question was, when I go out on

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.910
a day hike, how many sheets of
film do I take with me, and

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.200
how many shots do I take?

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.380
Did I get that right?

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.360
It depends.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.140
I can go out for three weeks and
not take a single thing,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.450
because I just don't
find anything.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.840
Or I can go out, and
in one evening

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.930
it just goes ballistic.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.090
And I'll go through everything
in my bag.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:54.120
But typically, if I'm a day
hike, I'll carry five film

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.970
holders with me, which
carries 10 sheets.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.390
Because there's two sheets
per film holder.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.270
And I can blow through
that in a day.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.700
But it's $50 a click.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.026
So I'm Scottish, right?

00:45:07.026 --> 00:45:08.520
A pretty frugal guy.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.110
And I evaluate it pretty good
before I rip up $50.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.046
AUDIENCE: So do you usually
shoot just one

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:18.014
frame of each scene?

00:45:18.014 --> 00:45:19.490
And then do you always
print them?

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.950
RODNEY LOUGH JR: The question
was if I just shoot one frame

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.690
or one sheet of film for
every composition?

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.380
No, not necessarily.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.950
Rarely will I shoot
one piece of film.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.270
Usually it's always two.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.440
Because the first one--

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.600
I shoot both sheets of film
exactly the same.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.010
And then I'll process one.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.790
And then I'll look at it and
make a determination.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.430
Do I need to push it or pull it
in processing, which means,

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.770
do I need to make it lighter
or darker in processing,

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.630
because I under-exposed
it or maybe I slightly

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:48.950
over-exposed it.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.460
And I'll do that post.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.280
But I shoot everything exactly
the same in the field.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.730
I don't use any color filters,
no polarizers.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.730
I do have a graduated neutral
density filter, which allows

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.680
me to hold back the
bright sky.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.430
But because it's a neutral
gray, it doesn't add or

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.760
subtract any color,
it just adds-- or

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.600
actually subtracts density.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.730
So it keeps the light
from coming through.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.580
And then do I actually
print them?

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.750
Yeah, that was actually
in the section I

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.790
skipped over on the studio.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.270
I've got my own LightJet
430 digital enlarger.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:28.910
I can do up to maximum one
image, 50 inches by 10 feet.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.367
And if I wanted to, I could take
that piece and stand it

00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:34.050
vertical and then put
pieces together to

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.000
make it even larger.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.290
Yep.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:37.530
Yeah?

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.036
AUDIENCE: How do you
decide where to go?

00:46:39.036 --> 00:46:42.210
RODNEY LOUGH JR: How do
I decide where to go?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.930
When I first started, I did
these little outdoor art

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:47.320
festivals all over
the country.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.710
And so I would end up usually
end up going, what's between

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.920
this spot and the next spot?

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.640
And that's kind of
where I went.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.290
I haven't done those
in like 10 years.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:59.170
But now I pretty much get
to go wherever I want.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:04.690
Tomorrow morning I fly down to
Managua, in Nicaragua, because

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.000
the president is getting
one of my pieces.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.720
And I'm there to
give it to him.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.720
Because I went there last year
and photographed Nicaragua and

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.065
actually had a blast.

00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:15.380
It was a lot of fun.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.630
So it just depends.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:18.570
Sometimes I get lucky, and
someone says, hey, you want to

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:19.005
go to Nicaragua?

00:47:19.005 --> 00:47:21.470
I'm like, Yeah, sure.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:22.990
Other times it's like, oh,
I've got to work in the

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.020
studio, so I can't.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.380
But if it's going off some
place like tonight-- for

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.060
example, if we were anywhere
to the north, there's an

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.260
aurora alert.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.910
I don't know how many
of you know that.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.120
But if you were up in Anchorage,
you'd be watching

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.900
the Aurora Borealis tonight in
full swing, because it's at a

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.317
level four, which is big.

00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:44.796
AUDIENCE: How many days a year
do you spend out in the field

00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:45.293
photographing?

00:47:45.293 --> 00:47:46.784
How many days in studio
developing?

00:47:46.784 --> 00:47:49.766
And how many days talking
through the business stuff,

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:50.263
making sure [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:50.263 --> 00:47:52.140
RODNEY LOUGH JR: You are so
a programmer, aren't you?

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.440
Out in the field, not enough.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.200
In the studio, too much.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.210
What was the other one?

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.440
AUDIENCE: Stuff like this.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.310
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Oh, doing
stuff like this.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.080
I give like--

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.090
I don't know-- four or
five talks a year.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.910
So I think my next talk is--

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.480
I think it's next
month in WPPI.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.110
It's a big convention
in Las Vegas.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.270
And then I've been asked to come
down to Disney and give a

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.620
talk to the imagineers.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:27.750
It'll probably be a group just
like yourselves, all PhDs with

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.000
a sense of humor.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.460
At least I saw some smiles.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.400
That's good.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.100
Any other questions?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.350
Yeah.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.420
AUDIENCE: So I'm a little
disappointed.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.320
I don't see your rig.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.955
I was kind of hoping you would
show us how heavy it was.

00:48:38.955 --> 00:48:41.650
RODNEY LOUGH JR: If I wasn't
going to Nicaragua, I actually

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:42.300
would have brought it.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:42.800
Yeah.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.010
I had planned on bringing it.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:44.930
AUDIENCE: How heavy is it?

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.300
And do you feel like you've got
some special muscles for

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.240
carrying it that most
people don't?

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.760
It's kind of funny, in this
world, where everyone carries

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.086
their iPhones.

00:48:52.086 --> 00:48:53.062
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Do me a favor.

00:48:53.062 --> 00:48:54.530
Stand up.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:58.150
OK, so that's you,
and this is me.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.890
I'm huge, right?

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.600
So if I put--

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.100
the backpack, without any
camping gear in it, is

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.490
probably pushing
55, 60 pounds.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.440
If I'm going out for a
week or more, it'll

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.650
pop up to 110, 120.

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:19.490
Right now I'm carrying what
I call my survival layer.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.850
And so if I--

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.100
get it, right?

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.410
So if I carry that camera out in
the woods for a few weeks,

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.405
the survival layer goes
away really fast.

00:49:28.405 --> 00:49:30.990
AUDIENCE: And how do you
fly with the camera?

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:34.050
RODNEY LOUGH JR: I put it in
one of those foamy deals.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.960
I take the whole thing
apart, lenses.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.260
I lock it up and throw it
on there and pick it up.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.840
And then I leave that usually
at the airport, because you

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.270
can do that, and put
everything in my

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.550
backpack and then go.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.932
Yeah, pretty slick some of the
stuff you can do these days.

00:49:50.932 --> 00:49:51.384
Yeah.

00:49:51.384 --> 00:49:55.110
AUDIENCE: How many miles
do you hike a day?

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.890
RODNEY LOUGH JR: When
I'm in the field?

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.000
Not when I'm sitting at
my desk in my office?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.730
OK.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.490
Well, on average, I'm
probably back about

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.350
11 miles, on average.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.840
There's a lot of stuff that's
easy to get to.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.670
There's some stuff that's not
too hard to get to, a day or

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.030
two to get into.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.900
And then there's some stuff
that's two, three

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.290
weeks to get into.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:24.800
So on average, I guess
I'm probably--

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.040
well, on Sunday I had a
friend from Moscow.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.310
He came to visit.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.940
And he's like, I want
to go shoot.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.950
And I'm like, it's fricking
24 degrees outside.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:34.860
What?

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.910
Yeah, let's go up
in the gorge.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.050
So I thought, fine.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.260
I'll take him on this
little hike.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.910
It's two miles in,
two miles out.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.520
I have what I call the
two mile rule.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.830
At two miles all
the jerks stop.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:49.510
They do.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.580
Because they're like,
do, do, do--

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.280
two miles.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.350
Oh my gosh, that's four miles.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.950
I don't want to-- four miles.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.240
This tail we went on was
just covered with ice.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.340
There's a part where you've
got to hold the

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.340
cable to get by.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.340
And it's like this wide.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.090
And it was just a
sheet of ice.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.780
And as we're going through--
his name is Dimitri.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.780
He's from Russia, so he's
probably used to some ice.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.510
I'm like, are you having fun?

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:11.710
Because it was dangerous.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:12.570
It was really dangerous.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.500
But on Sunday I did a
four miler, just a

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.110
nice little day hike.

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.730
Yeah, in the back.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:21.485
Oh, hold on.

00:51:21.485 --> 00:51:22.670
I'm getting two people.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.874
We'll start here, and then
we'll come to you.

00:51:24.874 --> 00:51:28.248
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
dangerous situations?

00:51:28.248 --> 00:51:30.616
RODNEY LOUGH JR:
Do I have any--

00:51:30.616 --> 00:51:32.350
AUDIENCE: Dangerous
situations.

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:34.990
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Have I had
any dangerous situations?

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:39.520
I kind of think the black bear
was pretty dangerous.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.440
One of my favorite sayings is,
when I'm doing workshops--

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.850
because some of places we go to,
there's no fence, and I'm

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.500
like, this is life.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.180
That is death.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:49.800
Right?

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.080
There are absolutely
situations.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.240
I don't have it to show you, but
there's this photograph I

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.790
have of me standing on this
precipice, where the rock

00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:58.820
comes back underneath.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.500
And it's easily like
a 1,200 foot drop.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.930
But that was the only place I
could get the angle I wanted.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:05.820
so I went out there.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.210
I think you have to have a
couple missing screws to do

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.780
some of the stuff I do.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.846
Yeah.

00:52:10.846 --> 00:52:13.552
AUDIENCE: How do you sell
your photographs?

00:52:13.552 --> 00:52:14.911
What is your business model?

00:52:14.911 --> 00:52:17.560
On your website, I couldn't
see that you had these

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.868
"dropped in a basket" tactics.

00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:23.358
How do you sell these
photographs?

00:52:23.358 --> 00:52:26.720
RODNEY LOUGH JR: I currently
have four galleries.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.730
I have one up in Happy Valley.

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:30.280
I have one in Sausalito.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.080
I have one in Las Vegas.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.980
And then I have one
at Fisherman's

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.460
Wharf in San Francisco.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.360
So my own galleries primarily.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.020
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.830
So you don't sell online?

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.020
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Not right now.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.400
No.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.550
Our website used to
do online stuff.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:48.010
But what we discovered, from
our collector base, is they

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.090
really just wanted to look at
the images and then call one

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:54.620
of the people at the gallery
and make their final

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.820
decisions that way.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.110
So we tried to make our new
website, which is up and

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:03.220
running right now, to be more
artsy, I guess, and less

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.278
commercial.

00:53:04.278 --> 00:53:06.966
Yep.

00:53:06.966 --> 00:53:09.885
AUDIENCE: You mentioned taking
people out on workshops,

00:53:09.885 --> 00:53:10.940
photography clients--

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.230
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Not
British people.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:16.160
I'm joking.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:16.920
I'm joking.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.696
AUDIENCE: Can the Americans
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:20.696 --> 00:53:22.584
So everyone's been to
the same place.

00:53:22.584 --> 00:53:24.010
They've all been exposed
to the same landscape.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.585
I'm curious as to how their
different shots compare.

00:53:26.585 --> 00:53:28.680
In other words, how much of it
is being there, and how much

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.080
is having the right eye?

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:30.990
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Remember,
we were talking

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.640
earlier about talent.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.260
I've actually looked through a
lot of other people's cameras

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.190
over the years.

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:38.065
And some people absolutely
have it,

00:53:38.065 --> 00:53:39.500
and some people don't.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.790
All right?

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:43.010
And I can't explain why that is,
other than this concept of

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.820
we all have different
talents, right?

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.180
But I've had five, six people on
this side of me, five, six

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.090
people on the side of me.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.630
We're all looking at
the same thing.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:55.290
And I go look at their cameras,
and every single one

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.640
of them is different.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.490
It's really unique, actually.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.170
It's kind of fun.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:04.706
Anything else?

00:54:04.706 --> 00:54:05.542
Yep.

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:08.110
AUDIENCE: When and why do
you choose nature to

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:09.030
be your main subject?

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.680
RODNEY LOUGH JR: When and why
do I choose nature to be my

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.890
main subject?

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.320
Have you spent much
time out there?

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.070
Yeah?

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.330
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Yes, OK.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.690
Well that would be the short
answer, wouldn't it?

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:28.410
I think that there is a
peacefulness and a calming,

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:32.320
serene feeling that
can only come from

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.480
being in these places.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:39.520
I don't know what a typical
workspace here at Google looks

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.153
like, but I'm assuming
you have a cube.

00:54:42.153 --> 00:54:44.910
You have a cube, or is it
just-- yeah, cubes.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.610
Everyone's got cubes.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.050
Let me tell you something.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:54.230
We weren't designed to work
and live in cubes.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.060
We weren't designed to
walk on concrete.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.520
We were given grass.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:02.640
That's what we're supposed
to be walking on.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.260
It's OK that not everyone gets
to do what I do, because that

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:10.340
means I don't run into as many
people when I'm out there.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.410
And I'm grateful to you guys.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:13.520
I seriously am.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.670
My guys at the studio were
working on Stand Here.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:21.750
And your Google Maps
API, they love it.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.800
If they could give you
guys a medal--

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.880
Any Google Map guys in here?

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.680
There was one, wasn't there?

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.870
Yeah, they'd give you a map--

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:29.760
or a medal.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.000
They totally would.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.890
They love you guys.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.830
But no, I do it because I
love being out there.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.150
Absolutely.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.160
I just grew up with
it, I guess.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:40.670
Yep.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.500
AUDIENCE: How many people
in your crew?

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:47.480
RODNEY LOUGH JR: I have, right
now, pushing 50 people that

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.690
work with me.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:52.130
And I say with me as opposed
to for me, because often

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.040
they're doing a lot of
things for me that I

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.580
don't even know about.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:00.010
And they can only do that
when they work with you.

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:01.640
Do you understand the-- do you
guys understand what I'm

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.680
saying, the difference of
working for somebody and

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.260
working with somebody?

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.270
My people are working with me.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.010
And I love it.

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:12.970
We've tried to create an
environment of people--

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:14.940
remember, I talked about
the two-mile rule?

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.660
Well, the people that you meet
beyond the two miles are what

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.930
I call earth muffins.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:24.110
Come on, they've got
the dreadlocks.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.600
The women don't shave
their armpits.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.450
You know what I'm
talking about?

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.350
These are earth muffins.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.360
I work--

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.410
even though they don't have
dreadlocks, and they do shave

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:36.240
their pits, I work with a
bunch of earth muffins.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.020
They're like the sweetest,
nicest people on the planet.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.330
I have a great life.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.720
I really do.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.366
One more question, then
I think we're done.

00:56:46.366 --> 00:56:49.190
AUDIENCE: So how has
this sort of--

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:51.070
I feel like in the last decade
or so, there's kind of an

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.560
increase in democratization
of photography.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.070
I feel like more people have
pro-level photography gear in

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:57.640
their hands.

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.730
More people are taking pictures
with lesser cameras,

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:01.520
all the way down to
iPhones and stuff.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.950
How is that affecting the demand
for your products in

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:04.650
your business?

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:07.050
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Actually,
it's improved it.

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:08.250
The question was--

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:09.550
I don't know if you guys
heard it or not.

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.400
There's a lot of people out
there with cameras.

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.530
There's a lot of people who
fancy themselves as

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.590
photographers.

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.370
How has that affected
my business?

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.930
Actually, it's helped it.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:24.200
Because when you look at what
other people have for the

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.700
price points that they charge,
and then you come look at

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.700
mine, it's like a no-brainer.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.190
If you've never been to my
gallery in San Francisco, it's

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.220
not that far away.

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.250
Has anyone been there?

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:39.340
OK, so you even know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.470
AUDIENCE: I think it's worth
pointing out though to people,

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.845
it's different to look at the
pictures in the gallery than

00:57:43.845 --> 00:57:44.540
it is online.

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.260
He has lighting in the gallery
that makes a big difference.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.510
And the size of the prints
make a big difference.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.270
RODNEY LOUGH JR: Let's be
clear about one thing.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.060
I take photos.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.470
You take pictures.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.200
RODNEY LOUGH JR: I'm just
messing with you, man.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.710
I don't--

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.260
he's probably like the senior
VP of all of Google or

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.940
something, isn't he?

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.760
Screwed that.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.550
AUDIENCE: Does a different
fraction--

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:09.620
is the fraction of money that
you get coming more from the

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.000
workshops and less from the
photos or anything like that?

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:12.590
RODNEY LOUGH JR: No.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.516
The fine art photography is
where I make my money.

00:58:16.516 --> 00:58:17.210
Yep.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.280
That's where we feed the
kids and pay the

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.440
orthodontist bills.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:25.080
And that's where it's at.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.520
What we're doing with Stand
Here, we actually don't know

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.000
that we're going to
make any money.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.200
We don't want to
lose any money.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.860
But by the same token,
we think it's a

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.400
greater mission, right?

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.430
It's not about making
gobs of money.

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.610
It's about making people's
lives better.

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.280
In the end, that's ultimately
what I want to be remembered

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.430
by, protecting truly beautiful
places and making people's

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:50.880
lives better.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.613
Is that such a horrible thing
to have on your tombstone?

00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.510
I don't think so.

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:58.040
All right, I think we're done.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.590
I want to thank you guys
for having me out.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:00.840
Really appreciate it.
