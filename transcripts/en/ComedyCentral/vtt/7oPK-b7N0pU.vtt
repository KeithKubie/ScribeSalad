00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.635
We're off this week but
just like cocaine Mitch

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.004
the deep state
never sleeps.

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.139
You can bet the mainstream media

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.609
will keep attacking Trump
and his allies all week long.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.110
I predicted ten news stories

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.679
sure to come from
the lying press this week

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:15.181
and I'm going to
preemptively strike

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.984
each one of them
down in under 90 seconds.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.552
Chuck clock me,

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.120
And go.

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:24.190
Giuliani's eyes popped
out of his skull on Hannity

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:26.059
and started rolling
around on the floor.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.227
And then he got on his hands
and knees looking for them

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.930
and accidently smushed one
that was a tactical move.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.000
Laura Ingraham
was only joking

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.535
when she cyberbullied the kids

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.870
in that burn unit.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.874
That Thing CNN said
Trump said didn't happen.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.110
But if it did happen it
shouldn't have gotten leaked

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.879
and if it did get leaked
you shouldn't have read it.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.049
And if you did read it what are
you some kind of a nerd.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.819
Tucker was just being
intellectually curious

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.488
when he invited seven members
of the KKK on a show

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.557
and then cut his own Mic

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.193
so they could do whatever
they wanted for the full hour.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:04.363
Relaxwhen Tomi Loren
live streamed herself

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.698
kicking that newborn deer.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.934
It was just a metaphor
for the forgotten man.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.071
Judge Jeanine Pirro getting
struck by lightning four times

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.107
in a row mean
she's touched by God.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.376
There's no way Kellyanne
could have known

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.713
that her new jacket
was made of all those
dalmations.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.750
Mike Pence is 100 percent
comfortable with women.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.087
He just thinks theme parks
would be safer that way.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:33.025
Dana Lash did not I repeat did
not turn into a flock of ravens

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.595
and knock over that old lady
that's just fake was.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.764
The fact that the American flag

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.000
and Ted Cruz's lawns
spontaneously burst

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.468
into flames
is not a metaphor

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.871
and has nothing to do
with all of the flowers dying

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.607
and the sound you hear
of distant babies screams.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.979
Nailed it.
Seconds to spare.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.981
The inefensible defendant and
the fight continues in one week.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.182
Try to make it that long.
