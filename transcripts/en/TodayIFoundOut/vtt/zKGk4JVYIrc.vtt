00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.040
How Much Caffeine Would it Take to Kill You?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.440
There are several factors that make this a
tricky question.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.220
Not everyone reacts the same way to caffeine.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.210
People also become tolerant to it and so the
effects can be different from person to person.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.339
Lastly, there would be no respectable researcher
who would dare perform a study on humans,

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.859
if the goal of that study is death to that
same person.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.820
All that being said, there are some very good
studies that have allowed doctors to understand

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.930
what’s going on inside the body in caffeine
overdoses.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.329
They also have been able to presume the approximate
dose that would prove fatal for the average

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.329
person.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.980
So while the exact dose is almost impossible
to answer for a given individual, I can tell

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.579
you the highest caffeine dose ever ingested
by someone who survived was a mere 100 grams.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.270
Although that might not sound like that much,
in terms of raw amount of caffeine, it should

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.640
be noted that that’s the amount of caffeine
in about 1,200 cups of coffee!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.060
While lesser doses would probably kill many,
we can safely say that’s around the upper

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060
bar.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.070
So you might now be wondering how exactly
caffeine can be fatal to a person, in terms

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.460
of what exactly is going on in the body when
high doses of caffeine are ingested.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.950
Caffeine is one of several naturally occurring
substances known as Xanthines.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.720
Xanthines are among other things, central
nervous system (CNS) stimulants.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.490
Caffeine, specifically, is in over 60 known
plant species.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.899
It’s the most widely consumed psychoactive
substance in the world.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.030
Depending on which study you read, approximately
80-90% of the US population consumes at least

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.990
200mg per day.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.360
In low doses, it has many benefits that can
help with things like pain management, water

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.890
retention, alertness, and a general feeling
of wellbeing, to name a few.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.060
As with most CNS stimulants, the higher the
dose, the more profound the reaction.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.820
As you consume more caffeine, the risks begin
to outweigh the benefits.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.040
A person can become jittery, anxious, begin
having high blood pressure, chest pain, headaches,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.530
dehydration, and unfortunately, dependence
that causes withdrawals if you don’t continue

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.590
consuming it.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.069
In toxic doses, caffeine can cause extremely
low blood pressures, seizures, cardiac rhythm

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.500
problems, and lactic acidosis.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.110
While there appears to be some dissension
among researchers as to exactly how xanthines,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.020
like caffeine, cause the reactions they do.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.190
What is known is that they antagonize what
are known as adenosine-receptors within almost

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.379
every cell in the body.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.190
Adenosine is a chemical present in every human
cell.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.819
It combines with other chemicals like phosphate
to create numerous compounds that help cells

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.090
work properly.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.140
Those compounds need to attach to their receptors
to affect cells.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.459
There are 4 main groups of adensonine receptors
within the body and their effects can fall

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.540
into four categories.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
Generally speaking, adenosine compounds help
in increasing the oxygen available to cells,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.680
protect against the damage caused by a lack
of oxygen, help in initiating the body’s

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.760
natural anti-inflammatory responses, and help
in the creation of blood vessels.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.590
Caffeine is similar to adenosine in chemical
composition, and as such, can attach to adenosine

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.860
receptors not allowing adenosine compounds
to perform normally.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.740
The result is CNS and cardiac stimulation,
relaxation of the smooth muscles, and a diuretic

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.459
action on the kidneys that can lead to dehydration.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.010
Thus, in high levels, caffeine can be very
toxic.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.599
It will bind to adenosine receptor sites known
as subtypes A1 and A2.

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.060
The result is seizures.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.629
In high doses, it will also inhibit an enzyme
known as phosphodiesterase, while stimulating

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.350
the release of neurotransmitters involved
in your fight or flight nervous system.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.900
The result is extremely fast heart rates,
dilation of your blood vessels causing low

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.709
blood pressures, low potassium levels that
can cause lethal heart rhythms, the breakdown

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.540
of sugars in your liver, and an increase in
your white blood cells.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.610
If all that doesn’t seem like it’s deadly
enough, those side effects will cause their

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.829
own problems.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.890
Specifically, lactic acidosis will be caused
by your body’s tissues not getting enough

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.170
oxygen because your blood pressure is too
low.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.790
The result of your seizures, low oxygen levels
within your cells, and an inevitable calcium

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.220
release from an area of your cells called
your endoplasmic reticulum will give you what

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.160
is known as rhabdomyolysis- this is a breakdown
of your muscles causing a release of your

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.000
muscle fibers into your bloodstream (brown
pee and clogged kidneys anyone!).

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.590
If you’re thinking “I’m never drinking
that nectar from Satan again”, don’t worry,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.110
those toxic reactions won’t happen at normal
consumption levels.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.600
Don’t just take my word for it; according
to the FDA, moderate amounts of caffeine,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.260
around 100-200mg a day is not harmful.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.670
They are quick to point out, however, that
caffeine will affect people differently based

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.390
on weight, sex, age, and sensitivity.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.320
They also state that 600mg or more per day
is not recommended.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.160
So unfortunately, when it comes to caffeine,
I can’t tell you the exact dose that will

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.850
kill you, other than to say the highest known
dose survived by anyone to date is about 100g.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.290
I will, however, repeat the advice that works
for just about anything you choose to put

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.610
in your body, “everything in moderation”.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.880
If you decide you want to consume 4 energy
drinks and follow it with 3 chocolate bars

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.510
and some Starbucks coffee ice cream, anxiety,
chest pain, and headaches are what you can

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.790
expect, at the least.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:06:16.520
That and an increased waist size!
