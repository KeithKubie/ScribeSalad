00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.210
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.040
Today we're joined by Arlene
Blum, celebrated aplinist

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680
and biophysical chemist.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.380
As a mountaineer, she led
the first all-female ascent

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.930
of Annapurna, one of the
14 8,000-meter peaks.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.450
On Denali, she co-led the
first women's team climb.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.950
She was the first American
woman to attempt Mount Everest

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.290
and completed the great
Himalayan Traverse

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.720
across Bhutan, Nepal, and India.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.380
As a scientist, she's worked
as a tireless advocate

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.030
for consumer safety.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.480
Her research has focused on
the use of toxic chemicals

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.040
in everyday products.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.950
This work has led to bans on
carcinogenic flame retardants

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.640
in children's sleepwear
and household furniture.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.360
Currently, she serves as
Executive Director of the Green

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.130
Science Policy Institute
and is a visiting scholar

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.720
at UC Berkeley's
Department of Chemistry.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.330
Today, she will share stories
of climbing and policy

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.280
from her memoir, "Breaking
Trail: A Climbing Life."

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.954
Please join me in
welcoming Arlene Blum.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:05.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.920
Well, it's really great
to be here sharing

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.720
adventures in both science
and mountain climbing.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.750
Because I suspect many of
you have your own adventures

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.070
in things relating to
science, and it probably

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.330
feels like mountain climbing.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.890
Some of you might
be looking at me

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.440
and thinking that I seem
like a regular person,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.560
and how did I start doing
all those crazy things.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.390
So I will start back
where it all started.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.330
That's my freshman chemistry
lab at Reed College.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.660
And my chemistry professor
was a young woman.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.580
She was 23.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.915
She had a Ph.D. From MIT
and thought chemistry

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.840
was the neatest
subject on the planet.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.370
There were four
girls in my class,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.890
and we all got
doctorates in chemistry,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.090
which says something about
the importance of role models.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.671
Also, my chemistry lab partner
was a very handsome young man

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.379
from Portland who was
a mountain climber.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.902
And late one starry
night, he said,

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:14.360
do you want to go
climb Mount Hood?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.320
And he was very
handsome, so I said sure.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.510
And we drove up to
Timberline Lodge,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.910
and he put a big
pack on my back.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.890
I was from Chicago.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.250
I'd never done anything
very physical in my life.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.595
I started gasping.

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.470
He later said he didn't
think I'd make it out

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.290
of the parking lot.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.900
But he was very handsome.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.690
I was very determined.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.185
And we got up on the snow.

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:38.730
It was the most
beautiful place I'd been.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.900
I fell in love with him
and with mountain climbing,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.640
and started a life of
mountains and molecules--

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.680
or we said peaks, public
policy, and public health.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.390
So I continue doing expeditions.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.940
Back in those days, the
world's highest mountains

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180
had not been climbed
much by women.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.810
And indeed, when I applied
to go on an expedition

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.710
to Denali, the highest
mountain in North America,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.510
I was told that
women didn't have

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.735
the physical strength
or emotional stability

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.730
to climb mountains like Denali.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.550
So this is the first all women's
expedition on top of Denali,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.620
which I took the picture,
so I'm not in it.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.750
And so I continued doing
mountains and molecules.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.210
And then things really changed
on this beautiful mountain

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.010
in India.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.910
Now, doesn't this look like
an easy, beautiful mountain?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.720
Wouldn't you all
like to be there?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.480
It's nearly 24,000 feet,
but it's gentle snow slopes.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.670
And we're climbing
this mountain,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.000
and got up to near the top.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.200
It was our summit day.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.760
And I'm kind of a slow
climber, so the others

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.730
got to the top first.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.160
And when I got to
the top, someone

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.770
said, what happened to Bruce,
who had gotten there first?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.770
And Bruce had walked along
here to what was here,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.070
which was snow, but was
actually a cornice where

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.270
the snow is over a rock face.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.000
And the cornice broke,
and he fell to his death.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.890
And Bruce was the country's
leading young rock climber.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.870
He had pioneered the
hardest routes in Yosemite

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.520
without using pitons.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.730
And it was just
unbelievable that he

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.290
died on this easy but
high mountain in India.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.790
So when that happened,
I got very depressed.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.440
At the time, I was a
postdoc at Stanford

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.340
studying how proteins fold.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.430
And that seemed
really irrelevant.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.880
And I wanted to do something
for the environment

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.320
in Bruce's memory.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.190
And so I went to a
professor of mine

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.090
at Berkeley, [INAUDIBLE]
Committee, Bruce Aimes,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.100
and said, is there anything I
can do to help the environment?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.210
And he said, well, why don't
you look at the flame retardants

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.700
in children's sleepwear?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.770
He said, right now, pretty
much all the kids in America

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.050
are wearing pajamas that are
10% by weight a flame retardant

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.500
called brominated tris.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.470
And I think it might get from
the pajamas into the children,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.770
and it's a cancer-causing
chemical, I think.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.560
And so that seemed a little
weird to me, flame retardants.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.090
But I was depressed, so I
thought I want to do something.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.360
So I found a little
girl who had never

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.440
worn tris-treated pajamas.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.310
And we put her in the pajamas
and collected her urine.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.910
And the first morning
she wore them,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.565
she had tris products
in her urine.

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:27.140
And she wore them
for three days.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.400
The level of tris in
her urine went up,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.640
and she stopped wearing
them, and it went down.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.850
So it meant the tris was
getting into the little girl.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.060
And then we ran a screening test
to see if tris was a mutagen.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.900
Did it change DNA?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.420
And it was one of the strongest
mutagens ever studied.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.150
So this was a huge worry.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.500
And we thought, oh my goodness.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.070
We need to tell the
parents of America

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.110
that most of the
kids in the country

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.080
are wearing pajamas
that are 10% by weight

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.690
this harmful chemical.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.994
So about that time, I got
invited to go to this mountain.

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:04.410
Do you know what
mountain this is?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.200
Anybody know?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.510
Mount Everest.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.790
It's the highest
mountain in the world.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.720
And at that point,
no American woman

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.760
had ever even had a chance to
try to climb Mount Everest.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.080
So I was like, wow, this
is such an opportunity.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.620
And I didn't know what to do.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.910
Should I stay and
write the paper

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.350
about the tris-treated
pajamas, or should I

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.160
go try to climb Mount Everest?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.730
So I can't help but ask.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.630
How many of you would
have stayed and written

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.290
the paper about the
tris-treated pajamas?

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.890
Most of you.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.020
How many of you would have
gone to Mount Everest?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.550
Even more.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.830
Well, I did both.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.890
So I did go to Mount Everest.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.810
And when I was climbing
in the Khumbu Icefall,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.350
every night, I'd
write the paper.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.430
And then up in the
great Western Cwm,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.880
we'd put stringing
ladders, and making

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.190
our way amongst the
crevasses, and we'd

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.800
get up steep ice faces.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.650
And every night, I'd
keep working on the paper

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.510
until I reached my high point.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.010
Here I am at about
24 5 on Everest.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.400
And my summit flag, The
Mutants, has a Petri dish.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.489
Without tris, there
are only two colonies,

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:23.530
because it's a mutagen.
And this one you can see.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.571
It's blowing in the wind.

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:28.570
That's the tris Petri dish
with many bacterial colonies.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.220
So this was October of 1976.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.470
And we did reach the summit.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.810
We were the second
American expedition.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.980
Now people reach the
summit all the time.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.590
But the first American
expedition was '63,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.580
and we were the
second one in '76,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.050
so it was much less [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.841
And we had the whole
mountain to ourselves.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.520
Only one expedition on Mount
Everest, which is a little bit

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.300
different nowadays.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.150
So I finished the paper.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.260
I sent it by mail
runner to Kathmandu.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.000
And it was published in Science
Magazine a couple months later.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.630
And if you read the
subtitle of the paper,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.420
the main flame retardant in
children's pajamas is a mutagen

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.620
and should not be used.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.760
Now, that's a little bit of
an unusual title for a paper.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.310
If any of you--
I'm sure you have--

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.510
if you read scientific
papers, they

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.040
tend to have the
same recommendation

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.742
at the end, almost invariably.

00:08:23.742 --> 00:08:25.450
And what's that
recommendation at the end

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.980
of all scientific papers?

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.370
What is the next step?

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.130
More studies.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.630
And it's always more studies.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.270
And it tends not to be something
like a chemical should not

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.539
be used in kids' pajamas.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.909
And at the Green Science
Policy Institute,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:48.020
our goal is to really help
inspire, encourage scientists

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.830
to take their research and tell
people what needs to be done.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.550
Because scientists are
the ones who really know.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.810
They understand the
science, and then they

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.810
understand what
needs to be done.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.410
And we believe that scientists
have a responsibility

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.420
to share their science in
a way that affects change,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.920
particularly if they're
working on harmful chemicals.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.580
And it works.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.220
Scientists are very respected.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.900
When they speak
up, things happen.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.560
This was January
of 1977 where we

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.840
called for tris not being
used in kid's pajamas.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.750
And April 1977, tris was
banned from kid's pajamas,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.810
just like it should be.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.530
And that was a
really good thing,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.270
because whole generations
of kids only wore it.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.030
It was only used for
a couple of years,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.850
which is a very good thing.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.170
So however, when a
chemical is banned,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.970
there's a big
tendency to replace it

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.080
with another chemical that's
very similar, because industry

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.400
likes to keep processes
as similar as possible.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.540
It makes sense.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.200
It was funny.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.170
I remember about six
months after the tris ban,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.470
I thought, I wonder
what they're using now,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.020
if they're still using tris.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.360
So I remember I rode I rode my
bicycle to Penny's, downtown

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.390
Berkeley, and I bought
20 pairs of pajamas

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.190
in all different sizes.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.949
And the sales lady
just gushed at me,

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:06.490
oh, you have such
a nice, big family.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.090
And I sort of felt like a
super spy with all my pajamas.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.600
And I thought, well, these
might make nice shower presents

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.350
for my friends.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.270
So I just took a
little fabric out

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.390
of the inseam of each pajama.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.682
But I actually didn't need
to bother, since none of them

00:10:20.682 --> 00:10:22.390
would I have wanted
to give for presents.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.080
And then I analyzed
what was in them.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.490
And not surprisingly,
about a third of them

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.030
had brominated interest,
because it takes time

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.430
for the market to turn over.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.410
But then nearly 2/3 of
them had a new chemical

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.550
which turned out to be
chlorinated tris, almost

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.680
identical.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.110
And so we went, oh my god.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.790
So we ran more
immunogenicity tests,

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.190
and chlorinated tris was also
a mutagen. It changed DNA.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.070
And we wrote another
paper in Science,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.250
and chlorinated tris was
removed from pajamas.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.310
However, what we
didn't know then

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:04.110
is it continued to be used,
for example, in furniture.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.160
And in 2005, when a
very bad flame retardant

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.870
was banned from use
in our furniture,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.050
it was replaced with
chlorinated tris,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.270
which was then banned in 2012.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.780
But if any of you
have a couch that

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.500
was purchased between
2006 and 2012--

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.890
anyone have a couch
purchased during that time?

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.430
Anyway, there's about a 3/4
chance that your couch-- 5%

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.562
of the weight of the foam
will be chlorinated tris.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.520
So if you have 20 pounds
of foam in your couch,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.330
you have about a pound of
this chemical in your couch.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.610
Not the best.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.440
But we didn't know it back then.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.170
And back then, I thought
it was really time

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.890
to give women a chance to climb
one of the world's highest

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.420
mountains.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.660
So in the '70s, all the
world's 8,000-meter peaks--

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.150
there are 14 of them.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.220
The highest mountains in the
world had been climbed by men,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.080
and no woman had
climbed that high.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.230
And I thought, women
should have a chance.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.300
We had done pretty
well on Everest.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.250
So I got a permit for Annapurna
on my way back from Everest,

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.710
and I thought, it's the first
of the 8,000-meter peaks ever

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.630
climbed, among the lowest.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.950
It must be one of the
safest and easiest.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.770
But as it turned out,
there wasn't so much

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.420
research in those days.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.370
So guess which is the
most dangerous of all

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.980
the 8,000-meter peaks?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.430
Annapurna.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.540
And which has the
highest fatality rate

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.620
and is considered, perhaps,
the most difficult to climb?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.760
Anyway, we didn't know that.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.190
But we found out.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.830
So this is our team.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.420
We had 10 climbers, a couple
filmmakers, a base camp

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.140
manager.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.010
We're all still friends.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.700
There are copies
here afterwards-- I'm

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.290
happy to sign copies of
"Annapurna" or "Breaking

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.400
Trail" for people.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.090
And "Annapurna" has just
been reprinted, September 15.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.016
Sierra Club Books had
been out of business,

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:07.140
and the book had been out
of press for a few years,

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.335
so it's just back in press.

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:09.710
And we're all
going to be getting

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.460
together for an Annapurna
book party next month.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.380
And I have to say,
when we get together,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.870
it feels like we're
back on the glacier

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.850
just like it did
a long time ago.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.900
So climbing Annapurna
was incredibly beautiful.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.125
I'll just share a
few of the pictures.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.530
The beauty is extraordinary, but
the climbing was really tough.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.340
And there were huge storms.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.230
The reason it's such
a dangerous mountain

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.270
is very high precipitation.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:43.390
And these huge snowfalls
led to huge avalanches.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.010
So it was a very
dangerous place.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.870
Ever since I became a mom, I
haven't wanted to go there.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.290
But wonderful climbing.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.810
And we did reach the summit.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.370
We were the first women,
the first Americans.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.560
We reached the summit
with two Sherpa climbers.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.910
We unfurled our flags,
held together with a Save

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.420
the Whales pin, and
we felt content then

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.440
we had achieved our goal.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.910
But we tragically
lost two of our team

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.370
on a second summit attempt.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.940
So climbing Annapurna is a
very, very dangerous thing.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.460
I wrote this book,
"Annapurna: A Woman's Place,"

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.650
which now, as I said, it's
just been reissued this week.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.100
And then I wrote another
book, "Breaking Trail,"

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.330
trying to understand how
my childhood and my life

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.840
had led to both my scientific
research and my mountain

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.740
climbing.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:41.040
And when I finished "Breaking
Trail," it was in 2006.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.510
I had spent 20 years
writing "Breaking Trail."

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.190
I twas like a personal
therapy project.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.410
It was a lot of work trying
to understand my family.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.180
And I had just
finished the book.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.490
My daughter was
starting college.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.960
I thought I'd really would like
to go back to doing science.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.470
But I actually stopped
being a scientist in 1980

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.840
to walk across the whole
Himalayan mountain range.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.720
I have a job at UC Berkeley.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.440
I said, I want to
take a year off

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.649
to walk across the Himalayas.

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:10.523
And they were like,
well, you have to decide.

00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:12.610
Do you want your chemistry
job or the Himalayas?

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.370
So I chose the
Himalayas in 1980.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.240
And many things intervened.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.300
It was 2006, 26 years later.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.110
And the last sentence
of "Breaking Trail"

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:31.120
is the future is like
an unbroken snow slope.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.350
I hope I can find a way to
break trail to a better world.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.200
But I actually really didn't
know what I was going to do,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.224
because we hadn't done
science for 26 years.

00:15:40.224 --> 00:15:42.140
I thought, well, maybe
I can get a job washing

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.350
test tubes in a lab.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.740
I thought I must be
completely out of date.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.300
But that was nine years ago.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.800
And the last nine years,
I have felt every day

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.450
like I was climbing Annapurna.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.110
I've been on my life's
greatest adventure.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.980
And it's been really
similar, because we're

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.620
working with a great team of
scientists and businesspeople

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.260
all over the world.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.860
A bunch of people in Google
are on the same team.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.440
Really working together for
healthier and safer products.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.650
And it's a real challenge,
but a real opportunity.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.130
So I felt incredibly
lucky that I could not

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:26.010
do science for 26 years and then
come back and be able to really

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.190
try to climb this mountain.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.470
And the reason that we're
all climbing this mountain

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.790
is there is a big problem.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.830
And that is-- I sometimes
ask this question.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.340
I bet you'll know the answer.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.150
But what do you
think-- do you think

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.320
if you have chemicals
in your shampoo

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.667
or your toothpaste
or your chair,

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.750
anyone think the government
is making sure they're

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.850
safe for their your health?

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.950
You all know not.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.500
But most people do think that.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.150
I used to think that.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.110
And the government actually
can't, because they

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.590
don't have the authority.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.460
There's only one
law about chemicals

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.824
before they go out in the world.

00:17:02.824 --> 00:17:04.240
Once they're out
in the world, you

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.410
have a Clean Air Act,
a Clean Water Act,

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.579
but you can't really
bring them back in.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.930
So the only law before
they go out in the world

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.869
is called the Toxic
Substances Control Act.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.869
It passed in 1976.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:21.740
62,000 chemicals were
grandfathered, like you're OK.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.770
And even a chemical like
asbestos that kills 10,000

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.670
people a year cannot be
controlled by the EPA.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.360
And you might say asbestos,
there are asbestos lawsuits.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.075
Asbestos is illegal.

00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:36.120
Well, asbestos is not illegal.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.060
There are lawsuits.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.040
And there's a rare
form of cancer

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.680
called mesothelioma
that's only associated

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.670
with asbestos exposure.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.640
So if you're an asbestos worker
or the spouse of an asbestos

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.500
worker and you get
mesothelioma, you

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.810
can sue the asbestos
industry that that's

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.980
the reason for your disease.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.850
And you'll probably win the
case, but you also will die.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.680
Everybody that gets
mesothelioma dies.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.600
And that's not a good way
to regulate chemicals.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.430
And that's how we regulate
asbestos, through lawsuits.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.660
By then, it's really late.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.920
So the 62,000 chemicals
nobody can do anything

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.200
about-- there have been 20,000
new industrial chemicals.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.400
No data is required.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.420
Most of them have
no health data.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.760
2/3 have no data at all.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.930
The EPA has six weeks to try
to show harm with no data.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.360
And if they do show
harm, the company

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.210
has several years to try to
prove their chemical is OK,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.540
and they can sell it
during those several years

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.540
to raise the money
for the testing.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.150
And once they're out
there selling it,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.000
it's really hard to stop it.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.380
So basically-- and
indeed, I'm going

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.650
to speak at the EPA tomorrow.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.577
In fact, if anyone
wants to hear my talk,

00:18:54.577 --> 00:18:56.160
you can tell them
10 o'clock tomorrow,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.070
I'll be speaking by the
post office at the main EPA

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.600
building.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.870
So if you ASK the EPA, they
say we can't even ban asbestos.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:05.600
They say that.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.550
It's really a problem.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.250
Another problem--
and in fact, this

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.200
leads to what two brilliant
pediatricians, Herb Needleman

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.270
and Phil Landrigan, said--
that we are de facto conducting

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.235
a human toxicological trial.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.850
Our children and our
children's children

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.070
are the experimental subjects.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.900
So if these chemicals aren't
tested in any other way,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.820
they're tested on us.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.320
And that's not a
good thing to do.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.060
And they do contribute
to increased rates

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.390
of cancer, infertility,
neurological impairments.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.470
So another problem
is what we call

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.430
the regrettable
substitution problem.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.240
If after a lot of work,
a chemical is regulated,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.530
the substitute is often
the chemical cousin.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.910
For example, over here, we
have-- if you know chemistry,

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.690
we've got decabromo,
10 bromines, diphenly,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.940
two phenyl rings.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.027
Decabrominated
diphenyl ether, that's

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:15.000
an ether bond with the
oxygen in the middle.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.760
And it's persistent,
bioaccumulative, and toxic.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.190
And about 15% of the weight to
the plastic in an average TV

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.010
is decabromodiphenyl ether.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.020
It's used in fabric back
coatings, many uses.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.940
Due to its severe persistence,
bioaccumulation and toxicity,

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.370
the deca ether has
been phased out.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.380
But what's the substitute?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.120
Decabrominated diphenyl ethane.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.680
So there's an ethane
bond instead of an ether.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.070
It's also persistent,
bioaccumulative,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.130
and appears to be toxic.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.730
So as the deca
ether sales go down,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.480
the deca ethane sales go up.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.000
Is that a good deal?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.480
Not much improvement.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.920
So it's a discouraging
situation.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.850
However-- everyone is looking
depressed but me, right?

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:12.040
Because I think there are
things that can be done.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.260
And to solve this
problem, we decided

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.440
to bring together scientists who
cared passionately about this

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.560
to really focus on
what could be done.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.280
And so we have had
a series of retreats

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.200
where we invite five
scientists from industry,

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.280
five from academia, five from
NGOs, and five from government.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.510
So it's about 20
scientists, maybe 25.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.730
And at the first retreat,
we said, are there

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.230
certain chemicals,
certain chemical families,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.720
that we know are harmful
that can be avoided?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.460
A simpler way of
thinking of this.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.610
When you think of
that 80,000 chemicals,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.440
it sounds kind of daunting.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.680
All you can do is put your
head down and get poison.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.650
Because who can deal
with 80,000 chemicals?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.480
So we came up with six classes.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.530
And this is a solution
that really invites action.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:15.140
And so briefly, the classes are
highly fluorinated chemicals.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.610
These are stain and water
repellents, like Scotchguard.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.150
Let me just ask-- how
many of you knew or know--

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.330
and by the way,
there's a handout

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.290
at the back when you leave that
lists all the classes and more

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.350
information about them.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.100
But let me see.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.950
How many of you know
that Scotchguard is

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.300
a problem in these chemicals?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.310
OK.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.130
One person who
works in this area.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.220
But when people know, they
can make better choices.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.570
The next class is the
chlorinated antimicrobials,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.920
like triclosan and triclocarban
approach ban liquids soaps.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.120
Who knew about them?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.740
A couple people.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.320
Then we have the
flame retardants.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.960
Who's heard about
the flame retardants?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.230
OK.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.063
You've all heard about
the flame retardants.

00:22:59.063 --> 00:23:00.230
We have bisphenols.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.130
Remember those bisphenol
A water bottles?

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.340
Phthalates, organic
solvents, certain metals.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.190
And you look at
this list-- this is

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.230
most of the harmful chemicals
in everyday products.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:16.050
And when you know they're there
and you know what they are,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.990
you can make safe choices
and avoid their use.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.270
And even more than
that, we want to ask

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.530
if they're in that class, is
this chemical really necessary?

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.630
So if the chemical that makes
a carpet stain repellent

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.050
is a highly fluorinated
chemical that's quite toxic

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.000
and never breaks down
for geologic time,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.740
maybe if you say
to a mom, you can

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.250
have a stain-repellent
carpet, but the chemical

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.040
is going into your
baby's body and staying,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.720
what would the mom say?

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.360
Maybe she might say,
it's not worth it.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.690
It's not worth it.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.690
So I believe just asking
these questions-- do

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.260
we really need it?

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.340
Is it necessary?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.990
You can stop the use of a
big chunk of these chemicals,

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.860
really reduce their use.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.850
And then if you think
they're necessary

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.160
and they're worth it, then say,
is there a safer alternative

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.920
and really invest in
that safer alternative.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.830
So we've heard about green
chemistry for a very long time.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.675
It's been around for 20 years.

00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:21.250
A classic book was written
by John Warner, who's here

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.294
in Boston, and Paul Anastas.

00:24:24.294 --> 00:24:25.210
And it's a great idea.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.260
Everybody loves it.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.890
But it's not happening
as much as it should.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.930
And so if a kind of
function is needed

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.790
and you really
want that function,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.860
then invest in green chemistry,
not in moving to the chemical

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.860
cousin.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.930
We have a webinar serious
about these six classes.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.750
They're 15-minute webinars.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.780
There's a flier in the back.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.570
And when we played the webinar
series and we ran them live,

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.590
about 1,200 people signed up.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.370
And they were from many of the
retailers and manufacturers

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.830
across the country.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.790
And amazing things happened.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.370
There was a webinar
on antimicrobials,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.710
and after it was on, someone
some Target called and said,

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.980
we had no idea that we had
triclosan in our personal care

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.680
line, and we're taking it out.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.320
And they just took
it out right away.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.040
So companies can
do that overnight.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.785
For government, it's
much, much harder.

00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:20.160
So if you want to
learn more, you

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.230
can listen to this
webinar series.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.350
Purchasers are key.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.530
Manufacturers of
consumer products

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.350
can just stop using
toxics in their products,

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.350
and that is starting to happen.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.210
Large retailers
can say, we're not

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.200
going to sell-- IKEA
is our leading example.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.580
IKEA has said no more
fluorinated chemicals.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.310
Almost all the six
classes IKEA is not

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.860
putting in any of
their products,

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.640
which is really inspiring.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.210
And then corporate
big buyers can say,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.440
we're not going to
purchase products

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.190
with these harmful
classes of chemicals.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.050
And consumers-- consumers
is a hard group to reach.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.420
They get many messages.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.000
They're pretty busy.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.305
So we prefer to work
with some of the larger

00:26:05.305 --> 00:26:06.513
purchasers and manufacturers.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.172
And the actions
for manufacturers

00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:14.350
is to come together and
say, we want disclosure.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.650
We want to know what's
in our products.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.560
And then we want to really ask
if harmful chemicals are needed

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.800
and ask for products
without them.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.460
And if that's not possible,
invest in green chemistry.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.690
So a very cool thing is
there's a Buyer's Club out

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.770
in California, and
Google is a member along

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.270
with Kaiser and Facebook
and all these companies.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.900
And they've all come together
with their tens of billions

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.930
of dollars of collective
purchasing power to say,

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.480
we want transparency
for manufacturers.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.450
We want to know
what's in products.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.080
And then we're going to come
together and buy safer products

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.830
with less toxics.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.310
And that's really exciting.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.990
I know I just spoke at
Harvard earlier today,

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.640
and Harvard says they want to
organize a Buyer's Club here

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.340
in the Northeast
and see if they can

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:05.240
get MIT and other
educational institutions.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.760
Oberlin is talking about
trying to organize one

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.730
in the Midwest with a lot
of the small schools there.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.990
So buyers clubs can
be really powerful

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.770
and can really move the market.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.180
Here's Harvard saying
they want to make

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.150
a buyer's club targeting
harmful chemicals on campus.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.980
So we're going to talk now
about flame retardants.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.150
That's how I started
doing all this.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.140
And the reason they're
there is back in the '70s,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.670
standards were made for
products-- children sleepwear,

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.590
furniture, foam plastic
building insulation.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.280
And these standards led to
the use of flame retardants.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.110
And nobody asked
if the standards

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.230
provided a fire safety
benefit or asked

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.730
about the harm of the chemicals.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.820
And with flame retardants,
the only way to change things

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.780
is to change standards.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.690
Changing the chemicals
doesn't work.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.630
There's always a
chemical cousin.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:03.920
But if the standards change,
then you no longer need them.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.760
Back to people's couches.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.690
Several of you bought your
couches between 2005 and 2012,

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.470
and you have chlorinated
tris, the same chemical that

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.930
was removed from kid's pajamas.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.150
And the reason is a
California standard

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.580
called Technical Bulletin 117.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.370
If you go home, you lift the
center cushion of your couch,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.800
you'll probably see a
label that says TB 117.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.630
And this is not a very
effective standard.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.010
It requires the foam
inside the furniture

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.900
to resist a very small
flame for 12 seconds.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.520
So if you think about
that, what happens if you

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.990
drop a candle on your couch?

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.590
What burns first?

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.920
The fabric.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.190
And when the fabric burns,
you have a large flame,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.950
and then the foam burns
in two or three seconds.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.080
And when foam is treated with
flame retardants and it burns,

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.540
it gives off a lot more
smoke and toxic gases.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.410
And what kills people
in fires is soot, smoke,

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.140
and toxic gases.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.390
And so Technical Bulletin 117
has been around since 1975,

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:14.920
and there's no data to show that
it's provided any fire safety.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.740
But it has instead ended up
that the toxic flame retardant

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.250
chemicals are in most
Americans' bodies.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.680
So if you bought your
couch before 2004-- anybody

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.801
have a couch from before 2004?

00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:31.300
OK.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.350
Well, those are worse.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:39.880
Because they all have a
very harmful chemical--

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.900
pentabrominated diphenyl
ether, a big mouthful.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.950
But the top picture up there
is polybrominated biphenyl,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.620
a PBB or PCB.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.430
Those are toxic.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.610
They're persistent.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.760
PCBs are not good molecules.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.480
If instead of having
a covalent bond,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.200
you have an ether bond
between your rings,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.230
then you have a
polybrominated biphenyl ether.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.010
And if you burn or oxidize,
that becomes another ether bond.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.670
This is a dioxin and a furan.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.270
So this is the
flame retardant that

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:22.190
was used from 1975 until
2004 to meet TB 117.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:29.010
It's halfway in structure
between a dioxin and a PCB.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.200
Not a great molecule to have
in your home, in your dust,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.990
in your body.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.040
And in fact, we had a group
of Berkeley summer students

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.630
studying chemistry
and policy at Berkeley

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.800
collecting [INAUDIBLE] samples
and getting them analyzed.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.850
And one of the professors
said, the students

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.580
should not touch that
PBDE flame retardant

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.020
except wearing full
gear and a fume hood.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.070
And I'm like, but it's
in everybody's furniture.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.320
So that is an unfortunate thing.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.710
And almost all the
use of the chemical

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.810
has been in North
America, in large part

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.080
to meet this standard.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.700
But it has traveled the
world, this global pollutant.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.240
So when we make these sorts of
chemicals, they go all over.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.840
There are hundreds of
animal studies showing

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.360
neurological and reproductive
harm from the penta chemical.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.590
And about two weeks
ago, studies were

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.190
finalized showing it
indeed does cause cancer.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:30.060
In humans, if pregnant
women have higher levels,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.430
it takes them longer
to become pregnant.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.430
And during critical windows
of brain development,

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:41.040
their thyroid hormones are
altered so that their children

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.670
will have lower birth
rate, impaired attention,

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.030
poor coordination,
and lowered IQ.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.180
So the average California child
has lost four to five IQ points

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.336
just from this flame
retardant penta.

00:31:53.336 --> 00:31:56.820
An economist
calculated a $9 billion

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.380
loss in earning power in
California children due to IQ

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.770
loss from penta, which is
one of the many, many harms

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.550
from this chemical.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.270
So how does the
chemical end up in us?

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:15.630
It's a semi-volatile
organic chemical, an SVOC.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.660
So it's continually
coming out of furniture,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.780
dropping into dust.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.320
And if eat a sandwich, you
have some dust on your fingers,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.570
you eat a little bit
of dust, the penta

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.130
ends up inside of you.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.600
Children, toddlers
who crawl on the dust,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.460
put their hands in
their mouth, tend

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.570
to have three to
five times higher

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.030
levels than their parents,
which is not a good thing.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.609
And cats have up to
100 times higher level

00:32:43.609 --> 00:32:44.400
compared to humans.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.072
Why would cats have
such a high level?

00:32:47.072 --> 00:32:48.530
Because of their
grooming behavior.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.470
So as I said, no fire safety
benefit, serious harm.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.850
We came to realize that
TB 117, the standard

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.220
could be changed to a
fabric standard that

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.370
could be met without flame
retardants that would

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.220
stop the fire in the fabric.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.220
So there didn't need to
be any flame retardants,

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.928
and you could have
increased fire safety.

00:33:11.928 --> 00:33:14.510
Does that sound
like a good idea?

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.020
So we had a bill with Senator
Mark Leno out there in front.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.625
And our bill was supported
by the furniture industry,

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:24.270
who didn't like putting
toxics in their furniture.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.570
Foam industry, fabric
industry, firefighters

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.040
supported it, because they knew
the flame retardants didn't

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.570
help and could cause cancer.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.380
Everybody supported it.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.310
But these bills never passed.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:42.210
And the reason was
Californians for Fire Safety.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:47.370
And this is part of a
one-week-long, $7 million

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.500
advertising campaign.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.030
One of the bills almost passed.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.380
And they were very
determined, I believe,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.680
to keep their market share
in selling flame retardants.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.310
And the legislators
tended to vote

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.510
for Californians for Fire
Safety rather than business,

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.420
firefighters, scientists,
and the public.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.520
And this went on
for about six years.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.360
And I'd go to hearings where
the lobbyists for the flame

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.520
retardant industry
would be saying

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.699
it's not sound
science to say there's

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.719
harm from any flame retardants.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.290
They've all been
evaluated by the EPA.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.100
Evaluated?

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.090
What did they find?

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.940
They don't say that part.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.449
So we decided to put
together all the science.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.620
And in a big meeting
in San Antonio,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.365
we developed the San
Antonio Statement.

00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:40.600
It was signed by a
couple scientists.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.480
It documented the harm
and the lack of benefit

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.170
of the flame retardants.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.270
And it was published
in Environmental Health

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.290
Perspectives back in 2010.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.250
And still, nothing
much happened.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.070
I would joke-- when
I went to parties,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.812
people would ask me
what I did, and I'd

00:34:57.812 --> 00:35:00.270
start telling the whole story
of the toxic flame retardants

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.900
in everybody's
furniture, no benefit.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.150
They'd get all wound up, and
after a while, they'd go,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.011
I have to leave now.

00:35:06.011 --> 00:35:08.260
And I'd see them on the other
side of the room talking

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.580
to someone else.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.860
And I thought, oh my goodness.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.330
Am I going to
spend my whole life

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.455
being this woman who rants at
parties about flame retardants?

00:35:15.455 --> 00:35:18.420
I started to feel a
little crackpot-ish.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:24.210
And then things changed
when the Chicago Tribune--

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.500
I had pitched this to
many, many reporters,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.800
but the Chicago Tribune
did a fantastic job.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.820
This is the first front page.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.640
The headline-- a deceptive
campaign by industry

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.580
brought toxic flame
retardants into our homes

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.880
and into our bodies,
and the chemicals

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.330
didn't even work as promised.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:50.640
And this story documents-- all
these hearings I'd been to,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.180
there was always
this burn doctor

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.870
who had won the Dalai
Lama Compassion Award.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.990
And he was always talking
about some poor, burned baby.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.150
It was this horrific
death this baby had, all

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.370
because there were no flame
retardants in her crib.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.220
And it was horrible.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.840
And it never really
connected to what

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.440
the subject of the
legislation was.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.370
It made no sense.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.399
But he would do it,
and then everybody

00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:15.940
would be very
emotional, and it would

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.810
give the legislators
cover to vote no

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.470
on these new standards that
would increase fire safety.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.320
And so these reporters
researched the hearings,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.000
and they listened
to four times he

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.260
talked about the burned baby.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.780
And they realized they
were all different.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.900
And then they confronted
him, and he said,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.140
well, really, I was
just kind of talking.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.780
But there was a baby.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.400
And he gave them a
picture of a baby.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.180
And they tracked it
down, and this baby

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.630
died for a completely
different reason.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.060
And the mother was
really unhappy.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:56.050
And the doctor said, well, we're
not under oath in California,

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.610
so I can say what I want.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.690
And ultimately, it
was learned that he

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.920
was paid $240,00
for his testimony,

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.010
and he stopped being a doctor.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.650
So a real scandal
in these series.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.840
If you want to read them, you
can read "Playing With Fire."

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.860
They came in second
for the Pulitzer.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.880
They won all these
environmental awards.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.930
And everything changed.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.990
So instead of me being this
person at parties ranting,

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:26.770
suddenly, Dick Durbin was
ranting in the Senate.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.940
There were hearings
in the Senate.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.970
This really empowered
Jerry Brown, our governor.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.250
That series came
out in May, 2012.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.590
A month later, Jerry Brown
directed the state agencies

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:46.400
to revise our standards so that
we could reduce and eliminate

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.800
dangerous flame retardants and
at the same time increase fire

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.270
safety.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:56.090
So this made a huge difference.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.170
And thanks to this, we
now have a new standard.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:05.940
You can go out and buy a
couch that meets TB 117-2013.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.150
And as you see, your couch
will have a label on it.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.245
And it says either
contains flame retardants

00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:13.690
or contains no flame retardants.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.790
So you can have that choice.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.300
Foam plastic building
insulation-- unfortunately,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.190
the materials that
make buildings energy

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.840
efficient-- polystyrene,
polyurethane,

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.040
and polyisocyanurate contain
the worst flame retardants,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.150
and there's no benefit.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:36.820
You think about foam below
the cement, below the grade

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.560
down there, it has
flame retardants.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.180
There's no oxygen.
There's no fuel source.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.390
And nonetheless, flame
retardants are required.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.162
So we now-- and
it's really hard--

00:38:48.162 --> 00:38:50.370
have been trying to change
the international building

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.820
code to allow foam plastic
without flame retardants

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.730
where there is no
fire safety benefit.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.670
The big hearing is September 30.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.640
And it's really a struggle,
because the same three

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.540
companies who make
the flame retardants

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.290
are adamantly
wanting to keep them

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.080
in our building installation.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.260
If you want to reduce your
own flame retardant exposure,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.540
it's not a bad time
to buy new furniture

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.110
or to swap out the foam in
your furniture for safer foam

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:24.540
or else to vacuum with
a HEPA filter, well mop,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.640
and hand wash.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.850
It all reduces exposure to dust.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.450
So I'm going to go now through
the rest of the classes

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.300
much more quickly.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.960
Highly fluorinated
chemicals, I think,

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.600
are the worst of the worst.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.540
The carbon fluorine
bond is the strongest

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.940
in the periodic table.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.680
It really does not
break for geologic time.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.700
So this class of chemicals are
very oil and water repellent,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.060
but they never break down.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.290
They just accumulate
on the planet.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.750
And the chemical
that was mostly used

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:06.400
was something called PFOA
or C8-- 8 carbons surrounded

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.360
by fluorines.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.920
And this is a book--
"Stain Resistant, Nonstick,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.180
Waterproof, and Lethal:
the Hidden Dangers of C8."

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.710
And it's very interesting,
because it tells

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.630
the story of the harm of C8.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.740
What happened was that C8 was
used in the making of Teflon.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.100
DuPont dumped the C8
in the water supplies

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.950
in communities in Ohio
and West Virginia.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.740
People got sick.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.980
They sued.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.310
They measured the
levels in thousands

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.770
of people who had
a very high level,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.580
and then they looked
at health effects.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.250
And among those people--
this is, again, human health

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.600
effects-- they
found higher levels

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.350
of two kinds of cancer,
cholesterol, thyroid disease,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.880
all those health conditions.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.760
And those people sued DuPont.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.750
And the first hearing was today.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.340
So this happened
a long time ago.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.000
Today is the first lawsuit.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.500
I read about it.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.130
And DuPont had known since
the '60s about the harm of C8.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.860
They had been monitoring
the water supply,

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.690
knew it was in the water.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.190
But they claimed that the
levels, they didn't think,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.437
were that high.

00:41:22.437 --> 00:41:24.270
And they said and if
the chemical had really

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.040
been harmful, the government
would have regulated it.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.930
That was their argument.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.020
So we'll see what happens
with these trials.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.970
But DuPont has actually
spun off all this liability.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:40.150
They have a new company called
Chemours that has the liability

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.570
and makes these chemicals.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.430
So it's not clear what
the outcome will be.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.730
But you can follow it online.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.260
Where are these chemicals found?

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.190
Food contact paper.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.780
If paper is oil and
grease resistant,

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.920
like pizza boxes,
microwave popcorn bags,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.220
it very likely has highly
fluorinated chemicals.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.950
Cosmetics-- not many cosmetics,
but several thousand of them

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.210
do contain
fluorinated chemicals.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.920
It will say fluoride
on the package.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.940
Outdoor equipment, carpets,
clothing, furniture.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.610
And so C8 has been
phased out in 2015.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:24.100
It took 50 years from when
the harm was first discovered.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.060
And what is the
replacement for C8?

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.940
C6-- six carbons with
fluorines all around.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.390
It's equally persistent.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.330
It doesn't break down
for geologic time.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.320
That's millions of years,
possibly longer than humanity.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.737
And the world is
filling up with it.

00:42:42.737 --> 00:42:43.945
There's nowhere for it to go.

00:42:43.945 --> 00:42:48.270
It's in water, increasing
levels in human blood.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.430
Philip [INAUDIBLE], a professor
at Harvard who studies it,

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.890
says it seems to
accumulate in the brain.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:58.230
And do we really want
C8 in our brains?

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:02.470
So we did a Madrid Statement on
highly fluorinated chemicals.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.250
It was signed by 230
scientists, published last May

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.760
1 in Environmental
Health Perspectives.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.100
Nobody much had heard
about these chemicals.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.430
They, I always say, did
not get the attention

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.410
they had deserved.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.150
So we document the
potential for harm,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.820
a roadmap to prevent
further harm.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.330
And it got a lot of press.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.770
Nick Kristof wrote about
chemicals in your popcorn.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.970
National Geographic,
these chemicals

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.950
in pizza boxes and
carpeting last forever.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.270
My favorite massive
group of scientists

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.710
thinks you shouldn't use
nonstick from Modern Farmer.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.540
But there were
hundreds of press hits.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:43.680
And the world is slowly starting
to find out about nonstick.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.410
A lot of brands
are eliminating it,

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.870
starting with H&amp;M.
Levi's has phased it out.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.130
Now, these brands
don't talk about it.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.760
Because if they say,
well, your new products

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.370
don't have this
toxic chemical, what

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.530
does that say about
your old products?

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.782
So they don't tend to advertise
it, but it is happening.

00:44:02.782 --> 00:44:04.990
This is in the public domain
that all these companies

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.300
are phasing it out.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.670
What can be done?

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.520
Google really wants safe
buildings for their employees,

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.880
and they're very active in
working for transparency.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.640
And they're part of
the Buyer's Club.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.640
And we're working with the
Buyer's Club in California

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.980
to give them lists of
products with and without

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.120
fluorinated chemicals.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.530
This is from a
database called Pharos,

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.480
but there's a lot more
chemicals than this.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.390
So if you want any
of these products,

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.490
you can pick the
ones with and without

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.160
the fluorinated chemicals.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.410
And the hope is to really move
the market towards without.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:48.340
When people know the extent
of the harm and the fact--

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:52.090
the chemical industry is
saying C6 is perfectly fine,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.320
but there are 40 forms of C6.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.160
We took 50 years to ban it, one
form of [INAUDIBLE] not ban,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.220
phase out.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.260
So with 40 forms of C6, it's
just not going to happen.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.340
But purchasers can
move to safer products.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.530
So all these products can
contain fluorinated chemicals.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:16.700
So try not to buy nonstick
if you can avoid it.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.450
The last class I'm going to
talk about in some detail

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.820
is the chlorinated
antimicrobials.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.740
That's triclosan
and triclocarban.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.860
They're used, for
example, in liquid soaps.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.090
It turns out the
best thing to wash

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.300
your hands is soap and water.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.200
Having bacteria on your
hands is a good thing.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.740
Triclosan kills
all the bacteria.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.430
I've heard people say, well,
maybe in a hospital setting,

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.510
it's useful.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.700
But Kaiser has banned it
at about six years ago.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.970
Now, Purell-- alcohol is fine.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.010
It's tricolosan, the
antimicrobial, triclocarban.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:46:04.820
And it's really sad, but
the FDA-- in 1974, the FDA

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.820
wrote a monograph on the
lack of efficacy and safety

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.990
of triclosan, and that
report still has not

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.470
been finalized and published.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.740
Meanwhile, back in '94,
there was a handful

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.990
of uses for antimicrobials,
because they were

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.880
considered pharmaceuticals.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.910
And they removed
from that category,

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.110
and now there's 2,000 uses.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.340
So antimicrobials-- Microban,
triclosan, triclocarban--

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.720
are in a vast number of
products in buildings.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.680
They're in everything--
doorknobs, counters, seals,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.760
walls.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.260
But the fact is, they
don't provide a benefit.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.890
They have huge
potential for harm.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.090
They reach out of products.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.650
They're not taken out by
sewage treatment plants,

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.340
so they end up in
our water supply.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.490
They're one of the top
10 water contaminants.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.640
They've been found to be
an endocrine disruptor.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.130
And tragically, they're in
most women's breast milk,

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.760
which is not where you
want these chemicals.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.780
And the fact is, once
again, we don't need them.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.300
They're not needed.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:13.110
And so again, purchasers
can pick products

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:17.530
without triclosan
and triclocarban.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:22.430
And Google is really leading the
way in these kinds of efforts.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.800
Consumer products-- cosmetics.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.820
Because triclosan is actually
considered a pesticide,

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.700
it has to be labeled.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.860
And so when you buy
things, you can look.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.890
Colgate Total toothpaste--
0.05% triclosan.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.820
I heard Crest is
advertising that it

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.554
doesn't contain triclosan,
so that's a good sign.

00:47:43.554 --> 00:47:45.470
But when you're buying
personal care products,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.240
you can just look on the label.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.360
Cleaning products,
apparel-- all these products

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.470
you can choose with
and without triclosan.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.610
So quickly, the other classes
I won't go into in much detail.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:01.220
Bisphenols-- many of
you probably go out

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.620
of your way to get water bottles
that say bisphenol A free.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.110
Anybody do that?

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.360
So I have a friend
who studies them,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.910
a toxicologist at UC Davis,
who likes to shock people.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.430
So he goes around
saying, I really

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.610
like my water bottle to say
it's got bisphenol A in it.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:24.550
Because that way, I know it
doesn't have bisphenol S in it.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.660
And the substitute
for bisphenol A

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.470
is often bisphenol S,
which he thinks is worse.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.327
So with the class concept, we
don't want bisphenol A to Z.

00:48:34.327 --> 00:48:36.160
Do you really need
something like bisphenol?

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.640
Do you need that function?

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.660
Is it worth it?

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.930
Is it necessary?

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.530
And if it's worth
it and necessary,

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.180
then let's really invest
in green chemistry

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.490
and come up with something
entirely different

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.620
that meets this function without
that potential for toxicity.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.890
Similarly, thalates that also
helps soften plastics-- there's

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.590
a tendency to go from one
harmful thalate to the next.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:02.180
So let's find green chemistry
solutions when we need it.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.240
And in many cases,
let's not use it.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.680
Solvents-- hydrocarbon
chlorinated oxygenated solvents

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.340
often are harmful.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.280
Many times, you can use water.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.320
One way to reduce
your own exposure

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.990
is to limit dry
cleaning, and when

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.240
you bring things back from the
dry cleaners, to air them out.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.490
There's aqueous dry cleaning,
so you can use water instead.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.160
And you can find
aqueous dry cleaners.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.010
Well, we've known
for a long time

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.510
about the harm of these metals.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.890
And still, there's
paints with led in them.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.970
It's still worth checking
reducing the levels.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.180
So what's happening?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.840
Retailers are changing.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.610
Many are selling furniture
without flame retardants.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.320
Home Depot, Lowe's, and
Menard's are phasing out

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.550
thalates in flooring.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.430
I got an email near
the middle of June

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.319
that made me really happy
from a major US retailer,

00:49:57.319 --> 00:49:58.610
but I can't mention their name.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.818
People don't like to mention.

00:49:59.818 --> 00:50:02.280
And they said,
starting July 1, we're

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.780
not selling anything with flame
retardants or stain repellents.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.800
We're not offering any
stain repellent treatments.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.970
And this is a loss of
a profit center for us,

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.470
because we make money with these
stain repellent treatments,

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.260
but it's the right thing to do.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.605
So if you go and try to get
a stain repellent treatment

00:50:18.605 --> 00:50:20.055
and they won't sell
it to you, you'll

00:50:20.055 --> 00:50:21.138
know this is the retailer.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.570
IKEA is really the star.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:29.720
This year, IKEA-- who we've been
working with for quite awhile--

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:34.140
said no fluorinated chemicals in
any of our products worldwide.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.860
There are substitutes, they
said, for shower curtains,

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.570
raincoats, and umbrellas.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.220
But they have a
nice table cloths

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.950
that needs grease resistance.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:46.260
That doesn't exist without
fluorinated chemicals,

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.840
so they're going to stop selling
the tablecloth, which is pretty

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.950
principled and pretty neat.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.220
And IKEA has been chemicals
in all of the six classes.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.840
So based on all
that, we have come up

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.800
with a very bold statement.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.280
We believe that the
use of some or all

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.740
of the six classes containing
chemicals of concern

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:14.740
can be reduced in consumer
products by 50% in five years.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.530
And I think that's
possible just asking

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.340
the do you need it question.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.430
IKEA has done this.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.570
One large American
retailer has done it.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.240
We're having a
meeting in December

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.840
with the commercial furniture
industry, the big companies,

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.530
and they're
interested in stopping

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.320
the use of all
antimicrobials, flame

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:42.160
retardants, and stain
repellents in office furniture.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.490
That is a big deal.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.930
And if they do, that's going
to really reduce the use.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.320
So I'm really optimistic.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.990
Our goal is to take good science
and use it for good policy.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.320
And now I'm saying you
can use good science

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.340
for good purchasing and that
purchasing can be even more

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.680
powerful than policy.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.860
So we send out
newsletters once a month

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.220
with updates on all of this.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.260
If you'd like to be on our
e-newsletter list, in the back,

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.160
there please leave your
card or sign your name,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.780
give me your card.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.640
And I'm happy to
autograph books.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.780
If you'd like a copy of
"Annapurna" or "Breaking

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.090
Trail," they're both here.

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:23.490
So I'm optimistic
that by reducing

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:26.700
the use of harmful
chemical classes,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.920
we can all have a
healthier world.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.858
So thank you.

00:52:29.858 --> 00:52:32.203
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.219
So if there are any questions,
please come to the mics.

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:38.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.467
Thank you.

00:52:40.467 --> 00:52:42.550
So if I go to Whole Foods
and I go to the cleaning

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:44.008
isle and they all
these things that

00:52:44.008 --> 00:52:45.800
say they're safe
and green, are they?

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.110
AUDIENCE: I look for triclosan.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.760
I don't know.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.780
Probably.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.800
But I think it's good to take a
quick scan of the ingredients.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.620
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the C6 and the C8,

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:03.110
the chemicals that don't
break down in geological time.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:06.280
Does that also make
them less reactive?

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.820
So would they be less
likely to cause harm

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:12.720
in biological,
chemical reactions?

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.514
ARLENE BLUM: That would be nice.

00:53:14.514 --> 00:53:15.930
AUDIENCE: Or they
just don't know?

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:16.721
ARLENE BLUM: Right.

00:53:16.721 --> 00:53:19.390
Unfortunately, they appear
to cause a lot of harm.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:21.842
And the mechanisms
aren't so well known.

00:53:21.842 --> 00:53:23.800
AUDIENCE: They might be
catalysts of something?

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.760
ARLENE BLUM: Yeah, or they
fit in, they fit into-- we

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.430
don't know why, but there
is this unique human epi

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:36.880
study of these 20,000
people who have been exposed

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.800
in southern Ohio
and West Virginia

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.550
where they came up with that
whole list of health problems

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.110
that's on the slide.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.800
And in fact, that's what the
lawsuits today are starting.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.280
So it's pretty unusual to have
that much human-- because all

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.300
these chemicals-- by the
way, to say the six classes,

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.660
the harm is irrefutable.

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.860
There are things like
genetically modified foods

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:04.840
are a real worry, but there's
not a lot of data to show harm.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.620
What we went for
is the things where

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.010
there was no question of harm.

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.050
We didn't have to do
anymore experiments.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:13.340
So the fluorinated chemicals
that have been studied,

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.300
there's vast numbers
of animal studies,

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:20.180
and then inadvertently, the very
sad, quote, human studies where

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.050
human populations are exposed
and you find human health

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:23.930
problems.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.890
So I think the harm
from C8 is known.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:31.220
From C6, there are 40 kinds.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.010
It's going to be really
hard to prove things.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:37.390
The fact that it ends up in
the brain is not a good sign.

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:38.844
And they are
biologically active.

00:54:38.844 --> 00:54:39.510
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.404
Thank you.

00:54:41.404 --> 00:54:42.070
ARLENE BLUM: OK.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.680
Well, I do hope that you
will sign our mailing list.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.260
You can go to
greensciencepolicy.org

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.640
and click on
Fluorinated Chemicals

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.320
and learn more or
click on Six Classes

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.180
and learn about the six classes.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.910
And as I said, if you
sign or mailing list,

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.030
or you can send me an email,
arlene@greensciencepolicy.org,

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:06.140
and we'll write you once
a month and update you

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.880
on what's happening.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.590
I think saying in
five years, we're

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.070
going to reduce the
use of these chemicals

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:17.720
by 50% in consumer
products is a high goal.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.530
But it feels to me
just like Annapurna.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:24.010
That seemed pretty impossible,
one of the world's highest

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.200
mountain that had
never been climbed

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.720
by a woman or an American.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.720
But we were able to get
the team together and reach

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.890
the summit of Annapurna.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:36.080
And so to me, this
feels just the same.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.510
A great team.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.200
If you sign our mailing list,
you'll be part of the team,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.450
working with scientists, people
in industry, government, NGOs.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.025
And we all see the same summit.

00:55:46.025 --> 00:55:48.050
It's a healthier world.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:53.160
And I think moving step by step,
we can all achieve that goal.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.510
So thank you.

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:57.260
