YONCA BRUNINI: Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.190
Yes.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.690
Hello.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.420
Good morning.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.930
Wow.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.050
Good turnout.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.490
And I know we've got live
stream from offices across EMEA.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.320
I'm very excited.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.520
I'll just introduce
Arianna very quickly.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.620
She needs no induction.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.840
So I thought I'd say something-
a personal reflection

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.780
about Arianna.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.159
As some of you know, because
I talk about it a lot,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm hugely passionate about
my family, the internet,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.980
and I would put
like, sleep there.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.690
And when I first
heard Arianna's talk,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.340
"Sleeping Your Way to
the Top," how many of you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.940
have heard about that?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.430
I thought, she is amazing.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.950
Not because the
way you turned it--

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.120
I think you were the first
person I heard talk about it--

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.280
but also because
as someone who's

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.700
quite passionate about sleep,
I find it's quite unpopular.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.730
It's like, oh let's meet at this
time in the morning for a run.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.140
Oh let's have another drink.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.580
Let's have a meeting at
this time with the US.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.810
I find that even in my personal
life, like my friends aren't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.620
very pro sleep and so, it does
require a cultural change.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.890
And I think Arianna's one of
the pioneers of that change.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.220
Same goes for something
in my conversations

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.330
with my father about
what is success.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.640
Switching to another topic
that needs a cultural change

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.540
and a rethink.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.880
And I think Arianna's amazing
at thinking about these,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.620
talking vocally about them
in a great storytelling way.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.920
And so I'm very excited.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.780
I know you all are.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.010
So without any
further ado, Arianna.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.143
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.770
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Thank you so much.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.050
I love having a fabulous Turkish
woman introduce a Greek woman

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.160
with a massive accent compared
to her very subtle kind

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.050
of little mysterious intonation.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.200
Where is she really from?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.129
With me, like is she Hungarian?

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.670
Is she Greek?

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.300
What is she?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.695
So I am delighted to be here.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.590
I love Google.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.970
I love everything you're doing.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.230
Including all your
wellness things,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.220
your sleep pods, your
obsession with running,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.320
your healthy snacks.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.162
But you're right.

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:27.120
We'll talk about sleep.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.940
There's some improvement that
is needed in that department.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.860
But let's start with
the big picture.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.260
Greek philosophers used
to ask three questions.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.760
What do we need to know?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.020
That was before
Google, when you had

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.970
to work hard to know things.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.770
How do we govern the city?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.150
And how do we live a good life?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.580
And somewhere in the
last two centuries

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.740
we stopped asking
the last question.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.100
And the good life became
reduced to the successful life.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.710
And the successful life became
reduced to two metrics-- money

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.325
and power.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:12.920
You know, slash
status, slash fame.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.420
And trying to live a life based
on just these two metrics,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.300
it's a little bit like trying
to sit on a two-legged stool.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.440
Sooner or later, you fall off.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.950
And that's why I wrote this
book to help us introduce

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.960
in our lives the third metric.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.140
The third leg of the stool.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.580
So it's not about denying
the first two metrics.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.320
It's about adding a metric.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.480
And that metric of four
pillars is very simple.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.870
It starts with our
well-being in hand.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.950
Because without our
health and well-being,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.090
life is really not
the life we want.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.710
Sometimes we are
forced to deal with it,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.920
and with a lot of
lessons to be learned.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.590
But 75% of health care
problems and costs

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.670
now are coming from
chronic preventable

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.010
a stress-related diseases.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.140
So there's an element of health
and disease that we cannot

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.370
control.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.550
But there's an awful
lot that we can control,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.860
and that we are kind of
bringing on ourselves

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010
in one way or another.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.790
Because as Philippe [INAUDIBLE],
the Belgian philosopher put it,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.370
burnout has become the
disease of our civilization.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.740
And in the course of succeeding,
we have sacrificed our health.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.060
Not perhaps when you are as
young as many of you here,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.670
but we see you know, people in
their 40s and 50s with heart

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.860
disease, with the
high blood pressure.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.630
And then the growing
increase of mental diseases,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.410
of depression and anxiety.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.350
Right now, one in
six in the UK is

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.820
suffering from some form
of depression or anxiety.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.430
One in six.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.120
So why, as a
civilization who've made

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.810
incredible strides in a solving
a lot of social problems,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.200
and economic problems--
has a long way to go,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.970
but has made huge progress--
we have really barely scratched

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.900
the surface of identifying
the inner causes of distress.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.490
And what is exciting right
now, because I'm an optimist.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.180
I'm a congenital optimist.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.940
Partly because I'm Greek.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.305
And partly because I'm
a naturalized American.

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:43.710
So it's a kind of irresistible
combo of optimism.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.990
So my optimism comes
because right now we're

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.250
living in a perfect storm,
where a lot of trends

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.250
are converging to make
this an incredible moment

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.550
for the cultural shifts
that you talked about.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.390
So the first trend is
the growing awareness

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.790
of all of the incredible
impact of burnout.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.600
The second trend
is the new science

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.080
that is validating ancient
wisdom about the importance

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.740
of sleep, renewal, pauses in our
life to regenerate ourselves.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.600
All those things that have
been dismissed as unnecessary,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.800
all the language that
has been used, especially

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400
by men-- none of the men
here, because they're all

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.160
enlightened-- but the men
who designed our world.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.430
That we'll sleep
when we're dead.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.740
Congratulating people
for working 24/7.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.990
All these things that have kind
of been part of our culture,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.750
that now we need to sort
of unravel and recognize

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.290
that they are really a delusion.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.200
We now have a lot of science to
prove that they are a delusion.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.940
That in fact, taking care
of our human capital,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.470
nurturing ourselves,
unplugging and recharging

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.690
our own performance
enhancement tools.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.300
They're not elements
of checking out.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.810
Far from it.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.710
They are the way to be most
effective and most creative.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.360
And the other trend is that
now more and more people

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.460
are coming out of the closet.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.570
Not out of the
closet saying they

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.230
are gay, although
that's happening too,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.290
and it's safer and safer.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.660
But coming out of the
closet and admitting

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.090
that they are
meditators, that they're

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.930
doing mindfulness courses,
and that they are actually

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.280
introducing these
elements into their lives.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000
And last year, 2013 was
the year when CEO after CEO

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.270
came out as being meditators.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.370
Marc Benioff of
Salesforce told us

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.470
that he's been
meditating for 25 years.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.870
Ray Dalio, the CEO of
one of the biggest hedge

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.610
funds, Bridgewater, said he's
been meditating for 35 years

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.150
and described it as the
foundation of his success.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.010
So something happened where all
these things that before were

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.460
seen as a little flaky, a little
new agey, a little California,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.370
are now seen as
safe to talk about,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.330
and in fact, scientifically
validated as a great way

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.070
to lead and to
lead our own life.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.200
So all this is in
the first pillar

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.090
of well-being and health.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.770
The second pillar is wisdom.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.590
You know, Google,
new technologies,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.380
have made it possible for us to
have literally unlimited data,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.640
to know everything.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.150
But you haven't yet made it
possible for us to find wisdom.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:48.040
And often, when
there's too much data,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.340
it's harder and harder to find
the needle in the haystack.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.480
So we need to tap
into our own wisdom.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.040
And that's where we need
to remember that we all

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.380
have a place in us, which
is an incredible place

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.670
of inner wisdom, inner
strength, in inner peace.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.390
But most of us don't live
there most of the time.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.570
Nobody lives there all the time.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.780
So life for me is a little bit
of a journey of how quickly can

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.390
we course correct.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.250
How quickly can we
identify ourselves

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.385
being off center and
return to center?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.070
If you think of it, we know
much more about our smartphones

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.020
then we know about ourselves.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.340
We get alerts.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.750
20% battery remaining.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.340
17% battery remaining.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.460
By about 13%, we get
anxious and we look around

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.867
for a recharging shrine.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:52.783
Lest something would
happen to our smartphone.

00:09:55.284 --> 00:09:56.950
We never say, you
know what, smartphone?

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:57.400
Deal.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.899
OK?

00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:58.810
Just get through it.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.340
But we do say that to
ourselves all the time, right?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.080
And when I collapsed, I start
my book, and I'm so glad.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.870
Thank you so much for
getting copies for everybody.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.130
So you'll see I start my
book with this episode

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.260
in my own life,
seven years ago when

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.260
I collapsed from exhaustion,
burnout, and sleep deprivation.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.270
Hit my head on the way
down, broke my cheekbone,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.880
got four stitches
on my right eye.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.410
And as I look back, I must have
been below 0% battery remaining

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.630
and I didn't even know it.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.500
I wasn't even aware of it.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.160
So increasing that awareness
about our own state

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.170
of being makes it easier for us
to connect with our own wisdom,

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.430
connect with our own strength.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.070
And let me just say,
this is important

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.920
whether you're at the
top of the world managing

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.520
multiple demands on
your time and attention,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.985
or whether you're
just starting in life,

00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:06.990
or whether you're struggling to
put food on the table, wherever

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.720
you are in life, when we
connect with that place, that's

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.500
when we connect
with our resilience.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.790
And after all, whether you
succeed in life, in the bigger

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.550
sense of the word
or not, depends

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.050
on how easily
you're discouraged.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.450
Because everybody has
failed along the way.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.690
I have an entire
speech on my failures,

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.510
if you want to hear it.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.800
Because very often when
people look at your success,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.880
they don't know how many times
you failed along the way,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.140
and I think that's
terribly unfortunate.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.255
Because young people--
and I have two daughters

00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:45.580
in their twenties-- need
to know that failure is not

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.700
the opposite of success.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.380
It's a stepping
stone to success.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.550
But what makes it
possible to accept

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.735
that is the fact that you
have your own resilience,

00:11:55.735 --> 00:12:00.160
your own strength and peace
and wisdom that you tap into.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.290
So that you're
not just dependent

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.470
on the outside
circumstances of your life.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.660
One of the enemies of finding
our wisdom is multitasking.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.320
And everybody here in
this room, including me

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.610
has really been brought
up in a new era thinking

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.060
that multitasking
enhances our productivity.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.400
So I know you
Googlers love data.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.100
So please look at the 45
pages of scientific endnotes

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.550
at the end of the book.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.180
I put them there for you.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.500
You don't have to believe
anything I'm saying.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.690
Just look at the data.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.910
There is no such
thing as multitasking.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.040
It's task switching.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.170
It's the most stressful
thing you can do.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.680
And it robs you of the
ability to experience

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.600
that third dimension of wonder.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.590
Because you know, life
is an incredible mystery.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.440
And being connected
with the fact

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.570
that we're living in
an incredible mystery

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.540
is so important for
bringing joy into our lives.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.760
And multitasking is
the enemy of that.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.250
I live in New York.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.830
And walking down the
streets of New York now,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.440
you hardly see anybody who
is not either on the phone,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.890
or worse, texting while walking.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.340
And texting while
walking is seen

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.150
as a kind of badge
of importance.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.020
Because you are so
important and so busy,

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.190
that you cannot just walk.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.340
And so less important
and less busy

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.110
people need to get
out of your way.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.280
Because they are
obviously just walking.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.510
When I stopped multitasking
while I was walking,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.890
I started noticing things
that I had not noticed before.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.110
Next to my apartment there
is this beautiful building

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.890
with this incredible
ornamentation

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.350
at the top, which
I had never seen.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.433
And I asked a friend, I
said, when did this go up?

00:13:55.433 --> 00:14:00.960
And she said, 1890.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.010
So what else are we missing
when we are constantly

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.640
buried either in our thoughts
or in our smartphones?

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.300
And being buried in our
thoughts is another issue

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.950
that we need to deal with.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.300
That's what the whole
mindfulness practice is about.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.060
It's about being
present right here.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.860
Rather than lost
in our thoughts,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.350
which are often either
judging us about what we did,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:35.570
or judging somebody else, or
worrying about what's coming.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.550
And our body-- again,
look at the science--

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.330
does not distinguish between
real things going wrong,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.240
and our imagination and
our thoughts about things

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:47.950
going wrong.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.800
As Montaigne, the
French philosopher

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.670
put it-- there were many
terrible things in my life,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.842
but most of them never happened.

00:14:57.842 --> 00:14:59.550
These are the kind of
negative fantasies.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.240
I tell my daughters, never
lose in your own fantasies.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.765
They're yours, make them good.

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.110
You know, don't
imagine the worst.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.410
Incidentally, I don't
believe at all the idea that

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.620
imagine the worst because
if prepares you for it.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.910
I don't believe that at all.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.180
Because when
something bad happens,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.210
and it happens in all our
lives, we are in a position

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.200
to deal with because
we are fully present.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.020
Our mind, our emotions,
and our body in one place.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.160
You can not deal
with something bad

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.260
when it hasn't happened yet,
except by stressing yourself

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.460
out.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.610
And it's amazing just
reading the science

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.520
around how animals operate.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.950
Gazelles are my screen saver.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.250
They are kind of a
role model for me.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:52.800
Because gazelles
really run really hard

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.910
when there's a danger.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.100
When there's a lion or
a leopard chasing them.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.870
But the minute the danger
passes, they graze.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.060
And there's absolutely zero
stress in their system.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.640
So that's really my
ideal state of being.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.660
The equivalent for
us running hard

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.420
is we have a big
project to complete,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.630
we have something to do.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.590
We put 100% into it.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.990
Then it's done.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:25.330
But we keep staying in
a fight or flight mode.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.050
And that's what
we need to change,

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.740
because we need to give
ourselves recovery time.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.190
How healthy we are depends on
how much recovery opportunity

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.250
we give to our system.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.920
And every religion and
every major philosopher

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.090
really talks in different
language about these pauses.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.970
Those of you who have started
Japanese philosophy, zen,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.940
or Japanese art, is
the concept of ma,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.290
which literally means space.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.780
And it's something sacred.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.750
You know, bringing
space into your life,

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.869
pauses into your life,
the whole tea ritual,

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.550
whether in England, or much
more neutralized in Japan,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.670
is about pausing.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.109
And related to that
now is something

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.635
that we are all
engaged in, which

00:17:18.635 --> 00:17:21.099
is innovation and creativity.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.859
This is really
the supreme irony,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:27.540
that our culture worships
innovation and creativity,

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.780
but we all live in a
way that completely

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.940
kills both of these things.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.620
Because there's nothing worse
for innovation and creativity

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.050
then being perpetually
connected to our devices.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:46.630
Because we're at the mercy of
incoming, what's coming at us.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.780
So if you look at some
of the major discoveries,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.080
whether it's Archimedes
while having a bath,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.010
coming out and
shouting, Eureka .

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.460
And getting out naked, screaming
that he found his major love,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.125
which would have been a great
tweetable moment, right?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.810
You could just
imagine the retweets.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:15.610
It would've been better
than Miley Cyrus twerking.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.970
Or Newton, in a contemplative
mood in his garden,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.470
and suddenly the apple falls.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.960
And there's a lot of
literature about the fact

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.320
that he was in a
contemplative mood.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.050
And when you saw
that apple falling,

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.560
he suddenly thought, why
is this all coming down

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.240
in a perpendicular way?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.560
And the law of gravity was born.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.620
So for those of us who worship
creativity and innovation,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.020
we need to realize that time
famine, and time pressure,

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.290
and burnout really
are killing them.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:57.050
And when we look at the
history of startups,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.680
we know that startup
entrepreneurs are notoriously

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.220
sleep deprived and burning
the candle at both ends.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.620
And we assume this
is the way to do it.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.330
But then why do 3/4
of startups fail?

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.110
Maybe somebody here
should do a study

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.410
about the correlation between
sleep deprivation and startup

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.010
failures.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.210
Because we really
need new role models,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:26.260
and we need ruthlessly
to provide the evidence,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.740
to eliminate the delusion, that
burnout is the way to succeed.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.200
And I'm constantly in
search of new role models.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.060
One of my favorites
is actually a woman.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.210
Padmasree Warrior, who
is the chief technology

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.140
officer of Cisco.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.280
And she oversees 10s of
thousands of engineers.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.470
And she spoke at our
Thrive conference.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.720
And she said, I sleep
for eight hours.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.260
I meditate.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.100
I write haikus.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.830
I paint.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.420
And every Saturday I
do a digital detox.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.650
And she has a great role
model herself, which is God.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.830
He worked very hard for six
days, created heaven and earth,

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.600
and he took a day off.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.800
That's like, he did
a pretty awesome job.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.160
I mean, there are few
imperfections here and there.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.350
We're still in the better stage.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:24.470
But nevertheless, this
is not just a fairy tale.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:30.420
This is a very significant
story about the importance

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.920
of renewal.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.180
And the final pillar,
well-being, wisdom, wonder,

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.380
is giving.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.500
Because our culture
celebrates go-getters.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.280
And very occasionally
celebrates go-givers.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.360
We celebrate them around
Christmas and the holidays.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.100
But in fact, we now
have the science

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.710
that shows that our genes
are wired for giving.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:10.270
And when we give, all of the
inflammatory markers of disease

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.940
go down.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.250
And giving is basically
a shortcut to happiness.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.690
And there's great
neuroscientific evidence

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.490
out of the University of
Wisconsin about this, and about

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.780
the fact that happiness
is a learned skill.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.800
Did you know that?

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.880
That you can learn to be happy?

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.880
We all think we can
learn to play tennis.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.130
We can learn to play golf.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.130
Whatever.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:37.510
But we don't realize that
we also learn to be happy.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.110
And the Greek word
for happiness,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.030
in its most profound
sense, is [SPEAKING GREEK],

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.650
which translated
would mean thriving,

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.510
which is why I picked that word.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.540
But in a literal
sense, it means--

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.880
and we have a fellow Greek
here who can correct me--

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.620
it means basically being at
peace with your own demons.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.060
Because the Greeks realized that
ultimately, happiness is not

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.620
a function of external
circumstances,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.390
It's a function of
our inner harmony,

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.310
with our external circumstances.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.040
And some people are
infinitely dissatisfied,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.990
no matter what they have.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.320
Because somebody
else may have more,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.710
somebody else always has more.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.710
If you value your life just
in terms of these two metrics,

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.560
there is always
going to be somebody

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.260
who is beating you at the game.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.670
I like to quote Mikhail
Baryshinikov, who said,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:36.800
I don't try to dance
better than anyone else.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.430
I just try to dance
better than myself.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.480
And I think it's really
great whether you're

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.770
looking at your life, or
you're looking at your company.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.820
At the Huffington Post, I tell
everybody, the most important

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.390
thing is for us to keep
disrupting ourselves.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.150
To keep innovating.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.240
It's not about what
anybody else is doing.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240
We're not competing
against anyone else.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.600
And that is an incredibly
liberating way to look at life.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:13.180
And I would love to see giving
time, volunteering, be part

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.540
of the way that we bring up
children from an early age.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.310
Because I've seen the difference
it makes to my children

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.080
when they were young
and I had more control

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.770
over what they were doing.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.200
And I would take them to
volunteer at places of art

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.930
with children, where
they could see and be

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.600
in touch with the suffering
in the world, which would make

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.400
them much less narcissistic,
and much less preoccupied

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.680
with everything
happening in their lives.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.360
So these are the four
pillars of the third metric.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.050
And because I very
much want the book

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.720
to be a bridge between knowing
what we should be doing

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.920
and actually doing it, I
have 12 steps in the book.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.910
I picked 12
deliberately, because we

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.760
are addicted to our
current way of life.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.850
12 steps, and you can pick
one step to start with,

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.320
whichever resonates
with you, to begin

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.260
to bring these
changes in your life.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.100
And my first step was sleep.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.370
I went from four to five
hours to seven to eight hours.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.690
And as you said,
sleep deprivation

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.120
is being worn at the moment
like a badge of honor

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.900
by many people.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.920
I had dinner recently with a
guy who bragged that he had only

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.489
gotten four hours
sleep the night before.

00:24:32.489 --> 00:24:34.280
And I thought to myself--
I didn't say it--

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.080
but I thought to
myself, you know what?

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.556
If you had gotten
five, this dinner

00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:39.180
would have been a
lot more interesting.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.790
But we are all
operating from the sense

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.470
of time famine-- you
know, breathlessness.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.440
A feeling that we just don't
have enough time to sleep.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.470
I really just want
everybody to carefully look

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.820
at their discretionary time.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.100
People have much more
discretionary time

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:12.170
that they think Somebody's
watching "House of Cards."

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.660
And that's why I really believe
in finding a thrive buddy.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.430
Finding somebody in your
life who can support you,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.800
and you can support them as
you are introducing new habits.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.452
And let's say you are tempted
to binge watch "House of Cards"

00:25:30.452 --> 00:25:31.910
at night instead
of going to sleep,

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.368
you can call your thrive buddy,
and they can cool you down.

00:25:34.368 --> 00:25:37.310
They can tell you to
just take a deep breath,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.780
and close your laptop, and you
can watch it over the weekend.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.290
Because the point is that if
you don't get enough sleep--

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.430
you know that feeling of
being tired and walking around

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.720
like a zombie during the day?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.660
I now really hate that feeling.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.625
How many people are
sleep deprived today?

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.120
OK.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.065
You don't have to be.

00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:01.523
It's just a matter
of prioritizing.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.980
Whatever it takes
to recharge you.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.620
And how much sleep you
need is individual.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.030
Most people need eight hours.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.250
But whatever you need.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.809
You know how you know it?

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:15.350
Because you wake up
without an alarm.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:23.350
And another very important
step is at the end of the day,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.850
turn off all your devices
and gently escort them out

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.350
of your bedroom.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.950
Very important.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.470
Because otherwise
you'll wake up and be

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.310
tempted to look at your data
if your smartphone is charging

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.320
by your bed.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.980
And I know all your excuses.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.110
Like, I need my smartphone
because it's my alarm clock.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.680
OK.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.915
First of all, if you put
it in the room next door,

00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:49.900
you can still hear it.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.720
Or you get a nice
vintage-looking alarm clock.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.880
In the states, I give
them to all my friends

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.770
from Pottery Barn.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.020
They're $32.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.760
I'm sure you can find them here.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.694
I think David Jones, I was
told, and Selfridges have them.

00:27:05.694 --> 00:27:07.610
John, we should do a
little research for that,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.190
so that we can advocate
where you can go and get it.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:17.390
The point is don't allow
yourself to be tempted.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.470
And I'm only going to
mention one more step that

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:25.570
was important to me, which
is at the end of the day,

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:31.180
scan your day and look at
something that you can drop.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.780
That no longer serves you.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:38.400
It could be a grudge,
a resentment, anger.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.690
Just something.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.040
Or it could be a
project that you thought

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:48.610
you were going to do, but
really you're not going to.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.540
The latest project
that I've dropped

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.170
was becoming a good skier.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.370
I decided that really
I was not going

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.660
to invest time and energy
into becoming a good skier.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.450
And it was very
liberating to realize

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.225
that I could complete the
project by dropping it.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.860
So as far as I'm
concerned, skiing is done.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.475
When I go skiing with my
daughters or with friends now,

00:28:16.475 --> 00:28:18.600
they ski, and I sit by the fire.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.010
I drink hot chocolate,
and I read a good book.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.380
And I'm very happy.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.840
So just see what is it that
you're not really going to do.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.740
And then you can really
invest your time and energy

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.890
into the things you
are going to do.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.720
So let me wrap up so
that we can leave plenty

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.110
of time for questions by
saying that if we're alike,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.970
you have 30,000 days to
play the game of life.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.700
How we play depends
on what we value.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.630
And if we only value
the first two metrics,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.090
we're never really going to be
thriving, because we're always

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.500
going to be putting our life
on hold until we accomplish

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.236
something.

00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:58.860
And then as soon as
we accomplish that,

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.520
we'll have another
goal, and we're

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.950
going to be putting
our life on hold again.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.120
And basically we'll
be shrinking ourselves

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.460
down to our jobs
and our to-do lists.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.260
And I just did an
interview with Oprah,

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.950
and she asks everybody the
same question at the end.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.340
What do you know for sure?

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.150
And I said to her,
what I know for sure is

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.170
that however magnificent
your job is Oprah,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.050
or however great my job is, or
however great anybody's job is,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.820
who we are in our essence
is more magnificent.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.470
We are more than our jobs.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.090
And if you need
reinforcement of that,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.610
just remember the last time
you were at a memorial service,

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.860
listening to a eulogy.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.690
You know, our eulogies are very
different from our resumes.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.570
Have you ever heard a
eulogy where they said,

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.785
George was amazing.

00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:53.478
He increased market
share by one third.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:03.670
So when we remember
all that, then we

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.880
can really find that place
that Archimedes called,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.610
give me a place to stand,
and I can move the world.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.630
We all have that place.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:17.100
You know, we call it being in
the zone, being in the flow.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.020
So we find that place.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.470
And from that place
we live our lives

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:27.600
with more gratitude, more
creativity, more joy,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.590
and yes, more sleep.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.250
Thank you.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.220
So who wants to come first?

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.560
If you don't mind coming
to the microphones,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.620
because this is being streamed.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:56.670
And also if you can tell me
your name, and what you do here,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:03.250
and if you want, how
many hours sleep you get.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.755
So who wants to go first?

00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:08.601
Yes.

00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:09.590
AUDIENCE: Hi Arianna.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.370
Thank you so much.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.610
It's really, really inspiring
and very interesting.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.790
My name is Gail.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.400
I'm a director in the
sales team here as Google.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.892
I'm actually also a mom of
two daughters, four and one.

00:31:20.892 --> 00:31:22.350
I really would like
it if you could

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.080
have a chat with my
one-year-old at the moment,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.996
about the sleep thing.

00:31:24.996 --> 00:31:26.280
That would be really great.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.570
But normally, I get
eight hours, because I

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:29.760
am a huge fan of sleep.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.630
I really, totally agree
with what you're saying.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.040
What I would really like to
understand from you is actually

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.350
as a working mom
yourself, if you

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:45.717
could have spoken to yourself
kind of, 15, 18 years ago

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:47.300
when your children
were really little,

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.430
what do you think you
would do differently?

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.570
And have you got any
advice for the working

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.600
parents in the room?

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.799
Because I think it's
not just a woman's role.

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:56.090
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.310
That's a great question.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.530
And so what I would
have done differently

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.590
is to be fully present
for my children.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:10.720
Because when I look back,
I never missed a milestone.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.745
You know, a performance,
or any school event,

00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:17.370
although I never
baked the cookies.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.550
And it's perfectly OK not
to bake the cookies, just

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.460
in case you are
guilty about that.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.280
Because I really think when
they take the baby out,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.870
they put the guilt in.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:31.690
And every working
mother I know is guilty,

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.690
that she's not doing a good job.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:39.380
So I would just
basically by practicing

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.610
the things I'm talking about
now, being recharged myself,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.620
I would have been able
to be fully present,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.220
instead of being
with them physically,

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.440
but my mind being
somewhere else.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.445
Like, on what I was going to do
tomorrow, or what I didn't do,

00:32:53.445 --> 00:32:55.850
or my completions, et cetera.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.230
So that that's my
biggest advice.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.980
And because I really think
that we miss so much.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.070
And these are such
special years.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.495
And even though,
I'm sure there are

00:33:08.495 --> 00:33:10.810
times when your one-year-old
wakes you up at night.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.300
It's just unbelievably adorable.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.596
And there will be times
later in your life

00:33:15.596 --> 00:33:16.970
when you would
like to spend more

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.890
time with that one-year-old,
but-- is it a boy or girl?

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:20.629
AUDIENCE: Girl.

00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:22.670
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: But
she will be awfully busy.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.320
So treasure every moment.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.450
And it's not easy.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.390
No question about it.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.640
That's why I'm a big
believer in naps.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.840
And I'm glad you
have nap pods here.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.670
Use them.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.690
Use them liberally.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.650
Because a 20 minute
nap, if you've

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.140
had a disruptive night of
sleep because of a young child,

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.440
or a sick toddler.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.910
But a 20 minute nap, as
Winston Churchill famously

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.250
proved by calling
them power naps,

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.770
having them
regularly and winning

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.610
the war against Germany.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:34:00.484
You can win any sales war
by recharging yourself.

00:34:00.484 --> 00:34:01.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.900
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.481
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.230
My name is Hannah.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.520
I work in the
sales finance team.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.454
I was also very happy to hear
that you sleep eight hours,

00:34:15.454 --> 00:34:18.170
because that's what
I try to do as well.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.060
Something that you said that
really resonated with me

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.600
was that failures are stepping
stones to success, and not

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.250
the opposite of success.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.590
Could you give an
example of something

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.110
that may have appeared like
a failure in your life,

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.900
but in fact it was just a
step to achieve success?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.900
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.620
Absolutely.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.610
I mean for example, just to
start with my early years.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.580
I went to Cambridge and I lived
in London for seven years.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.639
And I wrote my first
book by accident.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.750
I didn't want to be a writer.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.350
I was actually going
to the Kennedy School

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.570
to do a post-graduate
degree in politics,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.290
when I was asked by a
publisher who had seen me

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.650
on television at
Cambridge debate

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.780
to stop it to write a book.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.850
So my first book did very well.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.790
And then I wanted
to write a book

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.800
on the crisis in political
leadership, which

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.340
I wrote by spending--
I subsidized myself

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.790
by spending the money I had
made with my first book.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:26.870
And that book was
rejected by 36 publishers.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.900
And that's a lot of rejections.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.840
And by rejection
36, I was thinking

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.360
that maybe this was the
wrong career for me.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.950
That maybe my first
book was a fluke.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.790
And I was walking down
St. James's Street,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.260
despondent and then
having run out of money.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.720
And I saw Barkley's
Bank, and I walked in.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.790
And armed with nothing
but Greek chutzpah,

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.000
I asked to see the bank manager,
and I asked for an overdraft.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.590
And for some reason,
he gave it to me.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.480
I still send him a
Christmas card every year.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.820
And that's something important
to remember during moments

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.810
of failure, when things
are not working out.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.370
That we're not alone.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:17.430
That it's a little bit
like in fairy tales,

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.780
when the hero or the heroine
is lost in the dark forest.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.000
And all these helpful
animals come out

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.840
to help them find their way out.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.250
When in life too, there
are helpful animals

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.350
disguised as human
beings, as bank managers,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.180
there to help us.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.580
And that's a very
important way to live life.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.770
In fact, one of
my favorite quotes

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:41.490
in "Thrive," which I have
laminated in my wallet,

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:46.570
is from Rumi, the poet who said,
live life as though everything

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.100
is rigged in your favor.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.180
So whatever happens, if
we can approach it from,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.010
this is here to
teach me something.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.120
In fact, there's an
incredible quote--

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.160
I'm going to give you a Cliff
note, page 118 of the book.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.720
My favorite long quote-- too
long to read to you now--

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.150
by Marcus Aurelius, who
was a stoic philosopher

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.490
and the Emperor of Rome.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:11.190
So the guy had a pretty big job.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.320
And at the end of each
night, he would go to bed

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.530
and write what became his
famous book, "Meditations."

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.030
And in that book,
and in that quote,

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.260
he talks about how
everything that happens to us

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.310
has hidden blessing
and a hidden purpose.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.870
And when we look at it that
way, life is transformed.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.860
Because very often, a lot
of our pain and heartache

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.670
come from our attitude
to what happens to us,

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.897
rather than just from
what happens to us.

00:37:38.897 --> 00:37:39.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:43.310
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.030
I'm Mark.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.450
I work at YouTube.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.420
Fascinating talk.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.390
I can't wait to read your book.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.970
I do have one question though.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.470
So you spoke a little bit
about getting thoughts spiraled

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.860
in your head about
negativity-- building up

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.680
to scenarios that
actually never happen.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.930
I know my family is
specifically guilty of doing

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.854
this kind of thing.

00:38:02.854 --> 00:38:05.520
So I'm really interested in like
to hear from you, specific tips

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.520
or tricks to help people
to stop themselves

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.540
from getting into a place where
they start thinking like that.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.115
So first of all, if
we kind of recognize

00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:19.600
that that voice
is not who we are.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.020
And that's why I call it
the obnoxious roommate

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.340
living in my head.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.470
And every time that
comes up, that voice, I

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.165
think a sense of
humor really helps.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:40.220
And making it clear that
thoughts are not facts.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.060
And thoughts are not you.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.810
So there's that thing going
on, and if you approach it

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:54.540
like a sort of a toddler,
kind of screaming and being

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.510
disruptive, but it's not who
you are, and it's not fact.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.580
It begins to weaken the
power it has on you.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.150
I promise you, I had the most
obnoxious roommate living

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.550
in my head.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.980
Very self- judgmental.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.790
And now she only makes
guest appearances.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:18.500
And so the energy that
became available to me

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.710
when that voice
subsided is amazing.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:25.670
Because we look at the our
life in terms of time chunks,

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.880
but really it's
all about energy.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.800
When you are operating
at 100% of your energy,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.220
you can get stuff
done in one hour that

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.730
otherwise would take you a day.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:44.310
And a function of
good energy isn't

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.320
just how much sleep we
get, or how rested we are.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.060
It's also what we're
doing with our thoughts.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.010
And what we're doing
with our minds.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:40:00.200
But I promise you that you can
evict the obnoxious roommate

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.965
almost entirely.

00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:11.580
AUDIENCE: Hi Arianna.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.344
My name is Ioanna.

00:40:12.344 --> 00:40:13.510
I am actually Greek as well.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.540
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Oh great.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.165
AUDIENCE: And we
could do this in Greek

00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:17.352
but it would be unfair.

00:40:17.352 --> 00:40:18.060
Fascinating talk.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.904
Thank you so much.

00:40:18.904 --> 00:40:20.320
I guess what I
want to understand,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.302
you mention something
about when we die,

00:40:23.302 --> 00:40:24.760
what's going to be
on our deathbed.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.310
And I thought about that a lot.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.030
So even at university,
I remember thinking,

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.190
God I'm studying so hard.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.064
But what if I die
tomorrow, what's the point?

00:40:35.064 --> 00:40:35.930
I"ve missed a day.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.910
What has driven you,
having that thought?

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.300
What currently drives you
to do all the other things

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.341
that you're doing, knowing
that at the end of it,

00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:47.842
what really matters are love,
people, friendship, et cetera.

00:40:47.842 --> 00:40:49.300
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Great question.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.270
First of all.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.040
Having conversations about
that is incredibly important,

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:02.210
because our culture has
really driven death away

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.170
from our lives.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.120
And in our Greek
culture, of course,

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.130
Socrates famously used to
say, practice death daily.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.200
Not our of morbidity,
but because it

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.880
puts everything
else in perspective.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.170
And now, all over Europe, and
now they've come to the states,

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.430
there are these death
cafes that have come up.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.780
Where people can get together
and discuss their thoughts

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.710
about death.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:33.770
There's another movement
called "Death over Dinner,"

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.300
when people get together, have
dinner, and discuss death.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.170
And "The Onion," the humorous
magazine in the States

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.850
had a feature on death recently.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:52.360
And the headline was, "Death
Rate Holds Steady at 100%."

00:41:52.360 --> 00:42:00.240
So I think having that
realization and consciousness

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.810
then means that you really want
to focus on the things that

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.220
can make the most difference.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.960
And for me, one of the
reasons why I love speaking,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.120
say here to you about this,
is because I love the thought

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.480
that if enough of
us begin to bring

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.550
these changes into our
lives, we are going to really

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.370
very quickly reach
a critical mass.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.000
And for those of you with
a scientific background

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.770
here, you know
that critical mass

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:37.440
is when there's enough
radioactive material

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.710
for the change to
become self sustaining.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.020
So that's what we need here.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.090
It's just enough people
introducing these changes

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.860
in our lives will make
this the new reality.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.430
Right now we're like in
a period of transition.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.480
Where there is a
global shift happening.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.500
Thrive is part of
the global shift.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.980
But if we can accelerate the
shift, then the current way

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.220
we live-- being hyper-connected
24/7, burning out,

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.660
perpetually stressed,
perpetually anxious,

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.244
is going to be seen
as barbaric And it's

00:43:13.244 --> 00:43:14.660
going to be a
little bit like when

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.900
we moved from the Dark
Ages to the Renaissance,

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.000
when we stopped believing
that the Earth is flat.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.180
And everything changes.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.150
And I want to be alive
to see that change.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.200
I think it's going
to be amazing.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.830
And it's going to lead
to an incredible amount

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:38.850
of creativity, go-giving
and at every level,

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.610
we'll be able to deal
with our problems better.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.260
Including at the
political level.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.960
I'm speaking this afternoon
at the House of Commons,

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.940
where there's now a
mindfulness movement.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.520
There are 97 members of
the House of Commons, peers

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.760
and staffers who have weekly
meditation and mindfulness

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.480
courses.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.410
And if you look
around at the moment,

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:06.140
you see that our leaders,
most of our leaders,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.030
are so mired in that
second metric of power,

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.590
that they are not able
to make good decisions,

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.730
because they look at
everything through that filter

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.110
of if this going to help
my reelection or not?

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:27.010
And not to mention the impact
of burnout on decision making.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.540
It's so funny, because I was
speaking at the US Embassy.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.770
And I said something
in my speech

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.002
about nap rooms in the
Embassy, and the Ambassador

00:44:36.002 --> 00:44:37.460
said, that sounds
like a good idea.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.980
We should do that.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.340
And there's an article about
it in the Washington Post,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.520
and the State
Department yesterday

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.830
felt that they had to put
a statement out saying

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.715
that nobody in the State
Department sleeps on the job.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.100
It just shows how
archaic is our thinking.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.010
And the spokeswoman said, she
understands the importance

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.760
of achieving work/life balance.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.640
And one day she aspires to it.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.372
And so basically,
she used the fact

00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:09.330
that she doesn't have
work/life balance-- which

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.100
I think is a
terrible term, but we

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.490
know what she means--
as a badge of honor.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:18.110
Hey, you know, I'm too busy
to worry about these things.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.290
So this is the kind of thinking
that I want to make obsolete.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:28.000
So I want it very soon to
be completely laughed at.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.360
And I want politicians
who it's found out

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.060
that they have pulled
all nighters to then have

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.190
to do damage control about that.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.570
Because we can't trust
their decisions as much.

00:45:48.689 --> 00:45:49.480
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:49.980
I'm Zoe.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.420
I work in the
marketing team here.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.120
Thank you for coming in.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.130
It was really inspiring.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:53.850
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:54.800
AUDIENCE: I come
to talks like this,

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.008
and I think I'm going to
change something in my life.

00:45:57.008 --> 00:45:58.990
And then real life
tends to get in the way.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.970
So I was just wondering,
what are your tips

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.740
that you have about really
sticking to your principles

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.020
and making the change.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.474
You mentioned the thrive buddy.

00:46:06.474 --> 00:46:08.640
But do you tend to write
things down and review them

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.710
every so often?

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.872
How do you make them stick?

00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:13.830
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: So
the first thing-- and it

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.480
may sound counter-intuitive
is not to judge yourself

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:24.380
when we determine to do
something and we don't do it.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.210
To just say, give
ourselves another chance

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.890
and another chance.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:34.530
And to make the changes that
we start with very small.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.870
Because especially
all these driven

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.150
A types here identify with that.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.070
If we like something, and
we want to bring the change

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.160
we want to just
make them wholesale.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.680
And then it becomes much
harder to implement.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.920
And so just pick
something very manageable.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.750
Just pick one thing.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.790
Like I suggest getting
30 more minutes

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.230
sleep than you're getting now.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.550
Or charging your phone
away from your bedroom.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.040
Or making a gratitude list.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.960
I think that's something
which is incredibly helpful.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.950
And my daughter-- I write
about it in the book--

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.390
got involved in drugs in
her last year at college.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.170
That was one of the heartbreaks,
the difficult moments

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.150
in my life in the
last two years.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.204
She's now been sober and
went back and graduated,

00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:25.870
and all is good.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.760
But one of the things
that helped her a lot

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.590
was making this gratitude list
every night of three things

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:34.250
she's grateful
for, and sharing it

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:38.740
with two friends who shared
their lists with her.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.900
And that begins to
get your mind trained

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.860
to focus on the good things.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:49.320
Because we are trained to
focus on the bad things.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.620
And that had some
survival benefit,

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.730
you now, because if, let's say,
we were pursued by a leopard,

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:00.070
and we focused on the
rainbow, we would be toast.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:04.350
So but now, it's not just
focusing on the real dangers,

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.860
we focus on all those
imaginary dangers.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.270
So learning to focus on things
that we are grateful for

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:13.040
is a great exercise for this.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:23.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:24.480
Oh, sorry.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.980
Go ahead.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:28.740
Thank you so much for that.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.610
I'm so pleased
that you mentioned

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.620
the giving side of things,
which I think is so important.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.530
And I remember many years
ago, a mentor of mine

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:39.870
saying that you go
through stages in life.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.380
You start with a learning phase.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.500
And then and earning
phase, and a serving phase.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.530
But he said, what if you could
do all three of those things

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.260
at the same time?

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.104
Which is something
I've been trying to do,

00:48:50.104 --> 00:48:51.520
and I do a lot of
charitable work.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.680
But at Google we
give time to people

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.380
to do serving things,
2 and 1/2 days a year.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:02.200
And I was lucky enough to
go to Tanzania for 17 days

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.510
to do a volunteering
project recently.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.820
Where we helped a rural
village to put a water

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.320
supply into place.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.422
And it was an important
thing, because the villagers,

00:49:11.422 --> 00:49:12.880
many women and
children are walking

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.510
for six to eight
hours a day to get

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.030
on bucket of not so clean water.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.230
But I remember being in
the middle of that time

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.940
and thinking, this
isn't a scalable thing.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.610
And I'm not really designed
to be digging and stuff.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:33.610
Why don't I get a Bobcat,
or hire a digger to do this.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.740
But we then spoke to the
chairman of the village,

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.490
and he said actually,
you know what really

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:40.950
made the difference to us
was that you were with us,

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.670
you were living
in the community.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.510
You were working side
by side along with us.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.830
And that really inspired us.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.630
I think that the type
of giving that you give,

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.260
not just the money,
but your time

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.430
is quite an important thing.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:57.690
But my question is, what
are other organizations

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.160
doing that you see
to really encourage

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.550
the right sort of giving
that really gives you

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.050
a lot of energy and makes
you feel a lot less stress.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.180
What do you see?

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.940
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So thank you.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.150
That's a great point.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.920
I see more and more
companies encouraging giving.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.600
At the Huffington
Post, we, and at AOL,

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.800
which is our parent
company, we give three

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.610
paid days for volunteering.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:27.980
And we match volunteer
contributions up

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.720
to a certain amount.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.870
You see that happening
more and more

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.270
across the world
in many companies.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.260
But also, as you
said, it's something

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.340
which we can take up ourselves.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.600
Whatever our circumstances.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.950
That is what is so interesting.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:46.650
I have a story in the book
of a good friend of mine

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:49.750
who lost her job during
the financial collapse.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.700
She had a big job in
investment banking.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.730
She had never been out of work.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.430
She was completely
undone by that.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:59.110
And then I was talking to
her, and I said, you know,

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:00.730
this might be a
good time for you

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.240
to volunteer in this place
that is on the border.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.520
A place for at-risk
children in Los Angeles,

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.060
called "A Place Called Home."

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.450
And she looked at me like
I had lost all empathy

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.820
and compassion.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.720
And I said, you are going
to be looking for a new job.

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.300
But this is the first time
in your life you have time.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.650
So you can give a
couple of hours.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:21.600
And she did it.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.650
And it is just transformational.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.180
She was telling me
how first of all,

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.510
it put her own problems
in perspective.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.540
She stopped feeling
so sorry for herself.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:36.440
I really believe she
got another job faster.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.300
But also she told me the
story of how every night they

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.860
would do a forgiveness circle.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.570
And she was part of that circle.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:51.180
And she forgave her daughter
for forgetting her birthday.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.510
And the young woman next
to her forgave her father

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.100
for shooting her mother.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.580
And that connected her with
a whole world out there.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:05.460
Whether it's in Tanzania, where
people have to walk for hours

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.810
to get a bucket of
not very clean water.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.960
Or whether it's in inner
cities, where people

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.060
are living at the mercy
of drive-by shootings

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.600
and real dangers.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.690
It takes us away from our own
narcissistic preoccupations,

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:28.910
and our own questioning our
bodies, and our accents,

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:33.210
and our clothes, and our
place in the pecking order.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:36.860
AUDIENCE: My question if about
awareness about well-being.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.310
So you mentioned
how to recognize

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:41.146
your batteries being drained.

00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:42.520
Do you have any
tips around that?

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.530
Because I feel like
most people in this room

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.445
probably tend to think,
I'll go hard for a week.

00:52:48.445 --> 00:52:49.320
And then it'll be OK.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.090
And the week becomes
a month, and so on.

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:53.090
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.120
Absolutely.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.090
First of all, what happens
is that the more recharged

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:02.150
you are, the sharper
your awareness gets.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:10.080
So you begin to notice any kind
of departure from the center.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.430
I was talking to a
pilot friend of mine,

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:16.390
who said to me that
airplanes fly off course

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.690
most of the time.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.800
The reason that there
aren't more accidents

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.360
is because they have an
impeccable course correcting

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.610
mechanism.

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.050
So little by little,
your mechanism

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.630
of noticing these things
becomes truly impeccable.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.410
And it's a matter of
where do you start?

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:34.810
How recharged are you?

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:38.640
And I find that the minute
I feel stress rising,

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.820
or tiredness, there are lots
of little keys in the book

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.820
that you can practice.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.180
One is your breath.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.440
Your breath is an
incredible recharging tool.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.210
So wherever you are.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.520
You can just focus
on your breath.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.990
Breathing deeper.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.940
Exhaling deeper.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.200
Nobody else needs to notice it.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.712
I do it regularly in
boring board meetings.

00:53:59.712 --> 00:54:01.590
You know, I'm moving
to deep breathing.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:11.270
And also the other thing you
can do is, look at your schedule

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:16.010
immediately, and see is there
anything here that I can drop?

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.230
Is there something
I can do without?

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.990
Is there a meeting
that is one hour

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:23.320
that I can make half an hour?

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:29.460
And I try as much as possible
when it's not pouring rain,

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.120
to have walking meetings.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.620
Especially if it's one on one.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.886
It's just great to just
go for a walk, which

00:54:35.886 --> 00:54:36.885
is much more recharging.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.510
Depending on where you
are and what's possible,

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.840
I think our awareness
increases every time we do it.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.070
It's like building a muscle.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.190
The more we do it, and the
more we pay attention to it.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.820
Because now many of us don't
pay attention to it at all.

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.590
I had a young woman
in San Francisco who

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:01.920
came to me after
my speech and said,

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.120
I don't remember the last
time I was not tired.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.980
So many of us have
been in that state.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:12.170
So it's like building
a new muscle.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.030
And then it becomes
easier and easier.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.580
I want to thank you so
much for being here.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.450
For taking this time out
of your very busy lives.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:25.260
And I want to invite you to
continue this conversation

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.500
on the Huffington Post.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.290
Because I feel
one of the ways we

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:31.590
can have people bring these
changes in their lives

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.410
without having their own
painful wakeup calls, as I did,

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:39.360
or worse, is to learn from
the wakeup calls of others,

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.940
and to learn from the
thriving recipes of others.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.190
So I'm going to give you
my email address, which

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:49.330
is Arianna-- with one R and
two Ns-- @huffingtonpost.com.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:51.750
And if there's anything
you want to write about,

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.290
please send it to me.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:57.940
And also we have a campaign we
launched, hashtag how I thrive.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:59.940
So if you have anything
you do in your life that

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.040
helps you thrive, share it
with others, because you never

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.950
know who else may be inspired
and may want to do it too.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:07.450
Thank you.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.185
And thank you so much.

00:56:09.185 --> 00:56:10.226
YONCA BRUNINI: Thank you.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.800
I just want to say,
reflecting on what you said.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.660
When I was being present
and reflecting on wonder,

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.180
I mean, it is really
amazing to have you here

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.080
to talk to us about
this in person.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.240
So I really want to
thank you for that.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.650
And in your words
of giving, we could

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.610
do the gift of giving by telling
more people about this book.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.700
Google plus-ing,
YouTubing, right?

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.800
Tweeting about it.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.940
So give the gift of
Thrive to everybody

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.270
you know after you've read it.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.420
And thank you so much.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.670
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.520
Thank you.
