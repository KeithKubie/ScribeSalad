00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.360
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So here,
I have Bhavin and Greg

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.580
from the Android team,
who are going to show us

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.572
more about what's up with
5G here at Google I/O. So

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:13.530
what's new here, and what
are we showing today?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.500
BHAVIN ROKAD: So, at I/O we want
to demonstrate to developers

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.230
how Android is leading the
way when it comes to 5G

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.590
and what it means for them.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.640
In 2019, 5G is launching with
over 20 carriers worldwide

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.487
and on more than a
dozen Android OEMs.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:30.570
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: OK, cool.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.778
So there are going to be
all these devices out there.

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:35.850
So what APIs have we now added
to Android to allow developers

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340
to use this kind of capability?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.757
GREG LEON: Yeah,
so we've extended

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:42.570
our connectivity manager API
to be 5G aware so that you'll

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.270
know when you have an amazing
5G connection from a bandwidth

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.200
perspective.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
Additionally, we've also added
the metered-ness component

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.268
to the API so that you'll know
when that connection's metered

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:53.810
or unmetered.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.100
So you can do interesting
things over the 5G connection.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.090
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: All
right, so metered

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.730
means you're paying for it
per gigabyte or something

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.230
like that.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.260
So that would be a
great opportunity

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.887
to download movies
before a flight

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:05.220
or when you're going away
where there's no connectivity.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.220
GREG LEON: That's right.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.240
Yeah, so you can do all of
these great downloads of content

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.250
before you jump on a
plane, for example.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.910
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
All right, nice.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.780
So from what I understand,
5G is a lot faster

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.088
than previous phone networks.

00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:18.630
And it sounds like
it has the ability

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.250
to do really fast
download so you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.530
have a phone that is 5G aware.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yeah so let's take
a look to help demonstrate 5G

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.950
at I/O, we've actually set up
three live networks here at I/O

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.200
on a range of six OEM devices.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.280
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, wow,
so that's something people

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.210
don't get to see every day.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.760
Here at Google Air, we actually
have real cell phone company

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.927
base stations for our demos.

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:39.093
So see what this looks like
on a real 5G phone here.

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:39.850
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yup.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.050
So one of the challenges
that many of the AAA app

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.880
game developers
might run into is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.000
that file sizes get larger
and larger as we make

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.620
games more and more immersive.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.510
For instance, this
game is two gigabytes,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.660
and that file size could
mean the difference

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.242
between acquiring
the user or not,

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.575
especially if they're on the go.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.990
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Looks
like it could take hours.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.115
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yes, exactly.

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:03.540
So with 5G, we can see that
the download gets kicked off

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.520
relatively quickly,
and we're downloading--

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.790
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: 43 megs.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.330
Oh wow.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.390
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: 62.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.940
62 megs.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.160
BHAVIN ROKAD: 120.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.620
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
Oh, wow, so it's

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.430
going like 60 megs at a time.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.980
Wow.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.708
BHAVIN ROKAD: 200, 300, so
we're cranking right along.

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:17.500
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah,
that's really quick.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.080
So what technological advances
have they added to 5G in order

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.335
to get the speed achievements
that they've never seen?

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.460
GREG LEON: Yeah, so we've
done a few things for 5G.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.790
One is new spectrum,
mid band and high band,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240
increase the
robustness of the link

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.707
through beam forming
technology and Massive MIMO.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.290
And also we've
improved latency, which

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.350
is really important for gaming
through shorter packet sizes

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.000
and distributed
core network, which

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.630
is taking the central core
infrastructure of the carrier

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.730
and bringing it closer
and closer to the user.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.313
And that's allowed for
much better latency,

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:52.230
and that really matters
to things like gaming.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.430
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah, it
sounds like it'd really

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.840
help consumers and
also developers

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.140
who are going to be
building these kind of apps.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.450
GREG LEON: That's right, yeah.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So--

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.880
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yeah, absolutely,
and you can see we're

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.600
ready to play the game.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.550
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, wow, cool.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.217
That's all done, so
we're ready to roll.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:03.748
OK.

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:05.040
Thanks for talking to us today.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.200
Appreciate your time and I'm
sure everyone's looking forward

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.170
to trying this out.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.460
GREG LEON: Great.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.980
Thank you.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
BHAVIN ROKAD: Thank you.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.040
