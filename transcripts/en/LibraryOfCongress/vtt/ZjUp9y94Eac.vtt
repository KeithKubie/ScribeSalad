00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.770
&gt;&gt; Qi Qiu: Okay, so I am
literally in the spot.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.880
Okay, this is the first
experience for us to host

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.920
such an event here in
the Asian Reading Room.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.300
So my name is Qi Qiu,
Head of Scholarly Services

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.010
at the Asian Reading Room.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.000
So on behalf of the Asian
Division, I welcome you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.370
to this afternoon's event
and to our reading room.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.440
I especially appreciate your
coming out this afternoon

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.900
on such a, you know,
snowy, rainy day.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.570
It's not the best day but we
do appreciate your efforts.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.990
So for this afternoon's program,
after my welcome remarks,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.210
Dr. Jonathan Loar, who is
our South Asian librarian,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.890
he will give an introduction
of our South Asian collection

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.990
and will also introduce our
speaker, Dr. Richard Solomon

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
from the University
of Washington.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.210
So, as you have already seen,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.300
this is a beautiful
reading room.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.020
And if you haven't had a
chance to know more about it,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.470
here are some highlights of
our facilities and services.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.770
I know many of you.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.070
I see some familiar faces.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.830
Some of you are very
familiar with our services.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.960
So pardon me for the repetition.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.120
I will just take a few minutes.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.760
So this reading room is home

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.470
to multilanguage reference
materials on Asian studies.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.450
It is also where users
can access both physical

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.330
and digital materials
in Asian language

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.270
and get research assistance
from our reference specialists.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.760
We started collecting Asian
language materials as early

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.300
as the late 19th century.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.570
And today, the collections
have grown to represent one

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.610
of the most comprehensive
collections of Asian studies

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.850
in the world, that is more than
four million physical items

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.520
and numerous digital resources.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.170
These items are in
over 190 languages

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.440
and include most subject fields
covering in the area ranging

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.030
from the South Asian
subcontinent

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.650
and Southeast Asia to East Asia.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.000
So our reading room, the Asian
Reading Room opens Monday

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.100
to Friday from 8:30 to 5:00
p.m. Any users 16 years old

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.110
or older can come to use
the library reading rooms.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.610
All you need to do is
to bring a photo ID

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.150
and get a reader registration
card, which is also located

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.070
on the first floor of
the Jefferson Building.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.610
Of course, it's always a good
idea to check out our website

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.600
and library catalogue before
you come to the library

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.590
so that you can find the
materials that you are looking

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.650
for and make better uses of
your time in the library.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.710
On our website, you can use a
link marked "Ask a Librarian"

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.630
to ask research questions,
to request materials

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.050
and to make appointments with
librarians to use rare items.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.970
So "Ask a Librarian"
is an important phrase

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.330
for you to remember.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.600
It is actually the
tour to find answers

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500
to almost all of your inquiries.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.180
Also on the website,
you can find information

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.280
on our collections,
databases, digital collections,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.440
research guides, and blogs.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.700
And yes, we do have social
medial representations.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.170
We have blogs and we have
a Facebook page of all

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.760
of the international
collections in our library.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.630
So since Florence
Tan Moeson Fellowship

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.590
for this year just opened,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.700
I would like to raise your
attention to this fellowship

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.070
that funds researchers to come

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.990
to our reading room
to conduct research.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.610
You can check out the
application information

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.160
on our website or on
our Facebook page.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.270
The deadline for application
is the end of January.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.710
So we would encourage you

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.370
to spread words among
your colleagues, friends,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.150
and students who are
interested in coming out to DC

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.090
and to use our collection
materials

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.240
for their research projects.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.390
So with that, I will hand
it over to Jonathan Loar

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.440
for a brief introduction of
our Southeast Asian collection.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.740
Thank you.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.170
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar:
Welcome everybody.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.190
Welcome to the Asian Reading
Room of the Library of Congress.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.150
My name is Jonathan Loar and
I'm the reference librarian

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.530
for the South Asian collection,
which contains materials

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.360
for Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, Nepal, Pakistan,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.080
Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.550
So before we get started, I
just wanted to give a very,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.810
very brief overview of our
South Asian collection,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.300
which contains approximately
330,000 monographic volumes,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.040
more than 1000 journals, and
over 68,000 titles on microform

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.680
in over 100 languages of
the South Asian region.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.150
So that means we have
substantial holdings in Hindi,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.620
Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,
Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.960
Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit
and many other languages.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.270
Most of this acquisition comes

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.760
from the library's
two overseas offices,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.870
one in New Delhi
established in 1962 and one

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.190
in Islamabad established
in 1965.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.190
On the countertops here
in the reading room,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.350
you'll see some samples
from our collections,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.650
books about Buddhism in general
and about the ancient region

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.840
of Gandhara, in particular,
both in English

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.690
and also in Asian languages.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.080
We invite everyone to come
and spend some time here

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.490
with our collections in
the Asian Reading Room.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.820
And as Dr. Qiu just said,
if you have a question

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.820
about our collections, we have
our "Ask a Librarian" service

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.270
to answer anything pertaining

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.860
to your research or
general curiosity.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.100
I would also like to
remind everyone here today

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.780
that today's program
will be recorded

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.130
and later released as a webcast.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.860
So please turn off or
silence your mobile phones

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.970
and other devices and also
place hold your questions

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.470
until the end.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.710
And please be advised that any
questions you may ask during the

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.340
Q&amp;A will be recorded and the act

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.910
of asking a question constitutes
permission for us to record

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.940
and broadcast later as
part of our webcast.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.440
For South Asia at the
Library of Congress,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.810
I believe you could
call the subject

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.320
of today's lecture
a top treasure,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.160
namely the birch bark scrolls

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.910
from the ancient Buddhist
region of Gandhara.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.210
And to get to know
this treasure,

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.370
there is no better resource
than the experts on the history,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.730
language and culture out of

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.470
which this manuscript
came to be.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.450
Dr. Richard Solomon is
emeritus professor of Sanskrit

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.110
and Buddhist studies
at the University

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.250
of Washington in Seattle.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.690
In addition to being the
director of the British library

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.180
and University of Washington's
early Buddhist Manuscript

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.430
Project, he is the author
of many publications

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.970
on early Buddhism, many of
which are on display here

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.820
at the Asian Reading Room today.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.560
His most recent book, his
fourth on Gandhara manuscripts,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.330
is titled "Buddhist
Literature of Ancient Gandhara:

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.350
An Introduction with
Selected Translations."

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.960
Translation number
eight in this book is

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.060
"The Many Buddhas Sutra,"
which is the scroll here

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.820
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.400
And now for more on this scroll,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.510
I'd like to welcome
Dr. Richard Solomon.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon:
Can you hear me okay?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.350
Is the microphone on?

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.360
I don't have a good
projecting voice.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.380
So I want to be sure
you all can hear.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.270
So first of all, thank
you, thanks to John

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.590
for the very nice introduction.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.300
Second, I want to thank
you all for being here.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.110
When I saw the weather this
afternoon, I had the concern

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.580
that I was going
to just be speaking

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.720
to an empty room this
evening but I see

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.310
that you've all braved the nasty
weather to come and I thank you

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.230
for that and I will try to
make it worth the effort.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.880
So I'm going to start my
presentation with a description

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.650
of the physical characteristics
of the manuscript.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.280
Contents and significance
will come later.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:37.250
So the manuscript is called,
as you see here -- Next slide.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.770
The title of the manuscript
or, to be accurate,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.030
the title which I attribute
to the manuscript is

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.790
"The Many Buddhas Sutra,"
which is my translation

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.350
of the conjectural
title, original title.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.940
It's not actually there on the
manuscript, "Bahubuddha-sutra."

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.730
Please note the asterisk.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.170
Scholarly convention means that
that's a reconstructed title.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.130
I didn't make it up totally.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.120
I borrowed it from a related
and somewhat similar text

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.130
which exists in Sanskrit
as part of the Mahavastu.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.510
So it's a conjectural
but pretty likely title.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.060
The actual title of the
manuscript would have been

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.060
on some of the part that's
incomplete, that's missing.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.550
So that's why I have
a hypothetical title.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.790
And I'll show you the details
of that a little later.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.840
First, briefly, the big picture.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.900
This is one of several
hundred manuscripts discovered

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.010
within the last 20 years from
the ancient region of Gandhara.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.340
And I'll show a map later
if you're not familiar

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.030
with Gandhara and where it is.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.740
I'll get back to that.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.240
But we now know of several
hundred manuscripts,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.830
almost all of them like this
one, a birch bark scroll

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.460
and written in the
Gandhari language,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.740
which I'll describe a
little bit later on,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.360
and in the Kharosthi script,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.170
which you'll also see
some illustrations of.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:23.350
And these manuscripts date
between the first century BC

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.980
and the third century AD.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.280
So they are clearly
the oldest manuscripts

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.150
of any manifestation
of Buddhism.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.200
And they're also the oldest
South Asian manuscripts

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.000
in existence.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.730
So here, you see the scroll as
it was delivered to the library.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:53.380
The main piece is at the bottom,
rolled up piece of birch bark,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.290
and the piece on top is actually
would've been an adjoining piece

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.830
but it had already broken off.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.930
You might notice, I
don't know if you can see

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.460
from where you're sitting but
the two look quite different

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.890
and the reason is that they're
in a different handwriting.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.000
And the reason for that is that
when the scroll was unrolled

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.830
and examined, it turned
out that one scribe,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.710
I could just call it scribe
A, had written the front

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.450
and then he'd handed it
off to another scribe,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.420
I'll call scribe
B, and the back is

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.550
in a quite distinctly
different writing.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.850
So that's what you're
seeing here.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.310
This is from -- The top
upper one is from the recto,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.130
that is the front side,
and the lower one is

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.960
from the verso or the back side.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.830
Looking at another angle
on this manuscript,

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.250
this is how it looked before
it was unrolled and preserved,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.740
looking at it from the end

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.950
and you can see pretty clearly
how the scroll is rolled up

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.500
and you can see how delicate
and fragile this material is.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.470
If you've probably seen a
piece of birch bark, you can,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.980
if nobody's looking, you
can pull it off a tree

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.690
and a beautiful white
durable and very flexible

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.650
and very nice looking
material when it's new,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.060
when you pull it off the tree.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.680
When it's 2000 years old, it's
extremely fragile and delicate

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.640
and you can see all its
little bits falling off

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.690
of it no matter how
careful you are.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.950
Another extra problem,
I've boxed in an example

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.120
of what we call delamination.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.030
So actually, birch bark
consists of constituent layers.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.660
There're usually three layers

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.890
that you can't see
when it's fresh.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.190
You wouldn't notice.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.490
But again, when it dries out,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.470
those layers sometimes
pull apart

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.650
and sometimes they
completely separate.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.220
That causes all kinds of
problems when you're trying

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.820
to reconstruct the manuscript

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.790
because you not only have the
manuscripts itself is broken

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.450
into component parts,
as you'll see,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.660
but the component parts
are sometimes the front

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.890
and the back are completely
separated and it's not always

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.940
at all obvious where and
how they go together.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.460
So anyway, this is what came
to the library some years ago.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.610
And the first problem
is what to do with that.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.830
It has to be conserved and
unrolled and here they are.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.000
This is on the left is
Holly Krueger of the Library

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.120
of Congress and at the right is
Mark Barnard who was imported

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.950
from the British Library
as a special consultant

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.580
because he was the most
experienced person.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:59.350
He had unrolled two premier
groups of similar types

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.720
of manuscripts discovered again
in the fairly recent past.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.190
So we have really an A-team
conserving this difficult

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.770
manuscript and here's just a
detailed shot of how they do it.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.870
In a word, very carefully.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.760
Sorry. I'm going to wrong way.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.570
So here you see the
implements that they use

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.360
and how they are working
together carefully.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.400
And this is the result or at
least the preliminary result.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.180
So this is the recto
side unreconstructed.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.140
In other words, that's how it
actually looks and how it looks

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.830
in those facsimile images
in the back of the room,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.900
which you can look at
later, as it came apart.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.440
Several changes had to be made.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.880
Particularly, there were these
three pieces, loose pieces

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.370
at the top, and you saw one
of them in the first image

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.370
and two others came apart.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.830
And the conservators had
no way to know exactly

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.960
where they belonged
and the scroll

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.170
as it was unrolled was
placed on a sheet of glass

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.510
and when they were finished,
they put another piece of glass

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.730
on to seal it and that's a
permanent disposition of it.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.700
But some of these
pieces are not actually

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.190
in their correct position,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.250
particularly those
three at the top.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.550
So I'll show you.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.840
The next image is the
reconstructed version

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.240
and you'll see those pieces
are reversed and flipped

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.490
over like that and that.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.600
So this is photoshopped.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.820
All the reconstruction is
done on screen with Photoshop.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.370
The original, as you'll
see it back there,

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.840
remains as it was unrolled.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.180
And this is what
a typical problem.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.760
We have these problems almost
always with birch bark scrolls.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.610
When they get unrolled,
they don't come

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.950
out all nice and neat and clear.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.600
You'll notice

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.410
in the reconstructed
image the wear pattern

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.770
and this is again very
typical of birch bark scrolls.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.670
The best part is the bottom.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.090
So you can see clearly
the farther up you go,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:27.070
the worse the condition gets
and that's not the original top.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.570
At the top, there were
some more lines missing,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.250
apparently probably
not too many.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.410
So this is actually,
believe it or not,

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.890
one of the best preserved
birch bark scrolls.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.860
A lot of them were
worse than this.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.730
But there is something missing
at the top and those spaces

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.870
between the pieces are
intentional and planned.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.270
So they represent places where
the intermediate text was lost.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.650
But as I said, this
is very typical.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.950
The bottom is always
the best part.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.750
Why? Because when they'd finish
the scroll, they would roll it

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.830
up and they'd roll it
up from the bottom.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.740
So when it's rolled, the
bottom is on the inside

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.320
and it's protected and
the top is on the outside

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.820
and it's most subject to wear.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.790
So it's very rare that
we actually get the top

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.380
of the manuscript.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.270
And that causes plenty of
problems because, well,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.290
that's one of the reasons that
I don't really know the name

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.260
of the title of the text
because in Indian books,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.550
the title is written usually at
the end, not at the beginning.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.560
Seems strange to Western
way of doing things

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.360
but that's the typical pattern.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.690
So the title, the colophon
containing the title would've

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.250
been at the top of the back

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.910
and that's the part
that we don't have.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.700
This is the verso and you can
see it's just the same thing

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.740
turned around and you
can see how they do it.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.880
They write from the top to
the bottom and the flip it

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.820
over the long way and write
from the bottom to the top.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.540
So that means we're missing
typically, in this case

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.090
and typically, we're missing
the beginning and the end

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.040
of the text, which are parts
that you most want to see

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.630
when you're trying to analyze
it but usually we don't have it.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.830
So we look at similar
related texts.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.430
We extrapolate.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.050
We make up a title.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.250
We do the best we can.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.280
Now I've -- I don't
know if it's clear.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.840
I've boxed in a portion
of the top of the verso,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.310
at the top of the back side,
and that's going to be shown

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.090
in detail in the next slide.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.120
So I just wanted to give you
a little bit of a closer look

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.330
at part of it relatively
well-preserved part of the text.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.460
It's not as well
preserved as it looked

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.240
because if you look closely,
I don't know if you can see

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.170
from there, but actually
there are many little bits,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.840
sections of the bark
that have delaminated

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.290
and they're actually misplaced.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.470
So if you look closely,
you'll see some

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.330
of those lines are
jagged and interrupted

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.370
and that's delamination.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.550
So this is what I'm going to
be doing tomorrow is trying

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:18.030
to figure out where those lose
bits actually correctly belong.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:23.270
This is -- And just an
example of the text,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.170
I'll explain a little
more later on.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.440
But it's talking about when the
life in Buddhist cosmic time,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.110
the lifetime of the
various buddhas,

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.560
and also it's explaining
in a kind

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.620
of punning way the
name of the Buddha.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.950
His name is Padmottara because
he is pure like a lotus padma.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.570
So that's a typical
rhetorical device.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.340
So that's about the
manuscript itself.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.370
Now I'd like to give you
a little bit of background

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.410
on the date and chronological

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.260
and historical context
of the manuscript.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.430
So this manuscript
has been tested

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:10.030
by radiocarbon dating
twice in two different labs

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.370
and the results are here.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.470
And the results are
a little disturbing

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:18.050
because they should be the same,
theoretically but they're not

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.690
and there's been some
discussion of that

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.390
and probably there was
some contamination.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.410
These things were
packed in cotton wool

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:31.930
when they were shipped here
and that may have contaminated

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.190
and damaged the accuracy
of the test.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.900
So there's really no way to know

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.750
which is the more accurate
result, the one in Australia,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.280
number one, or the one
that was done in University

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.260
of Arizona, number two.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:55.930
So all in all, we have the big
possible span from 206 BC to 1,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.970
what does it say, 133 CE.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.340
But that's not -- It's not a
major problem because it's all

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:11.490
in the ballpark and since then,
quite a few other manuscripts

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.870
of similar types have been
tested and they all fall

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:20.510
in period between first
century BC to third century AD.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.850
And for specific reasons that
I'm not going to take the time

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.340
to explain now but
I'm pretty sure

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.730
that this manuscript is
either first century BC

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.640
or first century CE.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:38.820
So we have a pretty good idea
of where we are historically.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.960
And that fits right
in pretty well,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.040
quite well with what
we understand

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.230
of historical circumstances

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.970
or historical context
of this manuscript.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.670
So let's talk for a few
minutes about the ancient region

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.830
of Gandhara in the period
in question, end of BC,

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.700
beginning of CE period.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:09.410
So Gandhara, I've learned from
speaking about this many places

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.320
that some people know
where Gandhara is

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.680
and a lot of people don't.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.510
So I'll tell you in case
you're in the later category.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.970
So this is a detailed map of
Western and Northwestern India.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:27.040
And the area -- The rather
small area circled in green,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.410
I hope you can see that
at least where it is,

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.950
is what we call Gandhara proper.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.180
The city, you can't read it on
this map, but the modern city

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.470
that that's surrounding
is Peshawar

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.860
in Northwestern Pakistan.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.190
So the valley, called the
Peshawar Valley or the area

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:52.270
of the Peshawar River, small
area, 120 miles from east

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.530
to west, is the Gandhara
and region proper

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.790
but there's also much bigger
surrounding region I call

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.130
Greater Gandhara, which
is the cultural region

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:10.330
which in the period in question
that I was talking about was

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.680
under the influence or
within the cultural sphere

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.490
of Gandhara itself.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.950
The reason that happens, the
reason you get a thing called

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.680
"Greater Gandhara" is in
the period in question,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.820
again first century BC to
second, third century AD,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.610
Gandhara was very much a
political and cultural center,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.580
major political and
cultural center in India

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.370
and adjoining regions as well.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:46.270
In this period, there
were a series of invasions

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.250
or immigrations or movements,
whatever you want to call it,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.940
by peoples from the north, from
Central Asia, from the west,

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:01.880
from Iran and from other places
as well who came into this sort

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.900
of what some historians call
the funnel that leads immigrants

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.420
and movements across
Asia into India

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.870
through particularly the Khyber
Pass that's the most famous site

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.950
in that pattern.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:24.580
So these immigrants came
into India, set up a series

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.790
of kingdoms and eventually
The Great Kushan Empire

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.510
in the period in
question and they

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:39.900
on one hand imposed their power
but they rapidly assimilated

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:45.210
into an Indian cultural milieu
and the best and easiest way

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.150
to do that is to
become Buddhists

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.540
because Buddhism is open to all.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:54.160
So what happened is that these
barbarian conquerors very

00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:00.130
quickly became the great patrons
of, well, generous, wealthy

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:04.720
and generous patrons of Buddhist
monasteries and institutions

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.110
and that led to a great
flourishing of Buddhism

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.300
in Gandhara in the
period in question.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.370
And this textural
material we are dealing

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.170
with is one manifestation

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.890
of that flourishing
period of Buddhism.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:27.710
These foreign invaders, as they
might be called, are known to us

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.670
from the manuscripts but
also from a very large number

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.700
of physical remains, including
inscriptions recording

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.000
their donation.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.610
So this is just one example,
a fairly typical example,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:47.380
from the first century of a
reliquary dedicated by a member

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.870
of the royal family of
these Scythians or Saka,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:55.930
Indo-Scythian rulers
of Northwestern India

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.870
with a beautiful
inscription around the top.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.130
And I don't know if you can
see there are a few letters

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.430
that are in gold.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.930
So actually originally the
whole inscription was inlaid

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:12.750
with gold wire and most of them
disappeared but for some reason,

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.270
two or three of the letters
still have their original gold,

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:23.060
sort of emblematic of the
generosity of their patronage.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.130
So in the period that
I'm talking about,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.150
Gandhara became a major center,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:33.460
in some senses even the
major center of Buddhism

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.700
in the South Asian continent

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.540
and this had even greater
historical consequences

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.680
because we now know and it's
gradually becoming clearer how

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.200
Buddhism actually left the
motherland of India and went

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.590
into Central Asia
through Gandhara.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.980
And we are now getting
very clear evidence of that

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.520
that Gandharan travelers went

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.930
into Central Asia,
brought Buddhism.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.300
And from there, Buddhism spread
to China, to Korea, and Japan.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.490
So Gandhara is really
a critical node,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.980
not just in Indian history,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.930
but in the entire
history of Buddhism.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.570
The other best know
manifestation

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:30.590
of Gandharan Buddhism is
in its very abundant school

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.420
of sculpture and other arts.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.930
And I find that in
general audiences,

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.230
that's what people are aware

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.760
of if they have any
acquaintance of Gandhara.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.060
And Gandharan Buddhist
sculpture and again just

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.040
about the same period, time
period that I'm talking about,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.150
first to third century AD,
you can see specimens of that

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.020
in most major museums
anywhere in the world,

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.580
including right here
in Washington, DC.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:10.110
In the Freer Gallery,
there's this very amazing set

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.970
of four friezes illustrating
the four major events

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.270
of the Buddha's life.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.780
So if you're not familiar,

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.780
I definitely recommend
a trip over there.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.590
Quite worth it.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.960
So I'll just show you
these as a local example.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.450
So the first of the great
events is, of course,

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.840
the miraculous birth
of Buddha coming

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.280
out of the right
side of his mother.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.720
And this is the enlightenment
Buddha in meditation and all

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.520
around him are the army of Mara

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.350
or the anti-Buddha attacking
him, trying to scare him,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.650
trying to distract him.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.250
And of course, they can't.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.890
You have that sort of called
a force field around Buddha

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:01.070
and they're all coming at him
but there is this blanket area

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.360
where they can't penetrate.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:09.030
And at the lower left is Mara
in dejection because he sees

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.230
that he's losing the battle.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.660
And then the third is the
first sermon in the Deer Park

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.240
in Sarnath and you can see
the two deer at the bottom

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.930
of the chair and that's
the, the bottom of the seat,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.770
that's the emblem
of this great event.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.340
And then finally
the Parinirvana,

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.010
the final passing
away of Buddha.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:39.030
So these are absolutely basic
to the biography of the Buddha.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.130
But what might seem odd is
that the text that I'm here

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:48.320
to talk about, which is about
the life of the buddhas,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.240
these are not mentioned
at all in that text

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.650
because the kind of, the
biography that I'm going

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.480
to be talking about is not
a conventional biography,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.910
at least in modern terms.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:06.440
It works quite differently
and I'll explain

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.740
that in a few minutes.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.600
I want to add a little
more background information

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.240
on the nature of
Buddhist canons.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:30.310
Buddhist canons are not like the
canons of say Islam or Judaism

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.430
where you have a single,

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:38.020
clearly-defined invariable
unilingual text

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.590
or corpus of text.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.470
Buddhist canons are multiple.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.660
They exist in different
forms, in different languages

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.240
from different parts
of the Buddhist world.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.260
Basically, the best known

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.310
and most important
Buddhist canons are

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.220
in Pali Sanskrit,
Chinese, and Tibetan.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.710
The Sanskrit is an
incomplete canon known

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.320
from fragmentary remains,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:12.150
mostly from Central
Asia and from China.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:16.630
Buddhism in a way you can
compare more to Christianity

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.840
in terms of its approach to
language and text and canon

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.640
because like Christianity,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.880
Buddhism is a religious
tradition

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.970
that encourages translation,
again in contrast to Islam

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.960
and Judaism where if you read
the Quran or you read the Torah,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.320
you read it in Arabic
or Hebrew, respectively,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.560
because that's the
essence of it.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.720
And if you translate it, it's
just some pale imitation.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.390
That's not the idea in Buddhism.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.900
And the Buddha was said to
have explained to his followers

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:53.060
in a famous passage, speak,
explain the dharma to people

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.360
in their own language.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.970
So right from the beginning,
there was the desire,

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.010
preference for translation.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.810
So that's relevant to
what I'm discussing here

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:10.570
because we now have an
increasingly large body,

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:16.170
several hundred manuscripts,
almost all fragmentary,

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:21.190
in the Gandhari language, which
I will explain in a moment.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.790
So I am willing to go
out on a limb and say

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:30.850
that there was a complete
Gandhari canon in antiquity.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.100
It disappeared until recently.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.610
Why? Well, simply because
Gandhara ceased to be a part

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.240
of the Buddhist world
or Buddhism died

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.700
out at least 1000
years ago in Gandhara

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.090
and it was completely
forgotten until recently.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.700
So I would make the case

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.280
that we're actually
rediscovering an unknown canon

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.460
of Buddhism and that's the
canon that has been translated

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.190
into Gandhari language.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.190
And the Gandhari language was

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:06.190
in its day just the
local vernacular language

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.440
of the northwestern part
of the Indian subcontinent.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.810
So it's linguistically
related fairly closely

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.470
to Pali and Sanskrit.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:18.610
And so I just have a quickie
comparison chart for those

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.650
of you who are familiar
with or interested

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.480
in this sort of thing.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.720
So the same verse in Gandhari,
Sanskrit and Pali and I tried

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.620
to clarify it by, I picked
one word, in boldface,

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.230
which is the word for
a man or a human being.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.750
So you can see the relationships
of manocie [phonetic]

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.740
in Gandhari, manuoyaci
[phonetic] in Sanskrit

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.480
and manusso [phonetic]
in Pali and so forth.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.970
You can make what
you will of that.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:34:01.440
The Gandhari language is always
or almost always connected

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.900
with the Kharosthi script,
which looks something like this.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.990
Kharosthi script, which is
written from right to left,

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:16.550
although not in this example,
is unlike the Gandhari language,

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.150
which is of Indian origin.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.170
The Kharosthi script
is of Western,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.300
that is Semitic origin
derived or connected

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.560
with the Aramaic script.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.430
So this is the alphabetical
order or the character set

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.020
of Kharosthi script
but it's written

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.990
in Western way, left to right.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:40.900
And that alphabet is
called Arapacana at the top.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.200
Why Arapacana?

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.860
Well, that's why just
the first five letters.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.890
So as we say "alphabet,"
we call it alphabet just

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:52.860
by citing the first two letters
of the Greek alphabet, alpha,

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.390
beta, same principle was common

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.920
in many other scripts
or language groups.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.080
So that's the Arapacana
alphabet.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.650
And this is a chart
which shows the,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.030
illustrates the relationship
between the Aramaic script

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.610
and the Kharosthi script and
I just circled some examples

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.740
where it's relatively clear
the derivation and connection

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.420
with the Aramaic prototype.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.100
It's actually a complicated
and controversial

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.600
and interesting topic but
I won't go into it here.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.060
So that's all more or
less by way of background.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.460
Now I'll come to the main
point, context and significance

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:44.370
of the Library of
Congress scroll.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.670
What's it about?

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.950
Well, I call the
"Many Buddhas Sutra."

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.250
I would describe it

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.700
as a combined comparative
biographical summary

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.600
of the lives of 15 Buddhas
beginning with Dipankara,

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:05.370
who lived many billions of years
ago, and ending with Sakyamuni

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:11.070
or Siddharta or "our Buddha"
as he's sometimes called.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.930
And then going on one
more to Maitreya or Ajita

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.230
who is the next Buddha.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:22.480
So those 14 Buddhas in the past
and one Buddha in the future.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.990
So these are the 15
Buddhas involved.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.720
Start with Dipankara.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.980
Number 14 is Sakyamuni

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.410
who actually is Sakyamuni
the second, surprisingly.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.820
And then on to Maitreya
in the future.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.200
But this biography is not the
kind of biography that you saw

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.310
in those four sculpted images
that I showed you before.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.970
In fact, those four great
events, the four prime events

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.720
of the Buddha's life
are not mentioned at all

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.840
in this strange kind
of biography.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.140
So what it is about?

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.800
Well, I've summarized
that in this chart.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:14.020
There are seven points of
information which are enumerated

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.480
for each of the Buddhas.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.700
So it starts out
with the predictions.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.950
I'll explain the significance
of that a little bit later.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:26.630
And the predictions made by each
of the 15 Buddhas and so forth.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:31.300
So for example number
three, I'll show later.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.170
The lifespan tells you how
long each Buddha lasted.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.490
So it's not a narrative
presentation.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.240
It's a summary of information.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.040
And that has its own
significance, an importance,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.960
which I'll try to
clarify as I go through.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.980
So the next slide I'm going
to show you the specific,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.490
the full information, I've
picked item five, social class,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.720
the varna it's called
in Sanskrit,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.290
which of the four classes of
society each of the Buddhas

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.800
and I picked that, I showed
that one because it's short

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.720
and I can fit it all in
one slide So if we read,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.570
Dipankara went forth,
that means, you know,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.540
became a Buddha approximately
from a brahman family,

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.350
Sarvabhibhu from
ksatriya family.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.340
Padmottara was a brahman.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.160
Atyuccagamin was
ksatriya, on and on and on.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.670
Maybe not the most exciting
reading to the un-initiated.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.030
This is the part that I don't
show my undergraduate students.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.620
You can imagine their
eyes glazing over.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.930
But it has considerable
interest and significance.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.330
I'm not going to go into this
example here although it implies

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.800
something about the social
views of ancient Buddhism.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.240
But I want to show another one.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.990
This is another category,
category three

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.440
and the seven points
of information,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.660
which is the lifespans
of the Buddha.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.760
And I couldn't fit
in all 15 Buddhas,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.520
so I just give approximately
the last half.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.680
And here, you'll see
a clear progression.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.530
Vipasyin Buddha number eight
lived for 80,000 years,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:29.980
Buddha number nine 70,000
years, et cetera, et cetera,

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.720
down to number 13,

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.310
who is Kasyapa the
immediate predecessor

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.520
of the historical
Buddha Sakyamuni.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.710
He lived for 20,000 years.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.410
And I -- And this is Sakyamuni.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.360
By the way, this whole
text is, of course,

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.140
being recited, told
by Sakyamuni.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.200
He predicts that he
will live only 80 years.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.590
So you see it's very,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.000
it's a pronounced drastic
downward progression

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.300
in the lifetime of the Buddhas.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:05.460
And this is a matter of concern
because a year in the life

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.320
of the Buddha or a day
or an hour in the life

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.630
of a Buddha is a
very precious thing.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.390
So it gives you a sense

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:17.210
of the world getting
somehow deteriorating.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.070
Well, the world is
always deteriorating

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.540
and so it always seems.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:28.950
But when you look at the next
item, which is category four,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.190
the periods, the
historic periods

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.400
in which the Buddhas lived, you
actually get a different message

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.770
or a different picture.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.820
So here, we have -- I was
able to fit all 15 on.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.780
So this is the historical
progression,

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.640
the sweep of history when
these earlier Buddhas lived

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.830
and when the future
Buddhas will live.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:58.250
So Dipankara, which is
actually the same as Dipankara,

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:03.140
lived in an uncountable
eon before the present eon.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.540
I'll try to explain
briefly Buddhist cosmology.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.860
It's a little different than
what you might be used to.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.520
An uncountable eon
is a technical term.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.130
It doesn't mean you
can't count it.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.910
It means it's so huge.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.860
So an uncountable
eon is, I believe,

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.930
the best calculation I've
been able to find is 10

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:29.510
to the 154th power
number of years.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.720
So virtually uncountable.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:38.820
The next Buddha, Sarvabhibhu, 10
million eons, the third 100,000

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.410
and so forth, 1000, 500.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:44.260
So you see a different
kind of progression.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.230
You see for instance
in number nine and ten,

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.920
you have two buddhas,
Sikhin and Visvabhu,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.840
who lived in the same
eon and then the 11th

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.080
through 15th are all in the
same eon and that's the eon

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.850
that we're living in now.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.950
And that's called
the bhadrakalpa

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:08.460
because Bhadra means
good, happy, fortunate,

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.830
because it's the era in which
many buddhas are living.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.410
So you get -- There's a kind
of balance between the decrease

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.630
in the lifetime of the buddhas,
in the lifespan of the buddhas

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.970
but they're getting more
frequent in history.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.650
There's another related text
which contains these lists

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.830
of buddhas and their times
and their characteristics.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.960
It's called the
Bhadrakalpikasutra.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.350
Some of you might
be familiar with it.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.180
And Bhadrakalpika means it talks

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.170
about the bhadrakalpa,
kalpa means eon.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.930
And it's a list of buddhas
but not from the past

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.130
but looking ahead in the future.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:56.140
So it actually starts with the
first Buddha in the bhadrakalpa

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.640
that is Kakusandha and goes
through Sakyamuni, our Buddha,

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.070
and Maitreya and then 996
more buddhas are still to come

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.070
within this Bhadra era.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:18.150
So this is very important for
Buddhist practice or philosophy

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:23.580
or soteriology because the
point is to give encouragement

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:28.960
and comfort that Buddhas will
although we have missed the

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.190
Buddha, we living now, we're
not during the lifetime

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.520
of the Buddha but there
will be buddhas to come

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.030
and in future years if we
pursue the Buddhist path,

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.680
we might get the blessing

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.770
of actually some day a
million years form now

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:45.570
or a billion years
from now actually see

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.540
and be the presence
of the Buddha.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:53.330
So there's a balance of the
downward trajectory of the world

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.280
in general but the
increasing promise

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:01.020
of increasing numbers
of buddhas.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.900
Let me turn to my next topic

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.730
which is how many
buddhas are there.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.990
So at this point, you
might be wondering the text

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.910
that I'm primarily concerned
with contains 15 buddhas.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:19.320
I mentioned another one
that enumerates 1001 buddhas

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.960
and there are many
other numbers.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:27.050
There's a famous early
sutra, the [inaudible] sutra,

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:32.800
which has seven buddhas which
seems to be the original number.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.400
There's another polytext
called Buddhavamsa

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.080
which lists 25 buddhas.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.090
And significantly in that
case, it lists 25 buddhas

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.410
but it begins with Dipankara

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:49.470
and that's particularly
an important moment

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:54.350
within the history of
the buddhas plural,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.640
Dipankara has a special
importance

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.190
which I will explain
in a few minutes.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.730
Just I'll mention one
other number, the Mahavastu

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.990
which is a Sanskrit
biography of the Buddha,

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.890
also has a list of buddhas.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:16.050
It has a long list,
331,140,263 buddhas

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.960
from the remote inconceivable
past

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.970
down to the present
time of Sakyamuni.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.370
So how many buddhas are there?

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.930
Well, let me come back to
the point about Dipankara.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.390
Why is Dipankara
special in these lists?

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:36.060
Why do -- Why is he stressed
in most of them and in

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.840
at least two important cases,

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.490
including our manuscript,
it begins with him?

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.830
Well, because he's the Buddha

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.810
who produced our
Buddha Sakyamuni.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:56.530
And by produced, I will try
to say he inspired the person

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:01.430
who would eventually be
reborn as the Buddha.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:06.430
He inspired him to become a
Buddha and he actually predicted

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.420
that that being would
become a Buddha.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.790
So let me explain.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.440
I'll show how that happened.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.940
Here, I've just given
you the basic list

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.340
but I've emphasized
Dipankara and Sakyamuni

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.810
because they have this
special connection.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:27.420
And this is the famous
scene where it all started.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.390
This is where a young man,

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.840
a very handsome young man
named Megha or Sumedha,

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.050
different names, in
extremely remote past,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.650
in the time of Dipankara,
was walking down the street

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:46.180
and he saw the Buddha Dipankara.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:52.370
And he was overcome with power
and radiance of the Buddha.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.530
And the Buddha was walking
along the road and maybe it was

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.790
like today, the road
was wet and muddy

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.300
and he didn't want the
Buddha to get his feet dirty.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.150
So he undid his -- He had
this beautiful long thick hair

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:08.570
and he threw it over
the road for the Buddha

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.840
to walk on, to keep
his feet dry.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.710
And the Buddha seeing that said,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.250
knew that this man
Megha was special

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:21.060
and had a special destiny
and predicted that he would

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.090
in the future become a Buddha

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:27.730
and Megha was inspired
to pursue the path.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.580
And eventually after millions
and millions of lifetimes,

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.330
he in fact became the Buddha
and that's what we see here

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.730
in this Gandharan sculpture.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:45.410
So the point is where
do buddhas come from

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.000
and how many are there?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.950
The answer is buddhas
come from other buddhas.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:55.990
A buddha predicts and produces,
inspires the attainment

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.520
of Buddhahood by another person

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.270
or by other people
in the long future.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.860
So how many buddhas are there?

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.750
I finally come back
to the question.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.050
Infinite number.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.350
Why infinite?

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:11.780
Because time is infinite in
the Buddhas conception both

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.080
in the past and the future.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.380
There is no beginning.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.680
There is no end.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.920
And throughout history, buddhas
are either present or most

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.610
of the time in the process
of forming at some time.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.460
And that's why the Mahavastu
can say in all seriousness

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.600
that there are 331
million et cetera buddhas.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.050
There're actually
much more than that.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.240
There are an infinite number.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.910
But these different texts or
these different presentations,

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:46.690
usually by the Buddha himself,
simply address the issue

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.820
or explain the issue in a
limited scope because you can't,

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.460
well the Buddha can talk about,

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.830
understand eternity
but we can't.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.710
So it takes -- These different
texts are really slices

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.300
of history, slices of Buddha
history, which is infinite

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.020
from beginning to end.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.360
Some of them talk
about the recent past.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.740
Some of them talk about a
little farther in the past.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.120
Some go into the future.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.660
Some are concerned
mainly with the future.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.480
But they're all just
pieces of the big picture.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.970
I call them slices of history.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:29.410
Let me turn to my penultimate
topic, which is to step back

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:33.750
and try to give you some idea
of the importance of this text

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.670
and the position of this text

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.460
within Buddhist literature
more broadly.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:44.170
I think I've already
-- Excuse me.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.790
I hope I've already made it
clear that this text is new.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.080
It's text we've never
seen before but it's

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.750
by no means totally
unprecedented.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:58.420
We have similar texts or texts
of similar theme in other parts

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:03.790
of the Buddhist literature and
that's why I borrowed the title

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.410
"Many Buddha Sutra,"
Bahubuddha-sutra,

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:16.350
from another Sanskrit book
that has a similar portion.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:20.280
And that's interesting, now I'm
speaking in terms of the history

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.260
of Buddhist literature,
what this is showing us.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:30.120
We find similar descriptions
of the buddhas

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.420
in other Buddhist literature.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.620
It's Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:37.560
But they're usually incorporated
into much bigger text

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.770
like the Mahavastu
or the [inaudible],

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.770
these enormous multivolume
texts.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:49.100
What we have here are we are
finding the actual component

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.090
parts of some of
those massive texts.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.580
So it's beginning
to become clearer

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.000
that there was a process,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.650
for lack of better term I
call it the clumping process,

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.560
in the history of Buddhist
literature that individual,

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.570
what were originally
individual texts have tended

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.760
to get squished together
into these sort

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:11.780
of encyclopedic long works.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:19.180
There are other texts which
are more or less familiar.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.690
We have for instance
Gandhari versions of texts

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:27.470
that were known in essentially a
similar form in other languages,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:32.730
usual Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese
or combinations thereof.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:37.780
So these are not new texts
but they are new versions

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.400
of previously known texts.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.200
So it's less spectacular
but to the specialists,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.140
it's extremely interesting
because you can do all sorts

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:51.310
of textual comparisons of the
details and relationships.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:53.650
So, you know, to
us, it's exciting

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:59.630
as if someone discovered the
putative Aramaic original form

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:05.470
of the Gospels, New Testament
Gospels known only in Greek.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:09.640
So that's a big deal for us.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.110
And then there's a
third class of material

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:17.710
in this Gandhari literature
which I haven't talked about

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.910
and I don't have time to
introduce but I just wanted

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.410
to say there are texts
which are completely new

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.160
for which we have no parallel

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.160
or no approximately
similar material in any

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.380
of the other several
Buddhist literatures

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:39.680
and these are great eyeopeners.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.590
They give us views, new
dimensions of Buddhist doctrine

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:48.840
and Buddhist literature that we
had no idea of in many cases.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:57.750
So what do we have, couple
hundred scraps of partial texts

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:02.310
which are clearly part of
what was originally a much

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:03.610
larger literature.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:07.350
I think Gandhari Buddhist
literature in its day,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:12.810
there must've been thousands of
different texts in existence.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:17.160
So it's very much tip of the
iceberg situation but, you know,

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.740
you can look at the tip and
if you look closely enough,

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.490
you can sort of extrapolate the
picture of the whole iceberg.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:29.580
I have a larger vision
or fantasy

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:36.520
of original Indian Buddhism as
an ocean with many icebergs,

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:41.200
each representing the
local textual traditions

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.500
or the local canons

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.520
of the different parts
of the Indian world.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.300
Those icebergs are mostly gone.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.990
They've melted away.

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.290
We have a few of them.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.590
We have the Pali canon.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.710
We have the partial
Sanskrit canon.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:59.440
But I have the feeling now that
there were many local canons.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.320
All had a common core.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.180
I don't mean to give the idea
they're completely different.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:08.410
They had a common core but they
had many different texts in

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:12.410
and around that basic
commonality.

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:19.420
Those other Buddhist literatures
or canons most of them are gone

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:25.140
and I would say there's no
hope of finding them mainly

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.830
for a simple physical
reason, the climate of India,

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:33.890
of India proper is such
that organic materials,

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.290
manuscripts never last for
more than a few hundred years.

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:41.360
There are really no really old
manuscripts in India proper.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.190
You only get the ancient
manuscripts from the borderlands

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:47.030
of India, in this case Gandhara

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:51.170
which has a more moderate
climate and more conducive

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:58.140
to the survival of organic
materials of manuscripts.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.280
So extrapolating and I'm going
out on a limb a little bit.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.740
From the tip of the Gandharan
iceberg, I try to see the shape

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.650
of the whole iceberg and from
that I try to guess the shape

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:12.110
of all the other icebergs

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:15.310
that theoretically
existed and never will.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:22.090
But the details of this are
gradually become clearer as we,

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.390
myself and my colleagues
and collaborators

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:29.210
in this Gandharan enterprise,

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:33.510
work through the materials we
have and that's why I'm here.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:42.410
So I just want to conclude with
a few words on specifically

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:46.110
on what I and my colleagues are
doing with these manuscripts.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.470
Jonathan mentioned
already in his introduction

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:55.450
that I have published a
translation, really it's a kind

00:55:55.450 --> 00:56:02.200
of preliminary translation, of
this text and it's in my book

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.170
"Buddhist Literature of Ancient
Gandhara," which is on the table

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:10.740
and actually obviously open
to the appropriate pages

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.880
where I translate
this whole thing.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.910
But that's actually
just the beginning.

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:19.710
The translation with this sort
of material, this sort of work,

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.860
translation is not
the main part.

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:27.520
So what I'm working on and why
I'm here, other than of course

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.310
to speak to you, but to do some

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.340
of the detailed work
towards the production

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:41.780
of a complete scholarly
detailed philological edition,

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.160
that more for the specialists.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.850
So that will eventually take the
form of one of those black books

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:49.190
that you see on the table there.

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:52.800
That's a series called
"Gandharan Buddhist Text."

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.370
So that's the academic
presentation of this material.

00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:01.270
My other book is meant more
for the general readership.

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:09.030
So one of these years, I don't
dare be more specific on that,

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:13.400
I do commit myself that
there will be a black book

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.460
in the Gandharan Buddhist
text on this manuscript

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:23.730
and hopefully tomorrow I'll
begin making some progress

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.110
towards that.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.160
But for the meantime,
you can feel free

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.640
to consult my translation and
this is the book in question.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.720
This one already
actually exists.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.030
So thank you for your attention.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:38.830
Be glad to answer questions.

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:46.070
[ Applause ]

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:47.370
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar:
So we'll open it

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.960
up to questions if
anybody has any.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.070
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon: Please.

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.370
Yes.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.670
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:01.430
Could you just say something
about how the manuscripts,

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:07.460
I mean how we get manuscripts,
how [inaudible] manuscripts?

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:13.670
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon: Yes, that's
a little bit complicated.

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:18.800
The problem is that in nearly
all cases we don't really know

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.570
where the manuscripts come from

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:23.070
and that's why I
didn't talk about that.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:26.690
Almost all of the manuscripts
of this type have come

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:31.150
up through private collections
or antiquities market

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.880
and that is frankly
a murky place.

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.590
The people who have possession
of them may or may not know

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.590
where they actually came from
and they may or may not tell you

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.950
or may or may not
tell you the truth.

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:55.490
But what we do know fairly
certainly is that some,

00:58:55.490 --> 00:59:02.090
probably most, maybe all of them
were originally in clay pots

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.740
and we actually have not here

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.160
but in the British Library
we actually have one

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.300
of the clay pots
in which they came.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:13.900
And these pots were buried
probably under stupas

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.260
or near stupas in a monastery.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.300
So they put the manuscripts
in the pots,

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:24.970
sealed it up with a kind of,
I think probably with beeswax,

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:31.500
put a lid on it and sealed it,
and they buried it in the stupa.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:36.150
At least some of those came
from Hadda, in Afghanistan

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:38.520
if you're familiar with that.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.940
They all come --
They probably --

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.460
All of most of them come
from eastern Afghanistan,

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.930
maybe from some northwestern
Pakistan.

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:53.270
And so that's -- Unfortunately,
that's all we really know.

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:58.970
There are no cases where we
have any of these manuscripts

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:03.170
and know specifically definitely
exactly where they came from

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:10.130
but we have some general
knowledge about the provenance.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.300
It's a problem.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:17.230
Yes, please.

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:55.850
Yes. You may be referring to
in Buddhist literature they,

01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:03.220
in [inaudible], they talk about
Taxila, which was the great city

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.110
of that area, and they
call it the university

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.700
but that's actually kind of an
anachronism and that's something

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:14.720
that modern scholars, modern
translators have used that term

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.910
but really it was just kind
of center of learning but not

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.350
in a formal sense
of a university.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:28.280
But in terms of propagation,
well we don't know very much

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.630
about that but there's one very
important point that we do know

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:35.980
and that concerns what I
mentioned briefly before,

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.660
the transmission
of this material,

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.060
I mean Buddhist literature
in general,

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.740
into Central Asia
and into China.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:50.630
So there's something called
the Gandhari hypothesis

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.090
which I didn't talk about
but I will for a minute

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:54.820
because it's relevant
to your question.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:59.570
This is something that actually
goes back to I think the 1930s.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:04.960
It was first noticed that
if you look at some types

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.370
of Chinese Buddhist
texts and, of course,

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:11.560
Chinese Buddhist texts are, the
[inaudible] are all translated

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.170
from Indian originals.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.880
And this was a huge
enterprise that went

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.930
on from the second
century BC for, I'm sorry,

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.710
second century AD
for a thousand years.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.620
It was this enormous project

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.860
of translating the Buddhist
scriptures into Chinese.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.360
It's actually the biggest

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.100
and most impressive
translation project

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.430
in the history of the world.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:41.500
I'll go out on a
limb and say that.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.880
Very few people outside
Buddha circles know that

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.710
but it's a major achievement in
world civilization I would say.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:56.530
Now concerning that, there was
this idea called the Gandhari

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.600
hypothesis and what happened
is that certain text scholars,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.270
philologists were looking at
the early Chinese translations,

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.500
second, third, maybe
fourth century,

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.910
and looking at how they
rendered the Indian names.

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:15.520
And this was a problem
because Indian names

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.260
and Chinese names are extremely
different in the structure

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.700
of the language and the
sound system are so different

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.920
and the writing system,
everything is different,

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.660
so they struggled

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:32.330
with representing Buddhist
Indian names in Chinese but some

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:36.780
of these early scholars noted
that there were maybe oddities

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.860
in the way that the
names were presented

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.520
which made them question
what had been assumed,

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.800
which it was assumed that the
Chinese translations were made

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.740
from Sanskrit but
certain of the features

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:54.030
of the names actually
didn't line up with Sanskrit

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.600
but they do line up with
the corresponding Gandhari

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.400
pronunciations, like
that slide I showed you

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.960
where you'd see the
different sound systems.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.170
So the Gandhari hypothesis
then was

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:15.840
that the Chinese Buddhist
texts, not all of them

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.570
but the early phase,
were actually based not

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:21.780
on Sanskrit originals but
on Gandhari originals.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.800
And one of the question
marks about that theory was

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.490
at the time and for decades
afterwards there were no

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:29.790
Gandhari text.

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.130
Now to make a long
story short, there are

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:39.500
and so this new material
definitely supports,

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.720
I would say proves the
Gandhari hypothesis.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.330
So that's really, coming back to
your question, the propagation,

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.200
the historically
important propagation is

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.890
that these were brought
by various people

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:57.610
into China and translated.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.770
They probably wasn't
propagated in India proper

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:02.320
because in India proper,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.140
the other regions had their
own corresponding sets of texts

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.390
in their own local
languages and dialects.

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.840
I hope I answered your question.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.030
Yes, please.

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:19.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the
wonderful [inaudible] research.

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.360
Do you know the approximate
dimensions

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.620
of the original scrolls?

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon: Oh,
I didn't mention that.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.500
Is the facsimile
their actual size?

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.800
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: Close.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.100
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon: Yes.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.170
In the back, you can
look at it afterwards.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.240
About that long.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.920
Does that seem right?

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.510
So the original would've
been somewhat longer.

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:48.950
The dimensions of these
scrolls vary a lot.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.870
This is one of the shorter ones.

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.720
Ah, yes. Thank you.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.130
That long.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:01.410
This was probably,
as far as I see,

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:04.290
it was made from a single
piece of birch bark.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:06.670
But, of course, you're
limited by the size of --

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:10.560
So there are -- We have
some much longer scrolls,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.520
some that are several
yards long but,

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.750
of course, they're put together.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.260
We call them composite scrolls.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.210
They're sheets of bark, you
know, typically not longer

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:27.010
than this but there might be 10
or 15 or even more put together.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:30.950
I'm having some doubts because
there's a, you can't see it

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.310
from there, but there's
a blank strip here

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.240
and I wonder whether
that's actually a juncture

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.480
and whether this was
made, put together

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.850
from two separate pieces.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.910
So that's -- I'm going to
be checking that tomorrow.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:46.440
The range, very wide range.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.350

ones are about this high.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.970

I'm not sure I understand it.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:28.530
In the list of 15,
there's Sakyamuni the first

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:30.090
and of course it
doesn't say the first.

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.020
I just put together
those numbers.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.550
He was number eight.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.850
I don't know.

I'm not sure.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:38.450
And then Sakyamuni the second.

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:44.450
But there's another point about
that which I didn't mention.

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.310
I talked about that
list in the Mahavastu

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:54.640
of 331,140,263 buddhas.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:01.250
What I didn't say is that out of
the 300 million, out of the 331,

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:03.600
300 million were
named Sakyamuni.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.880
And according to that
text, there was a stretch

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.610
of 30 million buddhas in a row
that were all had the same name.

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:18.950
And I have thought about and
failed to understand what that,

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:21.510
why that is and what that means.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:27.390
But there is -- You know,
buddhas are and by impression,

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:31.050
they're more or less the
same and their images,

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:35.500
I don't think I have one
here, but you see in Gandhari

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.750
and other sculptures,
you see sets of buddhas

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.400
like the seven buddhas or
sometimes eight buddhas

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.410
and they're all almost
exactly the same.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:48.450
So there seems to be a
range of possibilities

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:52.320
that buddhas are always similar
and they can be very similar

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.590
and sometimes they are
absolutely identical.

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.240
But I'm still pondering that.

Yes. It's hard to
give exact numbers.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:37.660
Let me explain the problem.

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.350
There are groups of manuscripts.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:45.490
There are six or
seven major groups.

01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:50.230
And typically, one of these
groups will typically have,

01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:53.660
take two or three
dozen manuscripts

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.590
but there's one group
which comes

01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:59.580
from a place called Bamiyan,
which people have heard

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.530
of because they were, everybody
knows they were giant buddhas

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:08.890
and the Taliban blew them up
in 1999 or whenever it was.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:12.310
What the public general
doesn't know is

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:14.230
that they were also
thousands and thousands

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:17.870
of manuscripts found there.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:23.300
And most of those manuscripts
were later manuscripts

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.980
in Sanskrit but there's
an early phase

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:33.400
of Gandhari manuscripts similar
to what I've been talking about.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:40.480
Now that contains -- That
consists of 300 or so fragments

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.030
and most of them are -- When I
say fragments, I mean like this.

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.730
So it's very hard to
say, okay, what is that?

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:50.260
Is that 300 manuscripts
or are they part

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:55.500
and how many manuscripts
were they actually parts of

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.800
and in most cases they're

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.470
so small that's it's
hard to be sure.

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:05.630
So there might be 300 fragments
but there might've been 50

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:10.430
or 60 manuscripts at a
little more than a guess.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.650
So that's why the
numbers are very fuzzy

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.580
and that's why I've
been a little bit vague.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:20.470
But I would say we have
-- Well, I said 200 --

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:24.710
We have partial remnants
of at least 200 manuscripts

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:27.330
and we have possibly
more than that.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:31.380
In terms of complete manuscripts
or texts that are complete

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:37.190
or more or less complete,
you know, say 90%,

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:41.290
very few, maybe three or four.

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:45.300
This thing, I think I actually
calculated, I don't remember.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.800
We have maybe 75 to 80%
of the original of this

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.900
and that's much, much
better than usual.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.800
So it's a little hard to
say exactly how much we have

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.620
but we do have a lot of
material, enough to really begin

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.750
to get a glimpse
of the big picture.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.550
Yes, please.

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:24.600
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:31.040
The answer is almost
all are Buddhist texts,

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.950
not necessarily sutras
but Buddhist texts

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:41.740
of any kind clearly
Buddhist content.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:49.000
Sorry, I broke your microphone.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.690
There are two exceptions
in all of these 200

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.120
or whatever manuscripts,
there are two exceptions

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.030
but they're really interesting.

01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:01.590
One of them is a kind
of legal document.

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:06.370
The other, which was just
discovered very recently and is

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:07.670
about to be published

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.440
by my colleague Mark
Allen [assumed spelling],

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.860
you might know who he is.

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.760
And it's actually
just little fragments

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.230
of what would've been a very
interesting text but it's enough

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.530
to see what's going on.

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:29.940
It's actually a record of the
monastery's record of donations.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:35.720
And not only that, it lists
the names of the donors

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.090
and the primary donor
was [inaudible],

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:48.300
who's a well-known figure in
Indian history of around 100 AD.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.000
So this is really a great thing
for us because it clarifies

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.070
and confirms the historical
context within that period

01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:00.330
that I talked about, that
so-called foreign ruler period,

01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:07.390
and he was previously known but
[inaudible] his relationship

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:10.530
to Buddhism was not
clear and now we have it.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:15.280
He was mentioned several
times in this text.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.110
So it's not a Buddhist text in
the sense that the others are

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:23.680
but it's monastic business
and it's a real eyeopener.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.880
And this is going to be
published in a few months.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.380
So really change the picture.

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:34.790
But that's all we have
so far of that type.

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.090
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: I
think we have time

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:41.610
for maybe one more question.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.580
Are there any burning questions?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.810
Otherwise, we'll be here
around the reading room

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.630
for [inaudible] afterwards but
I feel incredibly fortunate

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:50.930
to be learning so
much about the scroll.

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:52.230
Thank you so much, Dr. Solomon.

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:53.530
&gt;&gt; Richard Solomon: My pleasure.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.330
Thank you.
