they'll say oh well I can't really do

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569
they'll say oh well I can't really do
 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:23.999

that now or I'm not gonna do that now
 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.830
that now or I'm not gonna do that now
and what I advocate is being more

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840
and what I advocate is being more
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.559
and what I advocate is being more

is that are gonna be your priorities and

the way that I recommend is to get index

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149
the way that I recommend is to get index
 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.690
the way that I recommend is to get index
cards and put one task on each card and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700
cards and put one task on each card and
 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.850
cards and put one task on each card and
then you can reorganize them throughout

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860
then you can reorganize them throughout
 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160
then you can reorganize them throughout
the day you you can put this one here

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
the day you you can put this one here
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.589
the day you you can put this one here
and this one here and the beauty of this

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599
and this one here and the beauty of this
 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.719
and this one here and the beauty of this
is that once you've prioritized

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
is that once you've prioritized
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580
is that once you've prioritized

whatever's on that top card that's the
 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.690
whatever's on that top card that's the
thing that is the most important thing

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
thing that is the most important thing
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.389
thing that is the most important thing
you should be doing and so you find that

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399
you should be doing and so you find that
 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.979
you should be doing and so you find that
your mind doesn't wander you're more

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989
your mind doesn't wander you're more
 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.449
your mind doesn't wander you're more
efficient and productive because you're

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459
efficient and productive because you're
 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.520
efficient and productive because you're
really focused on that now that most

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530
