00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
Disney World is supposed to be the happiest
and most magical place on earth and if you

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.260
ask anyone who has been, they will likely
agree.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
The Disney corporation seems to be pretty
fond of it’s world famous amusement parks

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.030
as well as they are not shy to reference them
in their movies.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.650
Some references are out in the open and other
are more cleverly woven into their film.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.100

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.700
Beauty &amp; the Beast
Beauty &amp; The Beast is one of the greatest

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.270
Disney films of all time and the world is
excited to see the Emma Watson led live action

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.340
adaption in 2017.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.800
This movie has tons of fun references hidden
within it, but there is one sneaky nod to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.300
Disney land that most audience members may
have missed.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.550
When Maurice and Felipe are lost in the woods
they find a road sign with arrows pointing

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.550
in a bunch of different direction., two of
the routes on the sign read Anaheim and Valencia.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.580
Why does this matter?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.939
Well Anaheim is of course Where Disneyland
is and is Valencia is where California Institute

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.299
of the Arts is located and many Disney artists
come from.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.820
It’s a quick reference and you need to be
watching closely, but it’s definitely one

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.679
that fans appreciated!

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:23.670
Pirates Of The Caribbean
When you think of Disney movies, your mind

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.619
probably doesn’t instantly jump to the Pirates
Of The Caribbean films, but in reality they

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.670
are some of the most successful movies Disney
has ever made.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.370
One of the coolest things about the Pirates
franchise is that the entire world was wased

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.380
on the Disney theme park ride of the same
name, Gore Verbinski's 2003"Pirates of the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.240
Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" put
a story behind the popular ride and turned

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.070
out to be a major blockbuster hit.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.069
Today, the four films have combined to gross
$3.73 billion at the worldwide box office.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.219
That total will only be going up, as the fifth
installment in the franchise will be arriving

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.249
to theaters soon.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.630
It is pretty crazy to think that a movie based
on a silly ride would turn out to be such

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.149
a huge hit for Disney.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.679
Tomorrowland
2015’s Tomorrowland is probably the most

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.150
“Disney” movie on this list.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.950
The whole film is centered around a park just
like Disney World and much of the movie was

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.420
shot in the parks.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.400
While Tomorrowland is intended to be a look
into the future of mankind’s resourcefulness,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.480
it also made time for some fun Disney World
shout outs.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560
While most of Tomorrowland’s exhibits were
about scientific progress and technological

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.950
advances, it also featured references to Space
Mountain, one of Disney World’s oldest and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.310
most famous roller coasters!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.209
Cinderella
The Disney castle is one of the most iconic

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.640
and recognizable images in the world.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
The magic castle is synonymous with the brand
so it makes sense that it is present in the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000
parks and films.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.180
The real world castle is right in the center
of the park and makes for a great backdrop

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.200
for your family vacation photos.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.010
The castle can also be seen in both the animated
and live action versions of Cinderella, where

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.010
it originated.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.890
The goal of the Disney theme parks is to let
the public live within the magical world of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.209
Disney and having the giant and iconic castle
present is a must.

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.709
Saving Mr. Banks
Saving Mr. Banks is a great movie that takes

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.700
a look behind the scenes of the creation of
the Disney classic Mary Poppins.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.890
In the film, Tom Hanks took on the role of
Walt Disney himself as the story follows him

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.000
trying to convince British author P.L.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.670
Travers, played by Emma Thompson in the film,
to allow her Mary Poppins children's books

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.099
to be made into a musical.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.569
Saving Mr Banks actually shot a of the movie
on the Disney lot and within the Disneyland

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.569
parks.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.670
They were able to transform the modern day
park back to its 1960’s roots with clever

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.209
set and costume design.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.920
This is most likely the best film to have
been shot at Disneyland and is a must see

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:53.319
for anyone interested in the behind the magic
action that goes on at Disney.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.249
The Haunted Mansion
The Haunted Mansion is one of the most famous

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.709
Disney attractions of all time, so famous,
that it was actually given a shot as a movie.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.310
The film starred Eddie Murphy and was released
in 2003 alongside Pirates Of The Caribbean.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.569
Unfortunately for The Haunted Mansion, it
did not find anywhere near the same amount

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.569
of success.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.109
The cool thing about the movie, however, was
how much the mansion resembled the one from

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.160
Disney and audiences had a great time identifying
similarities between the two.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.150
There have been talks about Hollywood taking
another stab at making this movie, but as

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.680
of now, nothing has been confirmed.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.930
The Country Bears
What is your favorite Disney movie of all

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.930
time?

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.800
If you said The Country Bears, we are genuinely
shocked.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.460
The Country Bears is a 2002 American family
musical comedy and is based on the famous

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.420
Disney attraction Country Bear Jamboree.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.070
The attraction was a big hit at Disney, but
it didn’t seem to translate to the big screen

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.500
in any compelling way.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.680
The film did have a few good actors in Haley
Joel Osment and Christopher Walken, but that’s

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680
about it.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.750
While it was a fun idea to see the attraction
re-imagined as a movie, it probably would

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.610
have been better if it just stayed part of
the park.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.220
Mulan
People may not realize just how big a part

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.199
Disney World played in the creation of the
1998 hit movie, Mulan.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.060
Mulan was the first animated film to be produced
primarily at the Disney animation studio at

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.640
Disney’s Hollywood Studios, which was part
of Disney World.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.051
The idea of having people work on Disney content
from within their world was a cool one, but

00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:26.199
unfortunately they have stopped doing it.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.310
Two other Disney classics were also created
at this Disney World studio, Brother Bear

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.780
and Lilo and Stitch.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.780
The studio closed down in 2004, so it doesn’t
look like we will be getting any more movies

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.270
with this particular identity any time soon.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.440
Hercules
Hercules is the zero-to-hero story of the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.370
son of Zeus and his adventures.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.090
The movie is one of Disney’s bests and brought
us some of the most memorable songs of all

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.090
time.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.730
Hercules goes from being a scrawny farm boy,
to a super jacked demon fight god all in a

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.330
few verses of song.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.980
In the Zero to Hero song there are lots of
sneaky easter eggs such as Lion King’s Scar

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.800
as a rug, but fans may have missed the nod
to Disneyland and the Disney as a brand overall.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.030
As Hercules rises in fame, kids are shown
to be playing with Herc dolls, drinking from

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.789
Herc cups, etc.

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.669
This self-referential moment is Disney’s
way of making fun of how they have commercialized

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.110
all of their content with the creation of
theme parks, action figures, lunch boxes and

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:33.120
everything else a kid could ever want!

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.919
Zootopia
Zootopia took the world by storm in 2016 and

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.370
made people remember just how good Disney
is at making fun and meaningful animated movies

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.259
that the whole family can truly enjoy.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.220
There are a ton of Easter eggs and hidden
messages in this movie but there is one that

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.150
you have to be pretty geographically savvy
to catch.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.000
In the movie, the design and color scheme
of the license plates of Zootopia directly

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
resemble the real license plates of the state
of Florida.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Why does this matter?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.009
Well, Walt Disney World is located in Lake
Buena Vista, Florida, so this was clearly

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.580
a fun shout out and done with intention.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.650
So there’s our list of 10 Disney movies
with cleverly hidden Disney World easter eggs

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.650
in them.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.650
What did you think of our list?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.800
