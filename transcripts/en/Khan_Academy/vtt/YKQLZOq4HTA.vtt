00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.110
Solve for p.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.000
We have the absolute value of p minus 12
plus 4 is less than 14.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.170
So, let's just do this one step at a time.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.450
The first thing we wanna do is we really

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.980
just wanna isolate the part that has the
absolute value.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.930
So, to do that we can just get rid of this
positive 4 here.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.840
We can do that by subtracting 4 from both
sides of the inequality.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.858
And so the left hand side the positive 4
and the negative 4

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:33.590
cancel out we're just left with the
absolute value of p minus 12.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.632
And on the right hand side it, we get 14
minus

00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.290
4 is 10 and we still have the less than
sign.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.908
So we have the absolute value of p minus
12 is less than 10.

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:46.440
So let's just think about it a little bit.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.986
If I were to tell you, if I were to tell
you that

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.950
the absolute value of x is less than 10
what does that mean?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.750
That means that the distance from x to 0
has to be less than 10.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.734
So if I were to draw a number line, if I
were to draw a number

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:06.660
line and put 0 here we can only go up 10
away and even that's too far.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.168
It has to be less than 10.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.338
So if this is positive 10 it would have to

00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:13.381
be less than positive 10 cuz 10 is exactly
10 away.

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.710
We have to be less than 10 away from 0.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.974
And then we could go all the way to the
left until negative 10

00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:24.430
and even that we wouldn't be able to
include because its absolute value is 10.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.344
It's not less than 10 but negative 9

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:29.282
negative 9.999 we could include all of
those things.

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:33.610
The absolute value of any of those things
is gonna be less than 10.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.758
So another way to write this, this
absolute value inequality

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:43.708
is that x could be, x could be greater
than negative 10, x

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:47.965
could be greater than negative 10 and x
needs to be

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:52.170
less than 10 or we can write this as x is
between.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.080
So negative 10 is kinda the bottom

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.420
boundary and we're not going to include
it.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.450
X is going to be greater than that and is
less than 10.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.500
So this is another way to write the
absolute value of x is less than 10.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010
Is essentially saying that x has to be
between negative 10

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.930
and 10 and it can't be either negative 10
or 10.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.080
We're not, there's no equals sign here.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.517
So, the same exact logic.

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:16.340
Instead of an x we have a p minus 12 here.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.444
So, we can write the absolute value of p
minus 12 is less than 10 is

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:27.020
saying that negative 10 is less than p
minus 12 which is less than 10.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.380
And we can just solve this compound
inequality all

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.103
at once by isolating the p in the middle.

00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:35.315
The best way to isolate the p in the

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.459
middle we wanna get rid of this negative
12.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.550
So let's add 12 to all three, all three
sections of this compound inequality.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.370
And so we get negative 10 plus 12 is
positive 2.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.620
And then is less than p minus 12 plus 12
is just p.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.480
And then is less than 10 plus 12 is 22.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.250
So p is greater than 2 and less than 22.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.710
So if we were to plot it on a number line
our solution set looks like this.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.510
So this might be 2 over here.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.350
This might be 22 over here maybe 0 sitting
right over here.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.620
P is greater than 2.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.710
P is greater than 2.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.060
It's not greater than or equal to so we
have to not fill this in.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.920
It has to be an open circle it's only
greater than and it's less than 22.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.390
It's not less than or equal to so we're
not gonna fill that circle in.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.470
And it's everything, it's everything in
between.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.510
And we can verify it for ourselves.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.690
Let's try a value that might work out
well.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.490
Well, 12 is in between these two numbers.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.170
It's in our magenta region right here.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.780
So let's try p is equal to 12.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.190
So if you have 12 minus 12.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.720
So it's the absolute value of 12 minus 12
plus 4 which should be less than 14.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.140
So this is 0 plus 4 which needs to be less
than 14 and 4 is definitely less than 14.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.150
So 12 worked 0 shouldn't work.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.210
Lets try 0.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.440
Zero minus 12 so it's the absolute value
of 0.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.900
I wanna do this in a different color.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.230
It is the absolute value of 0 minus 12
plus 4.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.120
This should not be less than 14.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.160
This should not work.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.709
So we get the absolute value of negative
12.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.005
Plus 4 should not be less than 14.

00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.246
Then we should end up with a contradiction
here.

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.941
So we have 12 plus 4 less than 14 we end

00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:29.052
up with 16 is less than 14 which is not
true.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:32.900
So 0 does not work so at least we're
feeling pretty good.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.105
We took something outside of our solution
set didn't

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.440
work something inside of our solution set
it did work.
