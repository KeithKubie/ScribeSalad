00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's try to compute 6 times 37.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.005
And I'll show you one
way of doing this.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.380
And then in future
videos, we can

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.129
look at other ways of
doing this and think

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.374
about why this is
actually working.

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:13.040
So what I like to
do-- and this is often

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.681
called the standard
method-- is take

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.930
the larger of the two numbers.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.644
It doesn't matter if you're
doing 6 times 37 or 37 times 6.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:19.560
They equal each other.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.269
6 times 37 is the same
thing as 37 times 6.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.810
So what I like to do is I take
the larger of the two numbers,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.840
and I write it on top.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.985
So I'll write 37.

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:32.180
And then the smaller
of the two numbers,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.846
which is 6, I'll write
it on the bottom.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.060
And I'll align it by
the correct place.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.410
This only has one digit.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.060
It's in the ones
place, obviously.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.090
So I can write the
6 right over here.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.930
And I'll write the
multiplication symbol

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.780
like that.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.980
And this is just another way
of expressing 37 times 6, which

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.940
is the same thing as 6 times 37.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.380
Now, what we do is
we go with this,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.922
the first place in
this lower number.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.254
And there's only one place here.

00:00:58.254 --> 00:00:59.926
It's only the number
6 right over here.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.300
And we're going to multiply
that times each of the digits

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.390
up here.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.300
So first, we will
start with 6 times 7.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.710
So we're going to first
multiply 6 times 7.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.030
Well, you remember from
your multiplication tables,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.720
6 times 7 is equal to 42.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.200
Now, we don't just
write 42 here.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
At least, not in
the standard method

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.360
we wouldn't write 42 here.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.140
We'd write the 2 in
42 in the ones place.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.830
So we'd write that
right over there.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.100
And then we'd carry the 4
in 42 up to the tens place.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.550
Now we need to think
about what 6 times 3 is.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.080
Well, once again,
we know 6 times 3.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.320
6 times 3 is equal to 18.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.370
But we can't just
write an 18 down here.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.160
We still have this
4 to deal with.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.000
So 6 times 3 is 18, but
we've got to then add the 4.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.303
So 6 times 3 is
18, plus 4 is 22.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:01.020
So it's 6 times
3, and then we're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.160
adding that 4 right over there.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.380
And that's how we get
our answer-- so 222.
