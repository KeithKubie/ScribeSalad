00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:09.629
You might not think dogs would be allowed into a hospital. [Griffin] "Our dogs have to be washed, cleaned

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.620
and brushed and everything.”

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.729
We recently met up with Ellen Griffin and Gerry Serotte,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.049
two dog handlers who volunteer for a dog therapy program called Happy Tails Pet Therapy.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.240
On this day the dogs were visiting patients

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.090
in Emory Saint Joseph’s oncology unit.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.199
[Dexter] “The program started small.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.609
One of our managers approached me and asked me if I was in favor of doing it, and I said ‘absolutely.’”

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.919
Hospital CEO Heather Dexter knows from firsthand experience the comfort a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.829
therapy dog can bring to patients and their loved ones.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.209
“My brother was in a bad car accident many years ago and was in a coma for almost a year,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.120
and during that time we had Happy Tails dogs come into his room. And I remember —

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.039
he was in a coma he wasn't responding a significant amount — when that dog came in,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.299
you could see him relax, you could see him engage a little bit with the world around him,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.689
and I would also notice that my parents would relax. And it was a moment to give them a little bit less

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.210
stress and something to look forward to in the hospital.”

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.949
Dexter's brother never recovered from his injuries but his own pet golden retriever would go on to become a comfort dog.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.059
“My mom decided to honor my brother's memory by training his dog for Happy Tails,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.990
and so his golden retriever was actually a Happy Tails dog for many years after his death.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.039
Happy Tails dogs started visiting Emory Saint Joseph’s in 2011.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.859
[Griffin] “We had a team of two dogs and we visited in the radiation room and in the infusion center

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.919
and through the years it's gotten so popular that we now visit seven areas in the hospital

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.979
and I have about 30 dogs involved in the program.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.249
A lot of times we go in and the patient is just down, I mean not smiling, very depressed,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.490
and we’ll say, “Would you like to meet our dog?” and they'll look like ‘Maybe… maybe not.”

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.460
And I’ll say “Well, just let Amy come in for a minute,” and by the time we leave they're laughing,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.380
they're talking, they're interacting with us. And that's just what we do — we try to brighten brighten their day.”

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.420
And the dogs also brighten the day of the medical staff.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.320
[Serotte] “It also changes your life. I mean it's made my life bigger and my heart fuller,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.300
I'm not the same person.”

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.580
[Dexter] “They bring joy, so that helps with the healing process, but they also bring normalcy, and it gives them

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.960
something, it gives them some sense of a stress-free environment, some balance and ultimately joy.”
