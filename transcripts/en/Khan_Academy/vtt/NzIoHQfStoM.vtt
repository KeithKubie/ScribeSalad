00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.260
Write 2.75 as a simplified
fraction.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.450
So once you get some
practice here.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.230
You're going to find it pretty
straightforward to do.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.990
But we're really going to think
through it and get the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.740
intuition for why this
makes sense.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.100
So if we were to write this
down, the 2, that literally

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.140
just represents two 1's, I'll
just write it down like that.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.910
Then we have the 7
in another color.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.020
We have a 7 one place to the
right of the decimal.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.420
It's in the tenths place,
with a T-H-S at the end.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.460
So it literally represents
7 over 10.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.110
And then finally, we have the 5
in the hundredths place, so

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.990
it represents 5 over 100.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.270
Now, if I want to write this as
a simplified fraction, or

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.240
really as a mixed number, I have
to merge these fraction

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.400
parts right here.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.320
And to add two fractions, you
have to have a common

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.330
denominator.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.560
And to figure out the common
denominator, you just have to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.920
think about the least common
multiple of 10 and 100.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.069
And that's 100.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.890
100 is divisible by
both 100 and 10.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.400
So let's get this
10 to be 100.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.720
So we can do that by multiplying
it by 10.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.920
So when you multiply something
by 10, you add a zero

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.790
at the end of it.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.620
But you can't just do that
to the denominator.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.320
We also have to do that
to the numerator.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.120
So we multiplied the
denominator by 10.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.310
Let's also multiply the
numerator by 10.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
7 times 10 is 70,
or 70 over 100.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.470
It's the exact same
thing as 7/10.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.870
Now we can add these two.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.210
What is 70 plus 5?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.240
70 plus 5 is 75.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.100
And our denominator is
100, so this can be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.310
rewritten as 2 and 75/100.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.800
And we saw that in the last
video, you would read this as

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.580
two and seventy-five
hundredths.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.790
Now we aren't in a completely
simplified fraction yet

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.670
because 75 and 100 have
common factors.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.220
And the largest number that
goes into both, if you're

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.990
familiar with quarters, is 25.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.320
Three quarters is $0.75, four
quarters is 100 cents, or four

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.190
quarters is $1.00.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.110
So you divide both
of them by 25.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.150
So 75 divided by 25 is 3, and
100 divided by 25 is 4.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.540
So as a simplified mixed
number, this

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.330
becomes 2 and 3/4.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.600
And after you do a lot of
practice here, and you just

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.770
see a lot of numbers like this,
it will be almost second

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.120
nature for you to say, oh, 2.75
is the same thing as 2

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.400
and 75/100, is the same
thing as 2 and 3/4.
