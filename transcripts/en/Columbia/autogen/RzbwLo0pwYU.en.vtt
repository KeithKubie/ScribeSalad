that and I think it begs a lot of

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
that and I think it begs a lot of
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.250
that and I think it begs a lot of
questions and some answers a number of

and my answer is no and yes to that I

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
and my answer is no and yes to that I
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.050
and my answer is no and yes to that I
think no in a very simple sense if we

model if you will so I think that that

was really helpful but all of that

and I think a couple of things are very
 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.900
