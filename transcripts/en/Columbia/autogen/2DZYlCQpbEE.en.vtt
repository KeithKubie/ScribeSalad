collections Explorer is where you search

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
collections Explorer is where you search
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.710
collections Explorer is where you search
the union catalog and if you go to the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
the union catalog and if you go to the
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.330
the union catalog and if you go to the
advanced search that was just the quick

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
advanced search that was just the quick
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.670
advanced search that was just the quick
and dirty search of course here you can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
and dirty search of course here you can
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860
and dirty search of course here you can
limit by field within the record

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
limit by field within the record
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110
limit by field within the record
metadata and you can also limit your

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
metadata and you can also limit your
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.200
metadata and you can also limit your
search by organization so this gives you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210
search by organization so this gives you
 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.000
search by organization so this gives you
a lot more precision in your searches

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
a lot more precision in your searches
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.350
a lot more precision in your searches
the other thing that's interesting is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
the other thing that's interesting is
 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.330
the other thing that's interesting is
that you can search by organization and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
that you can search by organization and
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.190
that you can search by organization and
sometimes you'll get a little better

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
sometimes you'll get a little better
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.080
sometimes you'll get a little better
functionality than that way than if you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
functionality than that way than if you
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.940

allows you to go through field by field
and just and look at how we define each

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.050
and just and look at how we define each
 

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.290
and just and look at how we define each
field for example title will say this is

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:13.300
field for example title will say this is
 

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.240

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:16.870
your data elements which you gave us
 

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.990
your data elements which you gave us
choose from the pulldown menu which of

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000
choose from the pulldown menu which of
 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.700
choose from the pulldown menu which of

your data elements is the same as what
 

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.530
your data elements is the same as what
we call title and then they just go

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:22.540
we call title and then they just go
 

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.870
we call title and then they just go
through element by element and really

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880
through element by element and really
