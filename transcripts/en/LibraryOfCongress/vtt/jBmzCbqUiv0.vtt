&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.850
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Hi students.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.150
&gt;&gt; [unison] Hi.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.450
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Everybody

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.750
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Everybody ready?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.050
&gt;&gt; [unison] Yes.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.250
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well I'm the
new Librarian of Congress.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.080
[applause] The world's
largest library

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.250
so you know I'm excited, right?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.080
I've just been on the job about a
week and this is a special thing

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.590
to see a person that I, I've been
watching her for a long time.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.950
[inaudible] And when I saw you guys
coming in with your bags I thought,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.960
gee, she's here to tell you about
and share with you her new book.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.250
Now you mentioned the
movie, what was it?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.550
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: My Girl.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: My Girl, guess what
other movie she was in, it's scary?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.960
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
No, no, they won't know.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.170
[laughter] Beverly Hills
Chihuahua was scary.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.050
&gt;&gt; I saw that movie.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.470
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
Did you see that movie?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.770
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.040
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Did you
ever see the movie Freaky Friday?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See
she was in that.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.940
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: I
was in that movie too.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.240
[inaudible audience comment]

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.540
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Annabelle?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.340
No, no, I wasn't in Annabelle.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:54.160
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.540 position:56%
I'm going to tell you in two minutes

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.690
after Dr. Hayden finishes
what she's telling you.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What
I'm tell you is we're

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940
in for a really good surprise

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.390
because [inaudible]
Jamie Lee Curtis.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.320
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Thank
you, Dr. [applause] Hi guys.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.020
Yes so let's clear
this up, shall we?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.540
So some of you may have seen
me on TV or in a movie, right?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.570
You've seen me on TV and maybe
you've seen the movie Beverly

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.060
Hills Chihuahua.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.360
&gt;&gt; I saw it.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.660
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Maybe
you've seen the movie My Girl.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.730
Maybe you've seen the
movie Freaky Friday.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.150
So here's my question,
you guys are really smart.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.770
Do you know the difference between
being an actor and being a writer?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.740
What does an actor do?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.410
Yes? Yes? No, no the young person
right behind you right there.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.810
You raised your hand, do
you know what an actor does?

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.250
Can you think?

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.740
Hold on, give her a chance.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.040
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.340
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
Ok, anybody else?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.640
What does an actor do?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.940
&gt;&gt; An actor acts in a movie.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Right but is it
her real self or is she pretending?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.010
&gt;&gt; Pretending.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.880
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Ok so an
actor pretends to be somebody else

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.530 position:56%
and that's what actors do and that's
a great job and I get to pretend

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.680
to be people all the time
that aren't really me.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.910
But my real name is Jamie Lee
Curtis and I'm a real person

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.200
but in the movies I'm pretending
to be the girl in Freaky Friday

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.420
or the mommy of the doggy
in Beverly Hills Chihuahua

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.710
or the makeup artist in My Girl.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.670
So that's the difference

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.120
between being an actor
and being a real person.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.100
Now does anybody in the room know
what a writer does, an author?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.400
Yes, what does an author do?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.110
All the way in the back.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.880
&gt;&gt; An author writes the book.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.960
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
They write the stories.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.370
Now do you guys write stories?

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.670
&gt;&gt; [unison] Yes.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.780
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Yes,
everybody can be a writer.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.690
There's not one thing anybody
needs to do other than be a writer.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.230
As long as you can know your
letters or you have an imagination

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.570
in your head, you're a writer.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.950
So a writer writes the stories.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.500
And do you know what
an illustrator does?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.800
Yes?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.850
&gt;&gt; It colors the book.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.310
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Right, they
color the books with their pictures

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.980
and their colors that they choose
and the characters that they make.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.530 position:56%
So if this is the book, I'm the lady
that wrote the words and the story

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.210
and my illustrator is the
woman who draws the pictures.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.890
And her name is Laura Cornell
and she's a great friend

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.490
of mine and a beautiful partner.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.350
So I am a lady who writes books.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.470
I also pretend to be other people.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.470
I also am a mommy and I have a dog.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.960
So I'm just like everybody else.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.260
&gt;&gt; A girl dog?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.560
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
A boy dog named JJ.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.030
&gt;&gt; How old are you?

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.330
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: How old am I?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.180
I am 57 years old.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.480
&gt;&gt; Wow. [laughter]

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.570
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: I
know, that's like way old.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.000
Now before I begin I have a
traditional way I like to do

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.620 position:56%
which makes the kids get really
quiet and they sort of really listen

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.440
to me because they can't believe
what they've just seen and heard.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.200 position:56%
So the first thing I'd like to do is
just since you guys have just been

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.960
in a car so in your seats where
you are, everybody in the room,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.390
let's just wiggle a little,
just to get our ya ya's out.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.440
Just to kind of get, you know
we've all been trying to sit still.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.790
Ok everybody stop for a second.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.720
Now everybody close
their eyes for a second.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.800
Just breathe in your nose, exhale
out your mouth, just relax.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.100
Listen to my voice.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.020
Keep your eyes closed.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.540 position:56%
Now everybody open their eyes and
very quietly without making a sound,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.930
let's do a silent scream.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.880
So like if you're screaming
with excitement

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.700
because it's your birthday,
everybody silent scream like this.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.120
So everybody go like this, like
you're screaming but no noise.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.270
Now everybody make a super tiny
face, like a super small face,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.580
like make your face
really, really small

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.300
and now silent scream, tiny face.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.700
Ok now we're in our bodies.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.370
Now we need to be in our ears.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.670
So does anybody here have
a baby sister or brother?

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.750
Wow, ok, and does anybody
have, so how old is your baby,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.680
two months or four months?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.980
&gt;&gt; Two.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.290
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Two months
and is the baby wet, poopy, hungry,

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.220
tired, cranky or all of the above?

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.440
&gt;&gt; [unison] All of the above.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.300
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
Never has failed me.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:24.840
So this is a two month old,
all of the above, baby.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.640
Listening with our ears.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:34.510
[ Baby crying ]

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.910
[ Laughter ]

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.670
Now you're listening.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:48.080
Now I'm going to tell
you about my book.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.680
This is a book about a teacher.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.050
This is a book about a teacher who
brings something to her classroom

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.360
of kids just like you
and asks them a question.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.540
And it's written by me, Jamie,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.810
and it's illustrated
by my partner, Laura.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.480
And I'm going to read it to
you now and then I'm going

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.130
to ask you a couple questions, ok?

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.390
So everybody put their
listening ears on, relax.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.290
So the book is called, This is Me,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.550
the Story of Who We are
and Where We Came From.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.840
My great grandmother came
from a far distant place.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.760
She came on a boat with
just this small case.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.870
Great grandmother left
her family and friends

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.380
to cross the great sea
to a land at the end.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.910
Her parents just told
her, she had no say,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.040
tomorrow we leave for
a place far away.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.940
So fill up this case with things
you love best, sadly you'll have

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.010
to leave all of the rest.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.320
Did she wear all her clothes
to leave her more space?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.230
Could her family album
fit in this case?

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.300
I know she took ribbons and
some things to eat and shoes

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.430
when they said to take
care of her feet.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.190
The whole family tree, pen and
pencil set, one writing journal,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.910
a comb and barrette, great
great grandma's necklace,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.090
her own handmade doll that
she clutched on her journey

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.560
when she felt very small.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.830
How did she do it?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.060
What would you take?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.270
Would you be scared that
you'd make a mistake?

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.620
How would you know in
this case what to pack?

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.660
And that once you had left
there'd be no coming back.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.740
So you, my dear class,
have big choices to make.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.590
When you take this case
home, what would you take?

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.710
Then we go into the room of a
bunch of the kids in the class.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.030
And the first kid we
go into is named Trey.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:19.110 position:56%
And Trey is a figure skater, which I
learned when I saw the illustration.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:25.480
I couldn't take paintings or Diglet
[phonetic] my rat, or trophies,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.980
or school books, or
dad's hand carved bat.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.880
Now we're in Chenaye's
[phonetic] room.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.190 position:56%
She says I'd take lots of photos and
the doll my gram sewed and my first

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.820
in line ticket to Katie's
first show.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.220
She really likes Katie Perry.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.900
I've heard she's a singer.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.890
Then Kate says my punk rocker
Barbie, my mom was one too,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.450
my barely stuffed bear,
old Winnie the Pooh.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:07.560
And then Roberto says a
[inaudible] beret, my ukulele,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.090
my St. Christopher medal
to look out for me.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:19.570
And then Luke says my Groucho Marx
glasses, weird Al's signed CD,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.850
my Notre Dame jersey,
my [inaudible].

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:32.410
And then Ollie says Legos, a
camera to film when I leave,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:37.300
if this really happened,
it'd be hard to believe.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:44.330
And then Alayna [phonetic] says
but I'd be so excited with all

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:49.480
that was new, people and
things to meet and to do.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.320
Now the teacher is
saying, great work, Alayna,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.670
for the time that you took.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.950
This suitcase is like
your own history book.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.830
For who we all are isn't just what
you've got but part what you learn

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.640
and part what you're taught.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.780
Who you become starts
with your past.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.110
Family histories and
stories that last.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.750
This great tide that brought
you, seeds ancestors sowed

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:21.260
that took root inside you
and helped you go grow.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.120
Now you take this case
and imagine it's true,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.640
that you're leaving
and needing to choose.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.160
What says you?

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:37.050
What would you take and what would
they be that says to the world,

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:43.070
and then at the back of the book
there's a suitcase and you open it.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.080
Hi there. This is me.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.380
That's the book.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:13:00.540 position:56%
So [applause] So my question is if
you were leaving and needing to fill

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.900
up a small suitcase with the
stuff that you would want to take

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.570
from your family, from
your room, something.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.340
Can any of you think
of something you would

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.980
like to share what you
would take in your suitcase?

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.280
What would you take?

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.160
&gt;&gt; I would take a stuffed animal.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.460
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Which one?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.770
&gt;&gt; It is a robot, Star Wars.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.360
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: It's
a Star Wars robot toy?

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.570
Do you love Star Wars?

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.870
Yeah? Me too.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.880
Who's your favorite character?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.240

Oh the little round thing,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.540

What about you?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.230
&gt;&gt; I would take a Ninja Turtle.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.530

&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: A
Ninja Turtle, which one?

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.430
&gt;&gt; The blue one.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.080
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: The
blue one is Michelangelo?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.640
&gt;&gt; [unison] No, Leonardo.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Sorry, I forgot
my colors on my Ninja Turtles.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.210
It's been awhile.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.040
So you would take the blue one.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.340
&gt;&gt; Leonardo.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.120

&gt;&gt; I would take Princess.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.670

[inaudible audience comment]
So it's a Disney princess, yes?

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.380
And it's a doll.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.340
So you would take a doll also.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.640
Yes, the little boy right there.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.240

&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: So you would
have a race car and a Ninja Turtle.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.260

Which Barbie would you take?

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.360

fit in the suitcase.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.610
Do you have a picture of him?

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.910

&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis:
A stuffed animal bear?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.650
Because one of the
kids in the book said

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:38.540
that they were going to
take Winnie the Pooh.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.480

Well I don't know if your

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.190
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: You
would take Darth Vader.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.490
You know what?

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.800
And he'd be probably a good person
to travel with, Darth Vader.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.720
What about a couple of adults?

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.910
A couple teachers, is there
something you can think

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.640 position:56%
that you would put in your suitcase?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.010
&gt;&gt; I would take a picture of my son
and of my class and my students.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.310
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Oh beautiful.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.610
[applause] And what would you take?

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:53.260
&gt;&gt; I would try to fit my
son into the suitcase.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:21:03.610
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Yes well
your son would be with you.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.560
&gt;&gt; Other than that I'm going

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.800
to say absolutely I
would take my AKA covers.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.100
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.400
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Ok.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.700
&gt;&gt; I would take a few
good books to read.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.000
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Really?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.300
And what would they be?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.530
&gt;&gt; I would take maybe The Giver.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.830
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Lois Lowry.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.380
&gt;&gt; Yes and another one I
would take is [inaudible].

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.330
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: I
don't know that book.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.260
&gt;&gt; It's Marion Anderson.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.570
&gt;&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis: Oh beautiful.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.870
Well the only other thing I wanted
to tell you before we finish is

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:43.610
that I would take a photograph
at my wedding of my whole family.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.540
Because I have a family
of many families.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.210
I'm the product of many
different marriages and kids.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:57.010
And at my wedding the gift I asked
my dad for was to have everybody

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.420
in my, my immediate family in
one room and it's the only time

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.100
in my life they were
ever in one room.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.830
And I have a photograph
of it from my wedding.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.690
By the way, no one is
looking at the camera.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:09.990
You know I am.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.270
I'm right in the middle in
my wedding dress like this

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.620
and everybody else is like looking
up and looking down and talking

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.320
to the person next to
them but they're there.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.170 position:56%
So I would too take a photograph of
my entire family with me to remember

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.490
who I came from and
where I came from.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.070 position:56%
So I want to tell you something, I
have read books for a long time now,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.410
to a lot of school children.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.290
All different places in the
world, all different ages.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:43.590
I have never had a classroom of
kids be as attentive, listening,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:49.710
not fidgeting, really being in
their feet, in their bodies.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.520 position:56%
And I want to commend you, teachers,
the school and all of you students.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.510
You have been the best
listening class I have ever had.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:05.100
