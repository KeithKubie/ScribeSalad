00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao:
Good afternoon.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.180
I am happy we have a
full house here today.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.900
Earlier our lecture had less
audience in the past yeah.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.150
And this lecture is cosponsored
by Asian Division and also Print

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.450
and Photo Division,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.980
two divisions cosponsor
this lecture.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.160
And also, this lecture is
part of Asian Division 2018,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.700
Asian study lecture series
celebrating the 90th anniversary

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.680
of Asian Division,
the founding yeah.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.970
Asian division was created
by Congress in 1928.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.320
At that time in 1928 it
was called the Division

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.930
of Chinese Literature and in
1931 it changed to the Division

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.550
of Chinese and Japanese
Literature.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.410
And we got the Asian
Division name in 1978 yeah.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.490
So, Asian Division is one

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.010
of the four major we call
ever studied divisions

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.640
in the Library of Congress.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.900
Yeah, we are the largest Asian
collection outside of Asia

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.430
that houses about more than 2
million physical items yeah,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.410
including 28 countries
and areas in East Asia,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.170
South Asia and Southeast Asia.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.220
This area consists more
than 60% of world population

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.320
and also several
Asian civilizations.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.540
Asian Division directly supports
the library's strategy goals

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.860
to acquire and maintain
the knowledge

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.960
and the record of
Asian countries.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.300
We collect the material to
support to meet the needs

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.640
of first Congress,
second researchers

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.430
and third, the American public.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.060
And our holding basically
are vernacular languages

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.580
in 179 languages in Asia.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.180
And we also have the largest,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.040
a very large rare collection
almost 50,000 books yeah,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.320
rare books published
in Asian countries.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.360
And among these collections
the largest one is Japanese

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.070
collection with 1.2 million
items about Japanese culture,

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.200
history in Japanese languages.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.460
In recent years you know
we have acquired a lot

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.670
of electronic resources in
addition to the physical items.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.100
And the electronic resources
have gained increased importance

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.760
in our collection.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.910
In addition to acquire the
vendors' databases we have been

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.130
doing the digitization
of our own collections.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.690
One of the major recent
achievements is the digitization

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.080
of Japanese censorship
material collection.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.950
That was available
online just recently yeah,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.120
there are several thousand
Japanese censorship books has

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.480
been represented.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.830
And so, we worked for this
project almost seven years yeah.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.510
So, in general, we have the
users using our reading room,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.180
our reading room is
in the other building,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.320
the Jefferson Hall, room 150.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.100
So, I hope all of you,
you know, have an interest

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.740
in Asian studies, particular
Japanese study can use our Asian

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.710
reading room yeah and everybody

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.430
above 16 years old can
get a registration card

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.610
from the main reading room
and use our collection.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.210
Our reading room
is open from 8:30

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.320

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.040
So, when you visit our
[inaudible] don't forget

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.690
to visit Asian reading room,
at least you have a tour there.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.240
Now I turn over to Eiichi
to introduce our collection

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.930
about wood prints and
also our speaker today.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.830
&gt;&gt; Eiichi Ito: The Asian
division holds more

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.030
than 300 woodblock
art and picture books

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.590
from the [inaudible] period.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.450
Notable among these are
the 15-volume collection

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:27.010
of [inaudible] and the artist
behind the iconic great wave

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.870
of Kanagawa.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.940
And also, the Prints and the
Photographs Division collection

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.590
include about 2,500 examples,
including [inaudible] prints

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.370
which was developed in Edo now
Tokyo during the Tokugawa period

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.030
1600 to 1868.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.540
[Inaudible] prints
are from 1868 to 1912.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:00.160
Modern woodblock prints from
the [inaudible] or new prints

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.540
and [inaudible] created prints

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.720
that dominated the Japanese
printmaking through the 1960's.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.090
And the [inaudible]
through the 21st century.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.590
Now today's speaker Dr.
Clair Cuccio earned the PhD

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.750
in Japanese literature
from Stanford University

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:31.320
and is an independent scholar of
the East Asian Woodblock Prints

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.300
and the print culture.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.930
She's country based
in Washington,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.690
DC after a long period
of residence

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.780
in China, Japan, and Taiwan.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.150
She has lectured at the Beijing
Foreign Languages University,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.180
Western Academy of
Beijing, Kyoto Consortium

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.380
for Japanese Studies at
the Doshisha University,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:02.390
and Bank Art 1929
in Yokohama, Japan.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.900
And she served as
chair of the board

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:13.350
for the International Mokuhanga
Conference 2017, last year.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.700
Her articles Translations

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.620
and Collaborations encompass
traditional woodblock artisans

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.110
and their training in
unique hand practices,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:32.330
as well as contemporary artists
working in prints and paper.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.940
She also published her own
portrait focusing on art,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.040
language, transnational culture,
and multiple identities.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.140
So today, Dr. Cuccio will
discuss how Japanese woodblock

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.890
prints are created by means
of network of multiple artists

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.320
in the process that
combines individual expertise

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.240
and collaborative production.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.470
Following the lecture, a
number of materials drawn

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.940
from the Asian Division and the
Prints and Photographs Division

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.340
to illustrate an array of
artistic and technical qualities

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.080
of the Japanese prints will
be displayed just outside

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.020
[inaudible] theater in the foyer
as you leave the auditorium.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.700
Thanks to Kathleen Black,
Prints and Photograph Division

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.570
and also Cameron Penwell
for assembling the materials

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.270
for display working
with Dr. Cuccio.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.700
Important request here, I have
to say this because I more

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.700
or less get excited to see some
beautiful material I attempted

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.100
to touch or ort of flip the
pages, but we appreciate it

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.650
if you can approach the display
without any food and drink

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.540
on hand and not touching
the display

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.400
as you enjoy viewing the
material in the foyer.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.510
Now please welcome Dr. Cuccio.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:08.500
[ Applause ]

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.580
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.350
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.130
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: The Library
of Congress and the topic

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.050
of my lecture intersect
in my mind as sights

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.600
of humble and honest inquiry.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.210
So, I feel enormous gratitude
today that I can be a part

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.340
of this public programming
and particularly

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.370
in this multisource approach
where my talk is only a pathway

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.230
as apparent by the larger
frame of all of this

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.560
to the extraordinary
collections here at the library.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.150
And for the particular works

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.210
that the Asian Division
specialist Eiichi Ito

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.910
who was just speaking
and the curator

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.550
of fine prints Catherine, you're
still back there in the corner,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.110
carefully [inaudible] today,

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.880
they don't often
reach public eyes.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.410
So, thank you for
that meticulous

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:12.340
and very patient approach to
a beautiful subject matter.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.070
And to Eiichi in particular,
thank you for bringing me

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:21.350
into the fold of the Asian
library in my peripatetic life.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.060
It's always been an institution

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.100
that has remained a
place I can come back to,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.650
along with the staff
who have grown with it,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.090
and it is gratifying that
some things stay the same.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:37.800
But some things improve, Cameron
Penwell who was just mentioned,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.810
is reasonably new to
the Asian library.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.370
I thank him for his
kindness and professionalism

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.010
in putting this together.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.840
And also for Cynthia Wayne who's
one of the exhibition creators

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.660
for the overall Library of
Congress, she's a dear friend

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.820
of a dear friend who first spoke
with Catherine Blood [phonetic],

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.770
and her knowledge
and enthusiasm.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.210
So, thank you to all of you.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.590
And to all of you right in front
of me, thank you for coming.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:12.450
I hope this is a respite from
the vagaries of daily life

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.590
and this is not a
passive moment for you.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.830
I'm here as much to receive
feedback and inquiries and input

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.280
from all of you, so thank you.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.160
A Story in Layers
the Artisan Hands

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.380
that Make Japanese
Woodblock Prints.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:36.170
Making has become increasingly
invisible, take some examples

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.100
of millennial making,
microchips, wear circuitry

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:46.060
on their exterior, but their
machine built panels are

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.700
so miniature they go
undetected by the naked eye.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.070
State-of-the-art kitchen
utensils we handle daily.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.350
such as cookware and knives
reflect aesthetic design.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.580
Yet how they are
made is imperceptible

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.330
to the majority of users.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.970
Digital images on
our devices reformat

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.070
into uniform pixels
the diverse mediums,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.240
for instance National
Gallery's favorite Renoirs,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.220
girl with the watering can,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.060
Mark Bradford's mixed-media
installation,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.490
which some of you may have
seen, Pickett's charge recently

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.800
on display and at Hirshhorn,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.080
and here at the libraries we'll
see this afternoon afterwards

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.220
Hokusai's iconic woodblock
print, great wave off Kanagawa

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.270
which needs no introduction.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.730
The pixilation of which severs
viewers from engagement with all

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.270
but the visual image often
fleeting or distorted at that.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.840
At least for now coding
sequences for images

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.460
that are foreign
languages for IT,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.910
safer IT specialists obscure
the size, depth, texture,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.820
color palette, individual
materials and even movement

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.010
if you think of someone
like Calder.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.220
And the smell, I mean
prints have a good smell,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.010
they have smell of glue
and inks in the papers.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.640
Elements that reveal the
making behind an object

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.110
and the hands invested
in its production.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.860
Reaction to this trend
is trendy and various.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.330
Richard Sennett's The Craftsman

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.950
and Matthew Crawford's
Shop Class

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.180
as Soulcraft have explored the
benefits of physical skills

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.890
and apprenticeship
culture presaging

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.070
or prompting a resurgence
in education about the value

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.260
of specialized handwork.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.190
On the ground maker
spaces involve dimensions,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.420
outgrowths of the vibrant maker
movement satisfying an appetite

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.110
for making from carpentry
to robots,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.890
organic materials
to recycled parts.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.810
More specific to the art world,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.420
in response to the restricted
experience of digitized works

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.510
of art, research and development
of haptic technologies

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.930
to enable experiencing the
tactile qualities of an object

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.630
in digital form is
similarly vigorous.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.320
This expiration of making
points to intrinsic value

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.790
in the handcrafted object itself
so ubiquitous today in Japan,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.640
especially as well as here
where glossy magazines

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.850
and aesthetic books
fetishize the handmade.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.950
Known familiarly as ukiyo-e
traditional Japanese woodblock

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.320
prints like Hokusai's wave
encompass visually complex

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.230
and technically refined prints
roughly of the Edo period 1615

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.610
to 1848 and then into the
modern period thereafter

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.680
for 50 or so years.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.080
They fall into the broad
category of invisible making,

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.050
that is to many viewers today
the mastery that ukiyo-e exhibit

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:58.630
in combining materials and
techniques is both inscrutable

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.990
and unimaginable not because
these images are mechanically

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.080
reproduced, but because
they are wrought so finally

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.670
by a multitude of hands skilled
in diverse tools, materials

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.070
and methods that uninformed
viewers cannot apprehend

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.580
their process.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.110
And so, traditional
woodblock print editions

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.500
of ukiyo-e today can often
be mistaken as machine prints

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.740
or even machine reproductions
of paintings.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.580
That is why master printer Keizo
Sato or excuse me Sato Keizo

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.680
of Sato Woodblock Studio in
Kyoto insists that engagement

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.510
with actual artworks ensures
the best form of study.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.990
That is also why
Sato reaches for one

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.030
of his studio's favorite
printings

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.820
of Hiroshige's landscape, a
view of Naruto at Awa province

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.370
to demonstrate his point.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.080
Apart from its production notes,
commissioned in the early 1970's

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.830
by a Tokyo publisher
for an initial order

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.410
of 70 prints completed by
one carver and five printers

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.850
and pulled 12 to 16
times from five blocks.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:12.170
It's prized for its Ichimon,
Bokashi, [inaudible],

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.040
I've got several examples
here and the one highlighted

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.320
in yellow is the one that
we can view in the print.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.980
So, this kind of straight
line color gradation

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.580
across the top here you
can barely see it there,

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.770
that challenging technique.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.740
The calibration of overall
color across the three sheets,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.450
so these each of these
is printed individually.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.490
But the color of the ocean
at the different points,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.090
the ocean line here this all
has to coordinate together.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:57.070
As well as the curved lines that
are meant to resemble flowers.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.270
Moreover, short of handling the
print holding it up to the light

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:06.430
to examine the multicolor image
on translucent natural paper

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.100
and take in its unified
experience of the senses.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.480
Sato maintains we cannot
fully appreciate the work.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.390
From the artisan
standpoint, the materiality

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.710
and techniques are not
surprisingly indivisible

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.440
from the enjoyment of
the picture they support.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.460
I'd like to push Sato's
claim one step further to add

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.190
that accessing the deep
knowledge of woodblock artisans

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.290
or shokunin in the Japanese
expression themselves reveals

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.290
meaning beyond both the distinct
visual appeal of ukiyo-e

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.450
and the techniques
they preserve.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.800
And in a broader scheme I
want to consider a work of art

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.330
that is also a sum of its
making is commanding relevance

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.270
in an era where so much making
has gone beyond what we can

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.160
picture or imagine.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.520
Let me begin by clarifying the
particular contemporary mode

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.560
of ukiyo-e production
to which I refer today.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.810
What the Library of Congress
primarily has in its holdings,

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.400
although Catherine also
pulled some of what we're --

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.100
a similar mode that
we're going to look

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.800
at today our ukiyo-e
contemporaneous with the air

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.010
in which their designers
created images

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.700
and artisans reproduce them.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.790
That is historic prints going
back as far as the Edo period.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.700
But what I focus on this
afternoon involves living

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.550
artisans creating new
editions of these prints made

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.530
from re-carved and reprinted
ukiyo-e known as fukkokuban.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:37.290
For the artisans who create
these prints translate a sheet

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:42.070
as a reproduction or even
a facsimile is inaccurate

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.730
because each is still
considered an original print in

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.130
and of itself being faithful
to the ukiyo-e work by relying

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.790
on the original design relying
on the original design go

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.830
through various means of
transferring it to new blocks

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.970
and yet being reinterpreted
by new sets of hands.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.360
Ukiyo-e fukkokuban produced

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.460
at Sato's workshop
follow a similar,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.110
if impossibly exact
process of making

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.750
that Edo Period artisans used

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.210
to create water-based
multicolored woodblock prints

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.190
like a view of Naruto.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.940
The process is commonly
explained in the context

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.050
of a quartet of makers,
publisher,

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.510
designer, carver and printer.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.230
Orchestrating the production
of an edition of prints,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.930
a publisher, the hanmoto
commissioned an image

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.260
from a designer [inaudible] who
passed the draft of the image

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.720
over to a single or a team
of specialized carvers

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.410
who divide the design into
multiple blocks, sets of blocks

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.150
that went to printers surishis

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.310
who pulled carefully mixed
pigments 15 to 30 times

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.140
for multiple blocks to the same
sheet to complete the process

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.260
for an order into the
hundreds of sheets.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.250
And Catherine has very happily

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.160
on my part pulled an
Acornian [phonetic] piece

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.440
that I think she's going
to put out later and some

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.800
of you may well have
seen these before

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.020
where it traces the buildup of
blocks from the light colors

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.800
until you get these
very brilliant colors,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.090
the very delicate process
of taking that same sheet

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.570
and adding an additional
impression to it.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.240
This I thought was another
way of looking at it

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.980
where you're looking at the
carver's blocks and the colors.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.290
Each block that sometimes
impressions are taken

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.030
of you know can be two, three,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:37.010
four times for more complex
works in the same field

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.940
and then the colors
gradually built up.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.800
For those of you who are
familiar with these blocks,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.100
you've seen them, you work

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.810
with them you will also you
know there's detail and story

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.870
within the blocks
themselves, so it's also nice

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.170
to be able to look at those.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.730
For those of you who you
know may look at these blocks

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.330
and not read the clues on
them, but you're curious

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.050
and you have questions,
I'd be happy to go look

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.640
at them with you afterwards.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.710
That gives you a picture
of the story of making

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.160
and then we get to
the final print.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.770
So, this particular story,
this simplified story is

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.910
so oft repeated that I wanted
to update it and expand it based

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:21.140
on ukiyo-e production as it has
been transmitted to us today.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.840
But first, glimpses from Edo's
past establishing standards

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.510
as designers such as Kitagawa
Utamaro Utagawa Kunisada took it

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.550
upon themselves to depict
their flourishing industry.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.840
And some of these
again if you're working

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.390
in this field you may well have
seen these, I'm going to look

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.680
at these in a very
rapid way today,

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.100
but there's extraordinary detail
that tells so many aspects

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.350
of what they saw
themselves doing.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.310
So, Utamaro's pair of triptychs
from the series the cultivation

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.610
of brocade prints and I've
got these broken up here just

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.210
because it's detailed,
so here are the first two

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:04.270
and then the second or
the third sheet of these.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.210
Utamaro characterizes the
production of nishiki-e

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.540
or brocade pictures,
brocade meaning multicolor

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.480
like the woven brocade
of a kimono obi.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.550
Through the particular work
of the designer, the carver

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:24.770
and then here you have the paper
sizer to the commercial side,

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.080
well you have the printing
here and then the novelty shops

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.140
that sold these popular
prints and the customers.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.400
The most conspicuous
aspect is Utamaro's pairing,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.680
the woodblock shokunin
by casting them

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.600
as delicately wrought
[inaudible],

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.710
beauties are courtesans

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.620
who of course were a very
popular genre in ukiyo-e.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.230
In a similar tongue-in-cheek
arrangement

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.110
of [inaudible] Kunisada
creates this tryptic

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.040
and up-to-date parody
of the four classes

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.980
where the artisan class
appears as ukiyo-e artisans

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.570
who are almost secondary to
the wealth and variety of tools

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.640
and materials show that
support their craft.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.110
A variety of brushes, sizing,
paper, wood blocks, mallets,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:18.460
knives, gouges, chisels,
mallets, Sumi color pigments,

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.800
[inaudible] wet stone,
animal glue known as nikawa

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.570
and printing and
carving tables designed

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.560
to aid physical labor
of each specialty.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.140
Beyond every one of those tools

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.430
or materials were
individual artisans trained

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.350
in their own particular
specialty

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.450
that go beyond this notion
of the quartet, which I just

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.690
because I haven't because I
think it's a beautiful book I

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.990
wanted to just point this out.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.510
This is a fairly new book
by Julie Davis who's at Penn

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:51.890
and works very deeply in the
art historical stories of prints

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:57.130
and she's also pushing
this notion of this idea

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.190
of the quartet that
has defined printmaking

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.090
or ukiyo-e making
for a long time.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.160
We have later versions, I've
got my buttons mixed up here,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.470
to become a little
bit more naturalistic

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.890
and this I think sort of
animates the physical labor

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.400
of the work, it can be
very labor-intensive.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.680
They also include
additional artifacts,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.610
such as the handwoven
encasements of paper over here

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.890
and then you have this man with
the cleaver clipping the edges

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.180
that was important to
these very clean edges then

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.330
when they went off for sales.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:40.040
The hibachis here that served
both to keep the artisans warm

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.250
and to melt down, keep their
nikawa, their glue melted.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.300
And then the functional
accessory of piece is

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.670
to the printing table, so this
is something a little more

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.920
modest, something that you
would see more probably

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.260
in the 10's, 20's, 30's.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:02.140
And this kind of -- in this
previous example here you can

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.360
see the documentation of those
kinds of aspects of the printer

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.370
that became very codified
and diagramed later.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.820
Apart from a few illusions
and updates these items

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.780
and processes are
still in use today.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.980
What understanding of ukiyo-e
then do woodblock artisans

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.170
practicing today impart and how
does their intimate view ascribe

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.150
value to what they
produce in this era?

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.780
Our first stop for the living
artisan's perspective is Sato

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.790
Keizo's shop just behind Kyoto's
old geisha quarters of Gion.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.230
Sixty years ago, Sato's
father Tiazo moved his family

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.590
and print studio together

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.010
into a typical post-World War
II house constructed of wood

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.920
and corrugated aluminum.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.790
A modest signboard above the
door still identifies the

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.080
structure as Sato
Woodblock Studio.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.520
Sato himself can only claim to
be a second-generation shokunin

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.930
or artisan, a lineage
that is unimpressive

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.610
up against the dynastic
handicraft families

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.690
that characterize Kyoto.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.920
Technically, however,
Sato descended

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.010
from a Tokyo area shokunin
that can be traced back

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.620
at least five generations.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.070
And what I have pictured here,
I don't know if the yellow,

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.930
the highlight is
coming through here,

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.230
but you have his lineage traced.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.260
This was actually
machine printed,

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.980
but as you can tell it was
a handwritten genealogy

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:32.690
from the early 1980's when a lot
of the shokunin were dying out

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.780
and realized they wanted
to capture these histories.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.370
Of the 70 odd woodblock artisans
who still practice the art

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.780
and craft between Tokyo

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:47.750
and Kyoto today three printers
have apprenticed under Sato.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:54.970
And at this time, he --
excuse me, there we go.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.950
He has four printers, two
male and two females ranging

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.710
from their 20's to 50's, three
of whom graduated university

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:20.380
as artists and opted to embark
on apprenticeships instead

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.170
and all of whom must
go through the rigor

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:27.360
of learning the refined
skills of printing ukiyo-e.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.170
While the market
for new printings

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.720
of ukiyo-e continues downsize
the more famous series

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.540
of Hokusai Katshushika, such
as Mr. Nakayama's printing here

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.510
and then you can see the very
familiar finished piece here.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.880
One of his fellow
printers Hirai opened with.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:57.580
They are still required
to study these prints.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.750
And they're commissioned
exercises to continue

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.650
to hone the refined skills
of this cultural heritage.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.120
And I just wanted to
share this piece with you

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.900
by a Finnish contemporary
artist,

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.080
more of a graphic design artist
who has trained extensively

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.490
in traditional techniques.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.140
And part of her cache of
teaching tools is these cards

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.290
that she's made to represent.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.210
This is only one portion
of the 50 odd techniques

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.740
that she herself has
documented and there are those

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.170
that extend beyond that.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.320
So, this is the reason so
much of this commissioning

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.150
of these old ukiyo-e
are being done today.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.190
Contemporary printers today
approach orders for ukiyo-e

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.470
with a consultation
pooling their knowledge

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.330
to discern what combination
of techniques is most likely

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.400
to achieve the effects
of the original.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.850
And here's one working
in process here

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.550
where you have the sample,
this one of the originals

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.490
that came probably
from the publisher

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.040
who made the request most likely
out of Tokyo or Kyoto today.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.950
And then you have
the prints coming off

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.280
where the printer is
checking the color and sort

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.960
of the overall flavor of
the print against the one

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.010
that they're aiming to recreate.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.630
They examine the
original paper I order

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.470
to assess how they should match
it by color, weight and texture

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.530
and sometimes they don't
want to match it at all

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.490
because in different eras
there were different qualities

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.500
of paper and that paper
is one area for example

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.080
that has become much
more standardized

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.620
because over the years they've
learned what works, what sells,

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.380
and above all in this case

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.100
for preserving what
is going to last.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.030
They analyze the
color palette based

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.960
on an original sample
though do not aim

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.930
to reproduce the
exact colors visible,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.580
rather they mix colors they
determine are authentic

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.380
to print before fading, as well
as to adapt to current tastes.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.010
They aim for consistency of
each color across an average run

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:05.760
of 70 to 100 prints at a time,
as well as across the entirety

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.210
of prints that compose
a particular series.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.020
Above all, is the
collective work

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.970
that cannot adhere
solely to a single vision.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.000
The style unique to each artisan

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.060
or their [inaudible] infuses
new paintings or new printings

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.980
with fresh originality.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.520
A hokusai or [inaudible] to
be sure differs from artisan

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.810
to artisan or network of
artisans to network of artisans.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.150
To be able to produce these
prints Sato Studio operates

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.400
within a traditional network
of mostly local shokunin

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.070
who [inaudible] relies on
additionally for his paper,

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.170
brushes, glue, Sumi
and color pigments.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.640
For paper he has a standing
order for a particular variety

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.330
of washi known hosho
made of mulberry fiber.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.290
It is handmade by
papermaker Iwano Ichibei

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:02.620
in the neighboring region of
[inaudible] and he's also a part

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.350
of the living national treasure,
echelon of shokunin Japanese

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:13.520
so he has a story
behind him as well.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.220
And the papermaking of
this particular village,

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.240
particularly this hosho
variety that is so prized

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.830
for woodblock printmaking is
of a cultural and a local level

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:31.270
that there's a shrine that is
devoted to celebration of it

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.270
with annual festivals
where the fresh sheets

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.490
of paper are brought up
to the shrine as a means

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:42.010
of Thanksgiving, so this
is serious business.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.180
Sato is clear about
his preference

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.460
for Ichibei's costly paper
over more economical options.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.760
Its consistency of color which
you can see it's difficult here,

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.630
but there's a real if you
were to look at this pail

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.910
versus someone else's pail
the quality, the color,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.160
the very softness, the
consistency of texture.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.270
Also, the fiber length
and the linkage

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.940
of those fibers are critical

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.260
to pulling a perfect
impression sheet after sheet.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.800
And you know unlike an artist

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.730
who may be seeking something
different, something surprising

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:19.030
or something not precise
across several sheets they want

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.320
that perfect turnout, so that
consistent quality is crucial.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.230
For pigments, Sato strolls 300
meters up the main intersection

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.940
to Adachi Pigment Shop.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.800
Okay, so we've got Iwano here
with his wife pulling the paper

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.850
and you can see the
stacks here and how smooth,

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.230
it's difficult again
in this light,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.780
but how smooth that quality is.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.260
And then up the street

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.220
from Sato's workshop
you have a pigment shop

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.200
and although Adachi here has a
pamphlet exhibiting nearly 50

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.470
exquisite color samples true
to the color wheel's claim

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.720
or largely true,
it only takes five

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.500
to generate the spectrum
of colors in ukiyo-e.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.040
Prussian blue, ocher, carmine
red, a resin like yellow

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.880
and iron oxide burnt umber.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:13.500
Mixing the pigments with nikawa,
here are the commercial versions

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:19.030
of the nikawa, the animal glue,
are also supplied by Adachi

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.990
and he supplies it from another
shokunin craft now gone more

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.640
industrial in Hyogo Prefecture

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.710
where the malodorous substance
was once made from horse bone

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:35.020
by Japanese, Japan's
Burakumin underclass.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.710
Sumi -- here's some
more examples

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:43.580
of the nikawa in
its various forms.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.740
Sumi is another carefully
tended ingredient right

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.450
and can be difficult
to deal with.

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.540
If the grains are too coarse
Sato explains they do not

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.390
generate the fine
[inaudible] necessary

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:59.180
to capture ukiyo-e's bold black
outlines nor evenness of mixture

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.250
in order to produce the same
result again, sheet after sheet.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:07.280
Three decades ago,
Sato met a Mr. Matsui

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.030
from the sumi maker Boku-undo
located in nearby Nara.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.530
Sato was determined to calibrate
the portion of [inaudible] black

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.020
or soot, the base of
sumi, nikawa and water

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.950
to best suit his printing

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.990
where today more standard
versions are premixed

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.520
to favor the expressive effects
in calligraphy and ink painting,

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.890
which there are just so
many more practitioners

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.410
so it's being driven by
the market of course.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.880
Matsui mixed up a custom recipe
for Sato that he has used ever

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.520
since and you can see
the various mixes here

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.780
and then he's got his
bottle of Matsui special mix

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.060
that he's pouring from.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.910
In the printer's world
beyond the various brushes,

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.480
each with their own purpose
and histories of making

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.780
that I'm going to leave

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.400
for another time is the
burnishing pad, the baren.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.790
And unlike some of the
other printing tools

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.260
that may be considered more
fungible the baren is unique

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.980
to Japanese woodblock
printmaking and essential

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.480
to executing ukiyo-e's
cache of techniques.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.570
Its curious construction
incorporates two varieties

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:19.510
of bamboo fiber that are rare
today, [inaudible], washi,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:24.820
bracken root, starch
powder, fermented persimmon,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.000
black lacquer and camellia oil.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.650
The materials are
worked into improbable

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.760
and laborious combination
of parts snugly fit together

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.910
in a durable disk that
can withstand the pressure

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.960
of a printer's hand for decades.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.940
The finished baren is
yet unrevealing though

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.590
because its innards
pictured here that's

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.000
where the efficacy lies.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.680
The crucial rationale behind
the baren being these nubbins

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.280
of this woven bamboo, this
braided bamboo, the [inaudible],

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.020
the part that sticks out that
emerged when different braids

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.020
of bamboo are coiled
into its tight disk.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.570
These nubbins create multiple
pressure points that pulse

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.670
over the woodblock surface
forcing the colorant

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.640
into the paper fibers.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.120
Equally critical are
the minute hollow spaces

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.280
around the nubbin
simultaneously working to allow

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.480
for enough release of pressure
in order to prevent the paper

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.740
from sticking to a dampen block.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.990
So, it's a pretty sophisticated
mechanism accomplishing many

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.950
things all at once.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.350
Goto Hidehiko, Japan's
only artisan devoted solely

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:40.220
to baren making and he
has a book on the subject,

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.190
characterizes the baren as
a tool that doesn't stand

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.390
out for its consequentiality,
but in actuality is a tool

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.450
that has continued in
use since the Edo Period.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.820
That is to say and this
is how he describes it,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.300
one with a depth that
is packed with wisdom.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.460
Like paper he explains the baren
occupies a hollowed position

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.660
in the woodblock
printer's craft.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.040
Where washi is the
ultimate long life medium

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.900
to convey the artist's
vision the baren is cast

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.140
and as the alter-ego
of the printer,

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.000
the trace of the
printer's hand testimony

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.480
to the printer's labor,
mark of the [audio breaks].

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.660
Goto adds that a good baren
finesses the work of the carver

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.090
and I like that it's not all
about the printer it goes back

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.010
to the carver by
expressing the hand,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.110
the lines cut by the carver.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.940
Because printers finish an image
by pulling it in brilliant color

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.290
to paper with a symbolic
baren their image has come

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.410
to represent the
essence of the craft.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.760
But backing up to consider
the block before the print.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.670
Carver Fujisawa Hiroshi
who collaborates

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.450
with the Sato Studio on print
commissions has his own take

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.010
on woodblock in ukiyo-e.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.010
Fujisawa is considered
number one in Japan,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.310
[inaudible] dai-ichi among
traditional woodblock carvers,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.410
though his beginnings
were modest.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.920
He came to his craft as
one of the last generation

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.360
of postwar shokunin
in the mid-1960's

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.360
who selected a vocational
path after middle school.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.340
Even though he enjoys reading
art books today he describes

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.490
himself as an old-fashioned
type without any education.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.990
When he came of age

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.300
as an artisan it would
have been unimaginable

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.410
that a shokunin could be
a university graduate.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.090
Fujisawa sees his spiritual
dimension to his craft

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.510
through the Japanese
concept of kokoro

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.930
or heart mind or mindfulness.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.780
He expresses his kokoro
through transmission

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.280
from his dedicated work
of the hand facilitated

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.740
by his prize tools, each
with their own handmade story

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.110
of course, to the
natural materials

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.070
that he handles with them.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.640
As the carver he
approaches his work

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.040
to ease the way for the printer.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.650
So, there's this this thinking

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:08.730
of this team along the way
helping each other out,

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.570
anticipating areas of the block

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.880
where the printer may
encounter difficulties

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.240
in effecting particular
techniques

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.160
and even manipulating
carved portion

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.450
to serve the carver's own
interpretation of the image.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:26.310
He has that artists in the past
praised carvers and printers

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.900
because they had the capacity
to correct the artist's work,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.190
just as a translator has
the possibility of improving

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.920
on the original of
the author's text.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.050
But Fujisawa concedes he
would never tell the artist

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.560
because the aim was
to please him or her.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.450
In the traditional woodblock
process before the carver was

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:50.020
the planer this shokunin
was essentially a carpenter

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.910
who possessed the
specialized skill

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:56.190
to prepare wood especially
for woodblocks.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.920
According to the 1929 handbook
Nishiki-e Carving and Printing

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.820
in the Edo Period these
[inaudible] or plank men apart

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.030
from harvesting and
aging the wood

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.240
to minimize warping produced
blocks in the appropriate size

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.240
and thickness specifically

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.180
for this industry of
multicolor prints.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.330
But the real expertise came

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.680
in the way they applied
different planes,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.880
the planing process to
prepare the woodblock.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.330
Above all, the woodblock had to
be absolutely smooth and even

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.110
to avoid any pooling
on its surface,

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.900
a condition that neither machine
planing is quite fine enough

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.270
to render today nor
can be matched

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.250
by substituting present-day
timbers

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.090
for building construction.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:46.110
Like the Chinese gold
standard of pear wood

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.130
or [inaudible] the Japanese
preference for [inaudible],

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.720
the mountain cherry type
of timber was practical.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.810
It was a plentiful
indigenous timber harvested

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.090
from nearby mountains that
offered a suitable hardness

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.590
to facilitate carving while
still supporting the hairpin

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.520
relief in ukiyo-e in
sustaining the wear

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.250
and tear of large print runs.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:11.240
And I noticed some of the prints
that Catherine pulled today,

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.750
these hairpin lines,
I mean there were some

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.390
that were even thinner than
a hairpin I think in some

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.750
of the patterns on
the textile designs.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.180
So, when you go out just zero in
on the fineness of those lines

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.700
and that the cherry
wood can withstand

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.970
that so those little
pieces don't pop off.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.310
Fujisawa considers
[inaudible] Japanese magnolia,

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.730
another desirable hardwood,

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.710
although he declares
it's no good for Utamaro.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.660
[Inaudible] further he
suggests another variety,

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.580
a type of boxwood known as
tsuge also pleasantly hard,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.030
but the trouble with [inaudible]
lies in the trunk diameter

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.930
that only matures about
15 to 20 centimeters.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.980
So, you know, if you're doing
small prints that works,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.520
but in the standard
of this oban size,

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.010
the standard ukiyo-e size
it's simply too small.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.990
So, you can see how all of these
things come down to us today.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:09.540
Unlike Western-style engraving
that uses that horizontal cut

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.410
on the top the custom of
ukiyo-e is a vertical cut,

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:17.880
and specifically an outside,
the outer side of a tree trunk.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.870
There are more practical
reasons for this,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.300
among them being the vertical
cut with its alignment

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.500
of green made a block softer
and easier to carve enabling

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.370
for speed and quick turnover,
which is less an issue today

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.100
but it was an issue
when this was a vibrant

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.120
commercial practice.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.600
Once Fujisawa puts knife

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.280
to block he must assess the
block's grain at every juncture.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.260
Unlike the composition
of steel for instance,

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.970
internally the wood possesses
a unique pattern of growth

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.640
and fibers can deviate from
the straight growth creating an

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.110
internal composition
of a mix of grains.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.690
Fujisawa sees his challenge

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.590
in the individual
nature of block poses.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.790
He characterizes
it as a face-off

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.340
between nature and human skill.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.920
Carving into the grain of course
can be damaging to the wood

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.790
and works against
the cut of the knife.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:12.770
Carving with the grain the
knife moves along in parallel.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.290
So, Fujisawa feels his
way across the block

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:16.800
as he wields his knife,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.290
anticipating these internal
traffic jams in the wood.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:24.480
One true test of the overall
quality of woodblock print lies

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.270
in these inked-out lines, the
[inaudible], the curved lines.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.980
And if any of you have had
the experience of going

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.190
through an ukiyo-e exhibition
around Japan I've observed

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:40.140
that viewers this is one of
the areas where they sigh

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.410
and they pause over this moment
of these beautiful curved lines.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.740
Although computer
technology can now aid

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.530
in carving these lines Fujisawa
hazards it's not the same

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.520
movement as the human hand.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.770
Therein lies his
conceptualization of kokoro,

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.530
this mindfulness, as
it ties to his craft.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.700
Lest his arguments sound
dubious he proceeds,

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.440
when he carves a masterwork he
may be transported into the mind

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.590
of an artist and effectively
be able to read them.

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:13.020
The physical process also
yielding a spiritual connection

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.170
if you will that a
computer cannot facilitate.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.110
In contrast, when he observes
computer-generated print designs

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.510
he believes their feeling,
their [inaudible] isn't good.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.400
Even if an artist
approaches a project

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.770
with certain intent the
mediating computer disables

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.290
dimensions of the human idea.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.040
He believes there's an
infinitely more variation

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.890
and nuance to the types of
lines humans can create.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:43.200
A computer-generated image of a
chrysanthemum for instance maybe

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.250
so finely executed
that it is impossible

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.190
for a human hand to carve.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:52.320
But if the human hand depicts
these lines it will only draw

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.590
what can physically
it can manage,

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.030
thereby vesting the
rendering of the blossom

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.770
with a subjective expression.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.790
And I think this is where
that's when people are sighing

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.040
at these curved lines, you
know there's that transfer,

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.040
that feeling of something
ineluctably human

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.690
if you will about
that execution.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.850
And in a case where the artist
fails to be as successful

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:20.100
in depicting lines the carver
can go in and improve the work.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.780
Or simply put, there's something
accessible and authentic

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.530
about an image whose composition

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:29.110
and production we can
finesse ourselves.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.360
I'd like to come full circle

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.450
to consider Sato Keizo's
selection of a view of Naruto.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:41.240
Like many ukiyo-e landscapes
it's a pleasing image in itself.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.180
The landscape also appeals

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.660
because like larger-than-life
Mount Fuji it maintains

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.510
contemporary significance.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:52.290
Hiroshige's scenic portrayal
of the tidal whirlpools

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.650
in the Naruto Strait can still
be witnessed today in a channel

00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:00.170
between Naruto in
Tokushima and Awaji Island.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.490
Art historically the print's
content also offers its own

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.170
narrative, it's believed
to be one

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.370
of the three tryptics Hiroshige
created in his last year

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.440
of life observing the theme
sun, moon and flowers,

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.530
the whirlpool rapids whimsically
depicting the flower theme.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.140
There is in short, much
to be made of it revered

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.700
as a pretty picture
and a visual work

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.100
that these days we can consume
for free in any proximity

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.840
of a screen or a museum
shot or for real here.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.100
So, the crux of the question
remains, does the making matter

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.140
as long as we enjoy
the visual image?

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.470
Japanese woodblock printing is
often discounted among Japan's

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.540
rich tradition of
arts and crafts,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.610
devoid of any explicit use value

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.350
like a ceramic tea bowl
or a bamboo basket.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.270
Historically viewed as a
reproductive technology rather

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.420
than a refined craft its
artisans also haven't always

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.710
made the annals of
traditional Japanese arts.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.330
But ukiyo-e comes to us
today both as historic prints

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.490
and refined artworks because
of the vast compendium

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.320
of hand techniques and the
[inaudible] materials it

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.770
integrates in order to
create a single sheet.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.260
Through the artisans

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.980
who preserve it today
ukiyo-e are documents

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.260
of living culture beyond
their visual value,

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.980
that such a universally
appealing image is still

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.830
generated primarily of organic
materials almost exclusively

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:31.360
with human hands and by a
community of local individuals

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.030
who know one another, are
values of making and of living

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.270
and working that
offer new relevance

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.560
in the virtual worlds of today.

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.510
Thank you.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:50.310
[ Applause ]

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.610
Yes.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.020
&gt;&gt; Fascinating, thank you.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.320
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Thank you.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.900
&gt;&gt; Can you tell me a
little bit about the market

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:03.060
for the [inaudible], I'm
sorry if I mispronounced that

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.700
and also, what is the method of
transfer of the original print

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.660
to this contemporary reprint?

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.520
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Okay the
[inaudible] market that reprint,

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.180
I'm not saying reproduction
or facsimile

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.950
because I'm trying
to [inaudible].

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.980
Okay, excuse me.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:31.200
Are you speaking at the
present day or across time?

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.220
&gt;&gt; Presently.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.520
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Presently.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.530
They're still issued
through publishers,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.170
publishers are often bookstores.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.150
I mean sometimes I think
that sense of the publisher

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.130
in the Western context it's
not clear, but publishers,

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.910
bookstores will issue special
series at certain times

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.210
of the year in a kind

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.060
of celebratory mode that's
becoming a little more esoteric.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.560
And so, people who know of
the may go seeking them out,

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.730
but they're not big
sellers today.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.880
There was a vigorous industry
postwar I think in the 20's

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.020
and 30's as well
where newspapers

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:13.230
and some other industries
would if you subscribed

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:14.720
to them they would
you know deliver,

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.930
you would receive your free --
like the New Yorker does today

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:21.830
with its bags, you know they
would issue a free series

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.620
or you'd collect
prints over time

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.520
if you maintained
your subscription.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.710
But that has for the
most part eroded,

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.050
that does come around
occasionally.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:34.300
But that would have to be
something today very high-end

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.560
where you're actually going
to get that handmade print.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.820
They might do those today in
some form of laser printing

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.850
that is still appealing,
but doesn't have, you know,

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.150
that despite virtue of
costs it's impossible.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:53.960
So, the market today is often
museums, libraries those

00:50:53.960 --> 00:51:00.080
that have a particular research
or connoisseur interest in them,

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.570
but so much of what's
driving it today is

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:07.310
if we don't do you know
we forget how to do it.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:12.670
And that is a valid market, if
a very limited one in itself.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.550
&gt;&gt; And how are the
original prints transferred?

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.720
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Okay there
are varieties of methods.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.960
If you're going to observe, if
a shokunin, an artisan is going

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.080
to observe a carver because
it's the carver who would

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.590
who would do this phase of
the making they will have --

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.100
at this stage they're not

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.520
of course getting an
original from a designer.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.440
So, what they would have
and this would likely come

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.380
from the -- it wouldn't come
from the carver it might come

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.960
from a printer who has
these in a collection,

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.260
a personal collection.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.960
But more likely it will come
directly from the publisher

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.490
who will have a library,
a cache of these originals

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.300
that date back to
different times.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.810
They will send that original
along and they can create,

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.120
today they'll do, there are
different laser processes

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.490
that can be done, but the
traditional style would be

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:10.030
to take that image and
photograph it in some way,

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:14.830
reproduce it, reverse
onto the print.

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:18.340
And then if it's the
traditional version it's a

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.640
paper reproduction.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.030
&gt;&gt; That part of the
production I understand,

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:26.810
I was just wondering
today how they take an old

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.800
conventional print.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.100
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Print.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.360
&gt;&gt; And then take that image and
transfer it onto a new block.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.660
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Right

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.960
and sometimes that's done
electronically, digitally,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.520
and sometimes if they
have an additional print

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.710
that they can just trash
they will so to speak,

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.950
they will glue that
to the block.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:50.560
And they'll -- if we go back
to some of the block images,

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.410
if I can get back there quickly.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.420
You can actually see
in these traditional,

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.630
this traditional process
where it's been glued,

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.830
the print has been glued
in the reverse to the block

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:05.920
and then it's peeled away
and it leaves the lines.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.640
&gt;&gt; We had a lot of blocks
with the [inaudible].

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.220
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Right, so here
is the paper still there right.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.890
And so, if they're observing an
absolutely traditional method

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.280
that would be the
way that it's done.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.920
Let's see if there are any, I
think there were some others.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.450
Yeah, you can still
see the little smidgens

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.150
of paper there on the edges.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.350
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Thank you.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:31.410
Other questions or input, I
mean I'm really interested apart

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:36.030
from the very specific nature
of this talk if this moves you,

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:38.370
if you buy into this
perspective.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:43.670
I imagine a fair number of you
are in the world of art history.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:47.500
I'm coming from this more from
a sociological perspective

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:54.130
from an interest in how
art is used and circulates.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:56.530
So, please speak up.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:57.880
Catherine.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.180
&gt;&gt; It's a good segue.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.070
So, you're very erudite
and knowledgeable

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.450
in the world of mokuhanga.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.750
I think of this now as being
an international phenomenon,

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:11.710
is that fair to say or would you
say there are stronger centers

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:15.930
or communities or can you
talk a little bit about that?

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:19.700
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Yes, so
mokuhanga is the Japanese term

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.700
that means objectively

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:27.220
and literally wood impression
picture, woodblock print.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:31.610
But it has been disseminated
from Japan today,

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:36.610
in the last 20 years by a
group particularly interested

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:40.350
in preserving the shokunin,
the artisan techniques

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.180
through an approach of
sort of sending them

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.960
out with the idea being
that there aren't that many,

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.900
there is a limited
number of artisans,

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.480
there are a limited number
of art students who in Japan

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.290
who are interested in this mode.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.520
And so, if we let it
free we send it out,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.370
somewhat like ukiyo-e when
they migrated to Europe

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.470
and they were sort of discovered
there and then they came back

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.040
to Japan and Japan
realized oh wow,

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.660
we do have something really
special here that we discounted

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.720
as you know just popular art.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.910
This movement started to happen
with a small group of people,

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:15.610
there are residencies there in
mokuhanga in woodblock prints

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.120
that are based on these
traditional techniques

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.140
with the idea being, not that
they stay the same, not the work

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.440
of the artisan where
you're trying

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.660
to reproduce the same
techniques, but to innovate

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.780
and take the base of these
techniques and the base

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.340
of these materials and
to create something new.

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.490
And yes, there is
a greater movement,

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.800
there's an American artist based
in New York, April Vollmer,

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.260
if any of you are in the print
world you're probably familiar

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.560
with her.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:44.200
She has a very active website,
V-O-L-L-M-E-R is the last name.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.900
She came out with a book
two years ago that looked

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.760
at very specific development
interest in the form

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.320
of mokuhanga appropriating
some traditional techniques

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.490
in North America, artists,
contemporary artists

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.790
who are using these forms.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:07.550
And it's a beautiful book
to look at, the latter half

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.520
of the book are images
of 50 odd artists

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.870
who are working in these modes.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.830
So that's a whole
another dimension of this.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.760
And there is some exchange
between these artisans

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.620
who occasionally
will collaborate

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:20.920
with contemporary artists.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.870
You know the issue in
Japan is the cost of labor.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:27.910
But if you somehow can
make that happen and if any

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.210
of you are familiar with
the work of Rebecca Salter

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.690
who does a lot of -- out
of the UK, she does a lot

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.960
of ink painting and maybe
better known for that.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.640
But she studied in Japan
at Kyoto Seika University

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.130
where three of the artisans
working with Sato graduated.

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.580
She was there working
with Kurosaki Akira

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.790
who also is another contemporary
artist using traditional

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:52.090
Japanese print techniques.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.840
So again, if you're in that
field you may know his work

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.140
as well.

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.760
She was studying with him,
became very interested

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.210
in a shokunin culture and
supporting these people.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.650
And so, she is now in a kind of
you know position as an artist,

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.350
a mature artist to
collaborate with them.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.700
And did a show where
she did the paintings

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.200
and then they interpreted
them into print.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.540
And if anybody has interest
in that it's a beautiful

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.910
and fabulous project and
I'd be happy to point you

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:21.020
to some resources
to look at that.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.620
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Thank you.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.920
&gt;&gt; Eiichi Ito: Last
question if you have?

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.340
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Go ahead.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.920
If there are other questions
I'm happy to take them,

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:46.390
I think there's one
in front, go ahead.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:54.490
&gt;&gt; So actually, I have two
questions which are related,

00:57:54.490 --> 00:58:00.060
one is a more detailed
technical question,

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:07.100
the other is more big
picture, sociological question.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:13.560
You mentioned about
some of them using,

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.130
could be using electronic
technology.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:19.320
When they compare their
printing the color,

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:26.270
check the color are they still
using their naked eye to check

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:32.070
or they are using some
kind of tools to help?

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:38.650
So that lead to the second
question is when you talk

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.050
to these people, when you
interview them [inaudible]

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.940
or talking to these people
are they really worried,

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.870
for example while some of
them are become living legends

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.660
and they are the only
person in their own world

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.540
to still keep this skill?

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.560
Are they worried
about losing their?

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.390
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: You
mean the preservation

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.490
of what they have accumulated?

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:03.720
So, the first question regarding
the assessment of color,

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.410
those that I have dealt with
I don't think in the workshop,

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:08.370
in these studios there
isn't that degree

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.540
of technical assessment
of a print.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.140
There are chemists and
there are art historians

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.770
with chemically minded projects
where there is technology

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.700
to do the interpretation,
to interpret.

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:26.460
And there may well be some of
you here that deal with that

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.310
if not in prints in some other
mode where they, you know,

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:33.010
they analyze it and see
what exactly you know this

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:36.040
composition was of
this particular color

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.270
and how many layers are
to it and all of that.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:43.410
But no, it's more, I think
it's just familiarity

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:47.140
with seeing these things over
and over again and again.

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:51.430
You know it comes back to Sato
saying, you know your best form

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:54.380
of study is with the original
work, it's that idea, you know,

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.860
the idea of repetition
and exposure.

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.370
On the skills and losing
them, I can't speak

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.150
for that specifically from the
people with whom I've dealt

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:02.450
with because none is
carrying that sense

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.750
of being the last one on earth.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.050
Goto Hidehiko, the baren maker,
he didn't descend from a line

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:06.350
of baren makers, in many
ways he was self-taught,

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.650
but has preserved you know
through what he knows.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.080
There is, you know, there is
a fair amount of documentation

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.330
to be able to preserve
these things.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:17.110
I'm trying to think, is there
anyone else here who deals

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:23.330
in craft in Japanese
living national treasures?

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:31.150
It is an issue and there's a
very practical issue of interest

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:34.020
on the part of people,

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.610
I mean Japanese directly
although some --

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.400
there has been some
studios in different areas

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.070
and this is beyond prints,
have been approached

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:44.290
by foreigners who've
wanted to apprentice.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.590
But when you're not selling your
items you don't have a market

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:52.400
unless you have some means to
find and there are some people,

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.030
there's a German carver,
I'm speaking too long,

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:57.330
who are interested --

01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.310
who's interested in
becoming a traditional carver

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.560
and I think he's in a
situation where he's able

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.610
to fund part of it for himself.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.030
But a lot of it comes
down to economics.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:11.150
I'm happy, I believe
you had a question,

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.740
I'm happy to take it afterwards.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.650
&gt;&gt; Eiichi Ito: [Inaudible],
so that's the last question.

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:19.450
&gt;&gt; Actually, I think
you answered it,

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:23.280
mostly about how are
new people educated,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.290
but I think you addressed
it with learning

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:33.520
from what's written
and other historical.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.750
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: I think
that the problem of exposure

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:39.010
and learning, I think there's
a fair amount that's available

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:42.220
for those who are curious and
really you know are devoted,

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.160
who you know sort of
apprenticeship level commitment.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.820
But the question in Japan in
particular is the mainstream

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.690
and there are students today,
young people who look at these

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:57.980
as elsewhere and
they're familiar with it

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.810
because these images
are so, they see them.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:03.330
But they can't comprehend
how they were made.

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:08.120
And one of the educated, very
mainstream educational aspects

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.340
that has shifted in Japan
is that these woodblock,

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.210
I mean when you were in
school did you do you know

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.510
mokuhanga prints?

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:19.980
Yeah, everybody, this is part
of the curriculum, every kid.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.510
Did you [inaudible],
you probably?

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:27.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.440
Oh, okay that's right.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.120
&gt;&gt; Eiichi Ito: Much older,
so I don't know [inaudible].

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.980
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: But until about
10 years ago you had it in fifth

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.250
or sixth grade and then
again in middle school

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.550
and again in high school.

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.010
So, typically you
had three shots

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:44.480
at the carving, using
the knives.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.070
Part of it is part of the
shift where it's been axed

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.160
from curriculums is a common
problem throughout the world

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.900
and that's increased
content to be exposed

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.000
to time, it's a slow craft.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.200
So, it's easier to do you know
craft with Styrofoam or linocut

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.610
or something like that.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:06.080
And I think as you
know this being

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.160
in this American venue we can
appreciate Japanese parents are

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.360
worried about the danger
of knives, that's also come

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.580
up as a reason why they don't
want them in schools anymore.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:18.400
So, this question of education
comes at many tiers and each

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.350
of those I think
is sociologically,

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:23.320
culturally very interesting.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.710
Thank you very much.

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:30.780
I'd be happy to take
thoughts on making, on craft,

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.640
on your own interests
if you're artists,

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.380
art historian's perspective,

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.810
please your time permitting
approach me afterwards.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.550
Thank you so much.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.510
&gt;&gt; Yes, as you walk out
there's a display ready for you,

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.870
so please enjoy viewing
those materials.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:48.230
Thank you very much, thank you.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:53.070
&gt;&gt; Clair Cuccio: Thank you.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:56.710

of the Library of Congress.
