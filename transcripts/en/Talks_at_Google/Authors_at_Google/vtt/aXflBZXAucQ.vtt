[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.650
JOSH: Right.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.670
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.586
This is a great crowd.

00:00:07.586 --> 00:00:09.960
And I want to welcome
Dr. Matthew Walker.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.240
He is professor of
neuroscience and psychology

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.226
at the University of
California, Berkeley.

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:15.600
And he's the
founder and director

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.580
of the Center for
Human Sleep Science,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.740
and he's here today to
talk about his new book,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.640
"Why We Sleep."

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.651
So without further ado.

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:23.400
MATTHEW WALKER: Thank
you very much, Josh.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.390
Thank you.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.020
Well, it's a delight and
privilege to be here.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.525
And I would like to
start with testicles.

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.860
Men who sleep five
hours a night have

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.620
significantly smaller
testicles than those

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.660
who sleep eight hours or more.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.040
In addition, men who routinely
sleep five to six hours a night

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.480
will have a level
of testosterone

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.990
which is that of someone
10 years their senior.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.260
So a lack of sleep
ages you by a decade

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.860
in terms of that aspect, that
critical aspect of wellness

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.620
and virility.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.790
And we see equivalent
impairments

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.010
in female reproductive health
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.270
This is the best news
that I have for you today.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.030
From this point forward,
it's only going to get worse.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Rather than tell you about the
wonderfully good things that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.920
happen when you get
sleep, I'm going

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.440
to tell you about the
alarmingly bad things that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.070
happen when you don't get
enough both for the brain

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.930
and for the body.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.560
Let me start with the brain
and the functions of learning

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.860
and memory.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.910
What we've discovered over
the past 10 or so years

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.170
is that you need sleep after
learning to essentially hit

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.600
the Save button on
those new memories,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.040
so that you don't forget.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
So sleep essentially
future-proofs

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.230
those facts within the brain.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.550
But recently, we've discovered
that you not only need sleep

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.710
after learning, you also need
sleep before learning, but now

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.360
to actually prepare your
brain, almost like a dry sponge

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.350
ready to initially soak
up new information.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.650
And without sleep, the
memory circuits of the brain

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.800
effectively become
waterlogged, as it were,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.170
and you can't absorb
new information.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.140
So here in this
study, we decided

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
to test the hypothesis that
pulling the all-nighter

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.140
was a good idea.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.050
How do you do that?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.340
Well, we took a group
of healthy adults

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.850
and we assigned them to one of
two experimental conditions--

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.192
a sleep group and a
sleep deprivation group.

00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:52.650
Now, the sleep
group, they're going

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.957
to get a full eight
hours of shuteye.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:57.540
But the deprivation
group, we're going

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.030
to keep them awake
in the laboratory

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.300
under full supervision.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.830
There's no naps,
there's no caffeine.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.920
It's miserable for everyone
included, us as well.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.790
And then the next
day, we're going

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.351
to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner,

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:17.100
and we're going to
have them try and learn

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.540
a whole list of new facts
as we're taking snapshots

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.940
of brain activity.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.340
And then we're
going to test them

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.880
to see how effective
that learning has been.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.520
And that's what you're looking
at here on the vertical axis,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.480
the amount of learning.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.970
So the higher up you are,
the more that you learn.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.470
And when you put those
two groups head to head,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.150
what you find is a quite
significant 40% deficit

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.670
in the ability of
the brain to make

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.155
new memories without sleep.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.540
And I think this
should be frightening

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.190
considering what we
know is happening

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.480
to sleep in our education
populations right now.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.280
Just to frame this
in context, it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.220
would be the difference
between acing an exam

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.207
and failing it miserably.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.100
And we've gone on
to discover what

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.420
goes wrong within your brain to
produce these types of learning

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.250
disabilities.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.190
There is a structure on
the left and the right side

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.100
of your brain called
the hippocampus.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.090
And you can see it here in these
sort of orange-yellow colors.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.840
Think of the hippocampus
like the informational inbox

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.610
of your brain.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.790
It's very good at
receiving new memory files

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.670
and holding on to them.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.170
And when we looked
at this structure

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.950
in those people who'd had a full
night of sleep here in green,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.110
we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.960
Yet in those people who
were sleep deprived,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.980
we actually couldn't find any
significant signal whatsoever.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.760
It's almost as though
sleep deprivation had

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.550
shut down the memory inbox
and any new incoming files,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.080
they were just being bounced.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.280
You couldn't effectively commit
new experiences to memory.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.240
And parenthetically,
I should note

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.950
if you would like
to know what life

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.130
is like without a
functioning hippocampus,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.840
just watch the movie "Memento."

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.030
I suspect many of
you have seen this.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.180
But this gentleman
suffers brain damage.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.820
And from that point
forward, he can no longer

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.230
make any new memories.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.930
He's what we call
densely amnesic.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.070
The part of his brain that was
damaged was the hippocampus,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.870
and it is the very
same structure

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.340
that sleep deprivation will
attack and block your brain's

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.910
capacity for new learning.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.570
So that's the bad that happens
when you take sleep away.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.075
Let me just come back to that
control group for a second.

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:04.450
Do you remember those
folks that got a full eight

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.670
hours of sleep?

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.940
Well, we can ask a very
different question here.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.900
What is it about the
physiological quality of sleep,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.340
when you do get it, that
actually enhances and restores

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.190
your learning and memory
ability each and every day?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.490
And by recording sleep
with electrodes placed all

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.860
over their head, we've
discovered that there

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.880
are big, powerful brain waves
that happen during the very

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.440
deepest stages of sleep that
have, riding on top of them,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.130
these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.940
called sleep spindles.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.020
And it's the combined
quality of these deep sleep

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.830
brainwaves at night that acts
like a file transfer mechanism.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.040
It takes memories from
a short-term, vulnerable

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.460
reservoir and shifts
them to a more permanent,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.980
long-term storage
site within the brain

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.460
called the cortex, this big,
wrinkled, massive tissue

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.750
that sits atop of your brain.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.450
And it means that when you
wake up the next morning,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.970
there are two benefits.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.640
First, having shifted
memories of yesterday

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.000
to that long-term, safe
storage haven in the brain,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.930
they are protected
so that you will

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.540
remember rather than forget.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.620
The second benefit, however, is
that having shifted those files

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.700
from that short-term reservoir,
almost like moving files

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.310
from a USB stick,
you've cleared out

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.920
all of that
memory-encoding capacity,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.900
so that when you
wake up the next day,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.660
you can start acquiring
new files all over again.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.910
You can start learning anew.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.010
So it's this elegant, beautiful,
symbiotic system of memory that

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.480
happens each and every night.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.120
And it's important
that we understand

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.230
what, during sleep, actually
transacts these memory

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.250
benefits, because there are
real medical and societal

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.740
implications.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.060
And let me just tell
you about two areas

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.270
that we've moved
this work out into.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.820
I'll begin clinically and
specifically the context

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.000
of aging and dementia.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.130
Because I think many
of us have a sense

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.920
or even know that
as we get older,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.310
our learning and memory
abilities start to fade.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.650
They begin to decline.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.230
But what we've also
known for many decades

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.190
is that a physiological
signature of aging

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.809
is that your sleep gets worse.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.100
And not just any type of sleep--

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.930
especially that deep
quality of sleep

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.480
that I was just describing.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.150
And only last year, we
finally published evidence

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.140
that these two factors are
not simply co-occurring.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.020
They are significantly
interrelated.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.470
And it suggests that the
disruption of deep sleep

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.360
is perhaps an underappreciated
factor that is contributing

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.450
to what we call cognitive
decline, or memory decline,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.150
in aging, and most
recently, we've

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.190
discovered, in Alzheimer's
disease as well.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.820
Now, I know this is
remarkably depressing news.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.510
I understand.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.620
It's in the mail.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.180
It's coming at you.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.200
But there is a potential
silver lining here,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.050
because unlike many of the
other factors that we know

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.800
are associated with
aging and dementia--

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.530
for example, changes in
the physical structure

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.580
of the brain or even changes in
the vasculature of the brain--

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.350
those are fiendishly
difficult to treat right now.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.970
And we don't have any
good wholesale approaches

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.150
in medicine.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.450
But that sleep is a missing
piece in the explanatory puzzle

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.420
of aging and
Alzheimer's is exciting,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.830
because we may be able
to do something about it.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.770
And one way that
we are approaching

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.830
this at my Sleep Center is
not by using sleeping pills,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.120
by the way.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.610
They are blunt
instruments that do not

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.650
produce naturalistic
sleep, and they've

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.330
been associated with a higher
risk of death and cancer.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.840
And I'm happy to speak about
that evidence during the Q&amp;A,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.210
and it's discussed
in the book as well.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.790
What we are actually doing
is developing a method

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.690
based on this technology.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.055
It's called direct-current
brain stimulation.

00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:44.020
It sounds like the stuff
of science fiction.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.750
It's actually science fact.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.830
You apply electro
pads to the head,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.560
and you insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.530
so small that you
tend not to feel it.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:58.060
But it has a measurable
impact on physiology.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.440
Now, if you apply this
stimulation during sleep,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.650
in young, healthy
adults, as if you're

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:10.720
sort of singing in time with
those deep sleep brain waves,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.390
not only can you
actually amplify

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.400
the size of those deep sleep
brain waves, but in doing so,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.180
you can almost double the
amount of memory benefit

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.420
that you get from sleep.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.710
The question now is
whether we can translate

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:34.060
this same affordable,
potentially portable technology

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.960
into older adults and
those with dementia.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.370
Can we restore back some
healthy quality of deep sleep?

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:48.040
And in doing so, can we salvage
aspects of learning and memory

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.140
function?

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.600
That is my real hope now.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.479
That's one of our moonshot
goals, as it were.

00:11:57.479 --> 00:11:59.270
I should note, by the
way, because I always

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.820
get asked this question--
people will say, where can I

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.460
buy one of those devices?

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.720
I want one yesterday and
I want five more tomorrow.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.450
And they are not yet
FDA-approved for use in sleep.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.640
You can buy them
on the internet.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.300
I strongly advise against that.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.580
Just read around,
some horror stories.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.210
People have misaligned
the voltage, skin burns,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.600
they've lost their
eyesight for several days.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.570
Hang on.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.330
We are desperately
trying to bring this

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.300
to fruition as soon as we can.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.940
So that's sleep and memory
in a clinical context.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.090
But let me speak
about sleep and memory

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.550
in society and specifically
here within education.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.150
Because if sleep really is
so important for learning

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.200
and memory, then enhancing
sleep in a context where,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.790
arguably, it matters most
should prove transformative.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.700
And it has because there
are several counties

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.440
throughout the
United States that

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.190
have started to delay
their school start times

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.850
and then measure the
academic consequence.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.360
Now, one of the earliest
test case examples

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.480
happened in Edina in Minnesota.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.520
It's a township that sits
just outside of Minneapolis.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.560
And they shifted their
school start times from 7:25

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.600
in the morning to
8:30 in the morning.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.680
By the way, what
are we doing trying

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.200
to educate our next generation
at 7:25 in the morning?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.890
To give you a sense of this,
buses for a 7:25 start time

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.090
will often begin leaving
at 5:30 in the morning.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.710
That means that
some kids are having

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.830
to wake up at 5:15, 5
o'clock, maybe even earlier.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.835
This is lunacy.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.960
But in Edina, it was the
beginnings of a movement.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.270
And the metric that they used to
assess the academic consequence

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:10.900
was this--

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.910
SAT scores.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.620
And they focused their analysis
on the top 10% performing

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.960
students, arguably those
that have the least

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.550
to gain in terms of any further
improvement by way of sleep.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.730
Now, in the year before
they made the time change,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.690
that top 10% performing
students got an average score

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:38.990
of 1,288, which is a
very respectable score.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.390
The following year
when students were now

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.870
going to school at
8:30 in the morning,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.920
the average SAT score was--

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.545
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:51.378
AUDIENCE: [WHISTLES]

00:14:51.378 --> 00:14:54.590
MATTHEW WALKER: --1,500.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:15:00.950
That is a 212-point increase,
which is non-trivial.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.480
That will change which tier of
university those school kids

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.730
end up going to and
perhaps, as a consequence,

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.740
their subsequent
life trajectories.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.790
Now, some people have questioned
aspects of the Edina study,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.910
and I think for
perhaps good reason.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.320
But in all of the subsequent
carefully controlled studies,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.040
the data is
unequivocal, I think.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.380
Academic grades increase,
behavioral problems decrease,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.630
truancy rates decrease, and
psychological and psychiatric

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.100
issues also decrease.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.430
But something else actually
happened in this story

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.940
of later school start times.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.950
And it was something that
we did not anticipate.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:03.070
The life expectancy of
students actually increased.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.070
And you think, I
don't understand.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.760
How does that work?

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.740
Does anybody know
what the leading cause

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.400
of death in late-stage teenagers
is throughout most developed

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.430
nations?

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.350
AUDIENCE: Suicide.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.141
MATTHEW WALKER: Suicide
is actually second.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.290
It's car crashes.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.400
And here sleep
matters enormously.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.420
Another example comes from
Teton County in Wyoming.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.300
They shifted their
school starts from 7:35

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.420
in the morning to
8:55 in the morning.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.780
And then they measured the
reduction in car crashes

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.610
in this narrow age
of just 16 to 18.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.180
The only thing perhaps more
remarkable than the extra hour

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.060
of sleep that those
students reported getting

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.830
was the drop in
vehicle accidents.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.170
There was a 70% reduction.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.360
Just to sort of frame
that in context,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.200
the advent of ABS technology,
what we call anti-lock braking

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.900
systems that prevent your
wheels from locking up

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.750
into hard braking, so that
you can still safely maneuver

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.339
a vehicle, that dropped
accident rates by 20% to 25%.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.369
And some deemed it
to be a revolution.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:23.089
But here is a
biological factor--

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:28.235
sleep that will drop
accident rates by up to 70%.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:38.480
I think it's time for us to
reconsider the importance

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.200
of sleep in education.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.720
When sleep is abundant,
minds flourish.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.410
And if our goal
as educators truly

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.150
is to educate and not
risk lives in the process,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.440
then I fear that we may
be failing our children

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.220
in a significant manner
with this incessant model

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.890
of early school start times.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.450
So that's sleep for learning,
memory, aging, Alzheimer's.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.220
What else is sleep good for?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.160
Let me tell you that sleep is
essential to help stabilize

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.580
your emotional
and mental health.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.910
And without sleep, the
emotional circuits of your brain

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:32.200
become hyperactive
and irrational.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.610
Allow me to demonstrate with
a sleep-deprived subject,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.670
because it turns out
that we do video diaries

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.250
with our participants throughout
the deprivation night.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.230
And you go to meet one
under the pseudonym of Jeff.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.780
It's 11:30 at night.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.950
Jeff has been awake
for about 16 hours.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.430
And I'm actually just going
to plug in the audio here

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.570
to see if I can get you
some audio playing out.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.550
Jeff's just entered the study.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.490
He's been awake for
a normal 16 hours.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.830
And perhaps let's
hear from Jeff what

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.950
his sort of hopes
and aspirations

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.860
are for the deprivation period.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.680
- Hey.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.290
It's about 11:27 right now.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.700
I've been here for about an--

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.115
I think about an hour now.

00:19:26.115 --> 00:19:27.310
Yeah, about an hour.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.050
So it's the first hour.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.740
I'm writing my paper right
now, a 30-page paper.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.427
Hopefully I can get some of it
done before I get too sleepy.

00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:36.052
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:19:36.052 --> 00:19:38.440
MATTHEW WALKER: So that's Jeff.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.560
Perfectly likable,
affable chap who's

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.190
hoping to get his 30-page
report complete in a night

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.623
of sleep deprivation.

00:19:47.623 --> 00:19:50.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.880
Classic delusional
under-graduate thinking,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.100
I have to say.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.830
I see it all of the
time in my students.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.930
So now let's
fast-forward the clock.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.260
It's now 5:30 the
following morning.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.040
Jeff has now been awake
for 22 hours straight.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.430
And instantly, you'll notice
one of the hallmark features

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.270
of sleep deprivation, which is
that you actually slide down

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.720
in your chair.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.210
You can look around the room
right now, actually, and see.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:24.020
Jeff's down about
six or seven inches.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.180
It's about an inch
for every hour

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.360
that you've been awake
beyond the standard 16

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.960
based on our highly
sophisticated machine-learning

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.170
algorithms.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:41.510
But in all seriousness, notice
how emotionally different Jeff

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.450
has become.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.940
Some people have, I
think perhaps unkindly,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.640
described him as becoming
a little bit emotionally

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.400
unhinged.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.980
So let's hear how that
30-page report has been going.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.991
And I do apologize ahead
of time for the profanity.

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.346

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:02.701

00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:04.120
- Hello.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.090
I'm very angry
right now, because I

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.060
didn't get any fucking--
could I curse on this?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.700
Are they going to, like--

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.238
whatever.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.628
[LAUGHS]

00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:17.990
They probably think I'm
crazy after all this.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.460
I'm very lucid, actually.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.930
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.830
MATTHEW WALKER:
So did you notice

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.960
how Jeff went from
being remarkably

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.670
upset and annoyed
that he got none

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.340
of his 30-page report
complete to then finding

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.530
it almost hilarious?

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.420
He was nearly sort
of punch-drunk giddy

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.120
on sleep deprivation and
then came right back down

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.510
to baseline again.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.710
That is a remarkably
abnormal emotional distance

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.140
to travel within such
a short time period.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.310
And I think it emphasizes the
type of destabilizing influence

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:58.990
that a lack of sleep has
on our emotional integrity.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.950
And we've since discovered
what actually changes

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.940
within your brain to produce
this type of pendulum,

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.480
emotional irrationality.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.760
There's a structure very
deep within your brain called

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.197
the amygdala.

00:22:14.197 --> 00:22:16.030
And you can see it here
in these red colors.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.000
Again, you have one on the
left side and one on the right.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.690
And the amygdala is one
of the centerpiece regions

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.050
for the generation of
strong, emotional reactions,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.420
including negative reactions.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.980
And when we looked
at this structure

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.330
in those people who'd had a full
night of sleep, here in green,

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.730
we saw a nice, controlled,
modest degree of reactivity.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.250
Yet in those people who
were sleep deprived,

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.000
we saw this amplified,
almost aggravated degree

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.270
of reactivity.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.110
The amygdala was actually
60% more responsive

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.757
under conditions
of a lack of sleep.

00:22:57.757 --> 00:22:59.590
And it's almost as
though, without sleep, we

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.650
become all sort of
emotional gas pedal

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.220
and too little sort of
regulatory-control brake.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.230
But what is perhaps
more concerning,

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.910
however, is that this represents
a neurological signature that

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:21.410
is not dissimilar to numerous
psychiatric conditions.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.220
And we're now finding
significant links between sleep

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.130
disruption and conditions
such as depression;

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:35.240
anxiety, including PTSD;
schizophrenia; and tragically,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.680
suicide as well.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:45.820
In fact, we cannot find a single
psychiatric condition in which

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.695
sleep is normal.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.180
I think sleep has
a profound story

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.170
to tell in our understanding,
in our treatment,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.490
and perhaps even may contribute
to our ultimate prevention

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.110
of grave mental illness.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.340
So that's sleep for the
brain, but sleep is just

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.920
as essential for your body.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.510
And here I could have gone into
any one of the model systems

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.100
and spoken about it in detail.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.080
We've already
spoken a little bit

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.530
about sleep loss and
the reproductive system.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.460
I could tell you about sleep
loss and the metabolic system,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.400
that after one week
of short sleep,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.860
your blood sugar
levels are disrupted

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.280
so significantly that your
doctor would classify you

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.780
as being pre-diabetic.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.140
Or I could tell you
about sleep loss

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.490
and the cardiovascular system,
that all it takes is one hour.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.590
Because there is a
global experiment

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:59.080
that is performed on 1.6 billion
people across 70 countries

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.440
twice a year, and it's
called daylight savings time.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.340
Now, in the spring, when
we lose one hour of sleep,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.150
we see a subsequent 24%
increase in heart attacks.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.730
In the fall, when we
gain an hour of sleep,

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.840
we see a 21% decrease
in heart attacks.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.570
That is how fragile your body
is to even just the smallest

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.940
perturbations of sleep.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.760
I think many of us perhaps
don't think anything

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.770
of losing an hour of sleep.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.510
But as a deep dive,
I actually want

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.320
to focus on this-- sleep
and the immune system.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.130
And here I'll introduce these
delightful blue elements

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.820
in the image.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.740
They are called
natural killer cells.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.330
Think of natural killer
cells like the Secret Service

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.190
agents of your immune system.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.160
They are very good
at identifying

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.524
dangerous foreign elements
and eliminating them.

00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:04.440
In fact, what they're
doing here in this image

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.770
is embedding themselves into
a malignant, a cancerous tumor

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.630
mass, and destroying it.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.880
And many of you may not
know, but today your body

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.000
produced cancer cells.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.790
And it's always doing this.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.150
What stops those cancer cells
from becoming the disease

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:30.650
that we call cancer is, in part,
these natural killer cells.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:36.970
So what you want is a virile
set of these immune assassins

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.160
at all times.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.890
And sadly, that's exactly
what you don't have

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.070
if you're not sleeping enough.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.537
So here in this study from my
wonderful colleague Mike Irwin,

00:26:48.537 --> 00:26:50.370
you're not going to
have your sleep deprived

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.020
for an entire night.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.140
You're simply going to have
your sleep restricted to four

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.362
hours for one single night.

00:26:58.362 --> 00:26:59.820
And then we're
going to look to see

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.870
what is the percent reduction
in immune cell activity

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.100
that you suffer.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.820
And it's not small.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.100
It's not 10%, it's not 30%.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:19.300
There was a 70% drop in
natural killer cell activity.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.360
That's quite a concerning
state of immune deficiency.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.150
And it happens quickly,
essentially after just one

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.450
bad night.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.880
Imagine the state of
your immune system

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.470
after weeks, if not months,
of insufficient sleep.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.290
And it perhaps should
then come as no surprise

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.290
to learn that we now
have significant links

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:49.600
between short sleep and
numerous forms of cancer.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.660
Currently that list includes
cancer of the bowel,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:57.860
cancer of the prostate,
and cancer of the breast.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.030
In fact, the link between
a lack of sleep and cancer

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:07.100
is now so strong that recently
the World Health Organization

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.210
decided to classify any
form of nighttime shift work

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.350
as a probable carcinogen.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.530
In other words,
jobs that may induce

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.025
cancer because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.950
So you may have heard
of that old maxim--

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.500
oh, you can sleep
when you're dead.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.720
Well, I'm being
absolutely serious.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.550
It is mortally unwise advice.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:40.000
Because if you adopt that
mindset, we know from the data

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.060
that you will now
live a shorter life

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.520
and the quality of
that shorter life

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.920
will be significantly worse.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.320
Epidemiological
studies teaches this.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.590
Short sleep predicts
a shorter life.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.200
It predicts all-cause mortality.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.190
And the bad news, I'm
sorry, keeps coming.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.540
Because if you are fighting
a battle against cancer

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.520
and not getting
sufficient sleep,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.960
that cancer may grow more
quickly and aggressively.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.540
So here I actually
want to feature work

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.680
not from my own sleep center,
but by a scientist called

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.470
David Gozal who works at
the University of Chicago.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.940
And he examines the relationship
between sleep loss and cancer

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.030
in mice.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.840
Now, I know this
isn't for everyone,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.440
so I will tell you when
to look away if you'd

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.280
prefer not to see this.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.740
But in one of the
studies that he did,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.810
he inoculated some mice with
cancer cells on their back.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:47.440
And then he gave that cancer
a one-month period to grow.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.130
And at the end of that one
month, he resected the skin

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.890
and measured the size
of that tumor mass.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.190
Half of the mice were
allowed to sleep normally

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.230
during that one-month period.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.290
The other half had
their sleep disrupted.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.390
Not total deprivation.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.450
They just sort of played
with them a little bit more

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.990
during the day and during the
night to restrict their sleep.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.070
So in a second, I'm going
to play a video with David

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.730
illustrating the results.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.220
Now would be the
time to look away

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.410
if you would prefer to do so.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.500
And here you can
see him pointing

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.650
to a mouse on a monitor
with the skin resected,

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.020
and you can clearly see
that tumor mass there.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.730
This is in one of the mice that
was allowed to sleep normally

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.790
during that one month.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.570
I'll play the video, and he will
reveal behind it another mouse.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.020
That mouse was in the
sleep restriction group,

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.100
and you will see the
difference in the tumor mass.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.668
This is the difference.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:01.010
There was a 200%
increase in the speed

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.640
and the size of that
cancerous growth linked

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.810
to insufficient sleep.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.040
Worse still, the cancer
in those under-slept mice

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.490
had actually metastasized.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.080
That's just a
medical description

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.900
meaning that it had
breached the original origin

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.330
and started to
invade other areas--

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.190
bone, other organs,
as well as brain.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.250
When cancer becomes
metastatic, that's

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.100
when we see mortality
rates escalate.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.090
So if you are fighting
a battle against cancer

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.820
and not getting
sufficient sleep,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.000
it may be the equivalent
of placing gasoline

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.400
on an already aggressive fire.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.280
Sleep loss is an accelerant.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.530
And we now know that it produces
a harmful biological fertilizer

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.875
for the more rapid and
rampant growth of cancer.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.990
Now, if increasing your risk
of developing Alzheimer's

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.420
or cancer by way
of a lack of sleep

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.050
were not sufficiently
disquieting,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.200
we have since discovered
that a lack of sleep

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.300
will even erode the very
fabric of biological life

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:29.440
itself, your DNA genetic code.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.150
So here in this study, they
took a group of healthy adults

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:37.920
and limited them to six
hours of sleep for one week.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.830
And then they
measured the change

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.630
in the gene activity
profile compared

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.480
to when those same
individuals were getting eight

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.570
hours of sleep for a week.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.300
And there were two
critical results here.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:59.540
First, a sizable and
significant 711 genes

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.590
were distorted in terms
of their activity,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.920
caused by six hours of sleep.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.480
And that's relevant, by the way.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.530
We know that almost one out
of every two American adults

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.620
are trying to survive on
six hours of sleep or less

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.400
during the week.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.750
The second result was that
about half of those genes

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.600
were actually increased
in their activity.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.740
The other half were actually
decreased in their activity.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.610
Those genes that were
decreased by a lack of sleep

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:38.560
were genes related to numerous
aspects of the immune system,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.690
which fits very well with
the evidence I was just

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.570
discussing regarding cancer.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.990
Those genes that were actually
increased in their activity

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.260
or what we call up-regulated
in their expression

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.950
were genes related to
the promotion of tumors,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.910
genes that were related
to chronic inflammation

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.700
within the body,
and also genes that

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.640
were related to stress
and, as a consequence,

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.260
cardiovascular disease.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:12.489
Now, I think many
individuals in society

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:17.050
feel uncomfortable about
the idea of genetically

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:22.679
modified embryos or even
genetically modified food.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:26.150
But by choosing to get
insufficient sleep,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.730
we may be forced
to accept that we

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.030
are performing a similar
genetic modifying

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.920
experiment on ourselves.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.730
And if we don't let our
children get the sleep that they

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:43.030
so desperately
need, then we may be

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.505
inflicting a similar genetic
engineering experiment on them

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:47.005
as well.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.170
There is simply no
aspect of your physiology

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.220
that seems to be able to
retreat at the sign of sleep

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.020
deprivation and
get away unscathed.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.940
It's almost like a broken
water pipe in your home.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.680
Sleep loss will leak down
into every nook and cranny

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.340
of your biology, even
tampering with the very

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.080
DNA nucleic alphabet that
spells out your daily health

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.710
narrative.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.720
So where does this leave us?

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.200
What is the piece of
sort of mental furniture

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.580
I would like to gift to
you as we finish the talk?

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.250
Well, it would be this.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:49.360
Sleep is not an optional
lifestyle luxury.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:55.320
Sleep is a non-negotiable
biological necessity.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.390
It's a life support system.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.770
And it is mother nature's best
effort yet at contra-death.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.330
And the decimation of sleep
throughout industrialized

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.540
nations is having a
catastrophic impact

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.990
on our health, our
wellness, and the safety

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.240
and the education
of our children.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.710
It's a silent sleep
loss epidemic,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.590
and it is fast becoming one
of the greatest public health

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.540
challenges that we now
face in the 21st century.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:40.420
I believe it is now time
for us to reclaim our right

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:46.550
to a full night of sleep,
and without embarrassment

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.750
and without that terrible
stigma of laziness.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.010
And in doing so, we
may finally remember

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:00.080
what it feels like to
be awake during the day.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:09.290
And with that soapbox rant over,
I will simply say good night,

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.220
good luck, and above all,
I do hope you sleep well.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.856
Thank you very much indeed.

00:37:14.856 --> 00:37:18.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:25.130
I think we've got lots of
times for questions, I think.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.880
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if you can hear me,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.338
but thank you so
much for the talk.

00:37:28.338 --> 00:37:29.852
It was actually
very informative.

00:37:29.852 --> 00:37:31.060
I have two questions for you.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.134
Number one, I have
a five-year-old

00:37:33.134 --> 00:37:34.425
and then there's myself, right?

00:37:34.425 --> 00:37:37.200
So how much sleep
should we be getting?

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.500
And number two, is there any
disadvantage of oversleeping?

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.725
So let's say if I sleep 10
hour, 15 hours in a day--

00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:43.600
MATTHEW WALKER: Yeah.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.000
AUDIENCE: Is there any
disadvantage to that?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.416
MATTHEW WALKER:
So great question.

00:37:46.416 --> 00:37:48.360
So firstly, recommendations
for sleep, you

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.610
can find them on the
National Sleep Foundation

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.890
website for all ages.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.740
For the average adult,
the recommendation,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.290
World Health
Organization-- eight hours;

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.620
range, seven to nine.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.290
Once the average
human being gets

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.120
below seven hours
of sleep, we can

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.610
measure objective impairments.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.490
So people who say, I can survive
on six hours of sleep, there's

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.290
a problem with
that, which is this.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.330
Your subjective
sense of how well

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.700
you think you're doing
without sufficient sleep

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.040
is a miserable
predictor of objectively

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.680
how you're doing without
sufficient sleep.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.782
So it's probably a little bit
like a drunk driver at a bar.

00:38:25.782 --> 00:38:27.990
They've had seven shots,
they pick up their car keys,

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.152
and they say, I'm fine to drive.

00:38:30.152 --> 00:38:31.860
And your response is,
no, I know that you

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.800
think you're fine to drive, but
trust me, objectively, you're

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.610
not.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.250
The same is true
for a lack of sleep.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.970
Your second question
is fascinating.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.480
Can I sleep too much?

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.900
Well, there are anecdotes
of something called a sleep

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.750
hangover, where you
sort of oversleep

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.000
and then you feel worse almost.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.040
When you oversleep,
it usually means

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.530
that you're trying to sleep
off a debt that you've

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.450
lumbered yourself with.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:01.360
So if you could sleep past your
alarm, if it didn't go off,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.520
then you're under-slept, because
it's physiologically impossible

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.370
to sleep too much
if you're healthy.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.250
Now, there is one
piece of evidence

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.390
that suggests something called
hyper-somnia, excessive sleep.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.734
That principally expresses
itself in depression.

00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:21.150
But if you look at that data,
it's actually very difficult

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.840
to tell.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.870
Is it people just reporting
being in bed for longer

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.070
rather than sleeping longer?

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.960
So I think it's
unclear right now.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.810
But let me just take it
to a theoretical realm.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.210
Could there be such a
thing as too much sleep?

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.190
I think yes.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.120
But don't forget.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.880
The same is true for the
other three essential factors

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.280
of life-- oxygen,
food, and water.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.210
Can you eat too much?

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.080
Yes.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.531
Can you overhydrate?

00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:45.030
Yes.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.240
Can you increase blood pressure,
cause stroke and heart attack

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.430
by excessive water intake?

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.190
It happened in the 1990s
with the ecstasy craze,

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.600
where people were dehydrating.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.490
Governments told
them, drink lots.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:57.780
They drank too much.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.400
Cardiac events.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.580
Can you actually become
hyper-oxygenated?

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.190
So you get free radical
species, dangerous for cells.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.390
Yes, you can.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.090
Is there such a thing
as too much sleep?

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.120
We haven't found it yet,
but I suspect probably so.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.410
It's a bell-shaped curve.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.650
It's a U-shaped function in
terms of benefit, not linear.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.790
But on most people in danger
of getting too much sleep,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.040
au contraire.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.904
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the great talk.

00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:25.170
MATTHEW WALKER: Thank you.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.920
AUDIENCE: Do you also
have any information

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.580
on how quickly people
recover after they switch

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.710
from kind of short sleep periods
to kind of more normal sleep

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:35.670
periods?

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.360
Because you only mentioned
kind of as a-- one evidence was

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.340
the DST change, or when we sleep
one hour more, kind of things

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.770
get better in terms
of cardiac problems.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.400
But is it quick, the
recovery as well?

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.820
As quick as the downhill
movement [INAUDIBLE]??

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.870
MATTHEW WALKER: Yeah.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.900
It's a great question.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.580
So different aspects of
your brain and your body

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.840
seem to come back online
to a status of health

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.610
with recovery sleep.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.650
And those temporal
profiles are different

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.680
based on-- even within the
immune system, for example,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.280
some components take longer to
come back online than others.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.040
What I would note, however,
is that you can never

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.960
get back all that you've lost.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.630
This is another one of
those myths with sleep.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.240
So sleep is not like the bank.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.810
You cannot accumulate a debt
and then pay it off at a later

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.500
point in time, which is what
most of modern society does.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.600
Chronic short sleep
during the week,

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.050
then you binge at the weekend.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.560
It's what I call sleep bulimia.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.660
It's what is otherwise
known as social jet lag.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.200
Now, if I were to take you and
deprive you of sleep for one

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.180
single night, eight
hours of lost sleep,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.680
and then I give you
all of the sleep

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.930
that you want for
however many nights

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.880
and we keep recording
you, your brain

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.700
never recovers all of
that lost eight hours.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.190
It will try to get
back some of it.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.320
It will never get
back all of it.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.050
Why is that the
case, we can ask?

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.530
Why doesn't your brain have
a credit system for sleep?

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.720
Because there's precedent
for this in biology.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.370
You have one for energy.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.890
It's called a fat cell.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.360
You can actually store
up credit calorically

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.650
and spend it when
you go into famine.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.800
Now, most of us aren't
in that danger anymore.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.260
But during evolution,
we faced that challenge,

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.310
so we came up with a solution
called the adipose cell.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.580
Where is the fat cell for sleep?

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.580
Why isn't it there?

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.650
The reason is this.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.480
Human beings are
the only species

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.610
that deliberately deprive
themselves of sleep

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.720
for no apparent reason.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.850
What that means is that
mother nature has never

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.760
had to face the challenge
through evolution

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.210
of coming up with a safety net
because of insufficient sleep.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.440
So there is no
mechanism of safety.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.705
There is no credit system.

00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:54.840
AUDIENCE: So similar to how
you can take supplements

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.530
after exercising, have you done
any research about supplements

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.750
that can help sleeping--

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.968
well, without the device yet?

00:43:02.968 --> 00:43:07.214
And as a side note,
what about melatonin?

00:43:07.214 --> 00:43:10.230
MATTHEW WALKER: So no
drugs or supplements

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.520
that we have currently
produce naturalistic sleep.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.860
Chemically, it's an
incredibly complex job.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.220
Now, I don't want to dismiss
people at drug companies.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.960
I'm not against medication.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.420
I'm not anti all medication.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.704
If medications work,
I'm all for them.

00:43:25.704 --> 00:43:27.120
It's just that all
of the sleeping

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.580
medications that we
have right now don't

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.110
produce naturalistic sleep.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.820
Most of them are a
class of drugs that we

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.830
call the sedative hypnotics.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.450
Sedation is not sleep.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.340
All you're doing is
knocking the cortex out.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.480
You're not producing
naturalistic sleep.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.160
And as I said and I
mentioned in the book,

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.340
they are also linked to
a higher risk of death--

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.050
and it's considerably higher--

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.970
as well as cancer.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.500
What about melatonin?

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.480
Well, melatonin turns out not
to be an effective sleep aid.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.170
And it shouldn't surprise us
based on how melatonin works.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:05.490
Melatonin helps time
the onset of sleep,

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.650
but it doesn't help in the
creation of sleep itself.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.700
So the analogy would
be melatonin is

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.850
like the starting official
in the 100-meter race

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:15.990
at the Olympics.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.500
Melatonin gathers all of the
racers to the starting line

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.590
and begins the race, but
that official themselves

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:25.830
does not participate in the
great sleep race itself.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.010
That's a whole different set of
brain mechanisms and chemicals.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.650
That's why melatonin
is not efficacious

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.040
once you're stable
in a new time zone.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.800
Now, I will say this, however.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.460
If you're taking melatonin
and you feel it's beneficial,

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.340
keep taking it, because
the placebo effect

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.240
is one of the most reliable
effects in all of pharmacology.

00:44:51.795 --> 00:44:53.670
I mean, that tells you
something, by the way,

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.900
something profound.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.060
There is such a thing
as mind over matter.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.990
And there is now a wonderful
science of the placebo effect.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.440
It's very real.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.475
And we dismissed
it for a long time.

00:45:04.475 --> 00:45:06.220
I hope that answers
both your questions.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.053
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:07.053 --> 00:45:07.980
MATTHEW WALKER: Sure.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.500
AUDIENCE: I was wondering--

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.810
again, thank you for the talk.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.610
MATTHEW WALKER: Sure.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.830
AUDIENCE: Does the time period
between when you wake up

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.010
to when you start using
your brain for learning

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.920
or whatever, also
play a difference?

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.410
If a person had a full
eight hours of sleep

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.170
but they don't go to
school until evening

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.300
when they have evening school,
do they learn worse than

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.620
if they could have went
to a morning school

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.164
and started learning
in the morning?

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.330
MATTHEW WALKER: So it's a
very interesting question.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.230
When on the clock face
is learning, let's

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.780
say, most sort of beneficial?

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.990
Well, once you're waking
at a reasonable time,

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.110
it seems as though there
is some degree of stability

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.280
of learning across the day.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.921
However, there does seem to
be a gradual deterioration.

00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:57.420
And we've done some
of these studies

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.150
to basically map the
time course, sort

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.170
of the Great Depression of
learning across the day.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.450
And we've inserted naps, and we
can actually restore learning.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.950
But I would like
to come on to naps.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.325
Someone should
ask me about that,

00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:13.800
because they're a double-edged
sword with danger.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.650
But what we do know from
those school studies

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.200
where they delayed the
school start times, where

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.550
you get the greatest
grade-point increases is not

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.970
in all classes across the
day, but it's especially

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.850
in those first morning classes.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.340
But I think that that's
less about your brain

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.890
being better at
learning in the morning

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.530
than it was about when you
were starting so early,

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.440
it was just so detrimental
to try and learn.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.690
So sort of you'd
lowered the floor

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.940
rather than raise the ceiling.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.870
So yep.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.910
But to me, it makes
sense that learning

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.370
is somewhat stable
across 16 hours,

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.650
because if you were to design
a system of memory that

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.740
could only learn in the last
couple of hours of wakefulness,

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.470
then why are we awake
for the other 14?

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.840
And we seem to have a system
of memory that gives us

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.790
a capacity for about 16
hours of recording in humans

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.110
before sleep is required.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.010
AUDIENCE: A quick
followup question.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.970
Do you do any study on
other brain activities

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.540
like coding-- well, not coding,
but more advanced [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.220
I try not to schedule
morning meetings,

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.740
because everybody is asleep
and nobody's making decisions.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.573
MATTHEW WALKER: Yes.

00:47:20.573 --> 00:47:25.170
So we've done lots of studies on
all aspects of brain cognition.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.300
We've done decision-making,
judgment making.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.360
We've done creativity,
emotional regulation.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.660
We've done visual
attention aspects.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.550
We've done motor skill learning.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.550
And it follows the same
profile, which is essentially

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.270
when sleep is in high
volumes, all of those things

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:43.320
are supported.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.230
Different operations
within the brain

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.640
rely on different
stages of sleep

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.570
at different times
of night, however.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.000
It's not just one
stage of sleep that

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.690
does it all for all of your
brain sort of mechanisms

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:59.550
and apparatus features.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.542
And this is why there is no
single one stage of sleep

00:48:02.542 --> 00:48:03.250
that's important.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.620
People will say, oh, how
can I get more REM sleep?

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.180
And I would say, why do
you want more REM sleep?

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.020
Or how can I get
more deep sleep?

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.660
Mother nature took
about 3.6 million years

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.500
to figure that out.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.700
Just let her do her job.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.150
She'll see you well.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:19.670
AUDIENCE: Quick
question, basically.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:24.350
How do drugs, any kind of
drugs-- medicine, alcohol,

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.555
marijuana-- how
would it basically

00:48:26.555 --> 00:48:29.710
affect the brain activity during
the night, during the sleep?

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.480
MATTHEW WALKER: So how do
drugs, perhaps some legal,

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.030
some non-legal, impact sleep?

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.159
I'll focus on
marijuana and alcohol

00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:40.200
since you mentioned them.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.900
Alcohol is perhaps the
most misunderstood drug

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.490
when it comes to sleep.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:48.070
People say, you have a nightcap,
and I fall asleep better.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.110
Untrue.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.800
Alcohol is also a class of drugs
that we call the sedatives.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.080
And once again, that's
not natural sleep.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.440
What you're doing is simply
removing consciousness

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.340
by way of alcohol.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.620
You're not putting yourself
into natural sleep.

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.480
Two more problems with alcohol.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.640
First, it will
fragment your sleep

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.050
with awakenings
throughout the night.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.260
The problem is that they
are so brief that you

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.940
tend not to remember them
and commit them to memory.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.570
So you wake up the next
morning feeling unrefreshed,

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.390
but you don't understand why--

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.010
that it was the alcohol
fragmenting your sleep.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.940
Finally, alcohol is very
effective at blocking your REM

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.700
sleep, at blocking
your dream sleep.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.480
So alcohol-- misunderstood,
should be avoided.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.770
Marijuana-- people
use it to try and help

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.920
them get to sleep or relax.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.430
The problem is marijuana
also seems to fragment sleep.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.570
It also seems to block
rapid-eye movement sleep.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.090
Probably the other chemical
that deserves mention

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.610
here is caffeine.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:51.139
Caffeine, most people
know, is an alerting drug.

00:49:51.139 --> 00:49:52.930
It's actually a class
of drugs that we call

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.780
the psychoactive stimulants.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.540
It's the only legal stimulant
that we readily give

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.480
to our children, by the way.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.395
Caffeine can obviously
keep you awake at night.

00:50:03.395 --> 00:50:04.770
But some people
will say, I'm one

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:08.170
of those who can have a cup of
coffee, and I fall asleep fine.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.250
The problem there is that
even if you fall asleep,

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.620
the depth of the deep
sleep that you have

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.770
is not as deep as
if you were to have

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.140
sleep that didn't have
caffeine swilling around

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.410
within the brain.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:23.310
So again, you wake up the next
morning feeling unrefreshed.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.329
You don't remember waking up
or struggling to fall asleep,

00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:27.870
so you don't think
it's the caffeine.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.550
But now you need
two cups of coffee

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.230
rather than one
the next morning.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.660
You build up this vicious
cycle, and it's probably

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.390
the reason that caffeine is the
second most traded commodity

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.449
on the surface of
the planet after oil.

00:50:38.449 --> 00:50:40.740
I don't think there's probably
any other statistic that

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.870
bares out how sleep
deprived we are

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:45.125
throughout
industrialized nations.

00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:45.750
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.964
Thank you.

00:50:46.964 --> 00:50:48.930
One more quick question.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:52.410
How much of the sleep every
night is basically enough?

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.132
It's eight hours maybe?

00:50:54.132 --> 00:50:55.590
MATTHEW WALKER: As
I said, once you

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.870
get below seven hours
of sleep, that's

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.385
when we can measure
objective impairments.

00:51:00.385 --> 00:51:01.900
Yup.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.277
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:04.860
MATTHEW WALKER: But
that's once we can

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.110
measure objective impairments.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.370
It doesn't mean that if we
had more sensitive tools,

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:12.451
we would measure it at
seven hours and 15 minutes.

00:51:12.451 --> 00:51:14.895
AUDIENCE: I wondered
about blue light exposure,

00:51:14.895 --> 00:51:16.490
especially from devices.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.010
And back a couple
years ago, I got

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.043
the blue light-blocking glasses.

00:51:21.043 --> 00:51:23.640
And it does seem to actually
give better sleep at night.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.200
I was curious what the
research is behind that.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.533
MATTHEW WALKER: Yeah, that
one is actually not a placebo

00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:29.070
effect, it turns out.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:34.040
So the studies are
very clear right now.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.090
As an industrialized
set of nations,

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.780
we are a dark, deprived society.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.060
And we need darkness
because the way

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.600
that darkness works
is that it actually

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.960
removes the breaks from
the hormone melatonin

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.690
that I described
that needs to rise

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:57.680
to help time the normal
onset of healthy sleep.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.770
So if you're bathed in
electrical light at night,

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.170
even though it's not as
powerful as daylight,

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:06.680
it can keep the brake
pedal on melatonin.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.020
Now, they did some
fascinating studies

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.600
where you read on
an iPad for one

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.440
hour versus just reading a
normal book with dim light.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.080
And firstly, relative to
that one hour of dim light,

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.290
normal book reading, the
one hour of iPad reading

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.350
firstly delayed that
spike in melatonin

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.400
by two to three hours.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.790
So here, if you're reading
the iPad in Seattle,

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.640
we're almost all
the way to Hawaii

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.460
in terms of our biological
melatonin rhythms.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.690
That's how shifted
and delayed we are.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:39.380
Second, the sleep
was not as good.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.590
REM sleep was disrupted,
and people subjectively felt

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.980
worse and less refreshed
the next morning.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.140
And it took a few
days before it washed

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.530
itself away after they ceased.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.200
So I think the
recommendation right now

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.230
is try to limit screen
time in the last hour.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.890
I know where I'm speaking
right now, which is at Google,

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.240
and what that means.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.060
You can install software
that helps desaturate

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.600
the most harmful wavelength of
light, which is the blue light.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.400
You can also put
those spectacles on.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.360
They seem to work as well.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.810
But overall, try to
decrease stimulation.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:19.590
Blackout curtains also great at
night during the night in bed.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, a followup
on the blackout curtains.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.110
One of the things
I've found is it's

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:25.610
really hard to get
up in the morning

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.320
if the room is all blacked out.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.540
Having that natural light
come in is important.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.790
And I wondered too--

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.880
which is worse, to have
any of this light coming

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.220
in during the
nighttime versus having

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.002
to deal with an
unnatural alarm clock

00:53:41.002 --> 00:53:42.210
waking you up in the morning?

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.304
MATTHEW WALKER: Yeah.

00:53:43.304 --> 00:53:45.470
I mean, it sounds as though
what you're experiencing

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.290
is sort of what we call
a sleep inertia, which

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:49.226
is when you wake up.

00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:50.600
It usually means
that you're sort

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.670
of waking up at a
time that's slightly

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.570
offset from your natural
biological tendency.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.610
With that, you can use daylight
to perhaps try and help you.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.550
Some people actually
use eye masks

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.190
in the first part of the night.

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:05.600
And at some point, they
will take the eye mask off

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.000
and then help with the
exposure to the daylight,

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.140
because they've
kept their curtains

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.960
non-blackout in that regard.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.730
But that's a tricky
one to balance.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:14.710
Yeah.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.750
JOSH: I know there are
a lot more questions.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.560
It's coming up on 2 o'clock,
so we're going to cut it off.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.780
But Dr. Walker will stay,
and he's going to sign books.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.250
We're selling a
few of the copies.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.380
And so just everybody, let's
give Dr. Walker our hands.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.171
MATTHEW WALKER: Thank
you very much indeed.

00:54:26.171 --> 00:54:27.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.040
Thank you.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.740
Thank you so much.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.590
Thank you.
