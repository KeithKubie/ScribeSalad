Mitchell: Well,
good morning, everybody.

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.400
Welcome to the Geo track
at Google I/O 2011.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.868
Um, I trust you all enjoyed
this morning's keynote.

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:10.534
We have a great lineup

00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:12.534
of content for you
over the next two days.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.534
We hope you'll stick with us,
and I'm gonna kick it off today

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.601
by talking about connecting
people and places.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.334
Uh, my name is Thor Mitchell.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.534
I'm the product manager
for the Google Maps APIs

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:23.968
based in, uh, Sydney, Australia.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.834
So what I'm gonna talk about
this morning is, firstly,

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.834
a little bit about what we mean
when we talk about places

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.968
and why they're important,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.868
a little about how Google
connects people with places,

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:40.868
and then move on to focusing on
how you can do the same

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:42.801
in your applications.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.567
So we start at the beginning.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.601
This is Google Maps circa 2005.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.601
Back then, there was
no Street View.

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.834
There was no maps, uh, My Maps.

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.400
There was no Western Europe,
for that matter.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.934
Um, so...

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:04.834
So it was, uh, it was a nice,
simple world back then.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.901
Um, if you look at the very top,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.067
just, uh, just in
the search box there,

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.868
you'll see that there are
only three options--

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:14.367
You've got maps, a local search,
and directions.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.200
Now what's interesting
about this,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.033
compared to, um, what
we're used to now,

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.167
is that Maps allows you
to search for addresses,

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.000
for geographical entities.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.067
Local search was business
listings and points of interest,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:27.934
and you had to make
that decision.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:29.501
You had to choose for yourself.

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.167
Um, what am I looking for here?

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.634
What type of thing
do I want to find?

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:35.467
Now the thing about that is

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.567
it doesn't really map
to the way we just think about

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:41.434
the world around us
on a day-to-day basis.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.267
If I were to say to you,

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:46.267
or if someone was to ask you
right now, where are you?

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:48.267
There are all manner
of different reasonable answers

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.267
you could give,
and the answer you chose

00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:52.901
would probably be based
on who was asking.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.901
So if it was someone you knew
was already at I/O,

00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:58.400
they'd--you would probably just
say, "Oh, I'm in Room 8."

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.067
If it was someone you knew

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.968
was in San Francisco,
then "Moscone Center."

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:03.968
If it was someone
you knew was abroad,

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.801
then "in San Francisco"
would suffice,

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:07.934
and all of these are places,

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:09.601
uh, in their own way,

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.367
and all of them are reasonable
answers to this question.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:15.367
The one thing you're unlikely
to say is the answer

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.367
your phone would give you
if asked this question,

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.100
or, at least, I would hope
you're unlikely to say that,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.801
'cause I wouldn't be none
the--the wiser if you did.

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:26.300
So what we need to do,
if you want to bring

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.200
location-based applications
to mobile devices like these,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.701
that relate to users in the way
they relate to the world--

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.601
we need to bridge this divide

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.934
between this sort of fuzzy
notion of a place

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:41.434
and the sort of
more geometric model

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:43.467
that, uh, mobile devices use.

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:46.968
Of course, we're sort of
fast and loose

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:48.968
with what we consider
to be a place.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.801
It can be one of many things.

00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.300
It can be an address.
It can be a city.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.801
It can be a landmark.
It can be a natural feature.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.300
It can be a point of interest.
It can be a business.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.300
It just goes on and on and on,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.367
and you have to kind of
accommodate all that

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:06.367
if you want to make people feel
at home with these applications.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.868
So we recognized this at Google,
uh, some time ago,

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.868
and back in September 2009,
we launched Place Pages.

00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:15.968
So now every place had a page

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:17.801
where we could aggregate

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.100
all the information
that we could find about it,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.033
um, including information that
we sourced from business owners,

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.534
information that we sourced
from data providers,

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:29.234
information that we'd crawled
from, uh, sites online.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.167
The next logical step to this
was actually to--to offer Places

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.200
as a first-class citizen
within Web Search.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.667
So now you can search for places
directly from Web Search,

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.667
and this was something
that was launched last year,

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:45.834
and this is a reflection
of the gradual evolution

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:48.367
of Places as a concept
within Google's product

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:51.267
to being a first-class citizen,
to being an independent entity

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.734
coming out from
under the wings, if you like,

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.601
of Google Maps.

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.567
And that reached
its logical conclusion

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:00.067
with the launch
of the Google Places mobile app.

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:03.133
Now you can just start
from Places.

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.567
Um, and Places and Maps
are now peers of each other.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.334
You can move interchangeably
between them.

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:11.467
Of course,
in the developer team,

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.000
we realized that places
were important there, too.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.334
And we've built a,

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:19.067
um, a, uh, a popular Maps
developer platform.

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.634
We didn't really have
a strong Places story.

00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.501
So at Google I/O last year,

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.767
we introduced
the Google Places API,

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:28.267
and the goal
of the Google Places API

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.801
was really to try
and capitalize a--

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.767
the development
of a-an ecosystem around--

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:35.400
a developer ecosystem
around Places

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.133
in much the same way
that we had done for Maps.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.934
However, we didn't rush into it.

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:43.267
We took it, uh, we took it easy,

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:46.534
uh, and we started just
by talking to developers

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:49.033
to get a better understanding
of what they needed.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.868
We launched a developer preview
back in July,

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.601
and we spoke to many,
many developers

00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:56.968
about what
their requirements were,

00:04:56.968 --> 00:05:00.567
about what the challenges are
in building location-based apps,

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.467
and what we needed to do
to meet their needs.

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:05.334
Now it was a hugely
valuable exercise.

00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:08.367
We learned an enormous
amount in the process,

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:11.367
um, and we were also
very pleasantly surprised

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.367
by the overwhelming response
from developers.

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:16.000
The downside to this was that
there were many developers

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.267
who we just couldn't accommodate
in the preview,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.267
so if you were in that bucket,
um, I apologize,

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:24.834
but if you, um,
if you did participate,

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.067
we're really grateful for all
the great feedback you provided.

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.167
And for the last
six months or so,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.000
the team has been working hard

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.834
to try and take
all that feedback,

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.501
factor it into the product,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.667
um, and deliver something
that will suit the needs

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.834
of as many developers
as possible.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.200
And really, it's the result
of that effort

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.167
that I want to present
to you today.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.634
So...

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:51.634
first things first.

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:53.634
No more waiting.

00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:55.634
As of the end of today,

00:05:55.634 --> 00:05:58.868
the Google Places API will be
available to every developer.

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:03.434
[applause]

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:05.901
And if you were with us
last year,

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.234
you'll notice a lot of things
have improved,

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.033
a lot of things have changed,

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:13.334
um, and I'm gonna go over some
of that with you right now.

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:15.801
But if you're not familiar
with the Places API,

00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:17.634
let's just start
with the basics.

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:19.467
What is the Google Places API?

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:22.267
Well, at its heart,
it's extremely simple.

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:24.200
You give us a location,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.300
you give us an area
around that location,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.501
a-a radius around that location
to search in,

00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:32.434
we will give you back
up to 20 places that match,

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.934
and these can be addresses.

00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:36.734
They could be points
of interest.

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:39.000
They can be businesses.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.801
So to give you an idea
for why this is valuable,

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:44.801
and to illustrate the value

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:46.801
of some of the other features
we're launching,

00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:48.467
I'm gonna use an example.

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.300
Now I totally
made this example up

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.968
for the purposes
of this presentation.

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:53.634
However, I don't doubt

00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:55.634
that there are applications out
there that are similar to this,

00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.200
so if your application's
a bit like this,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.067
I'm sorry.

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:03.534
Um, consider it, a, uh,
consider it flattery.

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:06.067
So let's suppose I like sport.

00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:07.767
I love sport.

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:10.267
Not actually
participating in sport.

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:12.267
That's--that's too hard. No.

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:14.634
I like watching sport.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.701
Um, and I prefer to watch sport
with friends

00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:21.234
in a bar.

00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:23.067
I'd just like to point out--

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.000
Comic Sans, always the answer.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.467
Right.

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.968
So sports good,
friends good, bar good.

00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:33.501
What I'm really looking for here
is to find that awesomeness

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:35.734
that is the combination
of all three.

00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:39.100
I'm looking for an app
that will help me,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.100
um, help me find places
that are showing games,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.234
help me meet friends there,

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:48.801
um, generally, uh,
find me that awesomeness,

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.434
and so consequently, we'll call
this the AwesomeFinder.

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:54.033
Now there's something--

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.634
there's something not right
about this.

00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:59.634
It's like a Web 2.0
application, this.

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:03.000
Ah, that's better. Okay.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.501
So as any good product manager
will tell you,

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:07.467
you start out with a product
requirements document.

00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:09.367
What do we need?

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:11.200
Well, we need
to find bars nearby

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.534
that are showing games
I want to see,

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:17.000
we need a way of sharing
my plans with my friends,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.634
and I want help choosing,
if I've got many options,

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:24.000
which bar will be the best one
for a given game.

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:31.167
Oh, yeah, and then maybe I have
to make some money as well.

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:34.501
So what do I need to do this?

00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:36.534
Well, I need the name
and location of bars.

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:38.267
Okay, no problem.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.767
Google Places API
at your service. Sorted.

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:43.267
I'm also gonna need the dates
and times of games,

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:45.267
and I'm gonna need
to match up those games

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:47.167
with the bars
that are showing them.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:49.667
Now I could go out there
and try and source this

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.501
from TV companies
or from business owners,

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.100
but I'm just gonna take
the easy option.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.100
I'm gonna crowdsource it.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.601
So this is a photo I took,
uh, just over the weekend,

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.334
of a bar literally opposite

00:08:59.334 --> 00:09:01.400
the hotel I'm staying at
for Google I/O,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.634
so this happens
all the time, everywhere.

00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:06.100
Um, bars advertise what games
they're showing.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.100
I'm not sure
if you can see that.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.100
There's a list of games
at the top.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.501
On the bottom, it says,
"Neighborhood Appreciation Day,

00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:14.534
$1 off draft drinks."

00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:16.934
So you can get
all your friends together,

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:19.534
you can get drunk, and there
goes the neighborhood.

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:21.467
So...

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:26.100
We want to crowdsource
the collection of games--

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.100
of these--these, uh, information
about these sort of listings

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.934
and what--what bars
are showing what,

00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:32.767
um, so how do you do that?

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:35.767
Well, let's say I'm walking down
the street and I see that sign,

00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:39.167
I should be able to go, Hey,
I'm a great lover of this app.

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:40.834
I'm gonna contribute,

00:09:40.834 --> 00:09:43.367
and I'm gonna correlate these,
uh, these games with this place.

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.567
So the first thing I need to do
is identify the bar I'm at,

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.901
and that's where we come
to the check-in.

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.334
Now check-in has
kind of become this, uh,

00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:55.901
this very common notion
over the last year or so,

00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:58.434
um, but it's really
a very simple concept.

00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:00.334
It's just a way
of telling an app

00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:02.701
the place you're currently
located at,

00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.801
in order to--for it
to then offer you

00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.868
you know, opportunities
around that--

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:09.067
sharing it with your friends,
perhaps loyalty offers,

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.801
various other things,
but it's cool.

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.801
The check-in is very simple,
and you're here--

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:16.033
people talk about, uh, you know,
check-in is over and so forth.

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.067
Well, check-in
is just a feature.

00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:20.567
Saying that--saying that
the check-in over--

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:24.367
check-in is over is saying
like the log-in is over, right?

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:28.534
So colors are probably not
helping us a great deal here,

00:10:28.534 --> 00:10:31.534
but what we have here
is, um, a map,

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:33.400
uh, very nearby, actually,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.434
um, and then in the middle here,
we have our location,

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:38.300
and then there's
a-a circle around it

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.300
that is the ambiguity,
if you like,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.667
in my location signal--
the margin of error

00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:45.601
that I'm getting
from my location-based device.

00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.467
So what my phone is saying

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.667
is that I am somewhere
within this circle,

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:52.667
which you can barely see,
but it is there.

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.534
So what we need to do

00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:56.667
to initiate the process
of a check-in

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.501
is perform a Places API search

00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:00.334
for this point with this radius,

00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:02.968
because, essentially, whatever
I need to check into

00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:04.801
should be in that area.

00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:06.634
In fact, just as a tip,

00:11:06.634 --> 00:11:08.634
I would say, if you're building
such an application,

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.300
pad a little,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.801
because one of the, uh, one
of the things you might notice

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:16.300
is that this circle sort of
dissects Del Taco just here,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.300
um, but the actual
point feature of a Del Taco

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.133
is actually outside the circle,

00:11:21.133 --> 00:11:24.501
so, eh, add a little bit
of a margin there.

00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:27.300
So what would the flow look like
for this application?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.834
Well, I would get
a list of places.

00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:31.868
Um, I'd choose one,
I'd check in,

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.968
and then I would be able
to fill in,

00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:37.167
uh, the games that are, uh, that
are being shown at that place.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:40.300
Now the more eagle-eyed of you
will notice

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.434
that this looks like
a real application,

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:44.467
and this looks
like a real application,

00:11:44.467 --> 00:11:47.501
and this looks something like
I knocked up in a text editor,

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:49.300
and you're not wrong.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.133
In fact, what I've got here,

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:53.133
and what you'll see
in a number of screenshots

00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:55.133
over the course
of the next few slides,

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:57.634
is a reference client that
we've built for the Places API--

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.634
we've built one for both
Android and iPhone--

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:02.234
um, that just shows you
the--the core features

00:12:02.234 --> 00:12:04.033
and gives you somewhere
to start,

00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:06.501
and we'll be publishing
the source code for those

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:08.501
as a code sample, um, in the--

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.434
in the not-too-distant future.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.701
Okay.

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.467
However, if you look at--if you
look at the--the list of places

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.334
on this screenshot in detail,
there are some of them

00:12:21.334 --> 00:12:23.601
which are clearly
not gonna be showing sport,

00:12:23.601 --> 00:12:26.434
for example, Britex Fabrics.

00:12:26.434 --> 00:12:30.434
Clearly, when you're looking at
the Google Places application,

00:12:30.434 --> 00:12:32.434
the one that we had--
I mentioned earlier,

00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:34.934
that you have on your phone,
we have no sense

00:12:34.934 --> 00:12:36.934
of what your intent is
in looking for Places,

00:12:36.934 --> 00:12:38.767
but in this
particular application,

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.767
we know exactly what kind
of things you're looking for.

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:42.767
We know you're gonna be
looking for bars,

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:44.501
so why show anything else?

00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.634
Well, we can help you there,

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:49.834
because the Places API
now has a catalog

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.434
of over 100 different types,

00:12:52.434 --> 00:12:55.968
and you can choose one or more
of these types,

00:12:55.968 --> 00:12:59.467
and say, I just want to receive
Places of that type.

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:03.901
Now I'm gonna show you
the impact of this.

00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:06.901
This is a-a search, uh, nearby

00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:08.767
with no type filtering at all,

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:10.734
and you can see
plenty of Places.

00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:13.200
No bars, as it happens,
Switch to bars--just bars.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.701
So it's not that type filtering
actually just removes non-bars.

00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.701
It actually gives you more space
in your results for more bars,

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:21.534
um, and greatly increases
the chances

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:25.367
that the place you need
is gonna be in there.

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:28.634
Okay.

00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:31.133
So sometimes, though,
even that won't cut it.

00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:32.801
If you happen to be somewhere

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.801
where there are just
a lot of bars,

00:13:34.801 --> 00:13:36.467
like Austin, for example,

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:38.501
um, you may still find
that it's not--

00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.467
the Place you need is not
in that set of 20 results,

00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:43.367
so you're gonna have to search.

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:45.801
But searching on mobile phones
is a pain,

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:48.133
especially if you're going
from bar to bar

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.033
when you're doing it.

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:53.033
So we're gonna try and make that
easy for you, so today,

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:55.467
we're introducing a new feature
for the Places API,

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.300
which we call Autocomplete.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.801
Autocomplete is based
on the same technology

00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.367
that drives the, um, feature

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:05.467
on the Google Maps search--
search, um, field,

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:07.634
which, um, offers predictions

00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:10.133
as to the places you're
looking for as you type.

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.100
You can now integrate
that same technology

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.767
into your mobile applications.

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:16.767
You can choose to say, I just
want you to offer me addresses,

00:14:16.767 --> 00:14:19.367
I just want you to offer me
businesses, or--or both,

00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:22.367
and you can also give a hint
as to the location of the user,

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:25.367
um, in order to--
to bias the results.

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:28.367
So let's see
how well this works.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.367
This is exactly where we were
a minute ago.

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:32.534
We were somewhere--ooh, sorry.
Back, back.

00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:34.467
We were somewhere
not far from here,

00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:36.334
um, about here somewhere,

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.267
and this is a list of bars,

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:40.767
but let's say I want
to check into Jillian's.

00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:43.100
Jillian's is a bar just opposite
the Moscone Center,

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.767
if you're not familiar with it.

00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:46.467
It's right over the road,

00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:48.467
and it's conspicuous by its
absence from these results.

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:50.133
So what I did is I took

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:51.968
the Places API
Autocomplete service,

00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:54.133
I gave it, um, this location,
this same location,

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:56.434
based on this map,
and I started typing.

00:14:56.434 --> 00:14:58.868
Well, let's see how far
I need to type.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.934
[humming]

00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:09.234
One,

00:15:09.234 --> 00:15:11.133
two.

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.400
Problem solved.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.901
So...

00:15:15.901 --> 00:15:18.434
if you still can't find
the Place you need

00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:20.400
after you've done that,
the chances are,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.000
we don't have it,
and that does happen sometimes,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.567
because Places data
is continuously changing.

00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:27.601
About 20% of Places we see,

00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:30.267
um, in our index,
change every year,

00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:32.367
and keeping up with changes
in businesses--

00:15:32.367 --> 00:15:34.801
businesses opening, closing,
moving, renaming--

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.634
is one of the biggest challenges

00:15:36.634 --> 00:15:38.734
of managing this kind
of a service,

00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:41.234
but your users are out there,
out and about every day,

00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:43.234
and they will see new Places
very quickly,

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.234
and they will want
to check into them.

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:48.234
In fact, particularly when it
comes to things like bars,

00:15:48.234 --> 00:15:50.734
there's a certain, um,
there's a certain cachet

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:52.567
in knowing about
the hot new bars

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:55.067
and being one of
the first people to go there,

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:56.734
so people will start wanting

00:15:56.734 --> 00:15:58.567
to check into places
really quickly.

00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:00.234
Now it's already possible

00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:03.300
for a user to submit new Places
to Google for Google Maps.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.300
They go into a moderation
pipeline, we check they're okay,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.300
um, and assuming they are,
then they'll get published

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.133
and everybody will benefit,
and that's great.

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:11.801
The problem with check-in apps

00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:13.634
is people want
instant gratification.

00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:16.133
They want to be able
to check into a place

00:16:16.133 --> 00:16:17.801
as soon as they've added it,

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:19.801
and if they are
unable to do that,

00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:21.801
it's more likely that they will
generate more Places,

00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:23.634
and then we'll build
this, um, virtual cycle

00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:25.501
of adding Places
and checking into Places,

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:27.968
so we need to be able
to support that, too.

00:16:27.968 --> 00:16:30.467
So for that reason,
we have a Report service,

00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:35.234
and this allows you
to add new places immediately.

00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:38.734
So you can submit
a new Place to us,

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:41.334
and that new Place will be
reflected in subsequent searches

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.834
made by your application
instantaneously.

00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:47.501
Now at the same time,

00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:50.501
we will take that Place
and we will moderate it,

00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:53.000
and assuming it moderates well,
it will become available

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.200
to all applications
using the Places API.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.734
So you don't have to worry
about other apps

00:16:57.734 --> 00:17:00.234
spamming your app with Places
that you don't want

00:17:00.234 --> 00:17:01.968
or that aren't good,

00:17:01.968 --> 00:17:04.467
um, but at the same time,
all those apps

00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:06.567
that are generating
good data, good content,

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.067
you will benefit
from that use as well.

00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:10.901
We also have a Delete service,

00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:13.901
obviously, so that you can
crowdsource, if you like,

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:16.901
your, uh, your maintenance
of your--of these Places.

00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:19.801
You can, uh, allow your users
to indicate

00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:21.968
whether newly added Places
are good or bad,

00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:24.133
and you can choose
to delete the ones that,

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:28.000
uh, that it seems your users
don't agree with.

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:33.234
So here's just a quick visual
overview of how this works.

00:17:33.234 --> 00:17:35.767
Every Places API application

00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:39.400
has its own little
private set of Places

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.234
that have been added
by its users.

00:17:41.234 --> 00:17:43.234
They get blended in
with your search results

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:45.300
that come from Google Places,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.300
um, and then all those changes
also get passed into moderation

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.634
and then ultimately end up
in Google Places,

00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.634
where they'll appear
not just in the Places API,

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:55.133
but also on Google Maps,
across all the other properties

00:17:55.133 --> 00:17:57.701
that Google has
that exposes Places.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.400
Okay, so we're in good shape.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.501
We have, um, we can implement
the check-in.

00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:09.501
We can collect that information
about the bars that we need

00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:11.667
from users, and the--the games
they're showing.

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:14.734
Um, we can, uh, we can find bars

00:18:14.734 --> 00:18:17.234
if they're not showing up
in our initial search.

00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:19.067
We can add bars
if they're missing.

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:21.567
So now we can move on
to the next step,

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.400
which is, okay,
I'm out and about.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.501
I want to decide where to go.

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.834
So just showing you
what games are around

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:31.501
is relatively straightforward.

00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.501
You have a list
of all the Places

00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:35.501
that people have checked into
and associated,

00:18:35.501 --> 00:18:37.334
um, associated
upcoming games with,

00:18:37.334 --> 00:18:39.334
so you can show those on a map.

00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:41.400
You can also encourage people
to check into bars

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.000
when they arrive
to watch a game,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
not just in order
to add new information

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.501
or new games to that bar.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.200
So you can share that
with friends.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.934
You can see where your friends
are watching games.

00:18:49.934 --> 00:18:51.801
You can plan ahead.

00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:53.701
But it would be good to know,

00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:55.701
you know, if I've got
a few choices,

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.701
where shall I go?
What would be the most fun?

00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:01.400
So what makes a bar fun

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.434
when it comes to watching
a big game?

00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:06.267
And to a large extent,

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:08.100
it's simply the number
of people there.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.767
You want atmosphere.

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:12.300
You want lots of like-minded
people enjoying the game.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.767
So as a general rule,
for the most part,

00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:17.767
the fun of a bar during a game

00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:20.267
is a function of the number
of people watching it

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:22.267
that increases until it gets
to a critical point,

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:23.934
where the bar is so full

00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:25.767
that you can't actually
reach the bar,

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:27.767
and then it begins
to kind of fall off

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.267
until you get to the point
where you can't actually

00:19:30.267 --> 00:19:33.267
reach the bathroom,
and then it's no fun at all.

00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:35.767
So as long as we can keep
on the left-hand side here,

00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:37.434
we'll be in good shape.

00:19:37.434 --> 00:19:39.934
For the most part,
in most cases, um, I think

00:19:39.934 --> 00:19:41.934
popularity of the bar
would be a good indicator

00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.434
of how much fun it is
to be there during that game.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.300
So how do you assess that?

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300
Well, you have the check-ins,
and the check-ins are

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.801
a reflection of the popularity
of that bar.

00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:53.300
You--it's a signal as to
how many people are there,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.968
and check-ins,
generally speaking,

00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:56.634
are a great proxy for that,

00:19:56.634 --> 00:19:59.133
um, both over short periods
of time and longer ones.

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:02.133
So on the left here,
we have a-a couple of mocks

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:04.634
of the kind of check-in activity
you might expect to see

00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:07.133
over the course of a day
at two different venues.

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:08.968
At a coffee shop, you would see,

00:20:08.968 --> 00:20:11.467
you know, a morning spike
as everybody gets their hit,

00:20:11.467 --> 00:20:13.300
and then, uh, another spike
at lunchtime

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.067
that's a little lower,
and then it would

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:17.968
sort of tail off towards the end
of the day.

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.467
At the ballpark, you'd expect
to see nothing for days on end,

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:22.968
and then suddenly, there'll be
a massive rush of check-ins

00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:25.968
when the game starts,
and then it will die away.

00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:28.567
So similarly, we've got
on the right there,

00:20:28.567 --> 00:20:30.400
we've actually got a-a heat map

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.234
that we generated
based on Hotpot ratings

00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:34.734
that were collected in Austin
over the course of a week,

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.400
and that also indicates

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.234
the--the Places that are
most popular.

00:20:38.234 --> 00:20:41.734
This bright sort of patch here
is, uh, 6th Street,

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.567
which, if you've ever
been to Austin,

00:20:43.567 --> 00:20:45.567
is kind of the--the heart
of the downtown,

00:20:45.567 --> 00:20:48.567
um, nightlife area.

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:51.567
Okay, now...

00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:53.567
let's take
this ballpark example,

00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:55.934
um, just because it's such
an extreme case.

00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:59.000
If I am stood
outside the ballpark, at--

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.067
let's take the ballpark here,
in San Francisco, AT&amp;T Park.

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:03.901
I'm stood outside the ballpark

00:21:03.901 --> 00:21:06.801
at about, you know,
10:00 in the morning.

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:09.033
Am I more likely
to check in there

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:12.033
or the coffee shop next door?
Well, probably the coffee shop.

00:21:12.033 --> 00:21:15.400
But if I'm checking in
in the vicinity of the ballpark

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.400
right at the beginning of a big
game, it's far more likely

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.400
that's actually where I want
to check in,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.234
so we should use those signals.

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:24.734
We should use those signals, um,
not just to measure popularity

00:21:24.734 --> 00:21:26.734
but to then influence
the ranking

00:21:26.734 --> 00:21:29.234
of the search results
we give you.

00:21:29.234 --> 00:21:31.734
So we're also enabling you
to do that.

00:21:31.734 --> 00:21:33.868
If you indicate to us

00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:36.033
the Places where your users
are checking in,

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:39.300
we will give you app-specific
personalized reranking

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.901
of your search results
in real time,

00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:43.868
based on the activity
that you're seeing.

00:21:43.868 --> 00:21:46.667
Now I want to stress
that the Places API,

00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:49.567
like all of our Maps API
Web services,

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:51.234
is developer-authenticated,

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:53.734
so we have no knowledge
of the end user here.

00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:55.567
We don't--nor do we ask for it.

00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:57.334
Um, this is app-specific ranking

00:21:57.334 --> 00:21:59.167
based on anonymous
check-in signals

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.667
that you provide us
for this purpose.

00:22:03.601 --> 00:22:05.234
Okay, so that's an overview,

00:22:05.234 --> 00:22:08.834
and I want to just give you
a-a brief recap,

00:22:08.834 --> 00:22:11.534
and if there are, um, two slides

00:22:11.534 --> 00:22:14.534
that I want you to take away
with you from this whole talk,

00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:16.367
it's this one and the next one.

00:22:16.367 --> 00:22:18.167
So four key services--

00:22:18.167 --> 00:22:20.701
Search, Reporting,
Check-ins, and Autocomplete.

00:22:20.701 --> 00:22:22.901
You'll see there,
100,000 requests per day,

00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:24.734
completely free,
to the Search service.

00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:26.400
Um, you can filter by name,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.400
and you can also--
so you can filter by type,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.400
but you can also filter by name
in the Search service,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.434
but it doesn't have the
Autocomplete functionality.

00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:34.067
That's--that's separate,

00:22:34.067 --> 00:22:36.067
and designed deliberately
to be more lightweight,

00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:38.067
and real-time,
check-in-based reranking

00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:40.567
and delete Places instantly,
and also get the benefit

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.567
of all those Places
that are being generated

00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:45.300
that get positively moderated.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.667
Second slide--"Key benefits."

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.934
So what are--what do we feel
are the strengths of this API?

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:53.901
Well, effectively,
the strengths of this API

00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:55.634
are the strengths of Google.

00:22:55.634 --> 00:22:57.567
It's comprehensive.

00:22:57.567 --> 00:23:00.667
We have, um,
detailed good coverage.

00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:04.033
Um, it's accurate.
It's curated. It's moderated.

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:05.801
It's clean.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.701
You won't see
lots of park benches

00:23:07.701 --> 00:23:10.067
and "my mate's house" and...

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:13.868
Um, I was, uh, I was at
South by Southwest in Austin,

00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:16.000
um, a couple of months ago,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.968
and I was stood in a queue
that ran five blocks

00:23:19.968 --> 00:23:23.100
from a party that was sort of
the opening night kickoff

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.100
and as I was stood there,
there was a guy

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.100
who was using
a location-based check-in app

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.267
stood about 10 meters
in front of me.

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:31.367
He was in the process
of adding a Place

00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:33.968
for the queue for the party.

00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:36.968
I turned to the person
I was with and said,

00:23:36.968 --> 00:23:39.567
"This is my data quality
problem, right there."

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:43.334
It's--so it's clean.
It's also fast.

00:23:43.334 --> 00:23:45.801
We sort of take that
for granted at Google,

00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:48.000
um, that everything
has to be fast.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.100
Um, the Maps APIs are known
for their reliability,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.834
and, crucially, it's global.

00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:56.734
This is a-a heat map

00:23:56.734 --> 00:23:59.734
of, um, Place locations
that we've served up,

00:23:59.734 --> 00:24:01.767
um, and you can see--

00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:03.834
if you--when the day
inevitably comes

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:06.267
that you want
to expand your application

00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:09.767
outside these borders,
we are ready and waiting.

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.901
And there's one more thing--

00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:14.968
We have this Web-based Maps API.

00:24:14.968 --> 00:24:16.868
You may have heard of it,

00:24:16.868 --> 00:24:19.467
and we wouldn't want
to leave it out in the cold,

00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:21.367
so we're also launching today

00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:23.200
a set of classes in the Maps API

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.167
to bring the same services
into the Maps API.

00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:27.167
In fact, these services--
the Place Search service

00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:30.100
and the Autocomplete service--
were the very services I used

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.934
to build the demos
that I showed a moment ago.

00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:35.334
Um, so all these features
will be also available

00:24:35.334 --> 00:24:37.534
to Web-based applications.

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:41.834
Right, and that's--
that's the overview from me,

00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:44.234
and now I'd like to, uh, invite,

00:24:44.234 --> 00:24:46.834
uh, a good friend of ours
up to the stage.

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:49.400
Um, so I'll let you
introduce yourself.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.467
This is Seth, and he's gonna
talk a little bit

00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:54.901
about how, um, SCVNGR,
um, his company,

00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:57.133
has benefited from their use
of the Places API.

00:24:57.133 --> 00:24:59.067
Priebatsch: Cool, cool.
Thank you.

00:24:59.067 --> 00:25:01.534
[applause]

00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:05.667
Priebatsch: And hit number 3.

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:07.534
All right, thank you.
Uh, hi, everyone.

00:25:07.534 --> 00:25:09.400
My name's Seth Priebatsch.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.367
I am the Chief Ninja of SCVNGR

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:13.734
and, uh, and I'm on
my last slide already,

00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:17.367
so I have to go backwards.
Uh, hold on a sec.

00:25:20.467 --> 00:25:22.167
Voilà.

00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:25.133
Uh, so I'm just gonna talk
for a couple minutes quickly

00:25:25.133 --> 00:25:27.234
about sort of
a real-world use case.

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.701
We integrated
with the Google Places API

00:25:29.701 --> 00:25:31.868
about five or six months ago

00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:34.067
and have had a phenomenal
experience with it,

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:37.400
and so I'm up here to sort of
sing the praises of it

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.868
and very realistically tell you
about how we took SCVNGR

00:25:40.868 --> 00:25:43.033
from being something
very, very small--

00:25:43.033 --> 00:25:45.634
uh, we actually launched
at Google I/O here last year--

00:25:45.634 --> 00:25:47.334
uh, to something very, very big,

00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:50.300
in large part on the back
of the Google Places API,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.834
letting them do a lot
of heavy lifting for us,

00:25:52.834 --> 00:25:54.734
and it's been--it's been
an awesome experience.

00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:57.100
So first,
very quick background--

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.567
Some of you may
have heard of SCVNGR.

00:25:58.567 --> 00:25:59.934
A lot of you probably haven't,

00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:02.234
so 30 seconds on,
what is SCVNGR?

00:26:02.234 --> 00:26:05.767
SCVNGR is a location-based game,
and it's a very simple game.

00:26:05.767 --> 00:26:08.234
You go places, you do these
things called challenges,

00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:10.100
quick, fun things
to do at Places,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.801
and you can unlock rewards.

00:26:11.801 --> 00:26:13.801
So you can go to a place.
You can check in.

00:26:13.801 --> 00:26:15.801
You can snap a photo.
You can leave a comment.

00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:17.801
You can also create
your own challenges,

00:26:17.801 --> 00:26:19.601
and anyone can build
these challenges,

00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:22.400
so sort of our goal is to create
what we call a game layer

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.934
on top of the world,
where everyone is both building

00:26:24.934 --> 00:26:27.200
and playing this game
at the same time.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.234
And some quick history--
like I mentioned,

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:32.434
we actually launched this
product last year at Google I/O,

00:26:32.434 --> 00:26:34.367
um, with 0 users.

00:26:34.367 --> 00:26:36.868
You know, you sort of always
have to start with 0.

00:26:36.868 --> 00:26:38.868
Six months later, we had
half a million users.

00:26:38.868 --> 00:26:40.934
Three months after that,
we had a million users,

00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:42.667
and somewhere in that period,

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.601
at around the 5-
or 6-month mark,

00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:46.434
we switched to
the Google Places API,

00:26:46.434 --> 00:26:48.434
um, in large part
to get better data

00:26:48.434 --> 00:26:50.968
and to be able to handle
a lot of the load

00:26:50.968 --> 00:26:53.968
that we were coming under,
uh, to make SCVNGR perform

00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:56.033
fast and seamlessly
for our growing user base.

00:26:56.033 --> 00:26:58.601
The Google Places API
is also incredibly reliable,

00:26:58.601 --> 00:27:01.100
and one of the things
I want to talk about

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.667
is that you can use it to build
a great consumer experience.

00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:05.501
We're nearing
a million and a half users

00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:07.167
and growth is accelerating
like mad,

00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:09.167
but you can also build
a really big business,

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:11.167
a meaningful enterprise business
on top of that.

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.667
Uh, we've got
over 3,000 enterprises

00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:16.667
building on SCVNGR, from
Coca-Cola to the Smithsonian

00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:19.734
to Sony to GameStop,
all the way to the U.S. Navy,

00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:23.234
and all of that is relying
on a core Places database,

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:25.601
uh, which is provided
through the Places API

00:27:25.601 --> 00:27:27.734
and through Google Places,
and it is reliable,

00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:29.634
and it's something
that you can get,

00:27:29.634 --> 00:27:31.701
you know, a really big business
and large enterprises

00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:33.667
building off of and supporting.

00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:36.667
One of the recent examples
of load that we came under

00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:38.667
and--and sort of
a beautiful use case

00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:41.667
of being able to get the right
data from the Google Places API

00:27:41.667 --> 00:27:44.033
was a campaign we ran
with Buffalo Wild Wings,

00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:47.000
where, over 6 weeks
at their 700 locations,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.033
180,000 unique people
played SCVNGR, checked in,

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:52.501
did something like
1.2 million challenges,

00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.534
unlocked rewards,
and we didn't have to add

00:27:54.534 --> 00:27:56.767
a single Place to the database.

00:27:56.767 --> 00:27:59.934
There were 0 user places added
for that entire campaign.

00:27:59.934 --> 00:28:03.067
They were all already there
from the Google Places API.

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:05.968
Huge campaign, very successful,
and something that we,

00:28:05.968 --> 00:28:08.968
you know, were able
to kind of provide turnkey,

00:28:08.968 --> 00:28:11.901
just adding our, you know,
our unique secret sauce,

00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:15.400
the SCVNGR game mechanics,
and building off of

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.434
the infrastructure
from Google Places.

00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:21.033
So enough background on, uh,
on--on SCVNGR.

00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:23.534
Uh, you know, the interesting
thing that we want to talk about

00:28:23.534 --> 00:28:26.534
is what Google Places let us do,
and where I really want

00:28:26.534 --> 00:28:29.033
to take this is from sort of
the core of what SCVNGR is,

00:28:29.033 --> 00:28:30.701
which is our mission.

00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:32.701
Our mission was to build
the game layer

00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:35.200
on top of the world,
and to do that, we needed

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.200
a couple pre-requisites, right?
We needed game mechanics.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.234
Cool, uh, we could
figure that out on our own.

00:28:39.234 --> 00:28:41.701
We needed a game platform,
we needed players and builders,

00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:44.200
and we needed to be able
to connect them to places.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.501
We needed to be able
to connect them to the world,

00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:49.000
and so we went on this big quest
for the world,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and that's the quest that
eventually led us

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
to Google Places
and to the Places API,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.701
and if you're looking to connect
people to the world,

00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:57.534
and, of course here,
by "the world,"

00:28:57.534 --> 00:28:59.534
I mean something
a little bit more specific

00:28:59.534 --> 00:29:01.267
than just everything
that's around us.

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:03.267
I mean having the knowledge
to connect people

00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:05.767
to the places that matter.
You have a couple options.

00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:07.701
We thought about
building it ourselves.

00:29:07.701 --> 00:29:09.534
We thought about, you know,
asking our users

00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:12.067
to create these Places for us,
to crowdsource them,

00:29:12.067 --> 00:29:14.534
to scrape it from the Web,
to do whatever we could

00:29:14.534 --> 00:29:16.367
to try and get
a good Place database.

00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:18.868
We looked at SimpleGeo,
and we spent a lot of time

00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:20.868
working with those guys,
and they actually have

00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:22.868
some really interesting things
that we're working on,

00:29:22.868 --> 00:29:24.534
uh, that they're working on.

00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:27.467
We ended up working initially
with GeoAPI when we launched.

00:29:27.467 --> 00:29:29.934
We did not launch
with the Google Places API,

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:31.801
and later did
a transition to that.

00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:33.968
GeoAPI later became
part of Twitter.

00:29:33.968 --> 00:29:37.000
Um, it has now been shut down,
and we actually--

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.534
we did the transition
several months before they--

00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:41.367
they deprecated the API,

00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:43.868
but one of the interesting parts
of doing this transition

00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:46.400
is we were sort of
in a unique position

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.033
to do some real comparison

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:50.601
between two relatively
full-featured Places databases,

00:29:50.601 --> 00:29:54.033
and I'll give some data on what
that looked like afterwards.

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.767
Um, and then there's also
the Facebook Places API, which,

00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:59.467
if you guys are interested
in location-based services,

00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:01.534
you've probably spent
some time looking at.

00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:03.534
And the reason why
we ended up transitioning

00:30:03.534 --> 00:30:06.534
to the Google Places API
over the Facebook Places API

00:30:06.534 --> 00:30:09.534
is that, um, you know,
aside from quality of data

00:30:09.534 --> 00:30:12.033
and some other reasons
I'll go through in a second,

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:14.701
one of the big restrictions
on the Facebook Places API

00:30:14.701 --> 00:30:17.834
is that to make any requests,
it is all user-authenticated.

00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:19.601
Um, and as Thor
was mentioning earlier,

00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:22.033
uh, Google Places
is developer-authenticated,

00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:24.534
so you can have, a, you know, an
app and you can get the Places

00:30:24.534 --> 00:30:26.534
and you can bring them
into your app

00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.534
and do whatever you want,
and protect user privacy

00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:31.033
and enable your users to have
a clean and safe experience.

00:30:31.033 --> 00:30:32.868
With the Facebook Places API,

00:30:32.868 --> 00:30:35.000
all queries have to be
authenticated by the user,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.267
and that was something that we
just weren't able to implement,

00:30:38.267 --> 00:30:41.667
and so we made the decision
about five or six months ago

00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:43.601
to transition
to the Google Places API

00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:46.601
for, sort of, these five
big reasons.

00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:48.434
One is, you know,
breadth of data.

00:30:48.434 --> 00:30:50.767
There's a huge amount of data
on the Google Places API.

00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:52.767
It's all over--I mean,
it's all over the States.

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:54.434
It's all over the world.

00:30:54.434 --> 00:30:56.267
You know, Places that you--
that you want your users

00:30:56.267 --> 00:30:58.267
to be able to use your app,
it's there.

00:30:58.267 --> 00:31:00.267
There's a tremendous amount
of depth of data.

00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:02.200
Most of our activity
happens in big cities,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200
so we don't just want
lots of data everywhere.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.200
We want the right data. We want
to be able to dig in deep.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.000
We found that
with the Places API.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.601
Quality of data is phenomenal.

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.601
If you've got the Place,
you also want to be able

00:31:11.601 --> 00:31:13.601
to get the phone number. You
want to be able to get the URL.

00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:15.200
You want to have
the right address.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.501
You want to be able to link to
places that might have reviews.

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:19.501
All of that comes standard
with the Places API,

00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:21.501
and it's been really valuable
for us.

00:31:21.501 --> 00:31:24.501
Speed &amp; reliability
is--is super key.

00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:26.200
We've got a lot of people

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.834
hitting our servers
all the time.

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:30.000
The Google Places API
returns quickly.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.734
It returns reliably.

00:31:31.734 --> 00:31:34.734
We haven't had a single issue,
and we work with lots of APIs,

00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:37.734
which are, you know, some are
more reliable than others.

00:31:37.734 --> 00:31:40.734
and so we're very happy with
both the speed and reliability

00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:43.234
and consistency of all of that,
and also the road map

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.734
that Thor and his team
are taking this thing down.

00:31:45.734 --> 00:31:47.567
They've started adding
great categorization,

00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:49.567
some of the things
they talked about today--

00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:52.567
just really interesting
features, which make our jobs,

00:31:52.567 --> 00:31:54.400
as location-based app
developers, much, much easier,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
enable us to focus
on what we're good at,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.234
the unique component
that we provide.

00:31:58.234 --> 00:32:00.734
In our case, game mechanics.
In your case, it might be

00:32:00.734 --> 00:32:03.300
enabling you to help, you know,
find your friends at bars,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.133
but focus on what you're good at

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:07.734
and outsource a lot of
the hard work to the Places API,

00:32:07.734 --> 00:32:10.601
and so the future improvements
are a key part of it.

00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:13.501
And the last slide
I want to sort of go through

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:15.734
is some of the results
we saw for this.

00:32:15.734 --> 00:32:17.434
After we did the transition,

00:32:17.434 --> 00:32:20.667
we had a 41% decrease in
"frustrated" location queries,

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:23.000
and this concept of
a "frustrated" location query

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.033
is one that we developed to try
and figure out how to judge

00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:29.033
how our users are interacting
with the Places we've got.

00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:30.701
When you load up SCVNGR,

00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:32.567
it's gonna show you
Places around you,

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:34.567
and if you find
the place that you want,

00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:36.234
you're gonna click on it
immediately.

00:32:36.234 --> 00:32:38.734
If you don't, you're gonna
have to either load more

00:32:38.734 --> 00:32:41.234
or do a search, or do something
to try and find that Place,

00:32:41.234 --> 00:32:43.267
and we define that
as a "frustrated" user,

00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:44.968
someone who opened up the app

00:32:44.968 --> 00:32:46.968
and did not get
what they want immediately.

00:32:46.968 --> 00:32:49.467
And the number of people
who opened up the app

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.467
and did get what they want
immediately increased hugely,

00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:53.133
and the number of people

00:32:53.133 --> 00:32:56.167
who had to actually do
those searches dropped by 41%.

00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:58.834
Um, and this is
kind of an abstract term

00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:00.667
to keep track of,
a "frustrated" query,

00:33:00.667 --> 00:33:02.400
but it's really important

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.234
if you're building
a location-based service

00:33:04.234 --> 00:33:06.767
that when they open your app,
that the Place they want,

00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:08.734
that the Place they're at
is there immediately,

00:33:08.734 --> 00:33:11.734
and dropping that frustration
by 41% was huge for us.

00:33:11.734 --> 00:33:14.234
Second is that the Places added
per thousand queries

00:33:14.234 --> 00:33:15.901
dropped by almost threefold,

00:33:15.901 --> 00:33:18.400
and this is how we keep track
of the quality of our database.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.067
You know,
over a thousand queries,

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:22.067
a thousand people opening up
their phone and saying,

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:23.901
"Hey, show me
the places around me."

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:26.400
How many of them
have to actually add a place?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.234
And it dropped from 60 to 22

00:33:28.234 --> 00:33:30.067
after we transitioned
to the Places API.

00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:31.834
Again, a huge increase

00:33:31.834 --> 00:33:34.834
in just basically quality of
interaction for our consumers.

00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:38.567
There was a 62% drop in reports
of incorrect Place info.

00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:41.567
You know, this Place is here,
but the address is wrong,

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:43.567
the phone is wrong,
the Web site is wrong,

00:33:43.567 --> 00:33:45.567
you know, something
about this place is wrong.

00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:47.567
It's just a much higher
quality data set,

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:50.067
and something that we've been
able to now help in improving

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:53.067
through some of the things
that Thor mentioned as well.

00:33:53.067 --> 00:33:56.067
And, of course, international
expansion comes standard.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.067
We are only U.S.-focused
at the moment,

00:33:58.067 --> 00:33:59.901
but when we're ready
to go international,

00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:01.634
when you guys are building apps

00:34:01.634 --> 00:34:03.300
and are ready
to go international,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.801
obviously, the Google Places API
has huge support for that,

00:34:05.801 --> 00:34:07.801
and that's one of the things
that we found

00:34:07.801 --> 00:34:10.300
in other location databases--
it's just hard to come by,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.133
so a really, really great asset.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:15.167
And the final one, which has
just been wonderful for us,

00:34:15.167 --> 00:34:17.434
in working with lots
and lots of different APIs--

00:34:17.434 --> 00:34:19.234
it's been up all the time.

00:34:19.234 --> 00:34:21.300
It's been fast.
It's been reliable.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.300
We haven't had any issues,
and if you're building,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.300
you know, a key part
of your infrastructure,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.133
and if you're building
a location-based app,

00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:29.434
you know locations
are as key as it gets.

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.434
Having it be up all the time
is really, really critical.

00:34:32.434 --> 00:34:34.434
So that's sort of my quick
use case story

00:34:34.434 --> 00:34:36.434
on the Google Places API,
and I'll pass it

00:34:36.434 --> 00:34:38.434
back to Thor now,
but thank you for your time,

00:34:38.434 --> 00:34:40.934
and have fun building
with the API.

00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:43.868
[applause]

00:34:46.934 --> 00:34:49.367
Mitchell: Thank you, Seth.

00:34:54.434 --> 00:34:56.934
Okay.

00:34:56.934 --> 00:34:59.067
So that's all well and good.

00:34:59.067 --> 00:35:00.834
How do you get started?

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:02.801
So we have a bunch
of documentation

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:05.033
that, uh, that's been posted.

00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:08.334
You can go to, uh,
code.google.com,

00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:10.400
obviously, is where Google keeps
all its API documentation,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.367
and the Places API
is no exception.

00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.300
There's separate documentation
for the Places features

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.801
I mentioned that are also
coming to the JavaScript API.

00:35:16.801 --> 00:35:18.801
If you're not a big fan
of long URLs,

00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:21.133
I'm sure your search engine
of choice can help.

00:35:21.133 --> 00:35:24.634
If you need to--if you want to
sign up to use the Places API,

00:35:24.634 --> 00:35:27.100
you'll need to get
a Google APIs console key.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.300
Now if you've used
any of the existing

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.300
Maps API Web services,
um, this will be new to you.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.968
The Google APIs Console

00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:36.467
was a service that launched
a couple of months ago,

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:39.567
um, that is a sort of
a dashboard for API use,

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:41.667
all in the manner of APIs
that Google offers.

00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:44.400
It's a really nice, tidy way
to look at, uh,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.901
to manage your use
of the service,

00:35:46.901 --> 00:35:50.934
to manage your keys, to check
your usage, and so forth.

00:35:50.934 --> 00:35:54.000
Um, and then I encourage you
to go to our follow-up session.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
As you can tell, this is more of
a broad overview of the service,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.834
and I'm sure many of you

00:35:58.834 --> 00:36:00.934
want to get stuck into
the nitty-gritty details.

00:36:00.934 --> 00:36:04.000
So the tech lead, the lead
engineer for the Places API,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.334
will be presenting a session
tomorrow at 3:00 P.M.

00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:07.801
It's entitled

00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:09.801
"Location Based App Development
Using Google APIs,"

00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:11.801
and it's essentially
just going right into the,

00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:15.567
uh, the thick of using
the Places API.

00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:18.367
Okay, so, uh, you'll start
to see these

00:36:18.367 --> 00:36:20.534
as you go through I/O sessions.

00:36:20.534 --> 00:36:23.601
We have a, uh, feedback pages
set up for every session,

00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:25.868
and we'd love to--
to get your thoughts

00:36:25.868 --> 00:36:28.734
on how you feel, uh, whether
you feel this was useful.

00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:32.167
We also have hash tags for each
of the tracks at I/O this year,

00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:34.667
um, so feel free to use those.

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:38.567
And with that,
um, we'll start with Q&amp;A,

00:36:38.567 --> 00:36:40.934
and, Seth, you want to join us?

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:46.434
[applause]

00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:52.501
Mitchell: [laughs)]

00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:54.968
Priebatsch:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:36:54.968 --> 00:36:56.667
Mitchell: Yes.

00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:59.801
man: So, um, we do a lot
with location-based,

00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:02.834
and what we're noticing
is that the young kids--

00:37:02.834 --> 00:37:04.868
they're constantly
really excited

00:37:04.868 --> 00:37:06.734
about sharing their location,

00:37:06.734 --> 00:37:08.734
and I'm seeing,
like, the younger generation,

00:37:08.734 --> 00:37:10.567
they're not worried
about privacy as much,

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:12.400
and they're really out there.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.901
Like, me, I want people to know
where I am at all times

00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:16.901
so they can always
get in contact with me,

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.567
and I'm wondering--

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:20.567
do you see, like, the younger
generations coming up--

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.234
they're not worried
about privacy,

00:37:22.234 --> 00:37:23.901
they're really out there,

00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:25.834
they really want to have
the connectivity,

00:37:25.834 --> 00:37:28.033
and just, you know,
just really engaging?

00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:30.167
Mitchell: Do you want to--
Priebatsch: Sure.

00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:33.100
So I-I think that
what we're starting to see

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.400
is--is that, you know,
across all ages

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.234
and all demographics
and everything,

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:39.234
people do want
to be connected to places.

00:37:39.234 --> 00:37:42.167
You know, when people, um, spent
a lot of time at places,

00:37:42.167 --> 00:37:44.667
there are places that they love,
and every different group

00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:47.634
has important places they want
to connect--be connected to.

00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:49.634
Some people love museums.
Some people like bars.

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.634
Some people want
to hang out at malls,

00:37:51.634 --> 00:37:53.701
and so we're seeing
a general trend

00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:56.667
that more and more people want
to use these types of services,

00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:59.501
and I would agree with you
in sort of a broad overview,

00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:03.400
that, um, you know, the younger
generations are more bold

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.434
about sharing information
into a digital world.

00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:08.767
But even then, you still
want to be careful

00:38:08.767 --> 00:38:10.634
to, you know, protect privacy,

00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:12.767
and I think that in many ways,

00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:14.834
some of the things we talked
about earlier,

00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.667
about being able to proxy that
through a developer key

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:19.667
and then give users control
over--Hey, I do want

00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:22.167
to share this data, and I know
who I'm sharing it with,

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:24.667
um, and people will get more
and more comfortable with that

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.501
as they get more
and more educated,

00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:29.133
but still a valid concern
for lots of people out there.

00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:31.334
Mitchell: I also think
it's beholden on us

00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:33.167
who work in this industry,

00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:35.100
and who are aware
of the consequences

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.300
of, you know, privacy leaks
or, um, and the sort of--

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.801
just the longevity
of information online,

00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:44.033
to protect people not only
from concerns now,

00:38:44.033 --> 00:38:46.133
but concerns
they may have later.

00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:49.801
So their--their feelings about
privacy may change over time,

00:38:49.801 --> 00:38:52.267
so it's important
that we sort of optimize

00:38:52.267 --> 00:38:54.734
for, you know, the worst case,
if you like.

00:38:54.734 --> 00:38:57.467
man: Loved the talk.
Mitchell: Thank you.

00:38:57.467 --> 00:39:00.467
man: Can you talk a little bit
more in detail

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.367
about the moderation process

00:39:02.367 --> 00:39:06.367
and how Places will eventually
get selected into it or not?

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:09.834
Mitchell: Yeah, um...

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:12.968
yeah, if you could,
that'd be great. [chuckles]

00:39:16.534 --> 00:39:18.400
Mitchell: This is
Jen Fitzpatrick,

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.567
who's a V.P.
at Google on local.

00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:22.901
Fitzpatrick: Hi, everybody. So,
yeah, the moderation process.

00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:26.133
Um, so we put a lot of effort

00:39:26.133 --> 00:39:28.934
into trying to make sure
that the Places that we,

00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:31.234
uh, the Places that we surface

00:39:31.234 --> 00:39:34.067
are actually, uh,
legitimate businesses--

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:37.267
are places in the real world,
uh, right?

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.100
Um, and so we have
a variety of means

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.934
that we use to do
that verification,

00:39:40.934 --> 00:39:44.501
um, everything from, sort of
using, you know, using humans

00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:47.000
to actually, you know, sort of
verify that the business exists

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.667
to, um, sort of corroborating,

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:51.167
you know, sort of other data
from across the Web,

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:53.667
um, and basically looking at
all the signals that we can

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:55.501
to try to essentially
verify that--

00:39:55.501 --> 00:39:58.801
that both the existence of
a place, um, is, in fact, real,

00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:02.000
um, and that the data that
we have about it is correct.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.501
man: Is there any SLA,
in terms of, like,

00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:07.000
you know, if you add a place in
and it is valid,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.501
that within 30 days, you'd
probably see it come in,

00:40:09.501 --> 00:40:11.167
or a week, or...

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:13.167
Fitzpatrick: We don't currently
have an official SLA.

00:40:13.167 --> 00:40:15.000
We're obviously looking
to make that turnaround

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
as fast as possible,
but there's not a--

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.267
there's not an official SLA
at this point.

00:40:18.267 --> 00:40:20.934
man: Thank you.

00:40:20.934 --> 00:40:23.567
man: So Places
or location-based services

00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:25.601
work great when I'm in
my home country.

00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:28.701
But when I am traveling,
the data charges are exorbitant,

00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:32.200
like, $20 a megabyte,
and I can't really use

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.534
the Places and these apps
when I'm traveling,

00:40:34.534 --> 00:40:37.033
and many people do that
for vacations and business.

00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:39.534
So we're trying to solve
the problem with an app,

00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:41.767
um, and the only way we had--

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:44.567
uh, to have the top Places
made available offline,

00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:46.701
that they can synchronize
and take it with them,

00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:48.267
uh, for cities,

00:40:48.267 --> 00:40:51.267
and the only way we had so far
was to build it ourselves,

00:40:51.267 --> 00:40:54.267
and pretty much like what you
had on your list on the top.

00:40:54.267 --> 00:40:57.267
So how can this new API help us
automate some of that

00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.100
and take some of the subset of--

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.434
like a Most Popular Places
offline with me

00:41:02.434 --> 00:41:05.434
for specific cities
that I'm traveling to?

00:41:05.434 --> 00:41:09.234
Mitchell: So the API
as it's currently designed

00:41:09.234 --> 00:41:11.534
is certainly very focused on,

00:41:11.534 --> 00:41:15.234
um, finding places near a user
at that moment in time.

00:41:15.234 --> 00:41:17.834
Um, we don't really have
a model for saying,

00:41:17.834 --> 00:41:20.901
um, can I precache
all the Places information

00:41:20.901 --> 00:41:24.000
in a certain area,
um, and there are, you know,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.868
some sort of
licensing complexities

00:41:25.868 --> 00:41:27.534
around doing that.

00:41:27.534 --> 00:41:30.501
We do allow sort of
a limited amount of caching

00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:32.100
for performance reasons,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.300
um, and, you know, you can
refresh cache data,

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.501
um, but it needs to be--

00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:42.601
it needs to be data
that was originally requested

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:45.834
relating to a real user query,

00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:48.467
rather than sort of
an offline operation.

00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:51.501
So, you know, in truth, I would
say it's not a use case

00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:53.534
that we are able
to cater to right now.

00:41:53.534 --> 00:41:55.267
man: Okay.
Mitchell: But this is

00:41:55.267 --> 00:41:57.267
the kind of feedback
that's very valuable,

00:41:57.267 --> 00:41:59.434
so, um, one thing
I should have mentioned

00:41:59.434 --> 00:42:02.634
is we do have a, uh,
an issue tracker,

00:42:02.634 --> 00:42:06.534
where you can go and report any
concerns you have for the API

00:42:06.534 --> 00:42:08.367
but also request features.

00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:11.300
man: But in the meantime,
uh, caching that locally

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.300
in our own database
and building our own app--

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.534
that may not be allowed
by licensing,

00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:18.267
and so the only option
is to build our own

00:42:18.267 --> 00:42:21.501
popular Places database
for taking it with you?

00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.501
Mitchell: [chuckles)
Brian sat up there.

00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:25.200
Do you have something to say?

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.901
man: The answer
is basically yes.

00:42:27.901 --> 00:42:30.234
man: All right, thanks.
Thank you.

00:42:30.234 --> 00:42:34.000
man: Hi. Um, one of the problems
I run across as a user

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.167
is when I go
to check into a Place,

00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:39.634
and there's a bunch
of user-created events,

00:42:39.634 --> 00:42:42.133
like for when I have
Movies in the Park,

00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:44.634
you'll go and you might see
a Movies in the Park.

00:42:44.634 --> 00:42:46.467
You might see this park name.

00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:48.334
Is there any plans in the future

00:42:48.334 --> 00:42:50.868
to separate events from Places

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:54.467
or allow you to check into
an event at a Place,

00:42:54.467 --> 00:42:58.000
or, um, without creating
ten different things,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.300
like today, when I checked
into Google I/O,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.834
but it's also
the Moscone Center.

00:43:02.834 --> 00:43:07.167
And--and how do you deal
with events at a location?

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:09.567
Mitchell: So the short answer
is yes.

00:43:09.567 --> 00:43:13.200
Um, we thought about this
at great length, actually.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.801
I mean, one of the benefits of
the developer preview we've had,

00:43:16.801 --> 00:43:18.767
um, and also
looking at, you know,

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:21.267
a lot of the popular sort of
location-based apps out there,

00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:23.267
is we can get a very clear sense

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:25.767
of the way people are likely
to use these types of apps

00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:27.868
and how that will
impact the service,

00:43:27.868 --> 00:43:31.968
and clearly, events, you know,
are a-a big part of that.

00:43:31.968 --> 00:43:35.767
One of the--the things
we, um, we toyed with

00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:38.300
was, well, is an event
just a type of place?

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.334
You know, is it just
a type of place

00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:42.133
that has an expiring date on it?

00:43:42.133 --> 00:43:43.934
And we decided, ultimately,
that no, it's not.

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:45.934
An event is actually
a property of a place,

00:43:45.934 --> 00:43:48.567
and consequently, we needed,
in order to do this right,

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:51.334
we needed sort of
an extra layer of features

00:43:51.334 --> 00:43:53.200
on top of
the existing Places API,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.067
where you can attach
events to places,

00:43:55.067 --> 00:43:57.100
you can check into events,
and so forth.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.100
So that's something that
we actively planned to do,

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.167
but we, um, it's not something
we were able to get done

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:04.033
um, right now, in time.

00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.767
man: Thank you.

00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:08.868
man: So at--you started
your presentation

00:44:08.868 --> 00:44:11.067
speaking about the granularity

00:44:11.067 --> 00:44:13.701
of search return, uh, results,

00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:16.667
talking about Moscone Theater
in San Francisco.

00:44:16.667 --> 00:44:19.033
Um, taking that example further,

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:20.968
uh, we're here in Room 8.

00:44:20.968 --> 00:44:24.000
If I was to do a search
on Room 8,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
you know, it needs to be
in the context

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.767
that I'm here at this event,
um, but further to that,

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:34.033
the returned result would be
in this area on Google Maps,

00:44:34.033 --> 00:44:36.334
but is there any plans
to take that further,

00:44:36.334 --> 00:44:38.133
to perhaps step inside
the building

00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:41.834
and demonstrate where we are
or where--where the--

00:44:41.834 --> 00:44:44.834
where we should go for Room 8
within this conference?

00:44:44.834 --> 00:44:47.100
Mitchell: Do you mean
from a mapping perspective

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.734
or from a check-in perspective?

00:44:48.734 --> 00:44:50.767
man: Yeah, from--so--
from the mapping perspective,

00:44:50.767 --> 00:44:54.267
to visually demonstrate
to the user,

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:57.000
um, or do we--should we build
custom layers

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.734
when--when that occurs,

00:44:58.734 --> 00:45:00.834
or what's the best practice
for that?

00:45:00.834 --> 00:45:03.367
Fitzpatrick: We don't currently
have plans along those lines,

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.367
but it's a great idea.
[chuckles]

00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:07.767
man: Thank you.

00:45:07.767 --> 00:45:09.701
man: I just want to thank you

00:45:09.701 --> 00:45:12.367
for releasing the Places API
for us all to use.

00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:14.501
It's really great,
and I'm really excited

00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:16.868
to see the focus
on Autocomplete.

00:45:16.868 --> 00:45:20.434
Um, for--for Web users,
sometimes the easiest way

00:45:20.434 --> 00:45:23.601
to bias a search result
for Autocomplete

00:45:23.601 --> 00:45:25.434
is to use their I.P. address.

00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:28.734
Is that going to be an option
that we--that we can use

00:45:28.734 --> 00:45:31.367
to bias, uh, Autocompletes?

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:33.501
Mitchell: Um--
man: And location searches?

00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:35.434
Mitchell: Right now,

00:45:35.434 --> 00:45:37.701
the service doesn't
automatically support that.

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:41.300
Um, I'm trying to think
whether there is--

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.968
I know that we
previously had a, um,

00:45:43.968 --> 00:45:46.801
uh, I think Gears--

00:45:46.801 --> 00:45:50.467
Google Gears had an I.P.-based
geolocation service,

00:45:50.467 --> 00:45:52.767
but I'm not sure whether
we still have that.

00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:54.601
Um, no. I'm being told

00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:57.434
by more learned minds
than my own that we do not.

00:45:57.434 --> 00:46:01.334
I think, in truth, that, uh,
that is the right abstraction.

00:46:01.334 --> 00:46:04.400
I'm not sure I would want to put
that specifically into this API.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.901
I think it's more useful
to be able to say,

00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:08.901
for a given I.P.,
have the location,

00:46:08.901 --> 00:46:11.400
and then you can use that
in many different Places.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.901
So, you know, that's something
that we can look into.

00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:15.901
man: Okay, thank you.

00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:18.601
man: Is there
a "Natural Features" category?

00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:21.501
I'm thinking of a use
in a botanical garden

00:46:21.501 --> 00:46:23.667
or arboretum.
Mitchell: Yes, there is.

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:26.968
Yeah. I would--in the interests
of full disclosure,

00:46:26.968 --> 00:46:29.868
I would say that it's mostly
large-scale features right now.

00:46:29.868 --> 00:46:32.701
Um, you know, uh, parks--
sort of national parks

00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:35.067
and volcanoes
and things like that.

00:46:35.067 --> 00:46:38.334
but, um, you know, the nature
of the category theme

00:46:38.334 --> 00:46:40.834
is that you can add Places
and you can--

00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:43.033
any Place that you add,
you can tag with one

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:46.067
of our existing categories,
and you can send--

00:46:46.067 --> 00:46:49.400
man: And how would moderation
fit in that category?

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.534
Mitchell: You know, I doubt
we had to face that... [laughs]

00:46:52.534 --> 00:46:56.367
um, until now, so I'm not sure,
in all honesty.

00:46:56.367 --> 00:46:59.934
Um, but, yeah, I-I will--
I'll be interested to see.

00:46:59.934 --> 00:47:01.934
[chuckles]

00:47:01.934 --> 00:47:04.434
man: Hi, thanks for doin' this.
It was informative.

00:47:04.434 --> 00:47:07.534
Um, simple question--
Support for GAPE?

00:47:07.534 --> 00:47:09.334
Mitchell: For--

00:47:09.334 --> 00:47:12.901
man: Google Apps
for the enterprise.

00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:16.667
Mitchell: So this is integrated
into App Engine, or...

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:19.367
man: No, integrated
with signing in

00:47:19.367 --> 00:47:22.701
from your enterprise account,
as opposed to GMAIL.

00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:24.567
Mitchell: Oh, I see.

00:47:24.567 --> 00:47:26.601
So, um, the authentication
scheme we use

00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:29.067
is tied into
the Google APIs Console,

00:47:29.067 --> 00:47:32.834
so, uh, essentially, the way
the Google APIs Console works,

00:47:32.834 --> 00:47:34.534
if you're not familiar with it,

00:47:34.534 --> 00:47:37.033
is that when you log in
for the first time,

00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:38.801
you can create projects,

00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:41.300
um, and each project has a key
associated with it.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.934
And any given project
can have multiple owners,

00:47:43.934 --> 00:47:46.801
so you can associate
multiple Google accounts

00:47:46.801 --> 00:47:49.300
with a given project, so that
projects don't get orphaned

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.234
if one person's,
um, not available.

00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:53.234
I'm not actually sure,

00:47:53.234 --> 00:47:56.300
um, what the, uh, Google Apps
account integration

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.133
into Google APIs Console is,

00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:00.133
but it's something I'll be happy
to look into for you.

00:48:00.133 --> 00:48:02.300
man: Well, I think my--so--
I'm pretty sure

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.834
you can't check in from
an enterprise account today,

00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:09.100
so forward--
Mitchell: Sorry, you mean a--

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.601
man: Using a latitude,
let's say.

00:48:11.601 --> 00:48:13.334
Mitchell: Right.

00:48:13.334 --> 00:48:16.167
man: So where's that
on the road map for people

00:48:16.167 --> 00:48:19.734
that primarily use Google
from an enterprise perspective?

00:48:19.734 --> 00:48:22.067
Mitchell: It's worth--it's worth
me stressing, actually,

00:48:22.067 --> 00:48:24.567
that the check-in service
as part of the Places API

00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:26.968
is just this anonymous,
um, reranking model.

00:48:26.968 --> 00:48:28.634
man: Okay.

00:48:28.634 --> 00:48:30.634
Mitchell: It's totally unrelated
to the check-in feature

00:48:30.634 --> 00:48:32.634
that's now part of Latitude
and Google Maps.

00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:34.467
man: Oh, it's totally separate.
Okay.

00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:38.467
Mitchell: Yeah. So, um,
but I know that there--

00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:41.033
that there has been,
you know, interest expressed

00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:44.367
in, um, enterprise features
for Latitude.

00:48:44.367 --> 00:48:47.868
It's not something that I am,
you know, am fully aware of,

00:48:47.868 --> 00:48:49.934
but I know there's--
there's interest in it.

00:48:49.934 --> 00:48:53.434
So if it would help,
I can probably connect you

00:48:53.434 --> 00:48:55.868
with the right people to ask.
man: Okay, thanks. Okay.

00:48:55.868 --> 00:48:58.767
man: Uh, related
to the earlier point

00:48:58.767 --> 00:49:01.667
that 20% of the Places
in the database,

00:49:01.667 --> 00:49:03.634
uh, change every year--

00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:07.501
Is there any thought been put
to making the API queriable

00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:09.701
from a historical perspective,

00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:12.567
so where you would provide
a date as a parameter

00:49:12.567 --> 00:49:17.067
and sort of get what was
around at that time?

00:49:17.067 --> 00:49:19.400
Fitzpatrick: As far as I know,
it's not something we've, uh,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.000
it's not something
we've looked at.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.267
Mitchell: Yeah,
but I like the idea. [laughs]

00:49:23.267 --> 00:49:25.534
So I would say log it
as a feature request.

00:49:25.534 --> 00:49:27.467
It's certainly interesting.

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:34.167
man: Okay, I've seen
the premier version of the API.

00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:36.801
What are the advantages
of this premier version,

00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:39.234
and are there any limitations
to the free version?

00:49:39.234 --> 00:49:42.300
Mitchell: So the Google Maps API
in general,

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.834
the overall family of products,
has a premier version,

00:49:44.834 --> 00:49:46.868
which is an enterprise version,

00:49:46.868 --> 00:49:50.300
and Maps API Premier
has a number of advantages,

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.467
including broader
licensing rights, for example,

00:49:53.467 --> 00:49:57.000
using use on the Internet
or in for-fee applications,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.434
also higher quotas on geocoding
and directions,

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:01.901
and, uh, and elevation.

00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:06.100
Um, and right now, however,

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.200
the Google Places API is,

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.067
uh, although we're now making it
available to everybody,

00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:13.067
it's still considered to be
in Google Code Labs,

00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:15.033
um, which is sort of
the initial stage

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:16.834
that an API goes through,

00:50:16.834 --> 00:50:18.667
where it's still being
developed and evolving,

00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:21.133
and we need some flexibility
just to adapt to feedback.

00:50:21.133 --> 00:50:23.133
Um, as a general rule,

00:50:23.133 --> 00:50:25.400
Labs APIs are not included
in Premier

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.334
because enterprise customers
have much stronger

00:50:28.334 --> 00:50:31.534
backward compatibility
expectations on an API,

00:50:31.534 --> 00:50:34.067
so, um, what
we anticipate happening

00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:36.167
is that the Places API
will graduate from Labs

00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:38.367
um, you know, in
the not-too-distant future,

00:50:38.367 --> 00:50:40.400
once we've, you know,
we're comfortable with it,

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.133
it fits everybody's needs,

00:50:42.133 --> 00:50:44.334
and then it will be integrated
into Maps API Premier.

00:50:44.334 --> 00:50:46.501
Um, and until we get
to that point,

00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:49.234
I couldn't say what
the specific benefits will be.

00:50:49.234 --> 00:50:52.467
Um, I would imagine that,
at a minimum,

00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:54.934
you know, the same licensing,
technical support,

00:50:54.934 --> 00:50:57.000
service level agreements,
and so forth, would be,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.567
um, you know, would be
the most likely possibility,

00:50:59.567 --> 00:51:02.534
rather than necessarily specific
feature differentiation.

00:51:02.534 --> 00:51:05.400
man: But no limitation
on the usage so far?

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.300
Mitchell: So currently, the API,
um, allows you to perform

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.434
up to 100,000 queries
per day for free.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.534
man: Thinking from a perspective
of emergency response

00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:21.534
and/or marketing,

00:51:21.534 --> 00:51:25.534
uh, if you can plot a polygon

00:51:25.534 --> 00:51:28.067
or put a point with a radius

00:51:28.067 --> 00:51:30.767
and get a summary report

00:51:30.767 --> 00:51:34.200
about how many people
are connected--

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.667
how many--how many bars
do you have,

00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:38.200
how many hospitals,

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.834
but instead of having them
brought in

00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:42.868
as points with a lat long,
individuals,

00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:45.934
to summarize the reports,

00:51:45.934 --> 00:51:47.868
is it possible, currently,

00:51:47.868 --> 00:51:51.367
if, let's say, we bring it
into the Fusion Tables

00:51:51.367 --> 00:51:53.968
and then summarize them there
and spit them out?

00:51:53.968 --> 00:51:55.934
Mitchell: Um, so just
so I understand,

00:51:55.934 --> 00:51:57.868
this was getting an assessment

00:51:57.868 --> 00:52:00.934
of a number of businesses
of a given type in a given area?

00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:02.734
man: Yeah.
Mitchell: Okay.

00:52:02.734 --> 00:52:05.234
man: So either you trace
a polygon, or you put a point

00:52:05.234 --> 00:52:07.234
and you put a buffer
around that point,

00:52:07.234 --> 00:52:09.934
and you want summaries,
not just a bunch of points.

00:52:09.934 --> 00:52:12.000
You want summaries--how many
bars, how many hospitals...

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.501
Mitchell: Right.

00:52:13.501 --> 00:52:15.501
man: for emergency response
or for marketing purposes.

00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.067
Mitchell: Sort of density,
essentially.

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.734
man: Yeah.
Mitchell: Yeah, so, no,

00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:20.567
that's not something
that we have right now,

00:52:20.567 --> 00:52:22.567
but, again, it's something
that it sounds like,

00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:24.434
you know, we could--
we could consider.

00:52:24.434 --> 00:52:27.501
So if you just do a search
for Maps API issue tracker,

00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:29.501
you'll see there's
actually a link there

00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:31.434
for logging Places API feature
requests specifically,

00:52:31.434 --> 00:52:33.434
and, you know, I'm working
to collect those.

00:52:33.434 --> 00:52:35.100
And also, I should mention that,

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.868
um, you can star
feature requests

00:52:36.868 --> 00:52:39.000
to indicate your interest
in them, and then

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.234
that ends up ranking them for us
in terms of popularity,

00:52:41.234 --> 00:52:43.234
which is something that we take
very seriously.

00:52:43.234 --> 00:52:45.033
So I recommend everybody,
in fact,

00:52:45.033 --> 00:52:47.033
even if you don't have
an idea in mind,

00:52:47.033 --> 00:52:48.834
keep a regular eye on that

00:52:48.834 --> 00:52:50.834
and just flag the things
that you find interesting,

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.667
and that will
help us prioritize.

00:52:52.667 --> 00:52:55.167
Okay, it looks like that's
all the questions we have,

00:52:55.167 --> 00:52:57.000
so thanks very much,
everybody, for coming,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
and, uh, enjoy
the rest of your I/O.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.000
[applause]
