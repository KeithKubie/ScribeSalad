00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.470
We've done a lot of work
on multiplying, adding,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.950
subtracting and inverting
matrices.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.280
So now let's delve a little
into what a matrix is

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.250
actually good for.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.800
And remember, all a matrix
is is, a way of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.870
representing data.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.120
And all of those rules we
learned, you can kind of view

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.890
them as human-created rules.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.660
There's no fundamental thing in
nature that says matrices

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.490
have to be multiplied
the way we learned.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.240
But I think you'll see as we
progress into applications,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.220
that the way that matrix
operations have been defined

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.020
are actually quite useful.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.230
So let's go back to our Algebra
1 or Algebra 2.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.920
I forget when you tend
to learn it.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.060
But let's go back to
linear equations.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.680
So what were linear equations?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.830
Systems of linear equations.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.610
Well you had two lines, and you
essentially had to figure

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.370
out where the two lines
intersected.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.630
So you might have had something
like-- let me think

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.955
of something-- 3x plus 2y.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.130
Is equal to 7.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:20.730
And then you might have, minus
6x plus 6y is equal to-- I

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.740
need to do this in my head just
to make sure that I get

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.230
numbers that work out
well-- equal to 6.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.760
I think this will
work out well.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.060
And what was this problem
essentially?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.870
Well this is a line,
and this is a line.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.870
So you had to figure out
where they intersected.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.890
And if you were to draw
those two lines--

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.920
Actually let's draw them.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.740
Just because this is all about
getting intuition, and seeing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.530
how it maps over into
the matrix world.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160
And the word 'matrix world'
has a whole new

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.730
meaning after 1999.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.730
Let's see, so if that's my
coordinate axes, what is this?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.750
I always have to put everything
into y equals mx

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.759
plus b form for me to-- So
this equation is what?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.240
It's y is equal to
3/2 x plus 7/2.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.680
So 7/2 is what?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.700
It's like 3 1/2 or something?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.150
So if that's 7/2, that's going
to have a slope of 3 1/2.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.580
So it's a little bit steeper
than a slope of 1.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.050
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.300
That's that line.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
And then this line is going
to look like what?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.380
I'll do a different color.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.230
It's going to look like-- It's
the same thing is as--

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.660
Oh, you know what?

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.910
I did that wrong.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.480
Because that line, I just
realized, is equal to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.710
minus 3x plus 7/2.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.470
Because when you take this to
the other side, it becomes

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.470
minus 3x divided by 2, so
it's actually going

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.550
to be downward sloping.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.450
So it will look something
like this.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.820
It's going to be a little bit
steeper than something that

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.220
has a slope of negative 1, so
I'm just approximating.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.820
So that line will look
something like that.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:26.940
And this line, this will be y--
I'm just rewriting this--

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.590
y is equal to x plus
1, if I'm right.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.890
Yeah.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.120
Because this go to
the other side.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.410
Divide everything by 6.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.510
y is equal to x plus 1, so its
y intercept will be-- We said

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.240
this was 3 and 1/2, so
maybe if this is 1.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.360
And it has a slope of 1.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.080
Then it'll just look like
something like this.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.780
And so when you solve a system
of equations, you're

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.900
essentially looking for the x
and the y values that satisfy

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.310
both of these equations.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.180
This magenta line shows us all
the x and y values that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.410
satisfy this first
linear equation.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.210
And this green line shows all
of the x's and y's that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.750
satisfy the second equation.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.399
And of course where they
intersect shows us the

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.060
particular x and y that
satisfies both equations.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.010
So that's what we did
in Algebra 1.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.610
We'd solve both of these
equations for that.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:41.650
And we'd either do it by
substitution, or we'd scale

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.370
them and add them together,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.970
As you'll see, that's
essentially just what we

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.290
learned in the Gauss-Jordan
elimination.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.350
It's the exact same thing.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.600
It's just when we did the
Gauss-Jordan elimination, we

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.230
just represented it a
little different.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.600
But I think you know
this much.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.070
But let's now do it in
the matrix world.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.030
So how can we represent this
problem as a matrix?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.580
We could write it like this,
and we'll take out a little

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.440
time to prove to you that
it really is the same

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.120
representation.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.740
If you define matrices the way
we have defined them in their

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.850
multiplication.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:23.020
You can define this problem
as 3, minus 6, 2, 6.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.390
I just took the coefficients,
3, minus 6, 2, 6.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.880
And if I were to multiply
that by soon. column

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.560
vector matrix xy.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.010
And if I were to set that equal
to another column vector

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.520
matrix, 7, 6.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.540
Now you might want to pause it
and actually just try to

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.650
multiply this out, the way
that we have learned to

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.720
multiply matrices.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.250
And you will see that you
get the same thing.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.660
But I will do it now,
in case you don't

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.740
want to do it yourself.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.920
So let's just multiply
these two matrices.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.025
Let's multiply this matrix
out and see what happens.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.440
So what do you do?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.610
You get your row information
from the first matrix, column

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.480
information from the
second matrix.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.140
And this is of course
the product matrix.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.560
So this is saying, 3 times x
plus 2 times y is equal to 7.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.820
Well that's exactly what
we wrote up here.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.250
3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.760
And similarly when you multiply
the bottom row, you

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.260
get minus 6 times x plus 6
times y is equal to 6.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.990
So if that was a little
confusing to you, go review

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.210
how we multiply matrices.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.240
But if you just multiply this
out, you'll get these exact

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.500
same equations.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.840
So hopefully you understand that
this is just another way

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.420
of representing this problem.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.580
Although we've gotten rid
of the plus signs

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.490
and the equals signs.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.950
But of course you have to
know the representation.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.425
But why is this useful?

00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:59.000
Why is this representation
useful?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.790
Well let's call this matrix a.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.350
Let's call this vector x.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.950
It's not a variable.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.480
It's a vector.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.420
So maybe we'll bold it, or we'll
put a little vector sign

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.970
there or something.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.310
Whatever.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.310
But you'll see it in
your textbook.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.920
It's bolded real heavy.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.190
And then we call
this vector b.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.800
And the general notation-- if
I remember it correctly-- is

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.540
that anything that's a matrix
or a vector is bolded.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.850
And matrices that are not
vectors, that have more than

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.360
one dimension in either
of the dimensions,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.420
they're capital letters.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.410
While lower-case letters
represent vectors.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.580
So these are matrices, but
they're also vectors.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.560
So that's why they got the
lowercase letters.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.420
And that's why this one got
the uppercase letters.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.690
That's just convention.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.370
So this equation has the form
ax equals b, where a is this

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.350
matrix, x is this vector-- or
this matrix, same thing-- and

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.420
b is this column vector.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.850
So what does that do for us?

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.470
Well, what happens if
we knew a inverse?

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.020
Well actually, let me
take a step back.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.150
If these were numbers,
what would we do?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:17.410
If I just gave you an algebra
equation, ax is equal to b.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.920
How do you solve that?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.870
Well you would divide both sides
of this equation by a.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.080
Or another way of saying it, you
would multiply both sides

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.380
of this equation by
the inverse of a.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:35.720
So you would essentially say,
1/a times ax is equal

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.789
to 1/a times b.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.020
And then these would cancel out,
and you would get x is

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.380
equal to b/a.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.840
That's how we would do
it in a traditional

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.690
simple, linear equation.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.130
So how would you do it here?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.170
Well what's the matrix
analogy to division?

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.430
And I'm going to give
you the answer now.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.400
What's the analogy to
multiplying by your inverse?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.820
Well, it's multiplying
by your inverse.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.980
So what if we knew the
matrix a inverse?

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.900
We could just multiply
both sides of this

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.280
equation by a inverse.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.390
And remember, order matters.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.310
So it's not like when you're
doing a linear equation you

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.910
could multiply 1/a
on this side.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.150
But then you can do it on
the right side here.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.350
But no.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.700
Notice, I put it in front of
the numbers in both cases.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.840
So you have to do it in front of
the numbers in both cases.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.750
But if we know a inverse, and
if a inverse exists, then we

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.240
can multiply both sides-- you
can say the left side of both

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.705
sides of this equation
by a inverse.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:44.580
a inverse times a, times the
vector x is equal to a

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.480
inverse times b.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.550
All I did is I took this
expression, and I multiplied

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.160
both sides by a inverse.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.880
And what's a inverse times a?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.260
Well that's just the
identity matrix.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.070
That's the identity matrix,
times x is equal

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.570
to a inverse b.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.900
And of course that's just x.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.720
The identity matrix times
any other matrix

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.720
is just that matrix.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.540
So that's just the matrix
x, or the vector x

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.310
times a inverse b.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.010
So, if you're given a linear
equation, and if you know the

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.400
inverse of this matrix, to solve
for x and y, we just

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.740
have to multiply this number
times the inverse.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.690
And you might say, Sal,
that's such a pain.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.720
Because this is such a simple
linear equation to solve.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.210
Why would I go through all the
trouble of getting an inverse,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.370
and then multiplying the inverse
times this number.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.570
And I would agree with
you to some degree.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.960
That for a 2 by 2 system of
equations, it is easier to

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.150
solve it the way that you did it
in Algebra 1 or Algebra 2.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:49.170
But if you're doing it for a 3
by 3, well, finding a matrix

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.780
is still pretty difficult
for a 3 by 3,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.460
so it's still difficult.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.990
But as you get to larger and
larger numbers, it's

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.900
sometimes-- well, finding a
matrix can be difficult too--

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.370
But actually the real place
where it you really, really

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.980
pays off is, let's say that
you have a bunch of linear

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.220
equations to solve.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.160
And the left hand side
stays the same.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.150
But you keep changing
the right hand side.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.860
So let's say you have
ax equals b.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.380
And then you have another one
that says, ax equals c,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.680
and ax equals d.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.380
And these numbers
keep changing.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.730
And these numbers
are the same.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.080
Then it really pays off to
solve for the inverse.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.200
And then every time you need
to find a new solution, you

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.090
just multiply your new
right-hand side times your

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.880
inverse, and you just
get the answer.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.810
And that'll really pay
off when we view

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.950
this in another way.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:34.870
But anyway, I wanted
to show you that

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.020
this is the same thing.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.540
And so let's solve
it using what our

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.020
knowledge is of matrices.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.070
Let me erase this here, and I
know I'm running over time,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.440
but hopefully I'm not completely
boring you.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.780
So I'm going to keep that there,
just because I think

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.080
it's nice to have that
visual representation

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.650
of what we're doing.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.240
Always to remember
what's going on.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.930
So, what's a inverse?

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:05.860
So first of all, the a inverse
is equal to 1 over the

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:12.260
determinant of a times the
adjoint of this matrix.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.520
I don't want to get fancy with
terminology and all that, but

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.350
what was that?

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.950
2 by 2 is fairly easy.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.980
You swap these two terms.
You get a 6 and a 3.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.690
And then you make these
two terms negative.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.100
So a minus 6 becomes a 6.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.780
And a 2 becomes a minus 2.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.870
And what's the determinant
of a?

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.610
The determinant of a is equal to
this times this minus this

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.070
times this.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.830
So 3 times 6.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:45.840
3 times 6 is 18 minus
this times this.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.540
So 6 times 2 is 12.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.430
That's a minus 6.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.320
That's minus 12.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.460
So minus minus 12.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.280
It's equal to plus.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.690
So 18 plus 12 is equal to 30.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.350
So what does a inverse equal?

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.090
1 over 30 times this thing.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:10.870
So a inverse is equal to-- we
could even keep the 1/30 on

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.120
the outside.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.490
That might simplify things.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.520
Well actually I'll put it--

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.890
So a inverse is equal to what?

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.120
This divided by 30.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:33.300
So that's 1/5, minus-- Actually
I do want to keep it

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.180
on the outside, because that's
going to make the later

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.080
multiplications easier.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:46.570
So anyway, a is equal to 1/30
times 6, minus 2, 6, 3.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.680
That's a inverse.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.370
So now let's solve
for x and y.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.340
So we said x and y is equal
to a inverse times b.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.990
So we could say x-- another way
to write x is like this.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.820
x is just this vector.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.090
x and y.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.785
Not to get confused, this x is
different than that x, even

00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:05.570
though I've written
them the same.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.430
If I was a typographer, I would
make this really bold,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.040
so that you know that
this is a vector.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.890
Maybe I should put a
vector notation.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.150
I don't know.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.480
You could do a bunch
of things with it.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.890
It's equal to a inverse
times this.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.660
So that's 1/30.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.490
I did that just for the
matrix addition.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.920
I didn't divide everything
by 30, just so the matrix

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.580
multiplication's a
little easier.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.510
Minus 2, 3, times 7/6.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.616
And so what is this equal to?

00:14:40.616 --> 00:14:45.700
It's equal to 1/30 times-- I
know I'm crowding this down

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.810
here-- let's see.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:52.440
6 times 7 minus 2 times 6.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.240
So 6 times 7 is 42.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.690
Minus 2 times 6, so minus 12.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.830
So that's equal to the 30.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.220
And then 6 times 7
plus 2 times 6.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.090
So 6 times 7, once
again is 42.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.820
Plus 2 times 6.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.420
So 42 plus 12 is 50.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.620
Is that right?

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.990
6 times 7-- oh I'm sorry.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.700
This is a 3.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.320
That's why I was getting
confused.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.700
See, it's important to
have good penmanship.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.565
So it's 6 times 7 is
42, plus 3 times 6.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:38.120
So it's 42 plus 18,
which is 60.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.480
And of course you divide
both of them by 30.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.770
So you get the final xy.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.450
I'll write it here.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.480
I don't want to erase
anything.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.850
So we get xy is equal to--
divide both of those by 30--

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.410
is equal to 1 and 2.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.420
And so that tells us that these
two linear equations

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:10.160
intersect at the point x is
equal to 1, y is equal to 2.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.610
That might seem a little bit
like a lot of work, but that's

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.480
just because I took the time
to explain it and all that.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.000
But if you just immediately took
that, represented it this

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.240
way, found the inverse, and
multiplied, it wouldn't have

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.050
taken you that much time.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.100
And I encourage you to do
that as an exercise.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.530
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.610
And in the next video, we're
going to do this exact same

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.010
problem, but we're going to see
that this data represents

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.370
a different problem.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.620
