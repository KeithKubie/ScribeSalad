00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.750
Christian is now going to introduce the final

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.710
project for this class. But a note before he

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.340
does. The final project is a digital device,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.430
something you keep in your pocket, something you work

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.220
by gesture and touch, maybe voice. You might

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.510
wonder, gee, everything in this class has been physical,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.270
physical products. So, how do the principles we've

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.580
learned in the class apply to this new domain?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.270
Well that's why we're doing it. We want you to know that all the things you've

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.730
learned apply to all products. It doesn't matter whether it's [SOUND] a physical

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.270
product like this, where the physical affordances are very important. Or

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.120
to a digital product like this, where gestures and maybe voice and touching

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.040
is very important. All the principles apply

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.820
with maybe different emphasis. So for example,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.930
with a physical product affordances are important.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.340
With this, it is the signifiers that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.410
are critical. Doesn't matter, all the principles

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.810
of this course apply to all products,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.220
perishible, digital, physical.
