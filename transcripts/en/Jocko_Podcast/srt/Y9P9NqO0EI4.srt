1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,420
Jocko. I had had a few rough months,

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,770
some setbacks at work that hurt me
financially, which is stressed out.

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:13,030
My family, I'm late on some payments,
I'm falling further behind at work.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,470
I don't want to tap out, but I
just don't know where to start.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,590
Well, you know what, that's,

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,190
that's just kind of the
way that life works.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,440
Sometimes it's, it's Murphy's law.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,650
When things go wrong,

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
they always seem to happen at once and
they just compound on top of each other

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,530
and it's, it's pretty easy sometimes to,

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,650
to feel beaten when you're faced with
all those issues and all those problems

12
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,580
and they all hit you at the same time. But

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,170
let me tell you that that
doesn't mean give up.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,260
In fact, it means the opposite.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,090
Okay?

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,090
It means it's time for you to fight harder
to dig in means it's time for you to

17
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,820
go on the war path.

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,060
And that starts with one of the
fundamental laws of combat leadership,

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,160
prioritize and execute. What's
the biggest problem? Well,

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,160
what's causing the most
stress? Family. Okay.

21
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,140
Sit them down. Explain where you are at.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Be Blunt,

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,820
be up front and then give them the simple
plan of how you're going to get things

24
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,420
back on track. Don't sugarcoat it,

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,400
okay?

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,870
You give it to them straight.
Next you've got some,

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,120
some late payments.
Call those creditors up.

28
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,110
Explain to them what's going
on. Set up some kind of a of a,

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,320
of a minimum payment plan so you can start
making some progress and get them off

30
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,930
your back and then you got your job

31
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,170
right. You're falling behind at
work, okay? Talk to your boss.

32
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,180
Face it. Tell him that you're
going to step up your game.

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,600
Tell him you're going to be at work
early. You're going to be at work late.

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,100
You're going to be at work during lunch.

35
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,450
You're going to be wherever you need to
be whenever he needs you to be there.

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Tell him you're going to get after it
and tell them that you are 100% committed

37
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,060
to supporting him and the
company and the mission

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,020
and then you get started

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,160
and I'm going to tell you
right now, it won't be easy.

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,200
It will be hard because life
is hard. That's what life is

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,540
in these challenges, these
challenges that you face,

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,370
they're going to do their
best to take you down.

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,210
Do not let them stand up. Dig in,

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,640
line up those problems and
confront them. Face them.

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,133
Fight them.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,710
Yeah.

47
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,670
Do not let them bring you down. In fact,

48
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,250
in fact,

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,870
let loose challenges raise you up.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,670
Let them elevate you.

51
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,040
Let their demands and their
trials make you stronger.

52
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,880
But the adversity you faced today

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,050
turn you into a better person tomorrow.

54
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,130
So, so in the future,

55
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,810
you look back at these
struggles and you say to them,

56
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,503
thank you.

57
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,740
You made me better.
