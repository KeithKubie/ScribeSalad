00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.601
Let's keep playing around with conjugates. First I'd like you to find the

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:09.609
complex conjugate of 1 plus 9i and fill that into this orange box. Then I'd like

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:14.532
you to find the product of 1 plus 9i in that conjugate. So write the conjugate

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:19.572
again in this second set of parentheses and then multiply it by The original

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:23.520
complex number. And fill the answer in this last box.
