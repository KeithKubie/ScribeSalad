00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.910
Today, we peer into a world where shadowy
government stooges manipulate the levers of

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.840
fiscal policy from deep in their evil lairs.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.680
They pick economic winners and losers and
control the business cycle, creating recessions

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.230
and controlling inflation to serve their nefarious
purposes.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.990
Adriene: Waahah hah hah!

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.180
Nah, fiscal policy's a completely legitimate
tool used by non-shadowy government officials

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.480
to correct the economy.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.100
(Overlapping)
Adriene: I'm Adriene Hill and I'm the host

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.770
of Crash Course Economics.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.899
Jacob: I'm Jacob Clifford and I'm the host
of Crash Course Economics.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.899
Jacob: Stan!

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.899
Stan: You're co-hosts.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.100
Adriene: Oh, co-hosts, awesome!

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.019
Jacob: Alright, yeah, whoo!

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.249
[Intro]

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.350
Jacob: I'm Mr. Clifford; and I'm a high school
economics teacher and YouTuber, and I'm gonna

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.949
focus on teaching you the theories and graphs
of economics, you know, the textbook stuff.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.079
Adriene: And I'm Adriene Hill; I'm a senior
reporter for the public radio show Marketplace,

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.229
and I'm gonna focus on showing you the real
world applications of economics, you know,

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.920
the good stuff, the really fun stuff.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Jacob: Hey!

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
We're both fun.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920
Adriene: 911, what's your emergency?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.320
Jacob: My house is on fire, how much do you
charge to put it out?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.590
Adriene: It'll be $10,000, what's your credit
card number?

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.690
Jacob: Economics is not the study of money
or getting rich, although, understanding economics

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.470
can help with that, and economics is not primarily
about men in bow-ties forecasting what will

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.750
happen in a given market or the overall economy.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.930
Economics is the study of people and choices.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.550
Adriene: We can't promise you that learning
economics will make you wealthy, but we can

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.500
promise that learning economics will enlighten
your mind and make you a more informed decision

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.250
maker, and that makes us all better off.
