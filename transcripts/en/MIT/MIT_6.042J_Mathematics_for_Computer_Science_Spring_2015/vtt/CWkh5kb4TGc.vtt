00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.410
PROFESSOR: The issue
of the approximate rate

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.120
at which things happen is a
common in a lot of sciences,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.370
the rate at which
things fall, or the rate

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.350
at which reactions occur.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.410
And in computer science, typical
concern about growth rates

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.680
comes up in looking at the
efficiency of algorithms,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.350
and whether they're growing
linearly, or quadratically,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.910
or more.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.600
And we're going to look
today at four notations that

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.860
describe relations between
the growth rates of functions.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.000
The first of these relations
is the simplest one.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.100
It's called asymptotic
equivalence,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.850
or asymptotic equality.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.120
So this is tilde symbol is read
as asymptotically equal to.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.970
So f of n is asymptotically
equal to g of n,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.790
if and only if the limit of the
quotient of f of n over g of n

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.249
is 1.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.290
Let's look at an example.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.220
N squared is asymptotically
equal to n squared plus n.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.820
Why is that?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.080
Well, it follows trivially
by manipulating the algebra.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.250
The limit of n squared
plus n over n squared,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.140
simplifying, is just the same
as the limit of 1 plus 1 over n.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.880
But as n goes to
infinity, 1 over n

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.310
goes to 0, so the
limit is 1 as claimed.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.650
Those two expressions, or
the functions they define,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.750
n squared and n squared plus
1 are asymptotically equal.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.810
So there's some easy properties
of asymptotic equality

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.050
that follow immediately
from the definition.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.930
One of them is that
it's symmetric,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.080
namely, suppose that f is
asymptotically equal to g.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.630
I want to prove that g is
asymptotically equal to f.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.420
Well, what's going on here?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.100
Let's look at the limit
of g over f, which

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.940
is what I'd like to prove as 1.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.480
Well, the limit of g over
f, by algebra, g over f

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.140
is the same as 1 over f over
g, so just moving a limit

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.150
across the division,
that's the same as 1

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.710
over the limit of f over
g, which is 1 over 1.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.750
And we've proved in
other words, the g

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.650
is asymptotically equal to f,
given that f is asymptotically

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.820
equal to g.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.630
It's symmetric.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.472
There's a similar
argument for transitivity.

00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:18.930
Let's just crank through it
for practice on the definition.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.380
Suppose that f is
asymptotically equal to g,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.240
and g is asymptotically
equal to h,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.790
I'd like to prove that f it's
asymptotically equal to h.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.120
Well, again, we just
plug into the algebra

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.190
and distribute limits.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.220
Let's just look at this.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.920
We're given that 1 is
the limit of f over g,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040
because f is asymptotic to g.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.200
But f over g can be expressed
as f over h divided by g over h.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.430
That's just algebra.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.070
The h's cancel.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.770
So this limit, now, I
can distribute the limits

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.380
to the numerator
and denominator,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.730
assuming both exist,
and the numerator limit

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.200
is what I'm interested in.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.160
The denominator limit
is going to be 1,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.310
because the limit
of g over h is 1.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.380
Since g is asymptotically
equal to h,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.590
the conclusion is indeed
that the limit of f over h

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.120
is equal to 1.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.980
This is not really
very interesting stuff,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.420
and the top level
message is that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.140
many of these
elementary properties

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.480
of asymptotic equality and
the other asymptotic relations

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.780
that we're going to
see follow by this kind

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.090
of elementary algebra, and
distributing the limits

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.460
over sub expressions.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.400
Anyway, the corollary of this
is that asymptotic equality

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.259
is in fact an
equivalence relation.

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.050
We've proved it's
symmetric and transitive,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.240
and it's trivially reflexive.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.930
It's an equivalence relation.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.270
By the way, it's
worth noting that it's

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.020
an equivalence relation on
functions of one variable, when

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.500
we write sometimes that
f of n is asymptotically

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.170
equal to g of n.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.370
But we mean that f of n is the
description of the function f.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.420
We're not talking about
the number that f of n

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.100
happens to have for some
particular value of f.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.110
So we'll sometimes
write f of n is

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.890
asymptotically equal to g of n.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.130
For descriptive purposes,
the proper thing

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.940
we should be writing is that f
is asymptotically equal to g.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.450
Asymptotic equality is a
relation between functions.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.240
OK.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.040
The next asymptotic relation
we're going to look at

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.300
is called asymptotically smaller
than, and the notation for it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.800
is this little o notation.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.650
So you'd write that f of n is
equal to little o of g of n,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.930
if and only if the limit of f
of n over g of n goes to 0 as n'

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.380
approaches infinity.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.910
So let's look at
an example of that.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.360
N squared is little
o of n cubed,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.570
because trivially, the limit
of n squared over n cubed

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.130
is the same as the
limit of 1 over n.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.050
It's equal to zero.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.560
And by similar kind
of reasoning that we

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.320
did for asymptotic equality
being an equivalence relation,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.440
it's not very hard to
prove that little o defines

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.000
a strict partial
order on functions.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.510
So the third asymptotic
relation is the most complicated

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.250
of the three.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.070
It's arguably the most
important in computer science.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.750
It's called the asymptotic
order of growth, o.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.570
And the definition
is that if function

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.770
f is big o of a function
g, what it means

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.940
is that the limit of
f over g is finite.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.930
So it might be other than
0 or 1, but it's finite.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.230
And that means that
f is big o of g.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.170
Now, there's a
technicality there

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.170
where the expression actually
says the limsup of f of n

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.420
over g of n.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.850
Let's just ignore that for
now, and we'll look at it

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.740
and explain why the limsup
is there a little later.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.960
So as an example,
3n squared is big o

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.670
of n squared, because
the quotient of 3n

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.350
squared over n squared is 3,
which is less than infinity.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.540
So what big o is doing is kind
of saying that constant factors

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.640
don't matter.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.150
And that turns out to be
particularly useful in computer

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.110
science, where you can't
really talk about the time

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.020
that a procedure takes,
because that's going

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.890
to depend on the hardware.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.850
So when you implement
it on faster hardware,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.820
it may grow at the
same rate, but the time

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.460
will actually change.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.120
And that's why big o
plays a prominent role.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.890
The final relation
of the four is called

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.130
theta, or same order of growth.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.510
The definition of
f is theta of g

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.700
is simply that f is o
of g and g is o of f.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.790
And it's easy to show
from the definition

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.370
that theta is an
equivalence relation.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.290
So to summarize, there
are these four relations.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.370
F asymptotically equal
to g means informally

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.860
that f and g are nearly equal.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.620
F equals little o of
g informally means

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.845
that f is much less than g.

00:07:23.845 --> 00:07:27.256
F equals o of g means
that f is roughly less

00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:28.630
than or equal to
g, where roughly

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.530
means that we're not concerned
about constant factors.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.760
And f equals theta of g means
that f is roughly equal to g.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.120
And we'll examine
these properties

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.190
in more detail in
the next segment.
