00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.350
So I have six different
fractions written out here,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.970
and what I want you to do is
pause this video right now

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.920
and try to rewrite each of
these fractions as a decimal.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.690
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.530
so let's go through
each of these.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.530
So we know that when we
say 34/10, or 34 over 10,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.910
that this could be interpreted
literally as 34 divided by 10.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.804
And so if you
start with 34-- let

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:30.470
me put a little decimal
right over here.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.803
It will be clear that there
is an implied decimal there,

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.500
so we could just keep
adding zeroes if we want.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.810
So when we divide
by 10, we're going

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.292
to move the decimal one
space over to the left.

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:43.000
And you should always
do a reality check.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.083
If you forget, hey, do I
move it over to the left,

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:46.620
or do I do it over to the right?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.870
You should do a reality check.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.520
Look, if I'm dividing
by 10, should I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.340
get a smaller value
or a larger value?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.750
Well, clearly, if you're
dividing it into 10 groups,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.820
you should get a smaller value.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.840
So when you take your
decimal place to the left,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.400
you're going to get
a smaller value.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.440
34 is going to become 3.4.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.750
And that makes complete sense.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.160
If you were to
multiply 3.4 by 10,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.870
you would move the
decimal to the right,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.966
and you would get to 34.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.090
Let's think about this one.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.575
So this one right
over here is 3.4.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.510
Now let's think about 7/10.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.930
So the exact same idea.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.650
This is equal to
7 divided by 10.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.451
This fraction, horizontal
line symbol thing

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.200
could literally be
viewed as "divided by."

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.930
This could be read
as 7 divided by 10.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.170
So when you divide by 10, you
move the decimal one space over

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.530
to the left.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.260
So we're going to
get to point 7.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.572
And just to be clear, we
could write this as 0.7.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:52.760
It's sometimes dangerous
to just write the decimal

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.350
without the zero out front.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.130
So 7/10, or 7 divided by
10, can be rewritten as 0.7.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.590
Now let's try 53/100.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.829
Well, we'll start with our 53.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.370
Once again, this
could be interpreted

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.510
as 53 divided by 100.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.730
So there's an implied decimal
point right over here.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000
Now, if we're dividing by
100, that's dividing by 10

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.790
and then dividing by 10 again.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.220
This is dividing by 10 times 10.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.780
So we're going to divide
by 10, and then we're

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.170
going to divide by 100.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.620
So the decimal is going
to land right over there.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.910
So that's going
to get us to 0.53.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.840
Now let's tackle
2 divided by 100.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.336
So once again, this could be
rewritten as 2 divided by 100.

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.930
2/100 is the same thing
as 2 divided by 100.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.600
If we start with a 2, put our
decimal point right there.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.463
So we're going to
divide by 10, and we're

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:53.430
going to do that twice.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.930
So we're going to
divide by 10 once.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.825
That would be 2/10.

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:57.565
That puts our decimal there.

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:59.100
But we have to
divide by 10 again.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.840
You might say, hey, look,
there's nothing here.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.590
Well, you could just
throw a zero on here,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530
just so that you
do something there,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.439
and then you have moved your
decimal over to the left twice.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.980
Remember, every time
you're doing it,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.965
you're dividing by 10.

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:13.470
You're dividing by 10.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.140
Then you're dividing
by 10 again.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.830
Dividing by 10 two times, that's
the same thing as dividing

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
by 100, because 10
times 10 is 100.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.384
So this is going to be 0.02.

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:29.925
Now we've already seen that, if
you were to try to read this,

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.320
this 2 is in the
hundredths place.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.067
So you would literally
read this as 2 hundredths.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:36.400
And we see that right over here.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.840
We've literally represented
it as 2 hundredths right

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.040
over there-- 2/100.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.310
So now we have 1,098
divided by 100.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.800
Well, same drill.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.020
Or 1,098 hundredths I could say.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.710
That's the same thing
as 1,098 divided by 100.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.390
So we could start with 1,098.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.275
The decimal is implicitly
right over here,

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:00.110
but we need to move it two
spaces to the left-- one, two--

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.940
because we're dividing by 100.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.460
That gets us to 10.98.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.930
And always do a reality check.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.980
Look, it makes sense.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.390
We got to a significantly
smaller value

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.910
when we divided by 100.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.579
Now we'll just divide
9,967 by 1,000.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.750
Well, 9.967, decimal
point implicitly there.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.880
Now, 1,000 is 10
times 10 times 10.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.590
So if you're dividing
by 1,000, that's

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.920
dividing by 10 three times.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.220
So we'll divide by 10
once, divide by 10 twice,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.500
divide by 10 three times.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.520
We get to 9.967.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.370
So another way of writing
9,967 thousandths, well,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.946
that's just going to be 9.967.

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:53.460
Or I could literally read
it as 9 and 967 thousands.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.600
And that also makes sense.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.540
I mean, you could break
this up into 9,000 plus 967.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.450
And so 9,000 thousandths
is going to be 9.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.002
And then you're going to be
left with the 967 thousandths.
