00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:12.673
The biggest kidney stone on record
weighed more than a kilogram

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:16.765
and was 17 centimeters in diameter.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:20.643
The patient didn't actually
swallow a stone the size of a coconut.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:23.464
Kidney stones form inside the body,

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:28.704
but unfortunately, they're extremely
painful to get out.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:33.245
A kidney stone is a hard mass
of crystals that can form in the kidneys,

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.345
ureters,

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:35.254
bladder,

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:36.846
or urethra.

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:39.595
Urine contains compounds 
that consist of calcium,

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:40.485
sodium,

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:41.387
potassium,

00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:42.406
oxalate,

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:43.476
uric acid,

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.487
and phosphate.

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:48.327
If the levels of these particles
get too high,

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:51.275
or if urine becomes too acidic
or basic,

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:56.635
the particles can clump together
and crystallize.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:58.316
Unless the problem is addressed,

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:03.907
the crystals will gradually grow
over a few weeks, months, or even years,

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:08.116
forming a detectable stone.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:12.214
Calcium oxalate is the most common
type of crystal to form this way,

00:01:12.214 --> 00:01:16.657
and accounts for about 
80% of kidney stones.

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:21.938
Less common kidney stones are made
of calcium phosphate, or uric acid.

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:23.777
A slightly different type of stone

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:27.528
made of the minerals magnesium
ammonium phosphate, or struvite,

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:31.258
can be caused by bacterial infection.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:35.169
And even rarer stones can result
from genetic disorders

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:38.489
or certain medications.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:44.099
A kidney stone can go undetected
until it starts to move.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.428
When a stone travels
through the kidney and into the ureter,

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:52.469
its sharp edges scratch
the walls of the urinary tract.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.481
Nerve endings embedded in this tissue
transmit excruciating pain signals

00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:59.802
through the nervous system.

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:04.142
And the scratches can send blood flowing
into the urine.

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:06.892
This can be accompanied 
by symptoms of nausea,

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:07.734
vomiting,

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.144
and a burning sensation while urinating.

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:14.594
If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine,

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.472
it can create an infection,
or back flow,

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:21.253
and damage the kidneys themselves.

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:24.124
But most kidney stones 
don't become this serious,

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:27.353
or even require invasive treatment.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:30.157
Masses less than five millimeters
in diameter

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:33.685
will usually pass out 
of the body on their own.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:37.415
A doctor will often simply recommend
drinking large amounts of water

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.895
to help speed the process along,

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:43.385
and maybe taking some pain killers.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:47.165
If the stone is slightly larger,
medications like alpha blockers

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.326
can help by relaxing the muscles
in the ureter

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:54.126
and making it easier 
for the stone to get through.

00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.406
Another medication called
potassium citrate

00:02:56.406 --> 00:03:02.987
can help dissolve the stones by creating
a less acidic urine.

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:06.197
For medium-sized stones up to about
ten millimeters,

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:10.577
one option is pulverizing them
with soundwaves.

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:16.226
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
uses high-intensity pulses

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:21.708
of focused ultrasonic energy
aimed directly at the stone.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.369
The pulses create vibrations inside
the stone itself

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.149
and small bubbles jostle it.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.127
These combined forces crush the stone
into smaller pieces

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:37.389
that can pass out of the body more easily.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.108
But zapping a stone with sound
doesn't work as well

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:42.565
if it's simply too big.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:47.050
So sometimes, more invasive
treatments are necessary.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.071
A rigid tube called a stent
can be placed in the ureter to expand it.

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:57.550
Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses
to break up the stone.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.980
Stones can also be surgically removed
through an incision

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.489
in the patient's back or groin.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.901
What about just avoiding kidney stones
in the first place?

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.821
For people prone to them,

00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.470
their doctor may recommend
drinking plenty of water,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.651
which dilutes the calcium oxalate
and other compounds

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:20.615
that eventually build up 
into painful stones.

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:21.878
Foods like potato chips,

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:22.932
spinach,

00:04:22.932 --> 00:04:23.744
rhubarb,

00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:26.280
and beets are high in oxalate,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.847
so doctors might advise limiting them.

00:04:29.847 --> 00:04:32.432
Even though calcium 
is often found in stones,

00:04:32.432 --> 00:04:36.281
calcium in foods and beverages
can actually help

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.101
by binding to oxalate 
in the digestive tract

00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.143
before it can be absorbed
and reach the kidneys.

00:04:43.143 --> 00:04:46.222
If you do end up with a kidney stone,
you're not alone.

00:04:46.222 --> 00:04:48.913
Data suggests that rates are rising,

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.852
but that world record probably
won't be broken any time soon.
