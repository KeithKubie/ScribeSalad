00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.050
On September 30th, Udacity is going to launch it's very first biology

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.550
course, Tales From the Genome, a collaboration with the personal genetics

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.790
company 23andMe. Now months ago, in preparation for teaching this course,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.680
I created a mini-lesson and shared it with my colleagues here at

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.170
Udacity, to see what it would be like to teach genetics

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.890
to the world. Now, although the style is a bit different than

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.330
what you may be used to in a Udacity course. Because

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.590
I created the whole thing on just my iPad. It still conveys

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.810
the excitement that I hope comes across in the new

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.830
course, Tales from the Genome. Now, if you're not a registered

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.210
Udacity user yet, and you want your progress for this

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.035
mini lesson to be saved. Then follow the links in the

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.730
instructor's notes on this page and create an account, signing

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.090
up is free, the lesson is free, the whole course is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.800
going to be free. And I really hope you enjoy learning

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.270
how to extract DNA from strawberries, in your very own kitchen.
