00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.211
[phone ringing]

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:03.920
Hey.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.754
Hey, Marty.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.089
Hey, guys.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.049
NARRATOR: [inaudible]
joins Rick Lagina

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.303
and other members of the Oak
Island team in the war room.

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.931
So, big brother, how'd
your trip to New York go?

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:15.932
Tell me.

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:16.766
I'll tell you in one word.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.143
I was stunned.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.769
Wow.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.356
NARRATOR: One week ago, Rick
received the shocking news

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.109
that his close friend,
researcher and author

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.737
Zena Halpern, had passed away.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.488
[knocking on door]

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.575
Rick also learned that Zena had
bequeathed to him the results

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.036
of her life's work, including
a vast trove of books

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.998
and documents, which seem
to connect the Oak Island

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.251
mystery to activities involving
the Knights Templar as

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.004
far back as the 12th century.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.883
I'm just so thrilled to know
that her life's work isn't

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.801
just going to stop right now.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.179
I guarantee you it's not
going to stop, Devin, Jason.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.764
It's not going to stop.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.974
She wouldn't allow it to
stop, and we won't do either.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:58.808
Thank you, brother.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.685
Yup.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.189
The amount of material
that Zena has wrought,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.566
the width and breadth of
the lady's accomplishments

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.318
and research, it was stunning.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.277
That is the word.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.320
Stunning.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.697
Is it tied to Oak Island?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.283
I think we all
have just a very

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.327
rudimentary
understanding of the work

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.953
as it relates to Oak Island.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.706
The information is
somewhat disjointed.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.041
Do you have the
information with you?

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.542
You have it all?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.544
I have some of it, but
there were so much that we

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.589
have to have it shipped.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.009
The information will
all come to Oak Island.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.511
So one of the things
that was found

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:39.599
is a actual copy of
the Cremona document.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:47.482
And it's a deposition by
this English Templar knight.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.985
It's a description of a
year long voyage to the New

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.403
World, what's called Onteora.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.617
I know what this is.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.621
This is at the core of
your mother's research.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.666
NARRATOR: While packing up
Zena's collection of research,

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.752
Rick discovered a copy of
what is known as the Cremona

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:12.006
document, a collection of
maps and journal passages

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.467
reportedly authored by
the 12th century Templar

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.428
knight Ralph de Sudeley.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.223
It describes not only
de Sudeley's journey

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.809
to the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem,

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.185
where he claimed
to have recovered

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.646
priceless religious
treasures including

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.775
the ark of the covenant,
but also a Templar voyage

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.195
to the New World
in the year 1178,

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.198
more than three centuries
before Christopher Columbus

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:41.744
made landfall in North America.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:43.746
I don't know if
this is 100% accurate.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:44.706
I don't.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.083
Right.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.252
I do believe
with 100% certainty

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.213
that it's worth some
commitment of ours

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.173
to try to come to
an understanding

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:58.177
of whether not only is this
relevant, but is it accurate?

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.888
Here's my thought.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.016
We've now come into possession
of some remarkable research.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.018
A lifetime's worth of research.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.769
Literally.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.983
And to that end, I propose that
we establish a research center.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:16.321
A place where we can gather the
information regarding our work,

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.449
our pursuit of answers for
the Oak Island mystery,

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.701
and commit ourselves
to that endeavor.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.369
I want to carry
her work forward.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.787
I do.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.457
Once seen as research
is here and housed here,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.877
it will foster this sense
of that the information

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.795
hunt is, indeed, important.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.674
I believe there's a lot more
to glean from her research,

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:39.469
and who knows where
those paths lead us.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.264
I think the future of that
research, Zena's legacy,

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.684
if you will, is in very
good hands on Oak Island.

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:52.148
It sounds to me like the
research center idea is timely

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.734
because, you know, it's going
to take some real digging

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.486
to mess with this.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.906
So keep going, keep digging, is
all I can say, and see what's--

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.991
try and separate out
fact from fiction.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.035
I'm going to make certain
that we follow up on this.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.370
- Good job, you guys.
- All right.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.120
See ya.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.955
See ya.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:07.997
Talk to you later.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:08.998
Bye
