00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.540
So Quicksilver asked this question, if recoverability

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.020
is so critical for so many subsystems,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.160
shouldn't recovery be a first class citizen

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.080
in the design of operating system and not

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.490
an afterthought? Because LRVM and Riovista are

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.210
trying to fix a problem that manifested

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.770
itself because the operating system was doing

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.710
it's job well. So the question that Quicksilver

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.180
is asking is. Can we make recovery a first

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.730
class citizen in the design of the operating system?
