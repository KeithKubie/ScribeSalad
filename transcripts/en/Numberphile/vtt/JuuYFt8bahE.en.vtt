00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.840
I brought a little tube

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.020
whose ends have been colored black and orange

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.380
and I'm going to launch it into spin

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.860
and it will spin around the middle

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.180
and because it is spinning around the middle

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.600
a priori, there is no reason why you would see black better than orange

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
orange better than black.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.800
Ok, but now when I launch

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.840
what do we see?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.120
We see black.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580
And every time we seem to be seeing black.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.400
That's really funny.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.540
We seem to be seeing, be seeing black

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.660
but you don't like black, I'm going to shake it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.520
and launch it

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.020
and now we'll see orange instead.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.060
That's really curious.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.060
It's not a matter of launching from right to left

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.720
because I can launch it with my left hand and it's still orange.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.360
After all, you don't like orange then

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
so I'm going to rub it against my black hair

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.720
and that changes the color again, and it's black.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.460
So the first mystery is why sometimes do we see black and sometimes orange?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.820
Mystery number two is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.300
when I launch this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
how many black spots do we see?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.060
I think we see four.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.520
Why four? It's not as if I'm launching it with very much care.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.240
Its initial conditions seem to be random.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.300
So why do we see four?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.100
When it's stabilized, it's four.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120
And I have to shake it around.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.160
And...

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.820
four oranges.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.700
See, in order to understand it better,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.840
I brought another tube.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.120
Similarly marked, black and orange.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.360
Now, this time I'm going to show you black.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.660
There's a much longer transient,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.820
in other words, you have to wait for it

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.060
but when it settles into steady state

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.300
we have three.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.320
Again.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.880
We see three.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.840
That's interesting.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.660
You might have noticed...

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.940
I hope you didn't, that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.080
when I launch from the black end

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.320
it shows black.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.500
And when I press down the orange end and launch

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.860
it's orange.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.880
So why is this?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.560
I'd like to begin by giving you a zeroth order theory,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.920
and then we'll do the full theory later on.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.780
So the zeroth order theory goes as follows...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.280
you see, this motion

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.740
I'm pressing down, making it spin

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.920
can be thought of as a combination or superposition of two motions.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.660
First...

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.420
the whole thing is spinning like this around the vertical axis.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.120
We shall call it revolution.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.020
Yeah.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.080
At same time, this thing spins around it's own axle.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.980
And we shall call that motion rotation.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.460
And the whole thing is a combination of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.420
revolution and rotation.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.420
Let's say for the time being that we launch it by pressing down the black end, okay.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.440
Always.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.100
And, please look at the other point

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640
here at the orange end.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120
That point will be advancing like this,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.040
because of the revolution.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.320
But you see...

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.100
the... rotation that I gave the black end is a back spin like this,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.980
which means the orange end is going in top spin.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.020
So that's a rotation which is also going forward.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.520
[Brady]: Yeah.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.680
So the revolution makes it advance like this

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.980
but the rotation which is like... like this

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.540
is making go like that also.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.840
So, the rotation and revolution ADD to each other,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.540
so this end is going fast.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.880
In contrast...

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.200
let's look at the black end that I pinch down.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.040
Well again, the revolution... the revolution will make it advance like this.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.340
But at this end, the rotation is back spin

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.100
so the rotational speed is actually pointing backward.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.060
So those two speeds subtract from each other

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.680
so this end's going to move slower.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.800
And the fact of the matter is that the end that we see better is the end that is moving slower

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.920
and the end that's moving faster we don't see so well.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.220
So, black end is moving slower

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.540
and orange end is moving faster

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.280
and the zeroth order theory is that black end is...

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.120
the slow end is the one end that we see

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.440
and the orange end, the fast end, we don't see.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.380
So far, so good,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.320
but you see, this explanation, zeroth order as I called it

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.000
is not totally satisfying, because

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.600
first of all, why is it that we see the slow end rather than the fast end?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900
It sounds plausible, but maybe human eyes have a...

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.620
you know...

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.220
preferred frequency that it wants to capture

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.640
and maybe at some frequency -- even if it is fast -- we see best, and so on.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.460
Maybe.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.600
And also, this zeroth order explanation doesn't do anything to explain why four, why three.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.400
So we'll wade into the now full analysis

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.220
It so happens that when you... pinch it

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.120
Initially, everything is sliding because I'm launching it.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.820
But soon, this sliding motion goes into ROLLING motion.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.220
Rolling, by the way, means the following thing:

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.100
when two bodies roll against each other

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.380
it means that at the point of contact, there is no relative velocity

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.660
In other words, these two bodies are moving in exactly the same way.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.800
That's what rolling means.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.260
If they have a relative vevlocity

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.200
if they are not moving the same way at point of contact

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.000
they slide against each other

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040
That makes sense.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.860
So they roll against each other.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.920
That means that their relative velocity is zero at the point of contact.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.340
But if an object is rolling on the fixed floor

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.100
Well, the floor is not moving, so that means that the point of contact at

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.160
any instant is instantaneously at rest

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.900
Has zero velocity...

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.800
at the point of contact. That's what rolling means.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.240
So let's say it starts rolling like this and it goes around, around like...

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.940
Okay.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.840
Now, as you can see...

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.940
It's tilted a little, but let's ignore this tilt for the moment.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.560
It's very, very small and it just keeps going around and around

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.680
The point of contact then is describing a largish circle on the floor.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.060
On that... large circle you can see there's a cross sectional circle of the tube

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.140
which is... you can imagine a coin rolling on the circle like this going around, around

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.940
Ok, so there is a small circle rolling on the large circle.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.080
Well...

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.140
How many times does this small circle roll on the large circle?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.340
Well it has to do with, of course, the perimeter of the small circle to the perimeter of the large circle.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.160
But that's equal to the ratio of the diameter of the small circle to the diameter of the large circle

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.380
which is approximately the length of this end

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.540
So, it's really the aspect ratio of how long it is to how wide it is.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400
And that's -- it turns out -- 4 to 1.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.800
By the way, it looks a bit curious, I think.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.160
Most people looking at this tube would say that

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.720
it's longer and thinner than 4 to 1.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.860
But actually it is, because, for example...

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.960
These two have the same width

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.020
and if I measure this in units of the small one

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.800
that's one... two... three... four

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.980
So it is really four to one.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.560
I don't know why human eyes think of it as longer and thinner than 4 to 1

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.660
but it is 4 to 1.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.020
And that's 3 to 1.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.340
And that is number that we were seeing.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.740
4 points, 4 dots, 3 dots.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.380
But there is something even more beautiful going on

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.860
so let me go into this...

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.340
We have been so far neglecting this slight tilt

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.000
but actually, there is a slight tilt

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.320
When I launch this...

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.920
it so happens that the part that I push down starts...

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.640
immediately rises it's head

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.140
and goes into this motion.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.160
Why does it rise it's head? Well...

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.040
it's easy, but...

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.560
an awkward explanation.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.120
It has to do with the gyroscopic effect.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.100
So let me, er, slide over that then.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.000
Let's accept that rise... it raises it's head and starts going like this.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.240
While this thing is rolling, rolling...

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.200
with a slight tilt against the floor

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.400
in steady state

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.980
In your imagination, please place a transparent ceiling from above

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.260
So as the touch this tilted tubes from above...

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.980
this motion is happening between two planes

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.420
the imaginary ceiling
above and then the real floor below

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.580
Well... you can see that there is an up and down symmetry between the floor and ceiling

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.360
of this motion, it's just going around and around like... like that

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.220
So... in particular...

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.560
if this thing... thing is rolling on the floor... at the bottom,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.340
at top its rolling under the ceiling.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.500
On the ceiling, or under the ceiling rather,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.620
this thing is describing a larger circle.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.460
And this...

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.600
sort of coin like cross-sectional
circle is hanging from the ceiling circle

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.100
going around, around in a circle.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.580
Rolling means, as we explained, that in fact instantaneously whatever...

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.180
point is a point of contact to the... with the ceiling

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.940
is instantaneously at rest, because it's now touching the ceiling from below.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.560
Yeah.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.920
So... earlier we said something to the effect that well the black end is the slow end then the, erm...

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.060
orange end is the fast end.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.420
But never mind slow,
it's actually instantaneously at rest

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.180
the velocity becomes ZERO

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.520
Every time it comes up

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.160
it goes paff, paff, paff, paff, paff!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.300
Stops for us

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.600
And that's why we see them so clearly

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.240
and how many times did it stop per circuit?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.280
Well, four exactly because that's the ratio...

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.820
aspect ratio would we talk about

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:34.340
[low frequency humming -- slowed down rotation]

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.380
[Brady]: Stopping four times in every possible position too, though?

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.160
[Brady]: It's not just stopping with the black part up,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.680
[Brady]: it's stop...

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.840
Ahh... that's right, but you see... the...

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.540
in other positions we are seeing the white bit stop

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.160
so between the black bits, in fact you
see lots and lots of white bits that are stopping for us

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.980
and that's why we see in fact the white circle with four black dots

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.960
Indeed.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.579
So every point, whenever it comes upward is stopped.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:02.179
Similarly, every point... down below

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.379
is stopping whenever it comes into point of contact

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:07.099
so if you did this experiment, maybe
you would like to do it together...

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.460
between not just a floor like this, but it's a glass floor

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.160
and transparent floor and we filmed from, ah... below

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.000
then we would see the orange bits...

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.700
boom, boom, boom, boom

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.660
paff, paff, paff, paff

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.320
and then all the rest would be white.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.860
There is a very beautiful curve called a
cycloid.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.700
So a cycloid is roughly speaking this curve.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.640
If you look at the trajectory of this black thing as the...

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.420
the cross-sectional circle rolls

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.020
I'm going to exaggerate the size

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.400
It... describe a... describes a curve like this and that's called a cycloid.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.920
The point about the cycloid... it has cusps.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.780
You see whenever it touches the floor

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.900
the stationary support

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.380
it... it has a cusps.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.100
and this cusp turns out to be locally vertical

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.000
you know it doesn't make an
angle like this...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.640
but actually it's like this

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.340
because the point is curving in and then

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.520
kind of bouncing vertically, and going out... and going out.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.020
(breath)

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.860
So... this has the
following very very interesting consequence as well.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.260
If you go back for a  moment to this motion...

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.440
Orange one, which is touching the floor, is then describing a cycloid.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.880
If you like those lobes standing on the, er, circle on the floor.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.480
Similarly, by the same token, this black dot is describing

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.460
a sequence of upside down cycloids

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.380
whose lobes are hanging from the ceiling... like this.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.820
And each time the black dot comes up you are at the cusp of this cycloid....

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.360
upside down cycloid.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.740
But you see this cusp is... vertical cusp

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.689
and we are looking at the motion from above

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:44.249
You see, so that means that whenever the black dot comes into contact with the ceiling

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.810
and goes into instantaneous rest.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.460
Not only does it stop instantaneously, but in that vicinity it's moving only
vertically.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200
and we are looking at... from above

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.800
so we see only the horizontal motion.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.620
And for the observer from above vertical motion is invisible, right?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.800
I mean it looks like stationary.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.940
See, in other words, near this stationary point

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.680
the cusp of the cycloid

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.300
when the black dot comes into contact with the ceiling from above

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.460
it not only comes... becomes stationary at that moment but it's velocity is really exaggeratedly

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.360
shrunk with respect to the observer from above

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.160
so not only do you get zero velocity, but

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.940
around that... moment

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.540
the... its velocity actually shrunk because of the angle of the observation.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.580
That's why we see this effect so clearly so it has the, erm,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.880
the effect of exaggerating this stop motion.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.980
Now, when I, erm, started thinking about this

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.340
I didn't know, of course, what was happening

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.640
and so I went to a hardware store in Tokyo and I bought a long, erm, plastic tube

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.800
and then cut them in aspect ratios... integers

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.200
and then started playing with this and figured out everything.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.180
By the way, if you want to do this at, er, at home and so on

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.720
I recommend that you use hollow tubes because, you see

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.860
a hollow tube means that most of the mass is concentrated on the rim

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.540
and at the same time because it's hollow, it's not so heavy

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.240
So making it like... has the advantage that you can launch it easily.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.740
but concentrating the mass on the rim

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.540
and has the advantage that

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.660
what is called the moment of inertia is large for the same mass

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.880
so once it gets going, it gets going... erm, it keeps going in a stable fashion.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.060
I made those things in... aspect ratios of
integers: 4 to 1, 3 to 1, and so on.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.680
I also have at home, 5 to 1,
but I regret doing this because

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.420
you see I really would like to know what happens when the aspect ratio is not an integer.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.200
And instead of listing the vertices

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.360
consecutively like this in order

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.280
what you see is that you see those dots skipping

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.380
and going every second vertex like this, like a...

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.280
[metal object spinning on a wooden surface]

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.320
In the beginning it's a mess

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.040
There's a...  [audio fades]
