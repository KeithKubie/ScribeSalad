00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.980
We can reduce six-ninths
into two-thirds.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.380
We can do this because 6 and
9 share the common factor 3.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.230
That means we can write 6 over
9 as 3 times 2 over 3 times 3.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590
Now I can divide out
the 3 from the top and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
the 3 from the bottom, and
what I'm left with this two-thirds.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.960
This might be a good time to remind
you that it's okay to do this,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.660
divide out the 3 from the top and

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.390
the 3 from the bottom, because any
number over itself is equal to 1.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.500
So here,
3 over 3 is just the same thing as 1.
