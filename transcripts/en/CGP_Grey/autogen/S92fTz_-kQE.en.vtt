00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.649
 Can Texas separate from the union? 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.339
 America's second most populous and second largest state is there to remind you 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.339
 that it was once an independent state: the Republic of Texas. 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.379
 Unlike California's three-week, incidental flirt with independence (and horrible flag) 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.630
 the Republic of Texas was a real country with its own presidents, laws and currencies 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.599
 for a decade, from 1836 to 1846, when it joined the union to become the 28th state, 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.130
 and to make the number of stars happy again. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 This happy marriage almost immediately led to the Mexican-American War about the question 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 how big Texas was. America, being the winner, was allowed to choose the answer: very big. 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.920
 While Texas gave up its independence to join the union, they gave them independence 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.649
 did not write down - and filed their divorce, along with a number of other states, just under 15 years later. 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.039
 This domestic dispute was not settled with flowers, but with force, something that many 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 are grumpy about today. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.129
 But history aside, in modern times could Texas still become a real country? In other words: 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.260
 Will Texas succeed in seceding? 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 In terms of population, an independent Texas would be the 46th largest country 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.620
 with 26 million citizens. And those citizens would make Texas the 13th largest economy. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.620
 Thus, the New Republic of Texas would be comparable to Australia, except for the size. 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.160
 But what happens to the federal money that goes to Texas? Building interstate highways 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.970
 not yourself, you knew. For most of the states, independence would be a financial one 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.220
 be a problem. Mississippi, for example, gets two dollars from Washington per individual being 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 sends taxes. Thus, an inevitable Magnolia republic would almost immediately fall. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.670
 Except Texas, which gives more money to the federal government, than it gets back. 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.250
 There is no reason why Texas cannot leave its highways paved * and * their population 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.920
 to give a small happy Texafhakigheidheiddag tax reduction. 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 So, from a financial perspective, the New Republic of Texas would have an advantage. 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 Now the question is; can Texas secede legally? And the answer is ... no ... not at all. 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.860
 In spite of popular belief, even by politicians, who should know better, the Texas Constitution includes 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.200
 no leaving-union-no-obligation clause how much like Texans, or residents of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.860
 other states, wish it did. 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610
 Although, the Texas Constitution has a weird clause that gives itself the opportunity to self 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.659
 to be divided into five states without the approval of Congress. So Texas can explode into any moment 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.189
 the states probably called: North Texas, South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and Austin. -- which 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.510
 his strength in the Senate would increase fivefold - but not necessarily help to gain independence 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.950
 because there is no legal process for a state to leave the union. 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.439
 Although the constitution is silent on that issue, separation should come before the Federal Supreme Court 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.340
 and shockingly enough, the Federal Supreme Court of the United States has decided that states should 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.379
 Cannot leave the United States. 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.090
 But the legal question is a strange kind of dispute. Finally, the first Texas Replubliek 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.569
 didn't just happen - Texas was originally a state of Mexico, which is Texas 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.859
 did not give permission to leave, but Texas did, or less harmoniously 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.969
 circumstances. 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.680
 While a war between the New Republic and Texas is hard to imagine, is 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.540
 it's not hard to imagine who wins that fight. Texas has its own army, but seriously, 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.019
 no one beats America in war. 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.120
 So the only way for Texas to leave is to convince the United States to be 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.769
 to change laws to allow it. Which would only have the chance as a majority 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 wants independence from Texas, which is not the case afterwards. 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.299
 So while a New Republic of Texas is interesting to think about - especially for some non-Texans, 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.360
 from now on it's a long way to reality.
