00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.761
We're going to backtrack, for just a second,
to make sure that you understand the steps

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:08.229
that are required to multiply two
polynomials together. So we're just going

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.689
to incrementally build up to getting the
final answer for this. So for the purposes

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.143
of this quiz, I want you to act like
you're only doing step 1 of solving this

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.654
problem or of simplifying this expression
rather. So for now, please just treat this

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.911
first factor, the x+5, as a block, so as a
single unit, and then distribute it to

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:29.063
each of the two terms inside the second
set of parentheses and then write out what

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.955
you would have in the slots over here on
the right.
