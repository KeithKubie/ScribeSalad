00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Break up suck

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.220
And there's no way around them other than going through the hoops

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.100
As painful as it is right now

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.080
We want you to know that it won't always be this way

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.860
Here are the 7 stages of heart break

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.160
1. Obsession for answers

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.580
We often yearn for closure

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.020
Because the confusion hurts too much

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.060
But closure doesn't always come

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.320
And more importantly

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.100
It doesn't change the outcome

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.460
You might be determined to gather answers from your ex partner's family, friends or co-workers

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.500
But eventually

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Playing "detective" gets old

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.100
Which is why you move to stage 2

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.820
Which is why you move to stage 2

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.640
2. Denial

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.500
You might have stopped searching for clues and answers

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700
But this doesn't mean you're ready to accept things just 
yet

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.160
It's too much for you to process still

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.000
So, you're avoiding it for now

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.920
Hoping it's just a bad dream you'll wake up from

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.540
3. Sorrow

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.460
But no matter how hard you tried denying the truths

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.460
It eventually catches up to you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.160
You start asking yourself

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.200
"Why me!"

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.300
And this time, you really let the water works out

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.420
4. Relapse

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.260
So, you finally managed to see the break up is really happening

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
But you're not ready to let them go

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.340
You tried to win them back, and come up with a million reasons "why they should still be with you"

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.160
5. Anger

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.840
But, it doesn't work

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.640
You feel fed up and angry about the situation

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.120
You start holding on to grudges

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.540
because it's better than not holding on to anything at all

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480
6. Acceptance

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.480
But even then, you eventually grow tired of resenting your ex

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.820
So you try something healthier, by accepting the break up for what it is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.320
You're not necessarily happy about it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560
But you're no longer bitter either

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.500
7. Hopefulness

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.260
Break up can leaves us feeling scarred and doubtful

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.980
But, the heart know how to mend over time

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.060
when you're ready

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
You start dating again, and see you past relationship as a lesson

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.660
it's important to remember that all the heart break you go through should be taken as an experience

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.640
Each one brings you one step closer to finding the perfect one

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.540
Are you going through a break up?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.620
