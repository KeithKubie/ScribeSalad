sometimes it's going to be vice versa
but on average you should go up to about

but on average you should go up to about
 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.050
but on average you should go up to about
fifty percent right so if you do this a

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060
fifty percent right so if you do this a
 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.820

Russia we see a very different

Russia we see a very different
 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.240
Russia we see a very different
distribution and not only do we see that

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250
distribution and not only do we see that
 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.939
distribution and not only do we see that
we see these conspicuous spikes right

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949
we see these conspicuous spikes right
 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.589
we see these conspicuous spikes right
around the fifty percent margin that

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599
around the fifty percent margin that
 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.930
around the fifty percent margin that
really shouldn't be there if the results

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940
really shouldn't be there if the results
 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.629
really shouldn't be there if the results
had not been doctored also around the

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530
fifty sixty seventy eighty percent
 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.450
fifty sixty seventy eighty percent
spikes we see these increases in vote

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460
spikes we see these increases in vote
 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.850
spikes we see these increases in vote
share for United Russia that if this

process were to happen without human
 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.320
process were to happen without human
intervention we should not see those

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330
intervention we should not see those
 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.659
intervention we should not see those
spikes so it's very likely that vote

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669
spikes so it's very likely that vote
 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.700

the vote was forty-nine percent decided

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:29.569
the vote was forty-nine percent decided
 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:30.939
the vote was forty-nine percent decided
you know 49-percent doesn't look so

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:30.949
you know 49-percent doesn't look so
 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:33.249
you know 49-percent doesn't look so
great we got to get it up to 50 so and

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:33.259
great we got to get it up to 50 so and
 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:34.659
great we got to get it up to 50 so and
that seems to happen continually

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669
that seems to happen continually
 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.550
that seems to happen continually
throughout the distribution so this

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560
throughout the distribution so this
 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.010
throughout the distribution so this
suggests that there was a lot of ballot

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020
suggests that there was a lot of ballot
 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.779
suggests that there was a lot of ballot

attention paid to this but I but there's
 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.309
attention paid to this but I but there's
a saying in election monitoring that

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319
a saying in election monitoring that
 

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.620
a saying in election monitoring that
only amateur steal elections on Election

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:50.630
only amateur steal elections on Election

only amateur steal elections on Election
Day I think one of the things we need to

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:52.909
Day I think one of the things we need to
 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:54.219
Day I think one of the things we need to
take into account is that the bigger

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:54.229
take into account is that the bigger
 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.290
take into account is that the bigger
biases in the Russian electoral process

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:56.300
biases in the Russian electoral process
 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.629
biases in the Russian electoral process
happened much earlier the biases and the

harassment of opposition figures okay so
 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.779
harassment of opposition figures okay so
we need to take these bigger picture

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:13.789
we need to take these bigger picture
 

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:17.200
we need to take these bigger picture
questions into account okay the protests

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.210
questions into account okay the protests
 

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.959
questions into account okay the protests
many people have pointed out that this

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:19.969
many people have pointed out that this
 

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:21.149
many people have pointed out that this

President Medvedev himself who is now
 

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.280
President Medvedev himself who is now
treated as a kind of figure of fun in

Russian politics and who in many ways
 

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:46.200
Russian politics and who in many ways
deserves it he's not probably got even

deserves it he's not probably got even
 

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.130
deserves it he's not probably got even
though I think he said in the past

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.140
though I think he said in the past
 

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.210

couple of days he might run for

president again probably not got the
 

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.940
president again probably not got the
brightest political future and yet I

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:53.950
brightest political future and yet I
 

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.350
brightest political future and yet I
think that he is tenure as president was

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360
think that he is tenure as president was
 

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.980
think that he is tenure as president was
actually quite significant for the

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:01.990
actually quite significant for the
 

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.550
actually quite significant for the
emergence of this kind of elite

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:04.560
emergence of this kind of elite
 

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.760
emergence of this kind of elite
dissatisfaction and the opposition that

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:08.770

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.840
dissatisfaction and the opposition that
we've been talking about and the

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:12.850
we've been talking about and the
 

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.460
we've been talking about and the
normalcy that he was trying to suggest

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.470
normalcy that he was trying to suggest
 

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.560
normalcy that he was trying to suggest
he had brought to the presidency was it

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.570
he had brought to the presidency was it
 

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.660
he had brought to the presidency was it
of course a kind of phone or Mille see

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:21.670
of course a kind of phone or Mille see
 

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:26.160
of course a kind of phone or Mille see
and yet his tenure as president was

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.170
and yet his tenure as president was
 

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.770
and yet his tenure as president was
marked by relentless criticism of

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:28.780
marked by relentless criticism of
 

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:34.260
marked by relentless criticism of
putinism and that I think slowly began

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.270
putinism and that I think slowly began
 

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.650
putinism and that I think slowly began
to erode the restraints that people felt

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:37.660
to erode the restraints that people felt
 

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.640
to erode the restraints that people felt
in expressing their own dissatisfaction

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:41.650
in expressing their own dissatisfaction

with the status quo I think it removed

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360
as well but I think he made a little
 

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.080
as well but I think he made a little
contribution to it which we should

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.090
contribution to it which we should
 

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:59.090
contribution to it which we should
recognize began to erode fear in this

was going on and I think that view is
much more widespread than it used to be

much more widespread than it used to be
 

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.950

going to begin by talking about kind of
 

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.220
going to begin by talking about kind of
that perspective and then I'm going to

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:28.230
that perspective and then I'm going to
 

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.690
that perspective and then I'm going to
talk about what that might tell us about

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700
talk about what that might tell us about
 

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.140

what could happen next and then what how

people spoke frequently about the

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.170
people spoke frequently about the
 

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.750
people spoke frequently about the
electoral breakthrough model of

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760
electoral breakthrough model of
 

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.250
electoral breakthrough model of
democratic development if you're working

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260
democratic development if you're working
 

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.630
democratic development if you're working
in democracy assistance you were

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640
in democracy assistance you were
 

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.580
in democracy assistance you were
expected to know about this and this was

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:40.590
expected to know about this and this was
 

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.900
expected to know about this and this was
kind of a standard model and the model

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:41.910
kind of a standard model and the model
 

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.120
kind of a standard model and the model
went something like there would be a

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.130
went something like there would be a
 

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.460
went something like there would be a
stolen election and it would be 12 and

they would go to the streets and and

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:53.850
they would go to the streets and and

then a miracle happens and and that was

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.070
then a miracle happens and and that was
 

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.560
then a miracle happens and and that was
kind of the theory here then a miracle

kind of the theory here then a miracle
happens and you have democracy and but

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:20.160
happens and you have democracy and but
 

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.100
happens and you have democracy and but
but there were other elements of that

part of that miracle happening was the

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760
part of that miracle happening was the
 

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.880
part of that miracle happening was the
fracturing of the political elites and

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:31.890
fracturing of the political elites and
 

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.580

that government so so that was a very
 

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.180

and then three things happen right first

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:04.890
and then three things happen right first
 

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.230
and then three things happen right first
thing happened is that post-election

leading to change so by 2005 you have

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:10.140
leading to change so by 2005 you have
 

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.110
leading to change so by 2005 you have
the color revolution which overthrew the

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.120
the color revolution which overthrew the
 

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.880
the color revolution which overthrew the
iliev regime in Azerbaijan and the

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:13.890
iliev regime in Azerbaijan and the
 

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:14.810
iliev regime in Azerbaijan and the
reason you haven't heard of that

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820
reason you haven't heard of that
 

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.180
reason you haven't heard of that
because it failed and didn't happen in

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.190
because it failed and didn't happen in
 

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.680
because it failed and didn't happen in
2006 similar events with lukashenko in

Belarus which failed and didn't happen
 

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.280
Belarus which failed and didn't happen
so you have now this kind of evening of

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:22.290
so you have now this kind of evening of
 

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.630
so you have now this kind of evening of
the scales where sometimes the color

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:23.640
the scales where sometimes the color
 

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.400
the scales where sometimes the color

revolution model works and sometimes it
 

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.720

doesn't then 2010 in Kyrgyzstan followed

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:29.730
doesn't then 2010 in Kyrgyzstan followed
 

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.030
doesn't then 2010 in Kyrgyzstan followed
by 2011 in several countries in North

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040
by 2011 in several countries in North

some kind of breakthrough of some kind

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:36.600
some kind of breakthrough of some kind
 

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.380
some kind of breakthrough of some kind
obviously a little premature and or just

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:39.390
obviously a little premature and or just
 

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.580
obviously a little premature and or just
wrong to call them Democratic

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:40.590
wrong to call them Democratic
 

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.230
wrong to call them Democratic
breakthroughs but they were not linked

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240
breakthroughs but they were not linked
 

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.700
breakthroughs but they were not linked
to election so it began to think maybe

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:43.710
to election so it began to think maybe
 

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.710
to election so it began to think maybe
elections aren't the key part of that

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720
elections aren't the key part of that
 

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.880
elections aren't the key part of that
miracle happening maybe we don't need

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:46.890
miracle happening maybe we don't need
 

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:48.290
miracle happening maybe we don't need
that so that on the left side of the

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300
that so that on the left side of the
 

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.570
that so that on the left side of the
equation and then of course what

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580
equation and then of course what
 

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.740
equation and then of course what
happened is we began to look at the

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:51.750
happened is we began to look at the
 

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.120
happened is we began to look at the
countries where the color revolutions

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:53.130
countries where the color revolutions
 

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:54.890
countries where the color revolutions
actually had occurred and we said hmm

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:54.900
actually had occurred and we said hmm
 

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.450
actually had occurred and we said hmm
maybe this doesn't have much do it

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460
maybe this doesn't have much do it
 

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.400
maybe this doesn't have much do it
democracy right kyrgyzstan went quickly

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:58.410
democracy right kyrgyzstan went quickly
 

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:00.110
democracy right kyrgyzstan went quickly
back into being a semi authoritarian

regime Georgia became a different kind

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820
regime Georgia became a different kind
 

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.430
regime Georgia became a different kind
of semi democratic regime that it had

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440
of semi democratic regime that it had
 

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.840
of semi democratic regime that it had
been or in some people's eyes a semi

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:05.850
been or in some people's eyes a semi
 

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.030
been or in some people's eyes a semi
authoritarian regime and Ukraine you

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040
authoritarian regime and Ukraine you
 

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.570
authoritarian regime and Ukraine you
know the couch mode shiancoe Yanukovych

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:10.580
know the couch mode shiancoe Yanukovych
 

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.680
know the couch mode shiancoe Yanukovych
direction of Ukrainian politics is

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:12.690
direction of Ukrainian politics is
 

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.450
direction of Ukrainian politics is
fascinating but it's not revolutionary

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460
fascinating but it's not revolutionary
 

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.050
fascinating but it's not revolutionary
in that sense and what we've learned is

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060
in that sense and what we've learned is
 

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.880
in that sense and what we've learned is
that when authoritarian or semi

there's opposition out there so maybe we

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:05.380
there's opposition out there so maybe we
 

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.499
there's opposition out there so maybe we

instability results from that that's
 

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.970
instability results from that that's
what that's what political transitions

significant will that instability be I

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:01.860
significant will that instability be I
 

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.130
significant will that instability be I

hearing in the elite

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:08.310
hearing in the elite
 

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:11.030

can still get support from the West the
 

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:19.850
can still get support from the West the
problem is you can't always get support

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:19.860

from your people and at the end of the

it's interesting we might think of
 

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:24.080
it's interesting we might think of
whether we'll get boonton return of

01:21:19.529 --> 01:21:19.539
dynamic of popular opposition is going
 

01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:24.600
dynamic of popular opposition is going
to turn out to be some growing number

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:24.610
to turn out to be some growing number
 

01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:28.680
to turn out to be some growing number
and its already large people in Russia

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:28.690
and its already large people in Russia

and its already large people in Russia
think that this rigged arrangement in

think that this rigged arrangement in
 

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:39.660
think that this rigged arrangement in
which Putin is able to win by keeping

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:39.670
which Putin is able to win by keeping
 

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:47.040
which Putin is able to win by keeping
out a legitimate opponents is something

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:47.050
out a legitimate opponents is something
 

01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:50.549
out a legitimate opponents is something
that just drives them nuts and does that

01:21:50.549 --> 01:21:50.559
that just drives them nuts and does that
 

01:21:50.559 --> 01:21:54.209
that just drives them nuts and does that
turn out to be strong enough motivation

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:54.219
turn out to be strong enough motivation
 

01:21:54.219 --> 01:21:58.919
turn out to be strong enough motivation
for an ongoing political campaign of

01:21:58.919 --> 01:21:58.929
for an ongoing political campaign of
 

01:21:58.929 --> 01:22:01.080
for an ongoing political campaign of
opposition to the regime we don't really

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:01.090
opposition to the regime we don't really
 

01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:05.009
opposition to the regime we don't really
know one quite in Booley might actually

01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:05.019
know one quite in Booley might actually
 

01:22:05.019 --> 01:22:06.509
know one quite in Booley might actually
be interested to hear people's views on

01:22:06.509 --> 01:22:06.519
be interested to hear people's views on

the first round VERSE win versus a

01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:08.860
the first round VERSE win versus a
 

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.399
the first round VERSE win versus a
second round what could the incumbents

01:22:11.399 --> 01:22:11.409
second round what could the incumbents
 

01:22:11.409 --> 01:22:13.259
second round what could the incumbents
try really hard in these kinds of

01:22:13.259 --> 01:22:13.269
try really hard in these kinds of
 

01:22:13.269 --> 01:22:15.239
try really hard in these kinds of
situations to avoid that second round

01:22:15.239 --> 01:22:15.249
situations to avoid that second round
 

01:22:15.249 --> 01:22:19.459
situations to avoid that second round
because that situation is very

01:22:19.459 --> 01:22:19.469
because that situation is very
 

01:22:19.469 --> 01:22:24.259
because that situation is very
unpredictable particularly if there is a

01:22:24.259 --> 01:22:24.269
unpredictable particularly if there is a
 

01:22:24.269 --> 01:22:32.459
unpredictable particularly if there is a
lot of sense that the opposition is was

01:22:32.459 --> 01:22:32.469
lot of sense that the opposition is was
 

01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:35.430
lot of sense that the opposition is was
was cheated in some way so I I mean but

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440
was cheated in some way so I I mean but
 

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.529
was cheated in some way so I I mean but
for example including pro could of India

01:22:37.529 --> 01:22:37.539
for example including pro could of India
 

01:22:37.539 --> 01:22:41.640

in the election who's the candid ease

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:41.650
in the election who's the candid ease
 

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:44.699
in the election who's the candid ease
most likely to steal votes from right

01:22:44.699 --> 01:22:44.709
most likely to steal votes from right
 

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:49.190
most likely to steal votes from right
it's not Zhuge enough it's not

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:49.200
 

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.940
janoski it's probably Putin right so if

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:53.950
janoski it's probably Putin right so if
 

01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:56.540
janoski it's probably Putin right so if
the goal is to win on the first round

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:56.550
the goal is to win on the first round
 

01:22:56.550 --> 01:23:00.180
the goal is to win on the first round
that that seems to me to be a little bit

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:00.190
that that seems to me to be a little bit
 

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.510
that that seems to me to be a little bit
odd maybe the notion is that broken up

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520
odd maybe the notion is that broken up
 

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.760
odd maybe the notion is that broken up
comes in third and then throws his

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:05.770
comes in third and then throws his
 

01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:08.310
comes in third and then throws his
support behind Putin because we really

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320
support behind Putin because we really
 

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.530
support behind Putin because we really
don't want to sue gone off maybe that's

01:23:10.530 --> 01:23:10.540
don't want to sue gone off maybe that's
 

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.820
don't want to sue gone off maybe that's
the idea but it does seem to me to make

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:14.830
the idea but it does seem to me to make
 

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.520
the idea but it does seem to me to make
a second a first-round victory a little

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:17.530
a second a first-round victory a little
 

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:21.930
a second a first-round victory a little
bit more difficult to achieve again not

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:21.940
bit more difficult to achieve again not
 

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.990
bit more difficult to achieve again not
not knowing much about Russia I mean

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000
not knowing much about Russia I mean
 

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.520
not knowing much about Russia I mean
there is the Ukraine precedent you don't

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:26.530
there is the Ukraine precedent you don't
 

01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.200
there is the Ukraine precedent you don't
want to have that second round yeah that

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:28.210
want to have that second round yeah that
 

01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:30.150
want to have that second round yeah that
that does that Kenan but that was

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:30.160
that does that Kenan but that was
 

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.380
that does that Kenan but that was
different because it was so close in the

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:31.390
different because it was so close in the
 

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:34.500
different because it was so close in the
first round as well um the Georgia 2008

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:34.510
first round as well um the Georgia 2008
 

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.479
first round as well um the Georgia 2008
president a precedent is different there

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:36.489
president a precedent is different there
 

01:23:36.489 --> 01:23:38.400
president a precedent is different there
the president didn't want the second

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:38.410
the president didn't want the second
 

01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.810
the president didn't want the second
round because we perceived the sign of

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:39.820
round because we perceived the sign of
 

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.460
round because we perceived the sign of
weakness even though even though it

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:41.470
weakness even though even though it
 

01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:42.600
weakness even though even though it
would have cleaned up in the semi and

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:42.610
would have cleaned up in the semi and
 

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:43.710
would have cleaned up in the semi and
actually won by a much more resounding

01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:43.720
actually won by a much more resounding
 

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:47.790
actually won by a much more resounding
margin um in Russia you also you know

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800
margin um in Russia you also you know
 

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.200
margin um in Russia you also you know
it's reminded of when Edwin Edwards ran

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.210
it's reminded of when Edwin Edwards ran
 

01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:50.820
it's reminded of when Edwin Edwards ran
against David Duke and the Democratic

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:50.830
against David Duke and the Democratic
 

01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:52.080
against David Duke and the Democratic
Party made bumper stickers and said

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.090
Party made bumper stickers and said
 

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.840
Party made bumper stickers and said
those for the crook it's important oh

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:53.850
those for the crook it's important oh
 

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:56.640
those for the crook it's important oh
it's it's you know if if you get that

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:56.650
it's it's you know if if you get that
 

01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:58.440
it's it's you know if if you get that
runoff against the best place we're

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:58.450
runoff against the best place we're
 

01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.760
runoff against the best place we're
going to be is having a run off with

01:23:59.760 --> 01:23:59.770
going to be is having a run off with
 

01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:02.070
going to be is having a run off with
someone who is just more despised than

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080
someone who is just more despised than
 

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.830
someone who is just more despised than
he and if he can set that up without all

01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840
he and if he can set that up without all
 

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.660
he and if he can set that up without all
the pitfalls along the way I don't think

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:06.670
the pitfalls along the way I don't think
 

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:07.979
the pitfalls along the way I don't think
he can that would be the best thing yeah

01:24:07.979 --> 01:24:07.989
he can that would be the best thing yeah
 

01:24:07.989 --> 01:24:09.270
he can that would be the best thing yeah
actually I wanted to just you your

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280
actually I wanted to just you your
 

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.150
actually I wanted to just you your
question very quickly to about Europe

01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:12.160
question very quickly to about Europe
 

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.790
question very quickly to about Europe
and what happens in Europe you there's

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800
and what happens in Europe you there's
 

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:23.790
and what happens in Europe you there's
been debate okay yeah yes so so the the

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800
been debate okay yeah yes so so the the
 

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.700
been debate okay yeah yes so so the the
I mean issue is if you're up goes south

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:26.710
I mean issue is if you're up goes south
 

01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:28.710
I mean issue is if you're up goes south
this will just make it that much more

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:28.720
this will just make it that much more
 

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.510
this will just make it that much more
difficult for Putin to govern going

01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520
difficult for Putin to govern going
 

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.160
difficult for Putin to govern going
forward because growth will be harder to

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:32.170
forward because growth will be harder to
 

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.560
forward because growth will be harder to
achieve the approval ratings that were

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:34.570
achieve the approval ratings that were
 

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.630
achieve the approval ratings that were
high are not going to be what they were

01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:36.640
high are not going to be what they were
 

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.630
high are not going to be what they were
and particularly if he wins on a sudden

01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:39.640
and particularly if he wins on a sudden
 

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.540
and particularly if he wins on a sudden
in a second round well then that the

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:42.550
in a second round well then that the
 

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:44.100
in a second round well then that the
formula for governing looks very

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:44.110
formula for governing looks very
 

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:46.229
formula for governing looks very
different so in some sense people have

01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239
different so in some sense people have
 

01:24:46.239 --> 01:24:47.760
different so in some sense people have
said well will the presidential

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:47.770

elections in change Russia Russian
politics in some sense they already have

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:52.900
politics in some sense they already have
 

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.130
politics in some sense they already have
I mean that you know that this room is

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:56.140
I mean that you know that this room is
 

01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.790
I mean that you know that this room is
full i think is testament

01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800
full i think is testament
 

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.839
full i think is testament
to the interest in the topic which I

01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:05.849
to the interest in the topic which I
 

01:25:05.849 --> 01:25:07.279
to the interest in the topic which I
think if we would have poll if we would

01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:07.289
think if we would have poll if we would
 

01:25:07.289 --> 01:25:10.100
think if we would have poll if we would
have had this event for months ago and

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:10.110
have had this event for months ago and
 

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.080
have had this event for months ago and

asked everybody will you come to this

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.959
event on january 26 the turnout would
have been a lot lower ex ante and not

01:25:17.959 --> 01:25:17.969

01:25:17.969 --> 01:25:20.089
have been a lot lower ex ante and not
knowing what was going to happen after

01:25:20.089 --> 01:25:20.099
