00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.560
Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.440
Well, this is embarrassing. The Nostalgia Critic on the Nerd DVD.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.320
You're probably wondering what the hell I'm doing here, well...

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
You see, we had a little bet a while ago.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.980
I bet that the Nerd wouldn't be able to make his gigantic opus, let alone get it on DVD or show it in a bunch of theaters to tons of people.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
Obviously I lost... So, he gave me one of two options.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360
Either do a review of the movie...

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.880
Or be whipped like a horse, pulling him down the streets of Chicago with a sign on me saying "I'm a fatty fatty fuck fuck".

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.560
It was a tough call. Let's get this over with.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.900
Remember that bunch of kids in high school, who said they wanted to make movies?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.620
Remember how they used to show you all their films they worked so hard on?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.720
Remember how no matter what, you were always so impressed with how they put all their passion and all their love into every single frame they shot?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.600
And despite all the dedication that they put into every single frame...

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.860
Didn't you just HATE those fucking films?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.360
The lame effects, the hokey acting, the stories that made no sense whatsoever?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.800
Well, the world loves to reward the insane, and this is the fruit of their labor.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480
Hey, you paid for it, so it only makes sense that you should PAY for it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.480
Let's not waste another second. Let's take a look at NERRRDDDD! The movie.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.840
We start off with a backstory about the world's most hated video game...

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.680
...spin off, which is in no way related to the world's actual most hated video game.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.080
We swear!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.800
"This is when they produced a game based on the highest grossing film of that year: Stephen Spielberg's E.T.."

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.580
"The end result was a strange and incoherent game that alienated devoted gamers."

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.900
Well no wonder, they couldn't even get the character's color right, or spell his name correctly.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.740
It was two letters, how could you fuck that up?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.620
"Will fans be eager to buy a game based off of such a reputation, even though the new version will be better?"

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620
"It won't be better, we'll make it even worse."

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.160
"Highly irregular..."
"Research shows gamers these days are playing games they hate."

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.160
"They think bad is the new good. Consequently, we'll cut our expenses and double our profits."

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.980
And internet critics will make thousands off of them!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.520
Dance puppets, dance! (Manic laughter)

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.520
I mean, uh, ahem... You monsters.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.640
But how will they convince people to play it? All by using needless profanity's holy grail,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.700
As a montage happens showing all of his fans praising the Nerd's work.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.260
"Custom T-shirt right here!"

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.140
"Well who else can you think of that actually cuddles up with an AVGN plush doll?"

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.180
"Got a Angry Video Game Nerd tattoo."

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.100
"I got that immortalized in ink."

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.660
Ha! That's nothing. Take a look at the fan videos I get all the time!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.200
Over phone: Hey Critic, remember the fight with the Nerd we were all angry at originally?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.540
Over phone: When are you gonna do another one of those?

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.600
But it turns out the Nerd has a real life.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.300
Yeah, wouldn't you expect that from someone whose legal name is apparently... "Nerd"?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.340
He works at a video game store, has an angry boss who yells at him, he even has a quirky black sidekick.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.940
"You've gotta make some unique sacrifices."

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.200
"No physical fitness, no social popularity..."

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.520
No bad green screening, no claiming you're filming this for an album that confusingly makes no sense...

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.540
"Album's gonna be good."

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.380
And most importantly: No starring in early 2000s sitcoms or direct-to-DVD Disney sequels.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.780
The exploiting of IMDB must flow.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.840
But, sure enough, a lot of cameos come into the store requesting the Nerd review the original E.T.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.120
Or, as I should pronounce it, "Eee Tee".

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.720
"You know what? I heard that Atari recalled all the cartridges..."

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.260
No, no, I already have a quirky black sidekick.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.720
Call me if you can get me a Ninja Turtle, preferably one that's been in the Brady Bunch.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.180
It must flow.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.960
But a representative from "Cockburn Inc."-

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.180
Yeah, that's really the- Ehh...

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.020
-Comes in to tell him about their plan to review Eee Tee.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.500
He doesn't take it well.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.380
Oh my god, I've never seen so much green vomit come out of one person's hand!

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.820
Oh, except that one time...

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.480
Yeah, that was weird.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.560
He obviously says no, but has a dream that night to help him provide trailer fodder.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.040
Like look, zombies! Look there's zombies in the movie everybody, you like zombies right?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.600
The Nerd fights zombies, we could put that on the poster somewhere!

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.140
I do realize that Bear McCreery, who did the music, didn't use The Walking Dead theme for a scene that had zombies...

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.100
But at least he played a zombie in there! Does that count?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.860
No it doesn't! I want an apology, Mr. McCreery! In C minor!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
I don't think you meant it.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.420
"We're gonna find that landfill and prove that there's nothing under there."

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.020
So he agrees that if they do find any games under there, he'd review them.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.620
But Cooper says they need proper equipment. Which brings in the representative, named Mandi, back onto the scene.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.040
"I also really don't like the idea of bringing this girl with us."

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.320
"Relax Nerd, she's our producer. And she's not a girl; she's a gamer."

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.380
Yeah, what?

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.240
"Everything alright over there?"

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.840
"The fans need you more than ever, Nerd."

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.160
So the road trip is on as Mandi keeps her team updated on her progress.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.580
"Don't get too close to these nerds. They are the product!"

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.920
"Don't worry Mr. Cockburn, they're just a couple of dorks."

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.580
And I'm not just saying that to reinforce the irony that they're going to win me over with their charm, because as this movie has clearly shown, they have none.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.500
What, is he going to turn into Hunter S. Thompson by the time the movie's over?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.060
We were somewhere in New Mexico, in the middle of the desert, when the dumb began to take hold.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.080
But evil... Evilness is keeping a close eye on them as they're apparently getting too close to their secret operation.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
"I'll take care of this."

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.080
Good lord, he's harnessing the power of Mattel's Missile Command!

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.380
"That's a little excessive... Sir?"

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.720
"Ohhh, maybe you're right."

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.680
Oh, thank Jesus, we almost lost an entire toenail to one of those.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.000
"Goddamn terrorist alien hunters!"

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
As they send out a crew to investigate, Team Exposition discusses a mythical creature so strange,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.220
And so NOT having anything to do with what's going on at the moment.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.620
"Santa Claus is real."

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.020
"Well, you probably believe the world is flat."

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.860
"The world IS flat."

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.080
"What about Heaven and Hell? Do you believe in that?"

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.120
"Yeah, that all comes down to the cyber mutant death god living under Mt. Fuji. He created both God and Satan."

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400
Oh come on, I can't see anything past your foreshadowing!

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:37.320
And thus we have our monster, so grand and so terrifying that you'll be yelling all throughout the film... How do you say his name again?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.120
"Death Mwauthzyx."

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.400
Teth Mwawziks?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.020
"Death Mwauthzyx."

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.380
Death mom sick?

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.000
"Death Mwauthzyx."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.440
Dick moth sex?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.940
"Death Mwauthzyx."

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.420
So be afraid, coming to destroy your city is TFPHFFMWXICKS.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.280
Marketing must've loved you.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.840
"With a single turn of the satellite dish on top of his head, every universe in the multiverse will disappear."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.520
"Non-existence, no space, nothing?"

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.640
"Nope. Well, one thing will remain: a bologna sandwich."

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.640
"Why a bologna sandwich", you might ask?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.340
Because bologna's a funny word.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.440
You could have easily said "cabbage", "banana", or "Lake Titicaca". None of it would have changed the story.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.280
Though "banana" might...

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.400
But hell, for the sake of canon, and to keep in the theme of the movie,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.660
The reason only a bologna sandwich would be left in the universe is...

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.180
"Cock-a-puss".

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.060
I don't know what it is, but hey, if they could make up a story for TFFPHWICKS; I'm sure I can make up one for that too.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.600
But the military comes in to arrest them.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.060
"It's the fuzz! We don't have a permit, I'm going to make a run for it!"

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.560
Hey, it's how shooting for most of the movie went.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.660
"Get me the fuck out of here!"

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:55.080
And that's the line most uttered on the set. Are you sure they didn't just forget to turn the camera off during certain scenes?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.460
"Hands on the vehicle!"

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.060
"All right, all right honey. Don't get your panties in a wad."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.300
"I'm not wearing any panties."

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.520
Well, I'm sure you just made a perverted little five year old boy's sexual fantasy come true.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.020
But the General accidentally blows up his arm-

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.220
Just a flesh wound!

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.120
-and they escape through a car chase.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.720
"What the hell is that?"
"Fruit, sir!"

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.800
"Did you see the size of those melons? Take a note, McButter."

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.700
Well, I'm sure you just made a perverted little FOUR year old boy's sexual fantasy come true.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.520
They outrun them and decide to go searching for the person who designed the original Eee Tee game.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.760
But they find the place is full of poorly rendered booby traps.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.680
Hey, as long as it is not as hard as the original Japanese Mario Bros. 2, you'll be alright.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.500
They don't find the creator per se; but a man named Mr. Zandor, a scientist who used to work at Area 51.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.020
"Did you know the Atari logo was based off Mount Fuji?"

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.780
"I always found that odd. Well, how may I help you?"

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.760
God, this foreshadowing is just as well woven-in as a basket with TWO holes in it!

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.080
"When that sucker crashed in the dessert, it broke up like one of those clay pigeons in 'Duck Hunt'."

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.660
"There was metallic debris all over the desert."

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.820
"Or debris(pronounced de-bres)."

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.320
"No, it's debris."

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.260
"Well, there's an s; why isn't it pronounced 'debres'?"

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.880
I don't know. How come you always say "burry" instead of "bury"?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.380
"We need to 'burry' it in the past where it belongs."

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.220
It's one r!

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.240
He explains how an alien ship DID crash into Area 51 and that the secret to how to get inside is hidden within Eee Tee.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.740
On top of that, an innocent alien life is still kept in captivity.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.400
"Oooh, we have an alien now too, huh?"

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.040
"Geez, don't people ever get bored of all this Area 51 nonsense?"

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.560
Yeah, hard to believe seeing how the Nerd hasn't come across ANY strange aliens or monsters in the past.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.800
"For now, make yourselves at home. There are video games upstairs."

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.380
So, the team just sort of... Takes it easy for a bit I guess.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.960
I suppose if I found out aliens were real, I'd just play on the Power Pad or reflect filming lights off of my glasses too.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.620
Pfft, amateurs.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.120
But when trying to get a better reception, Mandi gets caught, but promises to take them to Zandor's house.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.980
Of course leading them to all the funniest places they can take pictures of and green screen in later.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.020
"The girl man, we have to ditch her!"

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.740
"I thought she was a gamer, not a girl."

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.880
"She's not a gamer. These are phony prescription glasses with fake plastic lenses."

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.540
"It was all an act, don't you understand? She's bait!"

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.540
"Why would she do this?"
"To appear more nerdy."

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.980
By God, there really ARE fake gamer girls. Every internet troll that's never had sex before is right!

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.280
Congratulations!
"Yay!"

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.540
And you still never had sex!
"Awww!"

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.140
But word gets around about the Nerd's journey, and people form a huge gathering around the landfill,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.860
Populated by all the leftover cameos that couldn't be fit in anywhere else.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.760
"Fellow gamers, may I have your attention?"
(Applause)

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:16.880
When the Nerd tries to tell them it's all bullshit, lo and behold, the designer of Eee Tee himself comes in: Howard Scott Warshaw.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:24.080
"I've seen your videos. I know you are a frank and honest man. People like us, we don't cover things up."

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.540
"Wouldn't this world be a better world if people told the truth?"

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.100
If a lot of people learned to tell the truth, the world would be a better place to live.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.020
"The truth, Nerd. That is what you must find."

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:48.120
There goes the best, and yet somehow worst video game designer of all time! He'll most likely get a job at EA Games.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:57.900
But the Nerd still thinks he can debunk the myth, so he gets dressed up in worse effects than... Well, the movie's I guess, and manages to not-so-subtly sneak his way in.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.180
"Whoooa! Ow, shit! Ow!"

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.120
I fall! It's my thing!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.620
Sure enough, the inside looks just like the video game, and he gets himself caught.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:17.120
So it's revealed that Zandor replaced all of the space metal with tinfoil. Because of this, the General decides to blow up Mount Fuji.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.620
I'm surprised you don't see the connection there.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.600
"So long Nerd, and thank YOU for telling the truth!"

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:35.040
Damn fool, don't you know that duct taped, cardboard doors lightly pushed together are the strongest things in the world? Damn fool!

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.520
But it looks like the alien escapes, and helps the Nerd do so as well.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.560
"I thought you were just a hoax!"
"Yeah, we get a lot of that around here."

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.660
Clearly, his race is so advanced that their mouths don't even have to close to form audible words.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:58.220
Sure enough, TFFPHWICKS is finally released, looking as evil as a ceramic Tim Curry fucking a ceramic Doctor Octopus.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.260
You know, can you imagine actually asking for a tank in this shoot?

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:15.440
No really, we just want to tell a story about a video game puppet who has to stop a bigger video game puppet, all coming from an internet series I shot in my basement.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.340
-Fuck no!

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.740
Well, we'll have hot ladies hitting each other.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.840
-Duh, okay!

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.940
So TFFPHWICKS flies around the globe, destroying the Earth...

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.800
...Or practices destroying the play size model of Earth, before actually destroying the real thing.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.680
God, I've seen more carnage out of a toddler destroying his happy meal toy. In fact, are you are sure that's not what I'm watching?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:51.320
But McButter agrees to challenge Mandi to a fight because... Again, they had to get that tank somehow, and they partake in chick-on-chick martial arts.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:15:00.300
"You know, I thought I could get through this without objectifying myself in a sexy cat fight... But it looks like that's impossible now."

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.360
Just because you SAY you're doing it doesn't make it any better.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.920
"Whoa! Did you see that?!"

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.640
Geez, the Nerd turned into a bit of a puss in that line.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680
"Whoa! did you see that?!"

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.960
I almost hurt my manicure!

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.000
"The pieces to the ship, they're inside the Eee Tee games!"

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.560
But the alien calls all of the video game cartridges to him to rebuild his ship.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.360
This leads to easily, hands down, the best performance in the entire movie.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.680
"Daaahhhhhh!"

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:46.140
Look at the fear in his eyes, look at the depth he's portraying. Look at how many emotions this actor is able to get across in just a couple of seconds.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.420
He may have only had one moment of screen time, but he changed cinema with it.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.560
"Daaahhhhhhh!"

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.680
"Dahh" indeed.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.520
Mandi defeats McButter only to be captured again. But it's okay, Cooper helps save the Nerd, only to be captured again.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:14.220
God, you could just call this film "Getting Captured: The Movie". There's more people being bound up in this film than "Fifty Shades of Grey".

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.000
Awwww, Mandi looks so adorably plastic while screaming in distress.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.940
But sure enough, the Nerd comes to save the day, and catches Cooper and Mandi.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:38.300
They try to destroy the satellite on TTFFPHWICKS's head, which ultimately results in... This.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.820
(Laughter)

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.160
"You want me to explain? No, nuh-uh."

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.820
...Brought to you by the miracle of randomness.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.320
Like the saying goes: If you don't get it... cock-a-puss!

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.240
There, I finally put it to some good use!

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.020
Or at least better use than the bologna sandwich. Seriously, what was that again?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:13.740
And of course, having saved the day, Mandi gets together with her obvious love interest in the movie... Cooper.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:23.360
Because... Clearly they were setting THAT up! Hey, I guess if you can survive being in metal tentacle hentai, you can pretty much bond over anything.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.760
"And bingo!"

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:33.440
And as you'd expect, the ending credits is a review of the game, which even then isn't really as major as you'd expect.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:40.540
"So is it really the worst game of so time? Um....I don't think so."

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.880
"It's frustrating, it's challenging, and it's a brain teaser; but that's what makes it so addicting."

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:53.600
"And considering it was made in such a short period of time, it's more sophisticated than anything of it's era."

00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:02.440
Ah yes, the greatest bad game of all time reviewed by the greatest video game critic of all time, and the final epic conclusion is...

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.040
"Eh!"

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.320
Actually to the Nerd's credit, that's the ONLY reaction he COULD give that wouldn't be obvious.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:18.180
If he screamed and yelled and took a shit on it, we'd all know it'd be coming, but a reaction like that is kind of unexpectedly refreshing.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.620
Hell, he might even get a lot of people to kind of agree with him on it.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.940
Now if only I could get that same amount of people to agree with me on "Last Action Hero."

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.160
(Crowd booing)
It's bullshit, it's terrible satire!

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.800
"See ya later!"

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.420
And remember: forgiveness is divine, but never pay full price for late pizza!

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.240
And that's the movie, and... It's your movie.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:54.140
Everything you wanted to see is here: The review of the game, the Nerd being the Nerd; effects fake, but impressively practical.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:03.200
The homage to millions of geeky films from "Godzilla" to fucking "Ninja Turtles 3". You've pretty much got exactly what was to be expected.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:11.660
But that doesn't mean I like it! It just means I don't... Not... Not... Not like it.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.480
But, with that said, everyone has been asking me after this movie came out,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.940
"Nostalgia Critic, are you ever gonna do a movie? Are you ever gonna do a film that's gonna be released in theaters and all that bullshit?"

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.740
Well, there's another reason that I did this review for this DVD.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.100
Yeah, that's right. Right here, right now, on the Nerd's turf,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:43.100
I am happy to announce that I, the Nostalgia Critic, am going to release an official Nostalgia Critic mo-(Buffering/lag sounds)

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.260
Oops!

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720
"Did you see that?"
