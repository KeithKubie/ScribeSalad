[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.560
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.950
I made you a Google Doodle.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.500
And it's all patterned.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.490
I grew up in a family of five
girls in northern New Jersey,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.230
and textiles and fabrics
were always around.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.600
I learned to sew when
I was nine, and stitch.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.150
My grandmother was a
quilter, embroiderer.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.460
And I really got
interested in it,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.210
and I actually went to school
for textiles and clothing.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.190
And then I got a master's in it.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760
And for 16 years I worked
as a creative director

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.640
at a yarn company.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.690
And then I had my
daughter, who's here,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.240
and I decided to go freelance.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.400
And I've written
12 books so far.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.160
This is my latest,
"Crafting a Patterned Home".

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.540
So I've got a little bit
of stuff that previews.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.340
This is our house.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.530
It's a 1751 farmhouse.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.590
And it's white on the
outside, and you can't really

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.490
tell what's inside it.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.840
Here it is in the snow.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.140
And we have a sheep farm.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.030
We have about 300 sheep,
and my husband is a farmer.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.600
He grew up on a farm.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.870
And so we sell our lamb at
farmers' markets and wholesale

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.890
a little bit.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
So I'm always shuffling
around frozen meat.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.450
And so the sheep graze.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.760
They keep the land down.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.710
It was an old,
abandoned apple orchard.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.210
So here's in the fall.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.312
It's incredibly beautiful.

00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:35.270
I don't know if anybody's
been to western Mass,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.760
but it's really
pretty out there.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.040
This is my pottery shed.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.100
This is actually part
of the book project.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.780
And here's some sunflowers.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.990
I love sunflowers.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020
I love all kinds of
nature and flowers.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.760
I grow a lot of flowers, and
they're a big part of my work.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.880
Zinnias, my favorites.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.600
And just the leaves,
all the motion.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840
You can get ideas for
patterns from that.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.890
The vines going around.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.410
Watering can with that
beautiful heart-shaped leaf.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.690
You're going to see
that a little later.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.950
Hydrangeas.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.650
Beautiful pinks, browns,
greens, chartreuses.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.270
More zinnias.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.140
And for a while there, we grew
up about an acre of sunflowers,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.037
and this is them.

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:26.870
We've scaled a little
bit back because we've

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.160
gone more into the
sheep, but this is them.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.700
And I still do a big garden,
half a garden of sunflowers.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.960
I just love the shapes.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.240
And you guys probably
know what the name is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.850
about how the seeds go around.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.651
I have no clue.

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:42.650
I just know it's pretty.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:54.381
And here's some sheep,
lambs on pasture.

00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:54.880
More sheep.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.420
This is an abandoned
apple orchard.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.270
Pretty, pretty colors here.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.720
That stuff, it's a weed,
but it's so pretty.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.590
So I also have
collected textiles

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.020
for years and years and years.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.392
I started when I found a
piece when I was in college,

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:15.850
and it was my first
piece I bought.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.690
I can remember it
was back in the '70s,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.940
and it was right
before Afghanistan

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.260
was going to be taken over.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.270
And I was like, I got
to get a piece of this.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.940
So I still have that
piece of fabric.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.340
And this is suzani,
which is from Uzbekistan.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.480
I love this motif.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.440
It's all embroidered, if you can
believe it, all hand-stitched.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.710
So I find the connection between
somebody hand stitching that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.340
and then me using it as a motif
in my designs as a cool thing

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.060
to do.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.840
So I do a lot of computer
stuff with digital art

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.700
and use these designs.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.930
There's my sunflowers.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.520
And you're going to see more of
this room a little bit later.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.560
Those walls are
all hand-painted.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.530
I hand painted them.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.170
And that's a collection
of cloisonne,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.770
which is either
from Japan or China,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.290
and it's enamel on brass.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.730
Beautiful colors you can get.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.450
So I have quite a bit of that.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.079
I love all the designs on it.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.670
This is an old
antique Italian urn

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.310
with dahlias in the background.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.500
And you can see the other
piece of textile fabric

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.130
on the bottom, and
more cloisonne.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.690
So I find I can take a
bunch of flowers and some

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.330
of these beautiful objects
I have and some fabrics,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.940
and I can get a design
idea just by placing

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.270
those things together and
then taking a photo of it.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.540
And I can either paint
a picture off of it,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.230
or maybe figure out
how to take two motifs

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.190
and match them together
or get color ideas.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.980
And the walls there
are stenciled.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.460
I hand stenciled them.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.160
Here's a bunch of
inspiration pictures.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.370
I'm going to go kind of fast
because I got a lot of them.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.920
This is from Portugal, ceramics.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.760
This is a mola from Panama.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.810
Old carpet.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.560
Some transferware with
flowers and books that I think

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.930
is from India.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.300
Correct me if I'm
wrong if anybody knows.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.830
This is also from India.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.110
This is incredible.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.710
Every single stitch in
there is embroidered

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.240
to make those motifs.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.610
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.210
This is from Uzbekistan,
beautiful border treatment.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.420
This is an old sleeve from--

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.250
I can't remember where
because I really don't know.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.700
But see the moths have
eaten a little bit of it?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.840
But I just love the motif
and the border treatment.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.660
And then the piece
of felt up the right

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.760
that's all kind of moth eaten.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.380
Pretty idea.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.500
This is a Peruvian piece.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.020
This is from India,
a block print.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.900
I'm crazy over these things.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.980
That's another part of that.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.750
This is crewel work,
all stitched from India.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.970
This, I have no idea
where it came from,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.340
but it's all inlaid, so it's
all carved and then inlaid.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.090
And these are some
saris from India.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.757
So isn't that cool how
they've got the paisley design

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.590
at the bottom and then
mixed with the plaid,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.622
and then the medallion
piece on the top?

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:33.580
You can take all these
ideas and then turn them

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.860
into something of your own.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.950
This is a piece of ikat fabric.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.350
That's another sari with
all kinds of fun sequins.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.419
Another piece from India with
mirrors, all embroidered.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.460
Another piece from India.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.580
This is from Uzbekistan.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.050
That's the back.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.590
Lots of times these things are
so pretty in the back, too.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.400
More from India.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.380
That's from Africa.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.540
It's a piece of kente cloth.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.460
And that's a piece
of needlepoint.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.941
I don't know where it's from.

00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:15.030
From India, more from
India, Uzbekistan.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.330
India.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.087
And so we have a lot of
creatures at our farm.

00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:22.170
Now I'm going to tell you
a little bit about that.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.780
That's Annika the cat.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.540
And that is--

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.940
I don't even know what
name she was because we

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.470
have a litters of kittens.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.990
And she just happened to be
doing that for the photo shoot,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.410
and it was like oh my goodness,
stripes on pattern on pattern.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.960
How fabulous is that?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.170
And this, a litter of kittens
with a beautiful rug behind it

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.530
and crewel work.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.510
That's Paisley, one
of our sheep dogs,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.310
Border Collie to
round up the sheep.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.930
That's Kate.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.290
These are two Great
Pyrenees guard dogs.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.910
They are Bo and Sadie and
they keep the coyotes away.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.970
But they're
sweethearts to people.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.290
And there's some
more sheep, chickens.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.840
That's the name of our farm.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.540
And that's moving them.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.800
You have to move them,
and there's a lot of them.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.270
And so we do it along the road.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.040
And this is lambing season.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.090
That's probably 10 minutes old.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.910
They get up in about 15
minutes and they know right

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.750
where to go to eat.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.490
It's amazing.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.150
Just born.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.059
Well, you can see the fluid on
her and she's licking it off.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:46.170
Sometimes I go a little
nuts and dress up my sheep.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.976
So this is a ram.

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:49.350
And I was doing
this photo shoot.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.240
I had this idea to make
a sweater for a lamb.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.460
And I was getting it all
ready, and my husband

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.660
said, look over there.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.350
This little sheep was sitting
on top of this 300 pound ram.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.760
It was like oh, so cute.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.030
So this is an image
that I did that's pretty

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.580
popular around the internet.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.906
And so this was my 11th book,
"Crafting a Colorful Home".

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:14.280
And now this is
the book I'm here

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.590
to talk about called
"Crafting a Patterned Home".

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.050
So all these pictures
of these projects

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.260
are all things that you guys
can make if you so choose.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.120
Everything's done by hand.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.320
None of the materials
are expensive.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.190
And as long as you get the
idea and get the nerve,

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.940
you can decorate your home,
or maybe decorate some fabric,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.192
or do stuff for a
shirt or a tablecloth.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.130
We're going have a
little section on color.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.410
And these are pieces of felt.
I love to play with colors.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.550
And just by rolling
things up, you

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.950
can figure out what colors
work well against each other

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.720
when you're putting
them together.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.460
And the same thing
you can do with yarn.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.950
And you can do it with paint.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.310
Has everybody seen
a color wheel?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.070
Pretty much you learned
it when you were a kid.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.250
But I use this a lot.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.510
I use it intuitively.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.700
I call it a rainbow
in the round.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.620
So as you can see, it
goes all the way around.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.670
It has 12 slices.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:24.690
And if you look opposite each
other on the color wheel,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.820
those are complementary colors.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.650
If you look next to
each other, those

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.330
are called analogous colors.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.280
And I'm going to talk
a lot about that.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.240
So just try to remember.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.630
So here we have
samples that I painted.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.850
All the way to the left
are the analogous colors.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.310
So they're like orange,
yellow, and red orange.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.890
In the center, we've got the
complementary colors, so blue

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.484
and violet.

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:51.900
And to the right
we have something

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.040
that I call tonal colors.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.960
So it's like shades of blue.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.080
And so you can think about
what you like the best

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.447
and use that in your
home in different places,

00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:03.030
depending on the
mood you want to get.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.060
This is another good
way to work with color

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.000
is have just a piece of
paper in the background,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.970
and then just get a
flower or something

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.750
and see how the colors
work against each other.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.130
So this is what I call
analogous because they're all

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.880
sort of related.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.130
It goes from the
chartreuse to the yellow

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.600
and then to the orange.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.495
And this is getting
a little bit away

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:33.620
from that because it's got
the hot pink background.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.911
But you can see the same
flowers, how different they're

00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.520
starting to look.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.110
This is on blue, on a brighter
blue, so this is complementary.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.810
You see how they're popping?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.344
And then that's a little bit
more subdued, bluish gray.

00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:49.510
And here it is in real life.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.990
This is a complementary color
combination in fabulous yellow,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.050
purple, green.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.155
And here it is on furniture.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.980
This is our house.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.860
And so I use a lot of
pattern in the house.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.090
It has, actually,
very light gray walls.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.880
And then I mix
fabrics, colors, and--

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.050
whoops, there we go--

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.510
pottery, all these
things with it.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.160
So I used the very
light gray wall,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.630
and then brought the patterns
in, first with the pottery

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.755
and then with more fabrics.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.660
This is the living room.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.970
So you probably can't
see it, but this

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.270
is a tonal living room.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.540
I actually have
chartreuse and gold walls

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.860
and mixed with green.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.750
Actually, it's analogous.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.300
But then, by bringing in
all the different patterns

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.360
and the different fabrics,
it looks differently.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.030
It starts to become
complementary

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.370
because the oranges and
the reds are popping off

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.466
the green and the yellow.

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.840
And so then you start mixing
all these different patterns

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.000
together and you get what I
find very pleasing and cozy

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.100
and warm by mixing
all the colors.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.710
There's another view.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.420
Oh.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.560
Did you see the kittens
over there by the door?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.630
And there's a turquoise
wall in the background.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.000
So I chose that color so it
would pop off a little bit

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.910
from the rest of the room,
which is sort of gold,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.770
because I wanted
the space to look

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.040
different than just putting,
say, a gold wall there.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.785
I wanted to differentiate
that this was a stairway.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.870
This is an analogous
combination.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.570
So you can see the
chartreuse, and then

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.360
the green, moss green cabinets.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.970
But you see the red?

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.830
That is-- whoops, sorry.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.760
That's a complementary
combination,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.300
and that's popping.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.100
This is just some
artwork I've done.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.620
That's Charlie the cat.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.550
He loves this room.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.040
This is the library TV room.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.750
And I use a lot of
fabrics in here.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.910
And we'll get more
into this later,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.220
but all that painting on the
walls, it's not wallpaper.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.730
Good wallpaper is really, really
expensive to do a room in.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.820
So I couldn't afford
it, so I just said OK,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.050
I'll do it myself.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.360
So I painted the walls
to look like wallpaper.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.004
And it took a couple
days, but it actually

00:14:44.004 --> 00:14:46.170
is pretty because there's
all these little different

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.330
variations in it where wallpaper
would be screen printed

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.511
and just look pretty flat.

00:14:52.511 --> 00:14:53.010
OK.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.676
We're going to talk
about some patterns.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.440
So does anybody
think about patterns?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.770
Patterns, to me, are like so--

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.250
I just love them.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.800
They're so inspirational.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.030
They just make me feel happy.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.420
The simplest one is a polka dot.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.750
You guys all did polka
dots when you were kids,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.280
and here's different
bunches of polka dots.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.530
So we've got little pin dots,
bigger dots, random spaced,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.790
spaced out, and
alternating stripes.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.320
Next thing.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.300
Simple stripe, but
you can move on

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.770
and keep changing the stripes.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.890
So you see all the
variations you can do?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.490
Just hand drawn.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.310
And then if you take a stripe
and you turn it on its side,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.320
you've got a plaid or a check.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.840
So this is just a natural
progression of patterns

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.157
and how you can make them.

00:15:44.157 --> 00:15:45.990
And you can see all the
different variations

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.760
you can get.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.030
If you take it and twist
it on the diagonal,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.460
twist it 45 degrees,
you've got a diagonal.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.640
And then if you start
cutting them into segments

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.420
and you start flipping them
around, you've got chevrons,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.070
and you've got a trellis design.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.660
And so these are
all motifs that are

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.810
used in all kinds of
wallpapers and fabrics.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.920
I mean, we look around.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.270
This room is awesome.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.510
You've got all these gorgeous
plaid fabrics, which--

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.480
it's a pattern, but there's
so many different variations.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.900
This next section,
this is geometrics.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.690
So they're squares
and rectangles,

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.860
putting them in between
stripes and you make a pattern.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.330
More geometric circles,
hexagons, triangles, diamonds,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.410
ovals.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.600
So you see how
there's a lot that you

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.870
can do with simple
motifs to make a pattern.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.480
And then these are
called organic motifs.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.970
And they're more
round and organic--

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:50.790
tulips, hearts, paisleys, one
of my favorite things, flowers.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.720
And here we have organic
motifs, more in striped patterns

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.810
and borders, combining them.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.480
And this is called
a figurative motif.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.300
And that would be something if
you see Christmas or Halloween

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.810
wallpaper, they
take little objects

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.540
and make patterns out of them.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.010
Here, this is how different
patterns are made.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.290
We can have a lot of white
space in the background,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.069
and this is very dots on dots.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.109
Then we can have a
bigger dot, and so you

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.290
have a whole different
feeling from the dots when

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.080
you change the sizes
and change the backdrop.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.120
Now here we can have them
so they're spaced out

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.120
and you get a random pattern.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.680
But you've still
got the coverage

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.480
on the one on the
right, and the other one

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.210
is very open and loose.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.840
And it gives a
different feeling.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.140
It'll give a different feeling
to a fabric, to a room.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.440
This is pattern repeats.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.380
You can see a straight repeat
up on the left, top left.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.730
And if you move to the right,
you can see a brick repeat,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.150
looks like a brick pattern that
you see all the time in Boston.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.910
To the left on the bottom,
that's called a half drop,

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.880
so the circles move down a half.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.950
And then we have
a random repeat.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.100
So that's basically fabric
design and wallpaper design.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.280
That's what you do.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.240
And if you do it on
a computer, you just

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.640
move it with numbers, which
is what I do a lot of.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.360
This piece of fabric,
I actually started out

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.360
designing it by hand, and then
I brought it into Illustrator

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.120
and made it into
the pattern and had

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.100
the slipcover made for that.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.100
And here's some more pottery.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.320
I made a bunch of that pottery.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.690
I do that more free form.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.210
There's some antique
stuff in there too.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.837
Here's a thing on where
could we get ideas.

00:18:45.837 --> 00:18:46.920
This is my favorite thing.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.730
Books, I know.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.970
I go on Google, too.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.730
But I find like just having the
physical thing in front of me

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.240
is easier for me to work from.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.750
I know a lot of
people use Pinterest.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.100
I have a very slow
connection where I live.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.150
So I tend to just go old school.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.370
But you can see
such great things.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.560
I also like to visit
a lot of art museums,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.820
and I have a lot of art books.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.760
And I find the color
inspiration from there.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.360
And there's another, just
doodling, figuring things out,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.350
and then I painted the
table underneath there.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.970
So these are projects
for my new book.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.470
It's all real free form.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.410
I actually used my fingers
to paint a lot with,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.320
put the stripes on in different
colors and just splodge things

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.262
with my fingers, and
played with the colors.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.470
There's the top of the table.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.980
And I actually made that just
by taking plates and drawing

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.610
around them and figuring out the
spaces on the top of the table.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.650
Sometimes I cut
things out of paper,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.640
just like folding them to
get the shape that way.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.420
And then I trace
around it with a pencil

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.350
and I paint it in by hand.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.260
And that took less than a day.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.760
It's pretty quick.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.910
This is an embroidered piece
that I actually printed.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.810
And I don't know if you saw
it on the table outside,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.370
but I use these things.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.260
It's kids' fun foam.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:19.110
And I print with kids' fun
foam on insulation board.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.570
And let's see.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.390
This is that.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.480
And it's all embroidered.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.740
And if somebody wants to
come up here and take these,

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:31.990
I'm happy to pass them around.

00:20:34.662 --> 00:20:36.370
And you can see the
embroidery around it.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.640
The embroidery is adding
more colors to it.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.320
Now so in this picture
what we did was,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.000
we didn't want it
to be boring, so we

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.590
put in the pops of the color.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.822
And I look at this room
that you guys are in,

00:20:46.822 --> 00:20:48.280
and I'm looking
around, and there's

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.720
a lot of browns and tans.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.490
But then they put
in pops of color.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.270
They put the red
and the chartreuse,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.670
and that's what's making
the room super fun.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.910
And so when you're
making pictures,

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.100
you have to do that also.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.670
And see how we used the pops
of color for the plates.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.520
And the idea for this
one is I wanted something

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.130
that sort of was
mid-century modern looking,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.380
so I did these stripes and
spaced them apart three inches

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.730
and did different colors.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:22.390
But the colors are like
teal, dark teal, lupin blue,

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.760
and a brown.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.527
It gives that sort of
mid-century modern vibe, which

00:21:27.527 --> 00:21:29.110
doesn't really go
in my house, but you

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.810
can sort of mix everything
together and make it look good.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.570
But then we used the
pop of the colors

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.910
of the chairs and
the plates to make

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.950
the picture look interesting.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:44.650
Here what we've done
is these are napkins.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.150
So I did blue with brown
on top, printed them,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.790
and they actually
just use latex paint.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.650
All the directions
are in my book.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.240
And just did-- had
fun with some spacing.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.510
So there's one spacing.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.070
Here is a different
kind of spacing.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:12.420
And here is a different
kind of spacing.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.480
So I started with one stripe
and then kept filling the holes.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.310
So a lot of this
is playing around.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.750
Not everything is successful,
but paint is cheap.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.900
And you can just
slap it on the wall.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.790
You don't like it,
just change it.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.950
And the way this
picture is working

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.480
is the complementary
combination.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.430
See how it's orange and blue?

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.860
And that's what's making
that just pop and look vivid.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.640
There's those patterns.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.060
These are plates that
are ceramic plates.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.520
And for this book,
I wanted to make

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.010
things that were
approachable for people

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.662
that maybe don't have as
much experience as I do.

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:52.120
So I started with
polka dots, and I

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.899
figured anybody can put
a polka dot on a plate.

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:56.690
And then I moved from
the simple polka dot,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.100
started changing up the sizes
on the polka dots, putting rims

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.210
around them, and then the
big concentric circle one.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.870
And as you can see,
it's off centered,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.350
and that makes it a little
bit more A, easy to do,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.520
and B, interesting.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.280
And then my plan was
I had this tablecloth.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.620
So I thought, OK I'll
put the white plates

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.020
with the blue trim
on this tablecloth,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.430
and it would look really good.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.520
And I think it does.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.270
This is simple.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.700
These are stripes, and
what I did here was I

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.520
just added a little
bit of stitching.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.670
And if you can see
the color on these,

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:39.250
they were white, and a
light teal and a chartreuse.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.890
And by picking a complementary
color and drawing lines,

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.690
I just put stitches up it.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.510
And it's a nice
present, very easy

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.840
to do if you want
to relax at night.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.310
And let's see.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.370
There's a close-up of that.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.110
I've got this afghan here.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.110
So this is crocheted.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.680
And I don't know if anybody
knows how to crochet,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.690
but maybe your grandma does. ,
And my idea with this one was

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.130
to make it more modern.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.220
So I just chose two colors.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.300
And I actually drew
it out on my computer,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.340
fooled around with
the color placement

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.930
and how big I wanted these
hexagons, or hexagons to be.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.000
And then I wrote up the pattern.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.910
And they're pieces that
are then sewn together.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.740
This is not in the book,
but this is also hexagons.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.210
And it's kind of crazy,
but really super fun.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.860
And people love this afghan.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.190
It's a great way to get rid
of things, old bits of yarn

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.840
and everything.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.200
Now this next slide, this
has been a dream of mine,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.070
to have a paisley chair to
sit in to knit at night.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.950
I know.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.580
I dream about these things.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:00.310
So the fabric is all
hand-printed with this stamp,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.230
nine yards.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.100
But the cool thing
about this is--

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.540
I'm going to pass these around.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.970
These are the remnants from it.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:15.180
If you look at them, you can
see how it's not exactly even,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.440
but that's what makes
it more interesting.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.390
And so this is one colorway.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.450
It actually has three
different colorways on it.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.560
That's the bottom.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.350
And here, David, you
want to pass that?

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.200
DAVID: Sure thing.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.500
KRISTIN NICHOLAS:
And just so you

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.540
see a difference, this winter I
translated a lot of the designs

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.750
from the book that I had hand
printed in the digital files,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.940
and I had them digital printed.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.380
So do you see the difference?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.990
See this top one here?

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.420
So if it's printed, it looks
sort of flat and uninteresting

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.370
because it is digital printed.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.920
That, you can see
different bits of texture,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.340
and to me, it looks
more interesting.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.910
This is the wallpaper
that I hand painted.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.990
And I just used FedEx boxes,
and I cut out the motifs,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:11.210
and I just dropped a plumb
line, started with the cross,

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.160
put that on the
wall, painted it red,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.350
and then kept laying the motifs
on and adding more colors in.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.330
And then I got
tired of that, and I

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.850
said, OK, I'm going to
switch it up a little bit.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.400
So I had a small space
between the windows,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.740
so I took the square idea,
turned it on its side,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.820
made it a diagonal, and made
almost like an argyle tile

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.200
design, and then
painted some vases

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.830
with flowers on top of it.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.670
And you can see the fabrics
that I've used on the top.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.990
Those are things
that you saw earlier.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.455
They're from Uzbekistan,
the embroidered pieces.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.780
In the past I've been
known for knitting,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.700
so I had to put a
knitting thing in.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.850
And that is-- let's see.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.420
Right here, OK.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.120
Pillow that's not sewed,
it travels better.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.330
So it's just you follow a chart.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.300
Is anybody a knitter here?

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.120
Oh, there we go.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.020
OK, good.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.240
So you guys know this.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.040
And follow the chart.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.290
And then these little bits are
added on later in embroidery.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:18.790
Yeah.

00:27:22.817 --> 00:27:25.025
Here you can see the chair
with the different colors.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.980
So the khaki and the red.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.725
And on the side I used
a yellow just for fun.

00:27:33.725 --> 00:27:35.930
And most people aren't
even going to see this.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.730
But for me it's fun.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.270
OK.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:44.000
Upstairs in the bathroom I had
yellow walls that were color

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.770
washed.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.020
So for this design I made
long, eight-inch stripes

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.770
because my ruler
was eight inches.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.160
Lots of times I just do
things that are really easy.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.600
And then I cut this ogee
pattern out and traced around it

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.520
with a pencil, and
then just filled it

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.560
in with streaky paint.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.270
And this picture
is really popular.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.790
It's been on the
internet a bunch.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:17.000
And the bathtub, I was
inspired by embroidery.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.360
So I just took some white
paint and just did sort of

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.280
like a flower design on it.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.370
It took less than an hour.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.410
And then I put the border on
the bottom on the wood stand.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.770
And you can see that
little sun design,

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.730
which I actually got off of
this tile that was on the walls.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.290
I wanted do some things
that were really easy.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.090
This is called combing.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.840
You take a piece of cardboard.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.800
You cut it so it
looks like a comb.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.340
You paint one color
on a piece of wood.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.560
So I painted it blue.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.700
Then I painted it white,
and while it was still wet,

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.490
I took the piece of cardboard
that looked like a comb

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.880
and just dragged it through
in this kind of swirly design.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.230
So except for the
waiting for it to dry,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.054
this project was probably 40
minutes or something like that

00:29:13.054 --> 00:29:14.220
after I got the paint on it.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.830
So I like sunflowers.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.610
So this is the
sunflower bedroom.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.310
I did it in the winter when
it was really, really gray.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:32.020
And I thought, oh, let's do
some overblown sunflowers.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:37.680
So I just took a big piece of 18
by 24 paper, folded it in four,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.390
and then just cut
some shapes out.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:44.940
And I used them as a template,
and I drew with pencil around

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.070
and left space for the leaves.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.250
So I painted them all
in a light yellow.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.940
Then I went back and added some
leaves, free form leaves where

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.540
it needed to be, so
there was a lot of space

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.410
available around the
flowers, and then

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.240
put sort of a wash
for the center

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.940
and outlined it all
in a dark brown.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.940
And it just makes me happy.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.030
And in one end of the
room, to calm it all down,

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.930
I put this pretty spring green
because the maple leaves--

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.830
you know that one day
when they come out

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.350
and it's just gorgeous?

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.150
So that's what this color is.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.120
So in the winter I can look
at that and say, oh yeah,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.890
one day spring will be here.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.920
But it just gives it a nice--

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.240
like a break.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.340
And then I put these
antique engravings

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.600
on the wall and all the books.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.160
There's another
corner of the room.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.820
That's an oil painting I did,
and also lampshade I painted.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.200
I do a lot of
lampshade paintings.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.120
On the other wall
there's closets,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.220
and I thought,
OK, I need to have

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.860
something that's more geometric
to stand off these sunflowers.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.140
So I came up with this
idea of big diamonds.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.520
And I put tape in
a diamond form,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.820
and I just sponged it
with a piece of sponge

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.760
to get kind of the mottled edge.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.680
And it's another part
of the room that's

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.620
like geometric versus organic.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.230
And as you move around the
room, it has different feelings.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.690
And it all sort
of mixes together.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.180
This is a bedspread that I did.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.260
It's quilting, because this book
is for all kinds of crafters.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.490
So this is pieced.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.271
And I used an idea-- the Amish
people are incredible quilters,

00:31:41.271 --> 00:31:43.270
and way back when they
used to do a lot of stuff

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.820
with these beautiful
bright colors of wool.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:52.430
And this was inspired off
that, very simple shapes.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:32:00.150
The back of it,
this is a linocut

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.170
that I carved into Speedy
Carve, it's called,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.550
so I used a carving knife.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.540
And I printed it in black
and then I scanned it.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.730
Then I brought it
into Illustrator.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.110
And then I made the
fabric for the backing

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.835
and mixed up all the
different colors.

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.335
So you don't really
see it, but it's

00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:21.780
a way you can add
little bits of surprises

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.810
and take these
hand painting ideas

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.299
and put them into use
in the computer world.

00:32:29.299 --> 00:32:30.840
There's a company
called Spoon Flower

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.890
that's out of North Carolina.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.306
I don't know if
you know about it.

00:32:33.306 --> 00:32:36.240
But that's where I get
this stuff printed.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.140
And then another thing, for
a little bit of visual rest,

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.350
is these giant polka
dots that were hand

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.540
printed on a piece of linen.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.390
And I called this--

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.410
I was thinking about
big and little dots,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.170
so I did these
giant dots and then

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:55.050
put French knots, which is
an embroidery technique,

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.690
around it in a different
color, and I backed it

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.940
in this fun color.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:05.190
So you know, you can do this
stuff at night when you're, I

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.610
don't know, trying to cool down.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.670
This is the dining room.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:14.580
This is all painted walls,
and then down below it's

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.400
a plaid design.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.060
More of the dining room
with my oil paintings

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.590
and mixing the fabrics in.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:32.090
These are tiles that I actually
painted and glazed and fired

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.770
and put on a piece
of cement board

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:37.180
and mounted them into the
wall onto the fireplace.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.890
And these are some
projects outside.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.339
You know she sheds are a term?

00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:45.130
I don't know if anybody
has heard about it.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.110
But it's a term so
these are she sheds,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:57.100
and these have vines and a fun
painted rug and printed fabric.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.070
And this is my pottery shed.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:05.260
So I used vinyl VCT tiles on
the floors in bright colors.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.120
And there's the floor
and the cat, Charlie.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.635
And I just did this around the
edges, stamped with sponges.

00:34:15.635 --> 00:34:17.260
And I used different
colors all the way

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.929
around the room for more fun
because it doesn't really

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.130
have to match.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:25.088
And that's a
hand-printed linocut.

00:34:25.088 --> 00:34:26.379
And there's some of my pottery.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.330
More greenware patterns.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.889
And this is a sourcebook I got.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.300
I don't know where it's from.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.270
I can't understand it.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.480
It's got some kind
of weird writing.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.159
But I love that.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.889
This was probably given
as a guide for people

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:48.340
to do embroidery way
back when somewhere.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.260
This is a lamp from Home Depot.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.350
I spray painted it and
then put squiggles on it.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.170
And that's the outside.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:01.420
I did a little bit of
mural and-- oh, more.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.020
OK.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.228
There's that leaf I showed
you in the very beginning,

00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:07.480
the morning glory leaf, with
others, and a picnic down

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.085
in the orchard with
different projects.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.160
This is the last bit.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.710
This is a cocktail
hour under the pergola.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.770
And I did this big,
big, oversized kind

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:31.210
of Matisse-inspired
circular tabletop.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:36.550
And I free-handed
the leaf design,

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:43.540
and then I mixed it with
some more gridded designs

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.810
and then these napkins that
are just all hand-painted.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.850
And they're scattered
around the room.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.980
They're hand-painted stripes.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.900
So does anybody
have any questions?

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.200
AUDIENCE: So what I like about
this photo is that the table is

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.950
really sort of free form,
but then the photos in the,

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.930
I guess prints in the
background are very orderly.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.920
And so the balance or
contrast there is really nice.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.125
How do you think about
balancing that, and having

00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:14.500
some things that
are sort of more

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.864
structured and formulaic
with some things that are

00:36:17.864 --> 00:36:19.030
a little bit more free form?

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.238
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: It's a mix.

00:36:20.238 --> 00:36:26.650
So I usually will
start with a fabric,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.850
and then have some
kind of busy fabric.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.870
Say if I'm doing a room, and
that will be the color idea.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.840
And then I pick a
backdrop and then

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.020
just keep adding things in.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:44.560
This table and the rug, the
table is organic, right?

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.045
The pictures on the
wall are very square,

00:36:47.045 --> 00:36:48.670
but when you get up
close, they're not.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.010
They're also little pictures.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.230
And then the rug is a base.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.200
And a lot of this is
done in photography.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:02.590
So when you're photographing
projects like I do,

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.360
you have to make the
picture look good.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.700
So you're looking
through the viewfinder

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.730
and balancing it all
out, making a mix.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.160
And sometimes you might
move a set all the way

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.170
across the room to
a different color.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.550
So that rug is usually
not under that table,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.310
but it made the
picture work good.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.730
And it's just trial and
error and experience.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.430
I can't tell you
the magic formula.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.320
I've been doing
this for so long.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.850
But anyway, I don't
know if I helped you.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:42.150
AUDIENCE: So a first question
is when you painted the wall

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.350
with the red crosses
and stuff, did you

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.070
use the stencils for that?

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:52.470
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: No, I used
FedEx boxes because I had them.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.710
They're good, stiff cardboard,
so I cut the shapes out of them

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:01.450
and traced around it just
with a leaded pencil,

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.930
and then filled it
in with a paintbrush.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:05.771
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:07.520
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: I
don't like stenciling.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.380
You have to be really neat,
and I'm not very neat.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.640
If you put the
plastic stencil on,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.890
sometimes it seeps underneath.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:15.931
You have to clean it off.

00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:18.057
It's just this is faster for me.

00:38:18.057 --> 00:38:18.890
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.584
Well, it looked perfect.

00:38:20.584 --> 00:38:22.250
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: And
if I stenciled it,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.560
it wouldn't have been perfect.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.726
It would have been a hassle.

00:38:24.726 --> 00:38:25.870
AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.250
And second question is, you
said you print your fabrics.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:31.464
So what is the technique?

00:38:31.464 --> 00:38:32.380
How do you print them?

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.180
I know you print them
digitally, but when

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.220
you do it at home and on
your own, how do you do that?

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.830
KRISTIN NICHOLAS:
I have an iPad Pro

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.060
and I use a program called
Procreate, which is $9.99.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.580
And I have an Apple Pencil
and I just start drawing.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.920
And I use the different brushes.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.320
I get a design, like a motif
that I'm interested in,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.030
and then I bring it into
Illustrator, do Live Trace,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:59.650
and start building
files in Illustrator,

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.824
whether I want a straight
repeat, a half drop, a brick,

00:39:02.824 --> 00:39:04.240
just start fooling
around with it.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.770
So it's sort of a combination.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.080
Sometimes I'll actually
draw something.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.650
Or these things
that I showed you I

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.010
actually printed them,
scanned them, and then

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.329
brought them into Illustrator.

00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:13.870
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.990
So do you do hand
print them by yourself,

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.590
or it's all through Illustrator?

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.256
KRISTIN NICHOLAS:
That digital printing,

00:39:20.256 --> 00:39:22.510
I send it to Spoon
Flower, send them a file,

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.670
and it comes in two weeks.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.090
And you can get a yard.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.836
You can actually
get a half a yard.

00:39:26.836 --> 00:39:28.210
It's amazing what
you can do now.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's great.

00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:29.410
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: Yeah.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.090
So I'm really
interested in that now.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.437
It's cool.

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:33.520
You can reach more people.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.686
So I'm hoping that
people will really

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:40.810
want to try some of this
stuff by hand because it's

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.870
really, really easy and
doesn't take much time.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.260
But it's A, finding the time,
B, getting the supplies, which

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.160
I've tried to make things that
you have around your house,

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.760
and then just doing it,
getting the nerve to do it.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.070
That, I find, is most
people's problem.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.870
They don't have the nerve.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.880
So that's why I help people.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.090
I teach classes and
help them get over

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:06.794
their fear of sticking
a stamp onto fabric.

00:40:06.794 --> 00:40:08.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and it's
great to actually see

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.520
don't be afraid of color
and patterns together.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.420
So that was really nice
to see because we tend

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.015
to go in the same direction.

00:40:16.015 --> 00:40:17.390
KRISTIN NICHOLAS:
And if you look

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.970
at the interior decorating
magazines, you open them up,

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.580
oh my god, they're all
white and gray and beige.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.710
And I barely ever
seen anything that I'm

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:29.300
interested in because
it's just all safe.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.900
And I think people are
really afraid of color

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.380
and putting it together.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.400
But it doesn't take
a lot to do it.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.230
It's just getting the nerve up.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.500
And maybe start on a small
space like a bathroom.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.140
If you do a big
patterned wallpaper

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.300
or mural in a bathroom
so it's real big scale,

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.130
it can look fabulous.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.010
And try it that way
and get used to it.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.650
I also hear about a lot
of partners, you know,

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.180
husband likes this,
the wife doesn't.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.490
And that's the stumbling block.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.560
My husband loves everything.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.050
He's fine with it.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.140
AUDIENCE: Good for you.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.306
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: I'm lucky.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious about
the relationship between--

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.060
you showed many rooms
where everything's

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.170
in kind of a fun harmony.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.920
And so the first
thought I was going

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.739
to ask was, oh, did
you start with nothing

00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:25.280
and then build all
this room at once?

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.660
And it's like, no, OK.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.630
So if you've got a room that
already has a direction it's

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.790
going, I can sort of
imagine how you might say,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.160
OK, this is a piece that
would go well there.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.110
But suppose you are
moving into a place

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.960
that's all white and gray--

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.720
KRISTIN NICHOLAS: Yes, which
is all builder's houses.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.345
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:39.345 --> 00:41:41.820
How do you get started on--

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.280
where would you start?

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.950
How would you start building
the intuitions and the this

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.670
is the way this is
going to fit together?

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.045
KRISTIN NICHOLAS:
Well, I suggest

00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:51.050
you get some of those
decorating magazines

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.760
that I just said are
all white and beige,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.970
and start ripping pages
out that you like.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.850
Or go on Pinterest if you want,
and just start building a file.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.730
And you're going to
see a pattern coming

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.680
through to what you like.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.960
And then pick the
favorite thing,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.300
start with one room,
maybe a bedroom

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.490
because nobody will see it,
and start decorating and seeing

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.460
what happens, seeing how you do.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.130
So that would be one room,
also, it's away from people.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.260
And then maybe do the
bathroom next door.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.560
And start working
it so that each room

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.640
goes along and starts
being filled up

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.000
with more and more color.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.070
And you will find
your own theme.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.480
You'll find your own thing
for sure because people do.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.330
They have things that
they like, and then they

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.600
can put them in their
houses, colors that they like

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.770
and put them in their houses.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.010
You can do it.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.420
You can, I promise you.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.650
It's just A, getting the nerve.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:53.150
OK.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.170
Well, thank you so
much for having me.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.530
I hope you can think
more about using color

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.230
in your home and your
wardrobe or whatever you do.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.890
And also start looking around.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.140
I took a little walk through,
and I can't believe this space.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.860
They've got such
fantastic colors

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.300
and all kinds of design ideas.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.610
And so maybe you'll
walk to the Marriott

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.220
and see some cool
kind of carpet.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.930
And just start bringing
more pattern into your life

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.110
because it's happy.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.160
Thank you.
