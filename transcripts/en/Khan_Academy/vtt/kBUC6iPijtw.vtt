00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.170
- [Instructor] In several
videos we have talked already

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.320
about the price elasticity of supply.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.610
In this video, we're going
to dig a little bit deeper,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.530
and we're going to think about

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.390
what factors might make a supply curve,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.700
or supply schedule, or portions of it,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.240
to be more elastic or inelastic.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.880
So we'll think about the
determinants of the price

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.940
elasticity of supply.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.330
And to help us think about that,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.260
I've drawn two different supply curves.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.350
And so, remember, price
elasticity is thinking about

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.780
how sensitive is the quantity,
or the price elasticity

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.950
of supply, we're thinking about

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.350
how sensitive is a percent
change in quantity supplied

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.090
to a percent change in price.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.420
So, for example, if we were to go from

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.870
this price, to this price,
it's a pretty significant

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.070
percent change in price.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.090
It looks like about a 50% change in price.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.550
But if we look at this supply curve,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.160
where it's getting pretty vertical,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.290
it's not quite vertical yet,
but it's getting pretty steep,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.820
our percent change in quantity
is going from here to here,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.850
so it's not as dramatic.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.480
So these parts of the curve
that are relatively steep,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.570
as they're approaching
more and more vertical,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.430
we would consider those to
be relatively inelastic.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.120
If you had a perfectly vertical,
or portions of this curve

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.370
that were perfectly
vertical, at those portions

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.200
you would say that you
have perfect inelasticity.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.550
And then, if on the other
hand, in this example,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.670
if we were to change our price from say,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.440
this to this, that's a relatively small

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.030
percent change in price,
but notice it could result

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.290
in a fairly large percent
change in quantity supplied,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.110
we're going from this to this.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.760
So, when we are more
horizontal, or the flatter our

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.940
supply curve is, that would be,
we're talking about relative

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.210
elasticity, or we are
much more elastic here

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.340
than we are there.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.850
So, elastic.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.120
And if you were perfectly horizontal,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.060
then you would have a perfectly elastic

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.910
part of our supply curve,
or our supply schedule.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.610
Now what would cause, what
are the factors that would

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.120
make us get more
inelastic, or more elastic?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.500
Well let's think about a situation,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.650
let's say we are in this world.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.060
Let's say we are in the
world, starting at this price,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.663
where this is our quantity.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.810
Imagine that the factories
that produce whatever good

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.530
we're talking about here, they're already

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.980
at full production.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.790
And to make more production
would take a lot of time,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.110
or there might not even be the resources

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.560
to have more production.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.898
Maybe the people who make the factories

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.740
are doing other things right now.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.250
Maybe you have other
resources, other inputs,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.240
into your production that
there's just not more of.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.430
Maybe oil, as much oil in
the world is being produced,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.970
and that's an input into our production.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.530
And so in that world,
even if the price is,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.850
even if the price goes dramatically up,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.200
people might want to
produce a lot more quantity,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
but they just can't, they
don't have more factories,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.970
or they don't more inputs to produce them.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.040
So, the quantity might go up a little bit,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.700
they might run the factory,
they might run the factories

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.230
in overtime, or the people who
are trained to do that skill,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.420
and maybe there just
aren't a lot more people

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.970
who can do that skill,
they're working overtime,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.280
but they can't produce a lot more.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.300
And so, a couple of
things that we can glean

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.330
from that example is, this
inelasticity of supply

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.173
tends to happen in the short run,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.500
when in the short run, you're
not gonna be able to build

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.650
a new factory in the short run.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.770
You're going to be able
to find more sources of

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.230
let's say oil in the short run.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.120
You're not going to be able
to train a lot more people

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.650
to produce a lot more, in the short run.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.810
So if we're talking about a supply curve

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.240
that's describing more of
a short run time frame,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.320
then it tends to be more inelastic,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.370
and then the other
thing is, and we already

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.830
talked about this is, there's
not available resources,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.610
or not a lot of available
resources, not a lot

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.823
of available,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.430
available resources.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.300
Once again, your factory's
operating full-out.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.660
You've hired everyone who
can produce that thing

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.500
you're producing, or some natural resource

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.910
that you need as an
input, to make this good,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.620
well, the world is already
producing as much as they could.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.380
Well, let's then go to
the other situation.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.770
What would cause elasticity?

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.390
Well, this could be a world where

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.010
in the long run, it might be
easier to get more resources.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.460
In the long run, you can
build more factories.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.840
You can find and hire
and train more people.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.950
So, the longer run that
we are talking about,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.580
that tends to lead to a
more elastic supply curve,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.600
in the longer run, and
then another notion here,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.080
is that you aren't capacity constrained,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.750
or maybe I should say,
aren't resource constrained.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.200
Aren't resource

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.993
constrained.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.050
So, maybe our factories are
running nowhere near capacity.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.407
So even a small increase
of price, where it's like,

00:04:55.407 --> 00:04:57.207
"Hey, I'm gonna just make my factories run

00:04:57.207 --> 00:04:58.260
"a little bit more."

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.450
Or there might be a lot of
people who can help produce

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.150
who have the skills to
do, to produce that good,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.140
so as the price goes
up, more and more people

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.900
are going to start producing that good.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.860
Or it might be using
resources where there's

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.160
no shortage of it.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.380
Where, as the price even
goes up incrementally,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.220
people will just use more
and more of that resource

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.163
to provide more and more of that good.
