00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.230
Let g of x equal cosine of x.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.017
So let's actually graph that.

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:07.850
So that would be the
graph right over there.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.600
I drew it ahead of time.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.230
So this is a segment of cosine
of x between x is equal to 0

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.120
and x equals pi.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.150
Obviously, it keeps on going
in both directions after that.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.090
And then they ask
us, what is the limit

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.280
as h approaches 0 of g of pi
plus h minus g of pi over h?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.925
So they are concerning
themselves with g of pi.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.760
So let's look at the
point pi comma g of pi.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.130
So that right there is the
point pi comma g of pi.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.040
And they're also concerning
themselves with g of pi plus h.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.490
So let's say that
this right over here

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.510
is the x value pi plus h.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.112
And then this right over here
would be the point pi plus h,

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:04.857
g of pi plus h-- would be
this point right over here.

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:06.440
And they're essentially
trying to find

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.530
the slope between
these two points.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.040
If we wanted to find the
slope between these points,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.190
it would be change in
our y value over change

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.390
in x, or change in the vertical
over change in the horizontal.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.530
What is our change
in the vertical?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.406
What is the change
in the vertical?

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:22.780
Well, the change
in the vertical,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.970
we'll take this y value
here-- so g of pi plus h.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.440
We'll subtract this y
value here-- minus g of pi.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.420
So that was our
change in the vertical

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.840
over the change
in the horizontal.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.900
Well, what is that going to be?

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.710
Well that's going to
be pi plus h minus pi.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.140
And this is exactly what we have
or, before we take the limit,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230
what we have right over here.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.410
So this is going to be g
of pi plus h minus g of pi,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.640
all of that over--
these pi's cancel out--

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.650
all of that over h.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.960
Now, so this is the
slope, this slope the way

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.590
I've-- it's a slope of the
secant line right over here.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040
Now let's think
about what is going

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.160
to happen as h gets
closer and closer to 0.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.300
So the way I've drawn
it right over here,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.230
that means that
this point is going

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.530
to go further and
further to the left.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.010
This point is
going to go further

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.540
and further and
further to the left.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.280
So pi plus h, as h approaches
0, is going to approach pi.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.330
If we assumed h was a
negative value, then

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.920
we would be
approaching from here.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.500
But what is going to
happen as h becomes

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.530
smaller and smaller and smaller?

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.010
Well, the point pi
plus h, g of pi plus h

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610
is going to get closer
and closer to this point.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.800
And the slope of
those secant lines--

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.949
I know it's hard to see,
because it's small here--

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.490
they're going to
start getting closer

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.830
and closer to the slope of
the tangent line right at x

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.450
equals pi.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.850
So this right over here
really is another way

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:27.205
of saying the slope of the
tangent line at x equals pi.

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.730
Well, what does that look like?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.188
Well the slope of
the tangent line,

00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:32.660
we're at a minimum point at
x equals pi right over here.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.580
Cosine of pi we know
is a negative 1.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.149
That's a minimum value.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.440
It's one of the minimum values.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160
It keeps going to
that for cosine of x.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.680
And so its tangent line is just
going to be a horizontal line.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.650
So we know that this right
over here is going to be 0.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.876
Now, there are other ways
you could have tackled it.

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:54.250
We don't have the
tools right now

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.090
to do it purely
algebraically-- to say cosine

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.190
of pi plus h minus cosine of pi.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.550
There are ways to do it.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.008
But we're not going
to do that now.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.640
The other option that you
could do is use a calculator.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.130
So for example, you
could say, well, OK,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.640
let's just take very small
h's and just evaluate them.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:21.339
So we'll evaluate cosine of pi
plus some h minus cosine of pi

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.450
over that small h.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.640
And we're going to get
smaller and smaller h's here.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.223
And so actually,
let's try to do that.

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:28.830
That could be interesting.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.490
So let me clear this.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.230
So let's just take a
really, really small h's,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.600
h's getting really,
really close to 0.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.030
So let me make sure I'm in
Radian mode, first of all.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.800
I'm in Degree.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800
So let me fix that.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.380
All right, perfect.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.260
And now let me
take cosine of pi.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:01.850
I'll take a reasonably small
h, 0.1, minus cosine of pi.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.260
I always forget where the pi is.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.970
So that's the numerator.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.060
And then let me divide
that by the same h, by 0.1.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.100
So this is just my previous
answer divided by 0.1.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.440
So I get 0.04.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.299
Now let me make h even smaller.

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.340
And I'll actually do in
one expression, actually,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.920
this time.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.330
So cosine of-- actually,
make it a lot smaller--

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:34.470
of pi plus 0.0001-- so
1/10,000 more than pi,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.580
right over there--
minus cosine of pi.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.930
And now we are going to
divide by this h, 0.0001.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.610
And what do we get?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.740
5 times 10 to the
negative 5th-- so you

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.580
see clearly that we're getting
to some really, really, really,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.980
really small numbers, that this
expression is approaching 0.
