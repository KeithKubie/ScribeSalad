1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal, minimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,890
I can run flat out for a half mile before
my hands start shaking familiar else?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,970
Your personal question now
with the, it's like to be,

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm a cybernetic organism, living
tissue over metal endoskeleton.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,650
So this episode is brought
to you by [inaudible]

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,910
headspace. More than 80% of
the people I have interviewed,

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,140
world-class performers across
the military, entertainment,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,940
sports, and beyond all have some
type of meditative practice.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,150
I tried for years and
years and failed miserably.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,170
The key is making it simple and you can
dramatically improve your life in just

11
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,030
10 minutes a day. And
technology can help you.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,530
This change comes through
guided meditation and
headspace is by far the most

13
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,850
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,500
It's meditation made simple.

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,950
So what I recommend is that you
take this practice meditation,

16
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:01,840
which is rooted in thousands
of years of tradition,

17
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,720
supported by thousands
of scientific studies,

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,010
and try it for 10 minutes
a day for 10 days.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,830
That's all you need to do. You

00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:20,650
His last name is p, U. D. D. I. C. O.
M. B. E. If you want to look that up.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,740
But otherwise, download
the free headspace app.

23
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:28,150
I have it on my phone and begin their

24
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:32,260
meditation. Completely free. 10
minutes a day. That's all it takes.

25

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,171
Hello boys and girls.

43
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,320
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

44
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:41,970
Where does usually my job to deconstruct
world class performers across all

45
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:46,440
different areas and industries, whether
they be military, chess, sports,

46
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:50,370
entertainment, or otherwise.
Business. Of course, the obvious one.

47
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,940
This time it is a conversation between
friends and I am extremely excited to

48
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,760
have Kevin Kelly back on the Kevin
Kelly. I've said this before,

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,330
might be the real life, most
interesting man in the world.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,210
I'm not making up what
I'm about to read to you.

51
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,460
He is senior maverick at wired magazine,

52
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:14,050
which he cofounded in 1983 he also
cofounded the all Species Foundation,

53
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:19,051
a nonprofit aimed at cataloging
and identifying every
living species on earth in

54
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:21,870
his spare time. Of course, I'm
using that tongue and cheek.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,860
He writes bestselling books, many of
them cofounded the Rosetta project,

56
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:30,300
which is building an archive
of all documented human
languages and serves on the

57
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:33,600
board of the long now
foundation as part of the last,

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,500
he's investigating how to revive and
restore endangered or extinct species,

59
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,710
including the wooly mammoth
that is not made up. Folks.

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,320
We touched on a lot of really fun stuff
in this episode and when Kevin arrived

61
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,790
at my house to record,

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,480
I had certain plans and I asked him what
he wanted to highlight or focus on and

63
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,210
we just decided to catch up as friends.

64
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:59,211
So this is very truly the
type of conversation that
led me in the first place

65
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:00,900
many moons ago.
