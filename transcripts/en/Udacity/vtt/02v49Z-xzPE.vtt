In our exploration of health fall,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.080
we saw that patients could upload
data from a large number of devices.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.080
This is, of course,
increasingly possible, inexpensive, and

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.280
convenient with embedded
smartphone motion and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.920
other sensors,
being the latest technologies.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.920
With the introduction of
Apple's new HealthKit,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.030
it may be that the phone itself,
is the aggregation device.
