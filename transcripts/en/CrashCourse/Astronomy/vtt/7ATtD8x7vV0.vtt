00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.200
When you look up at the night sky, and if
you happen to live far from city lights, you

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.650
can see thousands of stars. It seems like
the sky is crammed shoulder to shoulder with

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.430
them. And you’re only seeing the tiniest
fraction of stars there are; billions more

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.170
exist that are too faint to see with just
your eyes.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.860
As you ponder this incredible number, a natural
thought arises: Are there planets circling

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.990
those stars, too? And are any of them like
Earth?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.990
People just like you and me have wondered
about this for thousands of years. And right

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.810
now, today, we can answer that question.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.810
And the answer is: yes.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.200
Our Sun is orbited by a lovely array of planets.
And they’re wildly diverse — big, small,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.770
airless, rocky, gaseous, hot, cold, and more.
That makes you think that maybe forming planets

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.570
is easy, with so many varieties to choose
from. Even if making planets is hard, there

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.050
are so many stars in the sky that it’s hard
to believe our Sun is the only one that’s

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.720
been able to pull this trick off.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.860
Astronomers have fretted over this for a long
time, but trying to find such planets is hard.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.980
The biggest problem is, any such planets would
be faint, far away, and sitting right on top

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850
of their parent star. Being able to see one
in a telescope would be like trying to spot

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.170
a firefly sitting next to searchlight.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.790
So if you can’t spot a planet like that
directly, maybe you can spot it indirectly.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.220
Imagine two kids, one big and one small, facing
each other. They clasp hands and start to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.029
spin around. As they do, the little kid, who
weighs less, will make a big circle, and the

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.049
bigger kid will make a small circle.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.400
The same would be true of a star and planet.
As the planet orbits the star, it makes a

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.209
big circle (or ellipse). But the planet has
gravity, too, and it tugs on the star. That

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.089
means the star will make a small circle—what’s
called reflexive motion.

00:01:56.089 --> 00:02:00.589
For a long time, astronomers looked really
hard for this motion in nearby stars.

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:06.820
But it turns out that indirect effect is also too small to
see. There were a few false alarms, but no real planets.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.140
Then, in 1992, everything changed. Astronomers
Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail made a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.310
shocking announcement: They found not just
one planet, but two orbiting a pulsar, the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.660
dead remnant of a star that had exploded.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.220
This was really bizarre: When a star explodes,
it’s a catastrophic event that should destabilize

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.240
any orbiting planets. It’s the LAST place anyone would
have thought to find them. However, follow up work

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.020
quickly confirmed that the planets did indeed exist,
and in fact a third one was found a few years later.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.100
The first true alien planets had been found.
Officially, we call them exoplanets, which,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.160
you have to admit, is pretty cool.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.360
While this was an incredible discovery, it
was still a little unsatisfying.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.700
For one thing, pulsars are really weird, and for
another it looked like those planets may have

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.060
formed around the pulsar after the supernova explosion,
from the material left over from the catastrophe.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.460
That’s nothing at all like our own solar
system. And that still left the question open:

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.680
Are there exoplanets orbiting SUN-LIKE stars?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.800
We didn’t have to wait long to find out.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.160
In 1995, Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and
Didier Queloz made a big announcement: They

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.320
had found a planet orbiting the star 51 Peg, a star
very much like the Sun just 50 light years away.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.060
How did they do it? Well, remember those two
kids holding hands and circling each other?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.260
Even though the wiggling back and forth of
the star is too small to measure, that doesn’t

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.040
mean the effect is undetectable.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.400
As the host star of the exoplanets makes its
little circle, sometimes it’s headed toward

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.340
us, and sometimes away. That means that its
light will undergo a Doppler shift, and that

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.829
CAN be detected. It’s not a big shift, and
takes some pretty fancy equipment to see it,

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.389
but it’s measurable. That’s how Mayor
and Queroz found their planet.

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.180
And the planet they found, called 51 Peg b,
is weird.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.740
For one thing, the orbital period turns out
to be just a little over 4.23 days. That’s

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.120
right, I said DAYS. That means the planet
is seriously close to its parent star, just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.220
8 million km out. Compare that to Mercury,
which is on average 55 million km from the Sun.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.040
Not only that, but the amount of Doppler shift
in the star is related to the mass of the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.320
planet; a more massive planet pulls harder
on the star, making it move more quickly.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.480
They found the planet was at least half the
mass of Jupiter, and probably more.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.280
That was a problem. According to planetary
formation models, that wasn’t possible!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.460
You can’t form a planet that big that close
to a star.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.700
Well, it turns out the models are probably
right. The planet DIDN’T form that close.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.400
It probably formed farther out, just like
Jupiter did. And like Jupiter, it then moved,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.380
migrated inward toward the star as it interacted
with the disk of planet-forming material around

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.129
the star. In our solar system, Jupiter didn’t
get very far in its inward motion – it’s

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.520
thought that interactions with Saturn put the brakes
on that, and pulled Jupiter out to where it is now.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.419
Apparently 51 Peg b didn’t have its own
version of Saturn pulling on it. Its inward

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.740
spiral continued until it ran out of disk
material to interact with, which was very

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.330
close indeed to the star. We call planets
like that “hot Jupiters”.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.629
Once 51 Peg b was found, other teams began
looking for short-period planets, and within

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.580
a few years several more had been found, many
of them hot Jupiters just like 51 Peg b.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.899
Now mind you, at first there was a LOT of
doubt and skepticism in the community about

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.509
these exoplanets discoveries. A lot of other
phenomena could masquerade as planets, like

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.729
starspots, or pulsating stars, or background
stars messing up the measurements.

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.129
Scientists discussed these possibilities vociferously
— as well they should. Science is all about

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.479
not fooling ourselves. A good scientist WANTS
other scientists to try to poke holes in their

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.610
ideas. It’s disappointing to be wrong, but
if we are we want to know.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.569
That all changed in 1999. A planet called
HD 209458b had been discovered on a very short

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.360
orbit around its star, taking just 3.5 days.
As luck would have it, from Earth we see the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.400
planet’s orbit edge-on. That means once per
orbit it passes directly in front of its star.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.099
This event is called a transit, and when the
planet transits the star it blocks a little

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.589
bit of the star’s light, and that means
we can detect a dip in the star’s brightness.

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.499
And sure enough, that dip was found. HD 209458b
was the first independent confirmation of

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:19.229
an exoplanet, and pretty much everyone was
on the bandwagon after that.

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.240
The beauty of transiting exoplanets is that the
amount of starlight blocked tells you how

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.029
big the planet is; a big planet blocks more
light. If we know the planets’ mass from

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.649
the star’s Doppler shift, we can use the
planet’s size to calculate its density.

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:37.220
This is important: A gas giant like Jupiter
has a low density, and a rocky metallic planet

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.420
like Earth has a very high density. Without even
being able to see the planet directly, we

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.860
can already start to determine what it’s
like physically.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.639
In 2009, NASA launched a space-based telescope
named Kepler, designed specifically to stare

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.379
at 150,000 stars to detect that telltale dip
in light indicating exoplanet transits.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.540
And oh my, did it work. By early 2015, Kepler
found its 1000th confirmed exoplanet, and

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.520
there are 500 more confirmed from ground-based
telescopes. That’s more than 1500 planets!

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.980
And we have well over 3000 more candidates
from Kepler awaiting confirmation.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.711
All these planets have been found using indirect
methods. What about actually seeing them,

00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:23.191
getting photos of them? That’s hard, because planets
are so faint. But it’s not impossible.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.260
In 2004, the first picture of an exoplanet
was released: 2M1207b, a planet with five

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.029
times the mass of Jupiter. It orbits a brown
dwarf, a peculiar kind of low mass star that

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.409
we’ll learn more about in a future episode.
It’s a young system, which makes it easier

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:43.189
to see: The planet is still glowing hot from
its formation, and it appears a lot brighter

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.069
using a telescope that can see in the infrared.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.179
About a dozen other planets have been seen
this way, too. My favorite is the planet orbiting

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.659
the star Beta Pictoris. It has seven times
the mass of Jupiter, and orbits the star in

00:07:54.659 --> 00:08:00.469
about 20 years—and we’ve actually seen
it move! Images taken a few years apart actually

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:06.760
show the planet in different positions around the
star, confirming its orbital motion. That is incredible.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.680
Taking photos of these planets is still a
daunting task, which is why so few have been

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:14.649
seen. But we’re getting better at this,
and as new technology comes along we’ll

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.049
get more pictures of exoplanets and learn
even more about them.

00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:23.100
The sheer variety of exoplanets is staggering.
Hot Jupiters are the easiest to find, because

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.180
they’re massive and fast, making their signal
easier to detect. But as the techniques have

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:32.430
improved, planets of lower mass have been
seen; the smallest exoplanet found is smaller

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.099
than Mercury, and not much bigger than Earth’s
Moon. We’ve seen planets bigger than Earth

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.690
but smaller than Neptune, called “Super
Earths”. About 500 multiple planet systems

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.959
have been found, too, including one with seven
planets.

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:49.459
We’ve found them around every kind of star,
too. Exoplanets have been detected around

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:54.430
stars like the Sun as well as tiny, cool red
dwarfs; hot, massive blue stars; and even

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.509
red giants, stars nearing the ends of their
lives. One exoplanet system announced in 2015

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:05.399
is incredibly old; the host star is 11 billion
years old! When our solar system was just

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:11.899
beginning to form, these planets were already over
six billion years old—older than our solar system is now.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.920
We’ve even seen planets orbiting binary
stars, making Star Wars seem a lot closer

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.639
to home than being in a galaxy far, far away.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:23.879
We’ve seen so many exoplanets now that we
can extrapolate a bit and get some numbers.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:29.219
The results are staggering: In our galaxy
alone, there may be hundreds of billions of

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.360
planets. In fact, planets may outnumber stars
in the sky.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.440
Now, if we’ve seen planets as big as Jupiter,
and as small as Mercury, then we must have

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.840
seen planets around the same size as Earth,
right?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.320
Yes. Yes, we have. We’ve actually found
hundreds of them so far, it looks like making

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:50.149
planets the same size as ours is pretty easy
for stars to do.

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:55.109
But Earth-SIZED is one thing. Earth-LIKE is
another. How many of these planets might actually

00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:59.960
be habitable? That is, at the right distance
from their star to have Earth-like conditions,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.160
where liquid water could exist on their surface?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.420
We’re not sure. But from what we’ve seen
so far, it looks like the galaxy may have

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.200
more than 10 billion Earth-like planets.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.880
Ten. Billion. And maybe a lot more than that.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.940
Now I want to be careful here: We don’t
know what kind of atmospheres these planets

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:20.759
will have, or what they’re composed of.
Do the planets have magnetic fields strong

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:24.699
enough to prevent solar wind from eroding
away their atmosphere? Do they even have an

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.740
atmosphere, let alone liquid water?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:32.440
We don’t know. But still, there are a LOT of
planets out there. There could very well be a twin

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.160
of Earth orbiting a star not too far away. And over the
whole galaxy? We could be part of a very large family.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:45.040
After all this time, we finally have an answer to one of
the biggest questions we’ve ever asked in astronomy:

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.839
The sky is filled with planets.

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:51.980
Today you learned that planets orbiting other
stars exist and can be detected with a variety

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.740
of methods. Nearly 2000 have been found so
far. The most successful method is using transits,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.550
where a planet physically passes in front
of its parent star, producing a measurable

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.949
dip in the star’s light. Another way is to measure
the Doppler shift in a star’s light due

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:10.639
to reflexive motion as the planet orbits.
Exoplanets appear to orbit nearly every kind

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:15.240
of star, and we’ve even found planets that
are the same size as Earth. We think there

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.680
may be many billions of Earth-like planets
in our galaxy.
