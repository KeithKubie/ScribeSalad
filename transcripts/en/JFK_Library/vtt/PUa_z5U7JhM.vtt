00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.830
- And I told him by email that I was--

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.120
the good news, I will be coming to London

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.760
for about a eight month long job.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.647
And I said "I'm not gonna
tell you what it is,

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.147
"but it's not theater."

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.163
And he sent back an email saying,

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:24.253
"my guess is it's this
show called The Crown.

00:00:25.147 --> 00:00:28.253
"About the English royals.

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:32.317
"What role would it be?

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:36.027
"The prince, the old king?

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:39.007
"If it's Winston Churchill you should know

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.157
"that every actor in London

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:43.485
"will have a contract out for you."

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.430
(audience laughing)

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.230
And I sort of swallowed
hard when I read that.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.570
A couple of weeks later
Nick was in New York

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.600
and I had supper with him
and a lot of other friends.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.427
And I got in the taxi with him and I said,

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:04.690
"Nick, it's true, it's
Churchill, in The Crown."

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.310
And his answer was "they will kill you."

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.675
(audience laughing)

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:14.970
And he said it without any irony at all.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.580
And I really was frightened.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330
And I also didn't know whether The Crown

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.663
was gonna be any good.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.883
Boy was it ever good.
