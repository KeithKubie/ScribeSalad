00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.290
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.869
is think about how to visualize
distributions of data,

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:08.368
and then to analyze those visualizations,

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:10.143
and we will eventually get to something

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.642
known as a density curve.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:14.609
But let's start with a simple example,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.882
just to review some concepts.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.952
Let's say I go to 16 students

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.457
and I ask them to measure
how many glasses of water

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:24.615
they drink per day for the last 30 days,

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.181
and then to average it.

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.079
And so this data point right over here

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.173
tells us one student drank an average

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:33.251
of 0.5 glasses of water per day.

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.884
That person is probably very dehydrated.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:38.883
This person drank 8.1
glasses of water per day,

00:00:38.883 --> 00:00:42.607
on average, for the last 30
days, they are better hydrated.

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:44.770
If we want to visualize that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.202
we can set up a frequency histogram,

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:51.329
where we can create some categories.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.365
So this first category
would be for data points

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.455
that are greater than or equal
to zero, and less than one,

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.206
and we can see that two data points

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:01.439
fall into that category,

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.393
and that's why the bar right over here

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:05.558
for that category is up to two.

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:08.316
This category right over
here is greater than

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:11.599
or equal to three, and less than four.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.360
Notice, there are four data
points in that category

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.682
and on this frequency histogram

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:22.340
the height of the bar is indeed four.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.514
So this is a nice way of
looking at a distribution.

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:27.191
But you might be more concerned

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:30.066
with what percentage of my data

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.358
falls into each of these categories,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.834
and that becomes especially interesting

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.968
if we have many, many, many data points,

00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:40.135
and if we had, you know,
1,600,432,507 data points,

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.451
well just knowing the
absolute number that fit

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.904
into each category isn't so useful,

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:50.046
the percent that fits into each category

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:51.793
is a lot more useful.

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:53.985
And so for that, we could set up

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:57.165
a relative frequency histogram.

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:59.996
So notice, this is
representing the same data.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.554
But in that first category,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.205
instead of the bar height being two,

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:07.399
the bar height is now 12.5%.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.630
Why is that?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.797
Because two of the 16 data
points fall into this category.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.228
2/16 is 1/8, which is 12.5%.

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:22.678
And this one right over here, notice,

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:24.273
instead of the height being four

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:28.091
for four data points, it's now 25%.

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.957
But these are saying the same thing.

00:02:30.957 --> 00:02:34.715
Four out of the 16 data points
fall into this category.

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:39.121
4/16 is 1/4, which is 25%.

00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:42.279
So both of these types of
histograms are really useful

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.632
and you will see them
used all of the time.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.377
But there are also cases where you have

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:49.387
many, many, many more data points,

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:52.554
and you want more granular categories.

00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:56.599
So what you could do, is, well,

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.259
let's just make our categories
a little more granular.

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.491
So for example, instead of them being

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.354
one glass of water wide,

00:03:03.354 --> 00:03:05.810
maybe you make them half
a glass of water wide.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.053
So this first category could be

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:12.136
greater than or equal to
zero, and less than 0.5,

00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:16.263
and that will give you a clearer picture,

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:17.354
and I'm now assuming in a world

00:03:17.354 --> 00:03:19.266
where we have more than 16 data points,

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:21.379
maybe we have 16 million data points,

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.513
this would be percentages
on the left hand side.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:28.436
But maybe that isn't good enough for you,

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:32.192
maybe you wanna get even more granular.

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:34.751
So you make everything, each category,

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.173
a quarter of a glass.

00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:38.623
But maybe that doesn't satisfy,

00:03:38.623 --> 00:03:41.513
you wanna get more and
more and more granular.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.930
Well, you could imagine
where this is going.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.763
You could get to a point
where you're approaching

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.825
an infinite number of categories,

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:50.844
and each category is infinitely thin,

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:53.031
is super, super thin, to a point

00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:55.561
that if you just connect
the tops of the bars

00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:59.005
that you will actually get a curve.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.498
And this type of curve is something

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:04.258
that we actually use in the statistics,

00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:07.220
and, as promised at the
beginning of the video,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.553
this is the density curve we talk about.

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.596
And what's valuable about a density curve,

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:17.843
it is a visualization of a distribution

00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:22.666
where the data points can take
on any value in a continuum.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:26.310
They're not just thrown
into these coarse buckets.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.463
So how would you interpret
something like this?

00:04:29.463 --> 00:04:31.813
If you look over the entire interval

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:36.326
from zero, let's say, to
nine, assuming no one drank

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:38.578
more than an average of
nine glasses per day,

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:41.784
even in our 16 million data points,

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:44.630
well then the area under
the curve over that interval

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.380
is going to be 100%, or 1.0.

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:54.822
This is going to be true
for any density curve,

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:57.936
that the entire area of the curve is 100%,

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.581
it represents all of the data points.

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:04.418
A density curve will also
never take on a negative value,

00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:06.081
you won't see the curve dip down

00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:09.473
and do something strange like that.

00:05:09.473 --> 00:05:11.411
Now, with that out of the way,

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.109
let's think about how
we would make use of it.

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:18.920
If I wanted to know what
percentage of my data

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.837
falls between two and four glasses,

00:05:23.004 --> 00:05:24.465
well I would look at that interval.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.465
I'd go from two to four,

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:30.732
I would look at this
interval right over here,

00:05:30.732 --> 00:05:34.730
and I would try to figure out
the area under the curve here.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.342
And this area is going to be
greater than or equal to zero,

00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:42.769
and less than or equal to 100%.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:44.379
When I eyeball it right over here,

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.680
it looks like it's about 40%

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.273
of the entire area under the curve,

00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:54.440
so just eyeballing it, I would
say roughly 40% of my data

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:57.755
falls into this interval.

00:05:57.755 --> 00:06:02.542
If I were to ask you what
percentage of the data

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.375
is greater than three,

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.531
well then you would be
looking at this area,

00:06:08.531 --> 00:06:12.505
and it looks like it is about 50%,

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.510
but once again, I am estimating it.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.469
But you can start to see
how, even with estimation,

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.931
a density curve could be useful.

00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:23.032
In the real world, statisticians
will often have tables

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.655
that might represent the
information for the density curve,

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:27.111
they might have computer programs

00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:28.921
or some type of automated tool,

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:31.573
and there are also
well-known density curves.

00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:34.854
The famous Bell Curve that
we will study later on,

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.455
where there's a lot of precise data

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:40.511
and a lot of tools to
exactly figure out the areas.

00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:42.391
The last thing I'd like to cover

00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:46.484
is a key misconception for density curves.

00:06:46.484 --> 00:06:50.497
If I were to ask you,
approximately what percentage

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:55.048
of my data is exactly three
glasses of water per day?

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.626
And when I say exactly, I mean exactly

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:02.198
the number 3.000 with zeroes
just going on and on forever,

00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:04.017
the exact number three.

00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:06.795
Well, you might be tempted to
just say okay, this is three.

00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:09.283
Let me see the corresponding
point on the curve.

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:13.480
It looks like it is about 0.2,
or a little higher than that,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.625
so maybe you would say a
little bit more than 20%,

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:20.387
or approximately 20%.

00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:23.715
And what I would say to
you, is this is wrong.

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:27.497
Remember, the percentage
of the data in an interval

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:30.014
is not the height of the curve,

00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:33.659
it is the area under the
curve in that interval.

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:36.555
And if we're just talking
about one precise value,

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:39.070
like exactly the number three,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.498
there is no area under the curve.

00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:43.489
This vertical line that I just drew

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:46.136
over the number three has no width,

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:49.141
and this actually makes
sense in the real world.

00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:52.207
Even if you were to look
at 16 million people,

00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:53.979
it is very unlikely that even anyone

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:57.211
would drink exactly three
glasses of water per day.

00:07:57.211 --> 00:07:59.546
I'm talking about not one atom more

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.079
or one atom less than three glasses.

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:05.933
There might be many people
between 2.9 and 3.1,

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:08.615
but no one is exactly three glasses a day.

00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:09.680
When someone says I'm drinking

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.173
three glasses of water per day,

00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:12.459
that would be a rough estimate.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:15.376
They're probably 3.001, or 2.99999,

00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:20.575
or 3.15, or whatever else.

00:08:22.073 --> 00:08:24.403
And so instead, you could say

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:27.575
what percentage falls in the interval,

00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:31.158
maybe, that is greater
than or equal to 2.9

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.289
and less than or equal to 3.1.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.277
And so once you have an interval,

00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:40.442
then you actually can look at the area,

00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:43.815
so we're gonna go from 2.9 to 3.1,

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:48.270
so now we have an interval
that actually has width,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.225
and so it'd be roughly the size

00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:53.427
of this yellow area that I'm
shading in right over here,

00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:56.229
and we can approximate it with a rectangle

00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:59.044
even though the top of
this curve isn't flat,

00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:01.414
but we can say, look, it's approximately

00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:04.247
like a rectangle that is 0.2 high,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.517
and what's the width?

00:09:06.517 --> 00:09:10.351
The width here, if we're
going from 2.9 to 3.1,

00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.184
the width is going to be 0.2 wide,

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:16.785
and so we could approximate this area

00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:20.483
by approximating this rectangle,
the area of the rectangle.

00:09:20.483 --> 00:09:24.650
0.2 times 0.2, that would
give us an area of 0.04.

00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:30.747
Or we could say
approximately 4% of the data

00:09:30.747 --> 00:09:32.664
falls in this interval.
