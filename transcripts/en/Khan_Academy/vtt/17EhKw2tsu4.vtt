00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.401
- [Voiceover] When we
start to study electricity,

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.554
we need to get an idea of what is Current

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:06.157
and what is Voltage and

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:07.466
in two earlier videos,

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.383
I talked about the idea
of current and voltage,

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:16.745
current and voltage and,
and what they meant.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.738
And when we talked about current,

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.383
it's easiest to describe current
when we talk about wires.

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.050
Let's say we have a copper wire.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.550
We talked about a copper
wire and inside it was,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.709
there was electrons in it,

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.293
and they have a negative charge, we know

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.993
they have a negative charge,

00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:40.055
and if we put a voltage on them,

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.795
those electrons would move
in some direction like that.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:46.453
So if I put a plus voltage over here

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:47.993
and a minus voltage over here,

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:49.293
the electrons are repelled

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:51.226
by the minus voltage and they're attracted

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.294
to the positive voltage.

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.211
That is called an Electron Current.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:04.779
So talking about current

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.895
in terms of what's actually
happening inside a wire

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.203
makes some sense, it's easier
to understand current and

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.160
that these electrons are moving around.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.668
And whenever we talk about this,

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:15.853
we'll talk about it specifically

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:19.192
that there's an electron
current going on here.

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:21.519
Now at the same time,
what I said in that video,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:23.028
and I'll say again,

00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:26.467
is the convention for
describing current is this.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:30.634
This is called the
Conventional Current Direction.

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:43.287
The convention we've had
for hundreds of years

00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:44.595
is that current is the direction

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.059
that a positive charge would move

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:49.432
if there was a positive charge there.

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:51.881
So, whenever we talk
about current from now on,

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:54.416
it'll always be conventional current,

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:55.613
and in fact, we don't even need to mention

00:01:55.613 --> 00:01:58.844
conventional any more, it's just current.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:01.879
Current is the direction that
positive charges would move.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.511
If we ever talk about electron
current then we'll use

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.266
the word, electron current.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.849
Now, as a reminder, when
we talked about voltage,

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.779
uh, this was built up by analogy

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.586
and the analogy was to electrons
rolling down a mountaintop,

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.427
so here's our mountain, remember this?

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:21.897
And I built a

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:26.260
battery or another
voltage source like this,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.804
and we said, that what
a battery does is it

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:31.304
pumps out energetic electrons,

00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:35.454
and they go down a hill.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.371
Roll downhill and go back into the,

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:42.010
back into the positive
terminal of the battery.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.371
And when we design
circuits, what we do, is we,

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:47.647
we put stuff in the
way of this electron on

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:51.582
its path, and this is where
we build our circuits.

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:53.540
So the, the electron current is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.465
going in this direction
here down the hill.

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.513
The conventional current direction or

00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:00.346
the current direction is this way.

00:03:02.074 --> 00:03:04.644
So now, I'm gonna redraw
my circuit and my battery.

00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:06.124
I'm gonna flip the battery around it

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:09.624
until the positive terminal is on the top,

00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:13.055
and I'll put my circuit

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:16.138
over on the side over here like this.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.419
There's my circuit that I just built.

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.919
Let's connect those circuits up like that.

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.754
This is the plus side of the battery,

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:28.188
this is the minus side.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:30.463
The plus side goes with the long bar

00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:33.141
and the minus side goes
with the short bar there.

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:34.456
And the current direction here,

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.863
the conventional current direction,

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.753
or just plain current direction,

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:39.586
is in that direction.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:43.172
Out of the positive and
back into the negative.

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.904
From now on, this is
what we mean by current.

00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:47.712
And we know that the
electrons are in here.

00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.475
They're heading around this
way, like that, but that's okay.

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:53.171
This is the, this is the nomenclature

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.445
for conventional current
or just plain current.
