00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.940
By these transformations,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.501
it's possible to write any linear
program in a variety of forms.

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:10.420
Two forms, however, tend to be
the most convenient and widely used.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.708
First is what we'll call
the symmetric form.

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:16.137
We'll see why it gets that name
when we consider duality and

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:18.490
second is the standard form.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.880
The key difference between the two is
that we have changed the inequality for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.330
an equality.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.160
To better understand the relationship
between these two forms,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.280
I'm going to write the standard form
in terms of the symmetric form.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.027
To convert the m
inequalities to equalities,

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:37.722
we introduce n slack variables.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:41.622
Xn plus 1 through xn + m.

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:45.691
And of course, this means that we need
to augment our matrix a as well, so

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.060
that the slack variables
can do their job.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.910
And C also needs to be augmented, so
that we can multiply it with the new x

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.450
without changing the value
of the objective function.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.280
It's interesting to think about
the differences between these two forms

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.260
geometrically, as well.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.613
In the symmetric, we're optimizing
over a polytope in end dimensions.

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:09.818
In the standard form, however,

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:14.390
these equality constraints here
define something called the flat,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.667
which is rather like a subspace, only
it's away from the origin and then we're

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:24.663
intersecting that with the cone defined
by the positive coordinate axes.

00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:28.120
And of course,
we're in a higher dimension.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.700
Note that we expect an optimum for

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
the symmetric problem to be at one
of the vertices of the polytope.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.050
That is to say,
of these m plus n constraints here.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.270
N must hold with equality or
be tight in the common products.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.530
Some might come from A, some might come
from the non-negativity constraints,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.570
but there will always be n of them.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.850
Over here in standard form,
the notion of whether the constraints of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.040
A are tight or not is captured by
the slack variables that we introduced.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
A slack variable is zero if and only if,
the corresponding constraint is tight.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.960
Thus, at least n of
the variables will be zero

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.430
when we're at a vertex of
the original polytope.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.752
In fact, if I tell you which n variables
are zero and the ones that are nonzero

00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:24.743
correspond to a linearly independent
set of constraints, then you can

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:29.673
construct the rest of the variable
based on the equality constraint.

00:02:29.673 --> 00:02:33.180
We'll see this when we talk
about basic solutions.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.880
Now so far, I've kept on using the
number of variable n and the number of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.510
constraints m from the symmetric form,
even as we talk about the standard form.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.610
In general, however,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.240
when discussing the standard form,
we redefine n to be the old n plus m.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.490
So don't get confused about that.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.300
One other thing to note about this
equality form is that we can assume that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.580
A is full rank or has rank m
where m is the number of rows.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.240
That is the say,
the rows should be linearly independent.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.620
If the rows aren't linearly independent,
then there are two possibilities.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.570
One is that the constraints
are inconsistent,

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.850
meaning that there is no solution.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.960
The other possibility is that
the constraints are redundant,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.650
meaning that some of
them can be eliminated.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.330
So from now on,
we'll just assume that A has full rank.
