Langen: So when we first started
developing our application,

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:05.067
we used linear layouts
a lot,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.901
and we found they were a source
of some slow-down.

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.667
And we were able to optimize
our views

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.601
by using
relative layouts instead.

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:13.234
Um, I would really recommend

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.567
that anyone new
to the platform

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.934
familiarize themselves
with all the various view groups

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.501
and how they're implemented,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.000
so they can keep their views
as responsive as possible.
