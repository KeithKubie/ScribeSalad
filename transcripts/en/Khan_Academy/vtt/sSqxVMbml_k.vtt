00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.230
There's some news out today
about how many jobs, or at

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.020
least a claim of how many jobs,
have been created so far

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.045
from the stimulus plan.

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.660
And at first, the numbers
look impressive.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.900
The administration said that
650,000 jobs were created from

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.280
$150 billion of stimulus
spending so far.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.530
So let me write that down.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.870
So what does that turn out
to on a per-job basis?

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.570
Let's see, let's get a
calculator out here.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.360
If I spent $150 billion to get
650,000 jobs-- let me just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.240
divide by 650,000-- I get
to $230,000 per job.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.100
So that is equal to $230,000
per job, which is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
claimed to be saved.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.520
So obviously, they're not just
outright paying the salary,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.880
these people were adding some
value to begin with.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
So these were clearly
very good jobs.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.820
So $230,000, I think it's fair
to say, is more than the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.310
majority of us make.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.140
So these are very good jobs.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.780
Now, there's a further claim
that at least another 350,000

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.230
jobs were created from $189
billion of tax relief.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.470
We got $189 billion less to
the government and that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.705
created 350,000 jobs.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.350
So let's see what that
turns out to be.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.310
That's $189 billion
in tax relief.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.460
Let's see what that is
on a per job basis.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.410
Get the calculator out.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:36.870
And so, if we have $189 billion,
so you divide that by

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.260
350,000 jobs.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.630
And you get $540,000 per job.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:55.350
So this is equal to $540,000 per
job, which are even better

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.970
than the $230,000 jobs
that we were able to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.050
save with $150 billion.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.790
So clearly some very highly paid
people are being able to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.960
keep their jobs by virtue
of the stimulus package.
