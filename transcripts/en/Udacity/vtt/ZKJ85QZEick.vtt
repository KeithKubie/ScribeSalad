00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.020
Once we've established the running
time for an algorithm,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.830
we can analyze other algorithms that use
it as a subroutine much more easily.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.440
Consider this question.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.770
Suppose that an algorithm
A has running time of order n.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.480
And suppose that algorithm B
calls algorithm A logn times.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.470
And then algorithm B spends
an additional order og

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.490
squared time afterwards.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
And my question to you is.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.690
What is the tightest bound that we
can put on the running time of B?
