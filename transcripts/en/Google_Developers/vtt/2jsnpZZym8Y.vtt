00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.540
DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.530
I'm Don Dodge, and this is
Google Group Access.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.020
Today, our topic is Best
Practices for Developing

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.125
Android Applications and How to
be Successful on the Google

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.570
Play Store.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.480
My guest today is Reto
Meier, my colleague.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
Reto's in charge of Android
developer relations.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.910
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.780
RETO MEIER: Thank you.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.440
DON DODGE: Reto, the number one
question I get everyday

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.130
is, how do I get my
app featured on

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.160
the Google Play store?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.270
RETO MEIER: It's a
common question.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.950
Absolutely.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.550
With Google I/O coming up, I'm
expecting to hear a lot over

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.970
those few days.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.040
I think it's an important
question because I think

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.000
that's fundamentally--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.080
it's probably the biggest impact
you can have on making

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.110
your app more successful.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.870
Having a lot more downloads is
getting into one of those

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.800
featured spots.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.239
So it is a question
we get a lot.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.230
And the answer is both simple
and quite complicated.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.920
Really, what it comes down to
is building a great app,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.090
something which our
merchandising team is going to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.690
be able to look at and think,
this is something people are

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.390
going to really love.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.360
This is something which
is going to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.520
help promote our platform.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.720
It's going to help encourage
people to buy Android devices

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.540
and really think great
things about what the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.500
platform can achieve.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.190
So that's the easy way.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.790
It's also kind of a cheap answer
because it's like, OK.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.540
A lot of people have
great apps.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.830
What do we need to do to
go to that extra level?

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.640
And so I think fundamentally,
there's a few very specific

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.610
things you can do.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.140
And the first is to make sure
that all of your Google Play

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.360
assets are there.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.020
And that's kind of table
stakes to the game.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.880
You need to have a great logo,
great feature graphic, all of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.590
those assets which we ask for.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.980
If you don't have them in your
Google Play listing,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.260
we can't fix you.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.670
It's just not possible.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.550
So that's table stakes
to get into the game.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.750
Beyond that, we actually have
two really great lists which

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.020
we've recently published, which
are "Best Practices for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.789
Creating Quality Apps" and the
same guidelines for creating

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.870
quality tablet apps.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.611
And they're both available
on developer.android.com.

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.240
And what they do is they break
down these check lists which

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.350
tell you exactly what our QA
teams are looking at in order

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.570
to decide whether an app is
viable for featuring.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.860
So if you go through each of
those checklists and make sure

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.123
that you cover all those things,
then again, you're in

00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:28.890
a great position.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.340
So if you have a great app
with all the assets, and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.290
you've gone through the
checklists, then you're in a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.980
real position where you
have a really strong

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.930
chance of being featured.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.670
DON DODGE: Where are those
checklists located?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.660
How do I find them?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840
RETO MEIER: They're all on
developer.android.com on the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660
slash distribute tab.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.920
DON DODGE: So developer.androi
d.com/distributor?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.440
RETO MEIER: Distribute.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.280
DON DODGE: Distribute.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.670
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.640
So we have three sections on
developer.android.com, one for

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000
developers, one for designers,
and one for people

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.040
distributing apps.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.730
And each has a huge amount of
data to help you build the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.660
best apps you can, the best
looking apps you can, and then

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.400
distribute them as successfully
as possible.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.220
And the Distribute tab is, I
think, something which is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.530
something of an undiscovered
gem.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.020
There's a lot of data there
which can help you really

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.010
promote your app, increase
your chances of being

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.780
featured, help your
chances of being

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.740
successful in Google Play.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.370
DON DODGE: That's excellent.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.030
So there's a section for
developers about best

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.160
practices for developing.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.190
There's a section for designers
on how to design

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.170
great apps.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.500
And then there's a section for
how to get distribution and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.640
best practices there.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.935
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:36.950
And I think in days gone by,
developer.android.com was

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.965
primarily for engineers, coding
types like myself, who

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:42.270
are more comfortable
sitting in code.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.500
And over the years, as Android
has developed into the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.590
ecosystem that it is now, it's
become increasingly important

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.350
to focus on those other
things, as well.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.450
And so as that has come more to
the fore, we've put a lot

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.890
more effort in trying to
help people design

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.950
great looking apps.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.520
Design in such a focus
these days.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.090
I think for really no matter
what you're trying to build on

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.970
whatever platform, having that
great design can be the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.440
difference between an app which
a few people enjoy and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.000
which really is a breakout
success.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.340
And then distribution is the
final cog in that wheel.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.310
You know, you have a great
app that looks great.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.050
How do you make it into
a successful business?

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.040
And that's the sort of stuff
that we're trying to highlight

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.240
and promote within the
Distribute tab.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.150
DON DODGE: So let's assume that
the developer has done a

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.160
good job in developing the app
from a technical perspective.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.870
Design is a little harder.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.450
That's like I know a good
design when I see it.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.120
But I couldn't describe it.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.710
So how do you encourage
people?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.790
What are some of the best
practices in design?

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.990
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.060
It's actually a really
good point.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.090
And it's something which we
really try and encourage.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.640
So what we have in the Design
tab is really a lot of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.760
information around what are
the expectations around

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.810
building an app which looks
right on Android.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.140
Now we don't want to get into
a situation where every app

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.150
looks the same.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.070
That's boring.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.020
That's not helping people
create new and really

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.780
interesting experiences.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.950
So what we focus on is providing
a set of guidelines

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.940
which will make your
app look at home

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.790
within the Android ecosystem.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.910
So that it will feel as though
it's a part of the system and

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.430
integrate well with all the
other apps running there.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.940
So what we really encourage is
making sure that you don't

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.790
break any of those guidelines.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.320
You don't institute any sort
of user experience actions

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.680
which are contrary to
what people expect.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.700
For example, if they see tabs on
a screen, they're going to

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.040
expect to be able to swipe left
and right using a view

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.670
pager to move that content.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.690
So if you don't do that, then
you introduce this cognitive

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.810
dissonance for your users.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.810
They're going to expect
something to

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.330
work, and it doesn't.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.060
Suddenly they lose confidence
in their

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.390
ability to use your app.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.600
And that makes them less
inclined to use it.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.540
So we say, don't break
the guidelines.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.420
Create a consistent
experience.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.200
But use that as a base, and
build on top of that to create

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.760
something as unique
as possible.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.300
We really encourage people to
create apps, which are a

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.670
unique experience, which
showcase the content which

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.470
that app is delivering in
interesting and innovative

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.110
ways which fit within the
guidelines that we have.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.520
DON DODGE: While we're on the
topic of design, is there a

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.730
difference between designing
an app for a mobile device

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.370
versus a tablet?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.240
RETO MEIER: I think there is.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.040
And it's a really good
way of looking at

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.920
it, as well, I think.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.030
We try and encourage people
to have, if possible, one

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.030
distributable, which will work
on a variety of different

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.710
devices and work well.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.850
And in terms of implementation,
often that's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.780
not too big a challenge.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.370
Where the real challenge comes
in is creating something which

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.040
works really well on phones and
tablets and any other kind

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.850
of form factor.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.380
And with a lot of different
screen sizes, that can

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.690
introduce a challenge
in design.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.650
Something which works very well
on a small phone may not

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.930
work as well on a tablet.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.100
And so a big part of what we're
encouraging developers

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.210
to do today is take a look at
their app and think about how

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.480
will this work well?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.080
How will this prevent a
better user experience

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.140
on a different device?

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.560
Particularly for tablets because
I think a lot of our

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.960
developers have come to Android
from that phone

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.820
experience.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.320
And We have a bunch of tools
within the framework to make

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.320
sure that many phone apps will
scale up and work reasonably

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.830
well on tablets.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.260
That's really just
the first step.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.480
I think we're moving now to this
next stage where we want

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.620
them to build--

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.940
really design their
apps so that they

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.260
work great on tablets.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.340
And mint.com is a fantastic
example of this, where they've

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.980
looked to see how the
users use our app on

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.280
tablets versus phones.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.460
And so they have with one file
which they distribute two

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.300
complimentary experiences.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.080
So on the phone, you're using it
to enter your expenses, all

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.050
of the things which you're
spending money while

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.080
you're on the go.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.270
On the tablet, it's much more
of a browsing interface.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.890
You're sitting down.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.950
You're looking to see how
have I spent my money.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.190
It's much more immersive.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.570
It has a much longer
engagement.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.340
And they've seen that from using
their analytics, finding

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.530
out how are people using the app
on different devices, and

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.670
then tailoring the experience
to maximize what people are

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.190
already doing on
those devices.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.810
DON DODGE: So the difference
between mobile devices and

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.980
tablets, does it have to
do with design and user

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.540
experience?

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.230
Or are there actually, from an
engineering point of view,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.070
different code that you have
for one versus the other?

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.810
RETO MEIER: Well that's one of
the beauties, I think, of the

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.800
way the Android framework
works is that from an

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.930
engineering perspective, no.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.340
It's all the same
sort of code.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.260
It's all using the same classes
and methods and

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.290
everything else.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.340
You're just having to implement
another design.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.390
And wherever possible, using
things like fragments, we try

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.060
to make that as seamless
as possible.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.270
So you can create different
components, which are just

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.340
effectively arranged
differently.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.150
In a lot of cases, it's
sort of first

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.549
past design for tablets.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.340
It's simply removing a
layer of navigation.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.220
So where on a phone, you
may have a list.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.159
You click an item.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.549
It drills down to
more content.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.470
You click again.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.510
It gives you more content.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.360
On a tablet, particularly in
landscape mode, you have a lot

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.410
more screen real estate.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.200
So you can have the
list on the left.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.930
You click on it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.540
It'll have the detail panels
on the right hand side.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.170
So you've got sort of
more on the screen.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.740
But each of those components
are used in both layouts.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.230
It's just a matter of laying
them out differently.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.770
And wherever possible, the
Android framework tries to

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.370
make that as simple as it can.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.750
DON DODGE: So a mobile device
is obviously quite different

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.860
than a tablet.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.890
But even within mobile devices,
there are different

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.360
manufacturers, different
screen sizes,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.410
that kind of thing.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.900
How do you deal with that?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.820
RETO MEIER: I think there's two
factors to consider there.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.200
And one is we try and think
less about specific form

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.180
factors and more about
screen sizes.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.270
So it's very similar to the way
that web development has

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.320
always worked.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.110
You basically figure out what
layout is going to work and

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.100
how small you can make it until
you're going to have to

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.850
rethink the user interface
for something

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.540
that's easy to use again.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.010
So much of the way we define it
is to say that you need to

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.330
have different layouts
for different

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.540
minimum screen widths.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.630
And that can take care of a lot
of the variation within

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.860
particular categories.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.440
As well as that, we also
like to think about--

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.840
I can't remember.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.190
Can't remember where I
was going with that.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.930
DON DODGE: So how many
applications have a good

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.930
tablet design?

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.730
Or what are some of those best
practices for tablets that

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.180
make it so much better on
a tablet and a different

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.840
experience from the
mobile device?

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.130
RETO MEIER: Right.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.400
OK.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.670
Yeah.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.380
And that's excellent.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380
It actually prompts me to remind
me what I was going to

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.720
say as my second point, which
is responsive design.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.010
It's a big part of that.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.936
So you want to have something
which scales well so that if

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:28.720
there is any sort of variation
between different screen

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.870
sizes, you're going to have an
experience that looks right.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.620
Things expand in the
right places.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.590
You have white space in
the right places.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.220
You don't end up with strange
empty things or really small

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.040
fonts or anything like that.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.770
When it comes to creating that
great tablet design, well for

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.860
a start, we have, again, a
best practices guide on

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.420
developer.android.com for
creating great tablet apps.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.560
And that talks about things
like making sure that you

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.780
don't have excessive
white space.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.390
That you don't have text
which is too small.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.370
That you have big enough
touch targets, all

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.610
these sorts of things.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.940
And that's all, as I say,
detailed more specifically on

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.285
developer.android.com.

00:11:04.285 --> 00:11:06.690
If are building for tablets,
definitely I recommend going

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.060
through that list again.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.410
This is what we look at when
we're trying to figure out is

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.880
this an app which we think is
designed specifically for

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.670
tablets to highlight in
different collections on

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.710
Google Play and those
sort of things.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.365
In terms of specifics, or I
should say, those that's sort

00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:25.680
of the engineering specifics
more generally, looking for--

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.410
or we found that users tend
to find tablets in a more

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.940
engaging way.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.480
So phones will be taken out of
your pocket, spend a couple of

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.200
minutes, put it back in.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.350
Tablets are more
using casually.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.720
On a couch, lying in bed,
whatever else, where you're

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.350
spending half an hour,
an hour at a time.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.210
It's almost an alternative
to a laptop in many ways.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.970
It's sort of an
easy-to-deal-with laptop.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.910
So it's creating experiences
which

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.410
work within that context.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.600
So richer user engagement,
longer periods of time.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.560
You build your phone apps
expecting that users are going

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.760
to be interrupted constantly by
the people around them or

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.420
notifications coming in.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.640
Just the day to day.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.170
On tablets, it's a great
platform for things like media

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.130
consumption.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.140
And you can design your app
using this same sort of

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.090
philosophy, like something which
people are going to be

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.050
able to sit down and
interact with for

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.910
significant periods of time.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.900
DON DODGE: You mentioned
touch points just a

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.810
minute ago in design.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:28.760
And I, this morning, had an app
where it was an HTML5 app.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.520
It looked great on my laptop.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.790
But when I went to use
it on my phone, I

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.530
had to check boxes.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.710
And they were so close that I
couldn't check the right box.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.210
So is that what you mean by
touch points and how to design

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.740
around those?

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.290
RETO MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.097
It's one of the things which
we found with modern smart

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.120
phones and tablets is
that people use

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.060
their fingers to interact.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.070
And this is a feature.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:49.920
It's wonderful.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.010
I had a phone back in the
day which had a stylus

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.020
touchscreen.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:59.490
And that finger experience is
just a much better way to go.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.690
But that does mean that
everything you need to click

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.540
needs to be about the size of
your finger, which an Android

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.480
is 48 dips, which is device
independent pixels.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.265
So on every device, 48 dips is
the right amount of space for

00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:16.130
your pointed finger
to touch things.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.420
So that's a really
important point.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.340
But in terms of how big the
buttons need to be and check

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.460
boxes, but also how much space
do you need to leave between

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.820
different touch targets?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.100
So check boxes is
a great example.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.920
You want to make sure when
someone clicks something,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.430
they're clicking what
they want to.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.010
As soon as someone does
something they didn't want to,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.610
again, they lose confidence
in themselves, in the app.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.760
They're less inclined
to use it.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.170
I've always found that we tend
to be quite deeply engaged in

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.030
the tech world.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.820
So the way we learn things is
you press all the buttons and

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.390
see what it all does.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.030
Most people, that's not
quite how it works.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.360
And a lot of people, and
remembering that smart phones

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.750
have been expanding so quickly,
that it's people who

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.520
used to own feature phones are
now entering into the world of

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.790
smart phones.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.200
Maybe not comfortable with
computers as some of us more

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.280
techy people are.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.220
They sort of approach it with
this feeling that if they

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.760
press things in the wrong order,
it's going to delete

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.370
everything and post nude photos

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.695
of them on the internet.

00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:13.810
Not that there are any.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.180
But somehow.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.210
And so when you're dealing with
people have that sort of

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.740
hesitation around using
technology, you really need to

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.850
do everything you can to remove
that fear, to make them

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:26.560
feel comfortable.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.790
So that anything they press,
it does something.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.615
It doesn't predictable.

00:14:29.615 --> 00:14:30.975
It does something
non-destructive.

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:32.950
It does something they can
take back if they weren't

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.390
happy with what they did.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.080
And really try to make them feel
more comfortable with the

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.190
technology.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.540
DON DODGE: Another question I
get every week is HTML5 versus

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.840
native app.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.360
And that example I used earlier
was an HTML5 app that

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.450
worked great on a laptop.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.890
But when I used it on a
phone, was unusable.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.670
So it's a big debate.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.330
But where do you come
out on that?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.320
RETO MEIER: That's an
interesting topic.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.790
And in fact, I gave a
presentation with Mike

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.050
Mahemoff from the Chrome team
a couple of years ago at

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.250
Google I/O, which tried to
tackle this exact topic.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.080
And it was interesting.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.230
And there was a lot
of interest.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.550
A lot of people want
to know the answer.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.130
And fortunately, or
unfortunately, there's no

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.520
silver bullet.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.970
I think in an ideal world, and
I think Google is a good

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.450
example of this, you do both.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.890
And you make sure both
are really good.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.500
I think these days it's
shortsighted to think that you

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.960
can have a web presence, which
if someone goes to on a

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.510
browser, doesn't look good
on whatever device they

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.030
happen to be using.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.590
On the other hand, there are
certain advantages to building

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.670
native apps, which just
can't be done on web

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.000
browsers right now.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.010
So if you're building apps
which have media content,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.905
which you want them to be
faster, smoother, feel more a

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:44.880
part of the device, native
apps create a really--

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.540
an optimal experience.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.480
So I mean I'm on the
Android team.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.370
So obviously I don't exactly
have a completely independent

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.170
perspective on this.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.470
But I think that you can create
a much better, richer

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.070
experience building a native
app for Android.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.000
But I think it's also worth
investing the time and effort

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.250
to make sure your mobile
experience is fantastic on

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.680
every platform, as well.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.360
DON DODGE: Right.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.870
So native apps have
a few advantages.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.680
One is your logo for the app
appears on the phone screen,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.730
whereas if you're a website,
then you have

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.500
to navigate to it.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.100
It doesn't appear
on your phone.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.070
So that's one.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.720
Another is native apps can send
notifications or messages

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.370
to the top deck.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.165
And HTML5 web apps
can't do that.

00:16:29.165 --> 00:16:29.460
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.070
DON DODGE: Right?

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.260
Those are two obvious ones.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.400
Are there others?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.810
RETO MEIER: I think a lot of the
biggest advantages is you

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.960
get from native sort of
fall into two camps.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.780
One is just the advantages
you get from being

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.780
closer to the metal.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.740
You know, you don't have an
additional interpreter between

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.190
you and the device hardware.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.390
So things can just be
faster and smoother.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.860
DON DODGE: So performance
is better?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.510
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.840
I mean, and it makes
sense, right?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.010
If you're running on top of a
browser, that's just another

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.810
app, another layer, between you
and the hardware, which

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.560
needs to do processing
and rendering.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.230
So you really want to have that
buttery smooth, beautiful

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.950
animations.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.490
Everything happening quickly.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.099
You're going to be better off
trying to have as little

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.359
between you and the hardware
as possible.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.210
The other side is more the
ability to be much more deeply

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.050
immersed within the ecosystem
on the device.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.380
Android was designed right from
day one to make sure that

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.720
each app was carefully sandboxed
for security

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.180
reasons, but then have a bunch
of really good controlled ways

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.839
that you can then share
information between apps.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.140
So things like sharing, so you
can share something from

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.400
within your app and take
advantage of every other app

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.420
on the device which is able to
share that kind of content.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.970
Those sorts of advantages, I
think, are quite significant.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.240
The ability to get into the
content providers of the app

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.070
to be able to launch maps, all
of those sorts of things,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.210
which really deeply embed your
app as part of that whole

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.150
ecosystem of the device is
something that you can't do if

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.700
you're within your own
sandbox on a browser.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.250
DON DODGE: Or if your app
utilizes the camera on the

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.750
phone, or utilizes
the GPS or the

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.460
accelerometer or other things.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.750
Those are some examples where
you'd want to go to native

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.600
versus HTML.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.230
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.160
It's an interesting point
because I think it's sort of

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.300
the most visible thing right
now, but also the thing where,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.680
I think, the web is
going to catch up.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.120
The advantages on if you're
building sort of natively,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.690
then you have access to every
sense as soon as it's

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.690
available on the device.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.420
So we introduced a barometer
a couple of releases ago.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.353
And obviously if the hardware
is in there, you've got APIs

00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:31.510
to be able to access it.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.500
I think what will happen over
time is the more senses become

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.690
standardized, then HTML5 is
going to start introducing web

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:46.510
API to access that and cameras,
GPS, and compasses,

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.760
three of the things which have
already made their way into

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.350
the HTML5 spec.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.140
I think we'll continue to see
that as the senses get more

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.050
and more standardized.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.000
But again, if you want to use
something new, then you're

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.330
going to have to
use the native.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.020
DON DODGE: So HTML5 is catching
up and being able to

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.370
access these different features
on the phone.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.140
But your answer is you
need to do both well.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.700
RETO MEIER: I think so.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.740
I think if you really want to be
successful, if you want to

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.750
have an app which is
able to reach the

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.080
biggest audience possible.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.030
And I think in terms of success,
that's fundamental.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.330
You want to make sure your app
is usable by everyone who

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.720
would be interested.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.180
You can't go wrong
by doing both.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.870
I think the real challenge
is figuring out

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.590
which do you do first.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.840
And for me, again, I think build
native is going to be

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.000
able to have that smoothest,
richest experience.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.120
And then have web as a back up
to that for people who are

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.770
running on different platforms,
which maybe you

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.320
don't support directly, or just
have landed there from

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.200
the web page rather than
downloading your app from

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.590
Google Play.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.490
DON DODGE: So let's talk a bit
more about distribution.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.310
Of course, everyone wants to
have their app featured.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.200
We talked a little
bit about that.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.360
But a very small percentage
can be featured.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.790
So what are some of the other
things that you can do, like

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.100
getting reviews?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.360
What are some best practices
on getting reviews?

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.670
And what should you try to do?

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.110
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.640
I think, again here, the easy
answer is build a great app

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.480
that people love to talk about,
which, again, is a

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.690
cheeky answer, but a really
important first start.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.400
I think beyond that, it's
interesting to see, I think,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.940
the fact that Android has
opened up, or mobile, in

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.470
general, has opened up this new
world of opportunity for

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.860
developers to be able to build
apps and distribute them to a

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.280
worldwide audience without
having to go

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.320
through a middle man.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.300
And so a lot of us aren't
necessarily as experienced

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.080
with OK, so I have
this product.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.320
I've launched it in this
worldwide marketplace.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.895
How do I get people to notice?

00:20:37.895 --> 00:20:40.350
And actually, a lot of the old
school techniques work really,

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.380
really well here.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.180
Sending out press releases,
using standard marketing

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.060
techniques.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.220
So two of the most effective
techniques that we've seen

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.710
from developers is using
surprise, surprise, online

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.800
advertising.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.220
So things like at AdWords from
Google or AdMob, or similar

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.600
things from competitors.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.500
Basically anything which is
going to put your app in front

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.270
of people for a relatively
low cost.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.050
I think Google's done a pretty
good job of demonstrating that

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.520
online advertising works.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.940
It works pretty well.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.680
And it works really well
for apps also.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.600
So I think that's definitely
something to invest in.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.550
And I think that's fundamentally
the decision you

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.160
need to make.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.830
You can either go through free
online channels, all the

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.630
social media, all the things
which are really

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.250
good practice there.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.580
And if you decide that,
you know what?

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.880
I want to take it to
that next level.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.960
I really want to get
eyeballs on there.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.970
Then you need to consider
investing money.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.870
And that means marketing.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.610
That means advertising.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.660
DON DODGE: I was using
an app last week.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.250
And all of a sudden, in the
process of using the app, it

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.540
popped up a screen and said,
post a five star review of

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.200
this app and click here.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.510
I didn't click it.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.790
But can you do that?

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.390
Can you have a user
automatically

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.810
do a five star review?

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.900
RETO MEIER: So that's
a good question.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.580
Happily, no.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.500
You can't.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.070
So it is something which a
lot of developers have--

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.700
well maybe not a lot.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.330
But it's certainly an avenue
that some developers have

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.500
taken to basically ask for a
review within their app.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.470
And I think there's a couple
risks with that and a couple

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.195
of best practices and
things to avoid.

00:22:14.195 --> 00:22:16.940
And The risk is alienating
your users.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.735
You know, if you ask them at the
wrong time, then they may

00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:21.976
go and write your app, but not
give you the writing that you

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:22.770
were hoping for.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.670
Or then they just see it as a
form of pop up advertising,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.590
even if the advertising is for
the game you're playing.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.430
It's like, oh, you're
getting in my face.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.400
You're asking me
for something.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.680
I just want to play this game.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.630
To hell with it.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.210
I'm going to uninstall it
and play something else.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.770
So you risk that.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.840
So one of the best practices is
making sure that if you do

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.960
do it, you can't ask for
a five star rating.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.220
That's actually against
the terms of

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.270
service for Google Play.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.385
So you can ask your users
to rate your app.

00:22:47.385 --> 00:22:49.560
But you can only ask them to
write it and write it fairly.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.200
You can't solicit a
five star review.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.820
You certainly can't

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.250
incentivize a five star review.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.060
So anything which says, do
this in order to get

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.650
something, that's a no-no.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.870
Anything which says,
give us a five star

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.740
rating, also a no-no.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.940
If you do choose to ask for an
honest review, so one of the

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.540
best practices is to make
sure that you're not

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.450
doing it too much.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.900
Not every time they
open the app.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.430
Certainly not the first time,
which is the oddest, right?

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.430
You've just installed the app.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.010
You've opened it, and it says,
go and rate us in Play.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.690
I haven't used it yet.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.010
How could I do that?

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.100
So do it sensibly.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.510
And I think one of the best
approaches I've seen is that

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.180
after you've used it for a
while, after you put in a few

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.720
hours worth of game play or
whatever else, at that point

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.960
you've got a user who you know
uses the app or the game.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.860
They use it a lot.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.940
Presumably that means
that they like it.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.900
And you haven't said anything
to them before hand.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.370
So you just ask them as a one
off at some point, hey, it

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.380
seems like you like it.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.920
Maybe go and rate it?

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.170
That tends to have the
best response.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.140
DON DODGE: I've heard of
developers who unintentionally

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.750
or through an honest mistake
got their app in trouble,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.500
where they incentivized someone
to write a review or

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.200
they said, click on these three
adds to do something.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.630
Or they did things that
seemed OK to them.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.880
But they got in the penalty
box and had to

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.590
dig their way out.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.020
What are some of those things
that, you call them no-nos,

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.150
but really don't do this?

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.655
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I would
definitely to anyone who has

00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.970
an app in Google Play or is
planning to launch one to

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.630
really read through the
content policies, the

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.920
developer distribution agreement
in the attached

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.660
content policies, because
everything there, we mean it.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.060
So these are the things which
we have teams which will go

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.180
through and make sure that the
apps in Google Play are

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.260
following those guidelines.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.900
So some of the things, I guess,
I think the things

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.290
which people find the most
surprising is they will assign

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.250
their own assumed priorities
to these things.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.000
So they'll see this list of
things they can't and they

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.960
shouldn't do.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.590
And they'll go, well this one
is obviously important.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.880
This one doesn't seem like
it's such a big deal.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.030
They're all such a big deal.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.120
There isn't really a prioritized
list where some of

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.760
them, it's fine and you can get
away with it, and others

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.050
are a definite strike.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.130
So make sure that you're
complying with all of them.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.225
Some of the examples which I've
seen most commonly-- so

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.090
I'll get asked a lot, well
my app got suspended.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.750
Why?

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.470
I'm not on the team, which
actually will go through and

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.640
do those analyses.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.490
And generally, I don't even
need to ask them.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.840
I'll just look at their Google
Play listing, and it'll be

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.660
things most commonly like
putting lots of key words spam

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.260
into their description, using
competitor names, either--

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.270
sometimes it's to try
and be deceptive.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.320
Often, it's not.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.600
They're just doing it
as a sort of subtle

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.900
form of keyword spam.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.910
Like, if you liked games like
Angry Birds and Temple Run,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.280
then you'll love our game,
and that sort of thing.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.890
It's like I could see you're
trying to be subtle.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.690
It's not working.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.970
RETO MEIER: In fact, you're
doing two things wrong there.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.350
Really, if you don't have
permission from a copyright

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.630
holder to use their name, their
brand within your name

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.850
or description, then
don't do it.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.990
And similarly, don't stuff a
whole bunch of keywords, don't

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.910
try and weave all those
keywords into a clever

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.570
paragraph because you
think that's subtle.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.980
None of that works.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.450
It needs to be a good and
accurate description, and an

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.918
honest description, of what the
app is and what it does.

00:26:19.918 --> 00:26:21.550
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.970
I've heard from other developers
who their app got

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.050
suspended and they
don't know why.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.110
And I tell them well, did
you change anything?

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.030
Sometimes they have.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.180
Sometimes they haven't.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.220
Other times, it's they did
one of these don't dos.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.200
But it wasn't caught
immediately.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.360
It could be a week or a month
or some time later.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.280
So is that fairly common?

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:46.970
RETO MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.090
I mean the way that Google Play
works, we don't prefilter

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.830
any apps which go into
Google Play.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.670
As everyone knows, it's one of
the features is you press

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.590
Publish, it goes through the
system, and it will be up

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.300
within an hour or so.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.870
Which means that there is always
going to be a time

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.280
disparity between anything that
you're doing wrong and

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.610
someone noticing it.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.490
Now for a lot of these more
obvious content policy

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.990
violations around inappropriate
content that

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.590
gets flagged really, really
quickly, malware will get

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.770
flagged even before
it goes live.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.620
So most of that will be stripped
out and removed

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.860
before anyone ever
has to see it.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.740
For some of the things which are
a little bit more subtle,

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.210
like keyword spamming or using
competitor names, it's usually

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.430
going to be when someone
notices.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.490
Either it will be someone in our
team which discovers it or

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.910
it may be by virtue of the fact
that a lot of users are

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.120
flagging it, or just that it's
getting more popular.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.530
So it's definitely something
which can happen either

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.340
immediately or over time.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.650
Hopefully, that time span
is as short as possible.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.020
DON DODGE: How should a
developer measure success when

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.550
developing an app or
on the app store?

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.460
RETO MEIER: That's a really
good question.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.330
I think it's one of the things
which we look at

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.200
internally, as well.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.850
Like how--

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.050
In the developer relations
team, we have to ask

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.360
ourselves, we want to make
developers successful.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.480
So what does that mean?

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.810
How do we know that
we're doing a good

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:06.970
job at helping them?

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.620
And I think it really
comes down to what

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.810
is valuable to you.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.790
What are you trying to achieve
by having your app

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.750
distributed?

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.770
Revenue is obviously one
metric that a lot

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.000
of people are using.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.390
But a lot of apps are free.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.710
They don't have any revenue
to speak of.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.520
So what does successful
look like to them?

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.520
And that could be anything from
getting a lot of users,

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.420
or it can be something like
getting a greater engagement.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.050
Maybe they've already got
something successful, and

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.060
they're now on mobile.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.630
And they want to make sure
that their mobile user's

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.810
having a rich, immersive
experience.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.250
They've got a static
user base.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.850
And they want to now expand into
mobile to build a whole

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.340
bunch of new users.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.020
So really I think it's important
to figure out why

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.200
are you launching this app?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.940
What will it mean for you
to be successful?

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.780
How will you be able to sit back
at the end of the day and

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.680
say, that was worth the
time and effort?

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.460
We've done something
worthwhile.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.000
And so I think the key there,
as well, is once you've made

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.120
that decision, is figure
out how to measure it.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.570
Revenue's really easy because
you can just look at your bank

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.000
account and see whether or not
the money's coming in.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.380
Other things require a little
bit more effort, particularly

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.680
things like engagement.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.820
And then using tools like Google
Analytics for mobile is

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.090
a really great way
of doing that.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.955
You can see how people are using
your app, are they doing

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:20.315
the things which you want them
to be doing on your app for it

00:29:20.315 --> 00:29:21.920
to be successful?

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.930
DON DODGE: So write a great app,
write a good description,

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:34.570
get good reviews, get
lots of downloads.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.310
In featuring an app, how
important is number of

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:43.270
downloads versus number of
reviews versus do they use the

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.400
latest feature?

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.530
Is this something--
so what kinds of

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.460
things get more important?

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.440
RETO MEIER: I think pretty
much everything

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.430
goes into the buckets.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.550
When the merchandising team
are looking to decide what

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.520
they want to highlight, they're
going to look at

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.710
pretty much anything
that they consider.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.080
And sometimes it's going
to be timely, like

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.110
Christmas is coming up.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.590
So we're going to be looking
at apps which we think are

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.220
going to be popular over
the Christmas period.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.610
Either Christmas themed or
through our analytics, we

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.240
found these sorts
of things that--

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.730
these sorts of apps are the ones
which people are looking

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.290
for at this time.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.800
You know, really it comes down
to, in terms of downloads, it

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.520
can be either.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.780
So obviously, we want
to highlight apps

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.700
which are very popular.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.050
But at the same time, we want
to download apps which we

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.870
think people will love and they
just haven't seen yet.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.700
So download count isn't really
a strong factor.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.620
Quality is.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.960
So you want to make sure
that you've got a good

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.490
high average rating.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.650
Something around the four stars
at least, I think, is a

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.970
good place to start.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.320
If you don't, find out why.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.460
There's nothing to say that just
because-- you know, maybe

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.700
you launched early, got a
few things wrong, got

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.320
a lot of bad reviews.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.560
You've turned things around
and started to improve it.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.220
We can see that, as well.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.335
But certainly, you want to be
getting as high a star rating

00:30:52.335 --> 00:30:55.060
as possible through legitimate
means, of course.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.800
DON DODGE: Cool.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.600
So write a great app, write an
accurate listing, get good

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.370
reviews, take advantage of new
features, use advertising and

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.940
other methods to promote
your app.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.880
That's five topics.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.280
Are there any other things?

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.840
Or are those the major ones you
really want to focus on?

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.990
RETO MEIER: I think those
are the main ones.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.670
I think the two other things
I'd want to highlight is to

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.530
really aim for app quality.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.470
There are hundreds
of thousands of

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.690
apps in Google Play.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.500
And you need to find
a way to stand out.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.300
And the minimum bar for that
is to really make sure that

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.580
you have a good quality app.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.810
So really looking at the app
quality guidelines, looking at

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.490
the tablet app quality
guidelines, and making sure

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.570
that you've got an experience
that works really well for all

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.530
of the users across all of the
different devices in the

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.880
ecosystem, I think, are the key
things you need to look at

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.640
to be successful
in Google Play.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.450
DON DODGE: So all of those
guidelines are available on

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.440
the Google Play store or
to the developers?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.560
RETO MEIER: Yeah, they're
all available on

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.751
developer.android.com.

00:31:54.751 --> 00:31:55.660
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.840
DON DODGE: So
developer.android.com is the

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.420
place to go.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:58.940
RETO MEIER: Where
you want to go.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.890
Absolutely.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.990
If you've got nowhere else,
that is the place.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:06.100
It's a hefty site, but there's
definitely all of the

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.210
information that you could need
or want to be able to be

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.030
more successful in
Google Play.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.650
DON DODGE: So I've not read the
distribution agreement.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.330
But is it a couple of
pages or 20 pages?

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.280
RETO MEIER: It's a few pages.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.880
I think, yeah, a couple
of pages.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.850
I think at Google, we try and
keep things in as plain

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.600
English as we possibly can.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.320
And I think we've done a
reasonable job there.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.090
DON DODGE: So I think you
suggested read that

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:32.810
distribution agreement carefully
because every line

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.040
there is important.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.060
You can't ignore one of these
suggested don't-dos because it

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.480
will eventually hurt you.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:39.850
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.950
And to be fair, I've spoken
to a lot of developers.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.870
And I haven't had that many
people who I've bumped into

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.250
which have accidentally
done something wrong.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.650
So it's definitely something you
need to be aware of, but

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.340
not anything which
I think is--

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.310
this there's nothing there which
is to onerous or too

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.300
unexpected.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.020
But as with anything, if
you're entering into an

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.140
agreement, it pays to understand
exactly what you're

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.120
agreeing to.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.300
DON DODGE: And on the other
hand, it does make sense to

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.220
spend the time reading the best
practices because they

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.440
really can help you--

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.030
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.290
DON DODGE: --get distribution.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.600
RETO MEIER: I mean, this is
the surprising thing.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.410
It's like, we have a cheat sheet
on the site which tells

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.400
you all the things you need to
do to build an app which

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.940
people are going to really love
and people are going to

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.240
be engaged with.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.620
So the cheat sheet is there.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.020
So if you go through and you
look at all of those details,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.130
and you those all into practice,
you're really going

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.070
to have an app which we're more
likely to feature, which

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.540
users are more likely to
download and more likely to

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.670
keep on using and talk about in
social media and give you

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.290
high ratings.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.360
It all really flows
in on itself.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.520
DON DODGE: So that
website again?

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.780
Where do you go to
get all this?

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.890
RETO MEIER:
Developer.android.com.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.360
DON DODGE:
Developer.android.com.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.210
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:45.580
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.070
Well this has been a
great discussion.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.890
I really appreciate your time.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.100
And thank you all
for joining us.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.630
And I hope you'll be with
us next time on

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.090
Google Developers Live.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.340
Thank you.
