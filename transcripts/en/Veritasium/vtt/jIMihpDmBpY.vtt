00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.641
- In my last video I showed you five fun physics
phenomena and asked you how they work. You

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:12.559
responded with thousands of comments and some
video responses. Well here are my explanations.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.030
Let's start with the cereal because it seems
the simplest but it turns out to be one of

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.020
the most surprising. The simple explanation
goes like this. So, I showed you cereal is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.960
magnetic. I have ground up all of this cereal
into a very fine powder. Let us see what is

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960
in it. I'm going to take these strong magnets
and run them over the cereal powder and see

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.690
if anything is attracted to them. Look how
the cereal actually sticks to the magnet.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.180
And it's because there's pieces of iron in
this cereal. They've been added because iron

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.680
is something we need, it's an essential nutrient
that we need to survive. In fact, this cereal

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.460
has 60% of your recommended daily intake of
iron. But there's more to it. I received a

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.780
video response from Maarten Baert showing
non-magnetic objects like plastic and paper

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.070
also apparently being attracted to a magnet.
So, how does this work? Well water is diamagnetic,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.860
which means in the presence of a magnetic
field it generates its own magnetic field

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.080
in the opposite direction. This means the
water is very slightly repelled by the magnet

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.170
and this causes a depression in the surface
of the water into which a floating object

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.000
will slide. You can even see this depression
by looking at the reflections off the water.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.430
So cereal is attracted to a magnet due to
its iron content but when floating on the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.080
surface of water there is an additional effect,
the depression of the water's surface due

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.189
to its diamagnetism. I showed you that you
can find the center of mass of a cane or another

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.400
stick-type object just by moving your fingers
in towards the middle from the outside. But

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.759
how does this work, even when you start, in
say, an asymmetric position? Well, one finger

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.640
is closer to the center of mass and therefore
it carries more of the weight of the cane,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.950
and so the friction force between your finger
and the cane is greater until the point where

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.060
the other finger catches up at which point
this finger slides in and eventually they

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.090
must meet in the middle. So this a way you
can find the center of mass of any cane or

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.820
cane-like object. I showed you that if you
trt to flip your phone end over end, there

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.980
is no way to do it without it also rotating
around the short axis as well. Why is that?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.760
The phone has three axes about which it can
rotate. There is the long axis, which has

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.950
the maximum moment of inertia, meaning it
requires the most torque to accelerate it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.819
in that direction. Spinning about the short
axis has the least moment of inertia. Then

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.980
there is the intermediate axis which has a
moment of inertia in between the other two.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.610
Now the intermediate axis theorem says that
if you try to flip any object along its intermediate

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.980
axis it will not maintain simply that rotation,
it will also get rotations in any of the other

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.890
directions. That is, if there is any slight
deviation from a perfect rotation. So why

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.100
does this happen? Well, the mathematics is
kinda complicated but it's similar to the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.120
mathematics of a rigid pendulum. So, if you're
flipping the phone along its long axis or

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.760
its short axis the phone acts a little bit
like this pendulum in that any perturbation

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.519
will cause it simply to go back to where it
was before. But, if you're flipping it along

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.860
its intermediate axis it's as though you're
trying to balance the pendulum on its end,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.480
in which case it's very unstable and any slight
perturbation may cause it to exponentially

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.110
increase. So that is why you can't just flip
your phone along its intermediate axis without

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.019
it also spinning along one of the other axes.
I showed you that an electrically charged

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.540
object can deflect a stream of water. But
it is not due to the common explanation, the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.310
common reason which is given, which is that
water is a polar molecule. So what really

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.050
is causing this water to be attracted towards
the cup? Well, it is charges, but it is ions,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.591
it is dissolved ions in the water. There will
be some OH ions, some H+ ions and there'll

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:19.239
also be some other impurity ions in the water.
So what happens when you hold this negatively

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.939
charged cup up against the water's stream
is it will repel the negative charges, the

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:29.020
negative ions in the water, some of which
will go back up into the tap. And that means

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.229
the water coming down will be slightly positively
charged. And once it breaks up into droplets

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.520
those droplets have a positive charge that
they can't get rid of, so now those positive

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.430
droplets are attracted to the negatively charged
cup. And you can see those droplets swirling

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.369
around the cup because they are so attracted
to it. So this is not actually a very good

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:54.289
demonstration of the polar nature of water.
Even non-polar substances with some ions dissolved

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.749
in them will deflect in exactly this way.
So this is actually showing us that water

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:04.639
droplets are charged, they are charged by
induction, and it is not due to the polar

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.259
nature of water that they are attracted to
electrically charged objects. Now you know.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.099
In the teabag rocket we showed that if you
light a teabag on fire from the top it will

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.639
actually take off into the air. That happens
because as the teabag is burning all the air

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.080
inside it heats up and so it expands so it
gets less dense and it's pushed up by all

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.240
the cooler air around it. You know, sometimes
people talk about how hot air rises. I mean,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.120
that is what hot air does, but only because
the cooler air around it is pushing it up.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.219
In essence it's like a buoyant force because
the hot air is now less dense than the cooler

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.020
air around it. So, when the teabag burns right
down to the bottom the remaining ash is so

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.930
light that it gets swept up in that convection
current, and you get a teabag rocket. So do

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.290
you agree with all of my explanations, and
did you get them right the first time? Let

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.159
me know in the comments and thanks for watching.
