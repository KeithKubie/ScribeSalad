SUZANNE FREY: Oh, ye
techmakers, ye world changers.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.310
On behalf of Google, I am so
excited to welcome you here

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.150
today to connect, to
celebrate, and even

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.020
to do some creating that is all
part of this ongoing movement

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.500
to the way we shift time,
and the impact that we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.080
are having in this world.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.990
I'm excited to
celebrate techmakers,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.370
I'm excited to celebrate
International Women's Day.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.240
And while International Women's
Day was absolutely created

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.470
to foster and raise the
visibility of women,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.110
the conversation
we are having today

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.870
and the movement of
which you are all a part

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.610
is absolutely
inclusive of everyone.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
All genders, all religions,
all perspectives.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.290
Diversity matters a ton
in making all the things

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.689
we want to do happen.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.230
Now before I get
into this, I do want

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.700
to make a brief apology that
we're not having this at night

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.165
so we could have projected
this session on the moon.

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:11.700
Mary Lou Jefferson is
definitely a role model here.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.330
She's done some amazing work.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.610
And those are the
kinds of crazy things

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.660
that people are doing,
that all of you are doing.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.700
I'm just so excited
and so energized

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.270
by the potential
energy in this room.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.230
So yes, actually we do believe
that diversity matters.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.430
I'm so excited to see so many
other companies in the Bay Area

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.940
and around the world
also recognize this.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.490
Just look outside your window.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.660
Look outside to
nature, and you know

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.140
that we have all come
from the result of a very

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.070
diverse ecosystem.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520
Ecosystems do not thrive
without diversity.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.460
In fact, if you eliminate
certain species,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.540
certain perspectives, et cetera,
the whole does not thrive.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.530
Those companies
that have-- we all

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.359
know the stats, the companies
that have more women on boards

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.650
and-- we've heard all of those.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.620
Hopefully we can all
repeat them very,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.164
very easily-- they
actually perform better.

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:08.830
But it's actually the teams that
bring more diverse perspectives

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.550
to the table and make a huge
difference in this world.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.260
And so that really,
really, really excites me,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.560
that folks are recognizing this,
and this movement continues

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.065
to grow stronger and stronger.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.440
I want to talk briefly
about women techmakers.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920
Megan Smith, another
huge role mode of mine.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.400
I remember the
first time I heard

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.530
her get up to a mic at a--
we have these TGIF sessions

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.237
at Google.

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:35.820
Every week our leaders actually
get up in front of the company

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.610
and answer any question
that folks have.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.670
But they also allow you
to engage in conversation

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.050
and tell us what happened
at the company this week.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.345
And I remember Megan stood
up in one of my early days

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.720
at the company and asked just
this really great question.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.080
I was like, who is that?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.860
And of course, Megan has gone
on to do some amazing things.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.310
Megan Smith is an entrepreneur.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.210
Key, key catalyst in
our GoogleX initiatives,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.020
and now the CTO of the US.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.250
Very proud moment for us,
for techmakers as a whole.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.750
And Natalie Villa-Lobos,
who will be speaking with us

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.680
a few times later today, who
is our women in technology

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.704
advocate.

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:17.870
She just stepped forward,
and she'll tell her story,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.780
and said, I think this matters.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.170
And I really want
this to be my job.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.280
And VP, Hiroshi, here at
the company-- in Android--

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.990
says, of course.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.650
That makes all the
sense in the world.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.190
What an awesome, awesome,
awesome opportunity,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.654
both for her, this
company, but for all of you

00:03:35.654 --> 00:03:37.570
in the room who are part
of this conversation,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.760
doing great things
at every company.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.960
So inclusivity is
important today.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.940
It's not about Google.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.440
This is not about
any given company.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.480
This is about the work we
are all doing together.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.280
So I'd like, actually,
to understand,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.586
and get some audience
participation at this time.

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:56.960
We rarely get
together like this.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.120
We don't have these
opportunities very often.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.000
And I'd like to understand what
gets you excited about what

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.070
you're doing.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.431
I would like to understand what
changes you would like to see

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.680
in the work that we are doing.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.960
What's not been invented yet?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.592
And we have mics
placed, I believe.

00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:16.050
People are carrying
mics throughout

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.600
to answer or get some
feedback from folks.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.344
Men, don't be shy.

00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:24.260
MC: Ladies and gentlemen,
we have mic runners.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.801
If you raise your
hands, a microphone

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:33.820
will be brought to you, and
we can participate in Q&amp;A.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820
SUTAPA BANSAL: Thank you.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.530
Hi, everyone.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.960
I'm Sutapa Bansal.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.550
Really got to be here today.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.450
And thanks, Google,
for hosting this event.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.510
Really good to see
a lot of women here.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.130
Usually, I go to
the conferences,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.650
and 1% to 2% women are there.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.200
So, really happy.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.530
And what gets me excited is
solving world's problems,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.510
solving my customer problems.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.010
I'm a product manager,
so what motivates

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.490
me is talking to
customers, listening

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.720
to what their problems
are, and then coming up

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.490
with products, developing
products, which

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.015
helps their problems.

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:18.290
Thank you.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.290
SUZANNE FREY: Thank you.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Anita
Rivas, and I really

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.710
just want to say I came
here to get motivated.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.410
And so I like, so
far, what I'm hearing.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.210
But what gets me
motivated is I've

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.240
worked with a lot of
children in the past.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.615
Ever since I've
been little, I've

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.720
always been trying to work
with kids of a younger age.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.760
And that gets me motivated.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.730
It gets me motivated to do
better myself, and continue

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.420
to be a mentor
for some of these,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.500
whether it's boys, girls.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.400
Right now I'm focusing
more on young girls.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.010
So that's one key
thing that gets

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.400
motivated on a personal level.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.850
On a professional
level, definitely, I

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.831
get motivated when I see
teams coming together.

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:04.080
When we can actually make
something, when I know that,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.240
alone, we can't do it by
ourselves, neither as females,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.650
or in the male-dominated world.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.490
So I like the sense of
teamwork and building.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.104
That gets me really excited.

00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:15.020
SUZANNE FREY: Awesome.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.190
And I'm excited
for you to hear--

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.730
AUDIENCE: I do want
to say, what I'd

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.230
like to see that hasn't
been invented, as part

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.410
of my thing-- I
would love, when we

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.889
talk about cafes of
technology-- it's been wonderful

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:27.805
when you're traveling.

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:30.290
And you can stop by a
cafe and get connected,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.860
and send pictures to
your family or whatever.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.560
But I would love to see cafes
where they have technology

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.550
where children that
can't afford to have

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.040
a computer at their
home can log in, and be

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.630
able to access it, and do
homework, and do all that.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.537
Because we're so behind on that.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:47.620
And so that's what I would
like to be able to see,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.454
something affordable that
could be made available.

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:51.370
SUZANNE FREY: Awesome.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.056
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:58.330
And I'm excited for you to hear
a bit more from Pavni Diwanji

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.500
later today.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.030
She's been behind YouTube
for Kids effort and launch.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.810
And she's done some amazing
work in the children's space.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.700
I love the idea.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.940
Keep those ideas coming.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.000
LAURA KELLY: Hi.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.830
I'm Laura Kelly.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.380
I'm a software engineer at an
early-stage startup up called

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.450
[? Frame Data. ?] And
we use machine learning

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.890
to predict user behavior.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.250
And the thing that gets me
really excited about technology

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.490
is pushing the bounds
of product and pushing

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.920
the bounds of technology
in new ways that

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.300
haven't been done before.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.120
And I'm really interested in
hearing from more women who

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.920
are working on interesting tech
and interesting products that

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.829
are going into
boundaries where we

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:37.870
haven't been able to
accomplish those things yet.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.300
And now's the time to do it.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.323
SUZANNE FREY: Awesome.

00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:44.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.750
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Rasha.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.920
And what gets me
excited is a challenge.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.750
I always surround myself with
people who are better than me,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.860
because it pushes me to learn.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.670
And I love the events and
gatherings like these,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.560
because I meet lot
of people like this.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.250
I came here to the
United States a year go.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.810
I didn't know anyone.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.670
And I went to every event
that's there in Silicon Valley,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.460
and now I know tons of people.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.740
And I learned so much
more than the five years

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.986
in college in this
just one year.

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.878
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:22.450
AUDIENCE: Good
morning, everyone.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.810
This is
[? Menaliki Serker. ?] I'm

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.900
flying here all the
way from Austin.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.360
I work for Dell Computers
in the validation group.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.080
So I do testing of
our laptops, desktops,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.990
all the products that reach
you guys and the consumers.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.260
Getting quality products to
the customer is my passion.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.120
I don't want any products in the
field that have issues on them.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.920
So that's what drives me
on my day to day basis.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.740
I applied for this conference.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.620
And what I wrote in, it was
that-- I have seen women

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.860
suppressed at several levels.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.590
Especially, I come
from India, and it

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.950
is a male dominant society.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.580
And it will stay that way until
the mentality of each and every

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.345
person changes.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.270
I really don't like to see
that and I have always raised

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.900
my voice against it whenever
I have seen such situations.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.700
And I truly believe that
women are very powerful.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.200
And my reason to
say that, even more,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
has become stronger, especially
after that I had my two kids.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.570
I have a three-year-old
and an eight-months-old.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.000
And I think if God trusted women
to give birth to a kid and go

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.710
through that entire excruciating
labor pain process--

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.460
if a woman can go through that,
there's nothing that she cannot

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.960
do.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.480
So I'm here to get motivated
and meet other women.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.430
I'm super passionate about it.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.610
And what I would like to
see and do more, personally,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.300
from my side, is also
work with underprivileged.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.140
Not many people are fortunate.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.160
And I really want our
computers and technology

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.540
to reach to all that strata
of society that don't

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.820
have access to it right now.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.320
So that's certainly
something that I

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.540
think we are missing yet.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.964
Thanks.

00:10:07.964 --> 00:10:10.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:13.840
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name's Christina.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.105
And what got me
really-- goodness,

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:17.480
and I'm not knocking
over chairs.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.150
That's how excited I am.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.500
What got me most
excited about technology

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.450
is the connection aspect.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.070
That is so awesome to me.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.780
A year ago, I
decided I was going

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.430
to run here from New York.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.750
And I was just no nobody.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.010
I didn't have a big network.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.765
And I was able to launch
this community around that,

00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.890
and raise a lot of money
for a cause I cared about.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.360
And I had no reason to--
I wasn't a big industry

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.980
mover or shaker, and I
didn't have a lot of money.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.360
But because there are
tech platforms out there,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.170
I could do this crazy idea
and rally people to my cause.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.535
And so I think that's the
awesomest thing about tech.

00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:57.373
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.630
AUDIENCE: Hi, this is
[? Shuta Takapur. ?]

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.620
I'm a software
management student.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.620
So, as [? Marali ?] said,
I totally agree with you.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.510
I'm also from India, and
I am sure that everybody

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.780
knows about India's struggle,
the documentary, which

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.510
was on BBC.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.010
We all feel, somewhere,
that we are in the stage

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.150
that we need to improve a lot,
and help other women to come

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.680
out of that stage to be
strong enough to face

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.140
the male dominant society.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.910
And I believe that
only technology

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.040
can change this scenario.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.510
Everywhere in the world, it's
something that-- all the women,

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.000
they are in good positions.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.740
But still, they are not
able to face this thing

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.990
that they are better than men.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.420
We are better than men, but we
are not in as a good number.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:54.240
Everyone is not-- almost 150,
200 people are sitting here.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.490
But there are so
many women out there

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.820
who are not as lucky as us.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.460
So I want to do something which
only makes everyone strong.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.465
Thank you.

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:05.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.910
I'm Jasmine, and I'm a computer
science student at UC Berkeley.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.340
And something that really
excites me is learning.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.340
Learning computer
science, learning math,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.700
and just having my brain
expanded in ways I never

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.260
knew before was possible.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
And I think something that
I would really, really like

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.830
to see in the future is not
only more female leaders

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.130
in the industry, but
more women in academia.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.040
I haven't yet had a
math or computer science

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.090
female professor.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.098
And that's something that
I would really value.

00:12:38.098 --> 00:12:40.942
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.580
AUDIENCE: Hi I'm
[? Ujuella Konkerni. ?]

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.370
You can call me UJ.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.180
I'm glad that Google
has organized this.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.680
Thank you.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.120
Thanks a lot.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.060
What excites me to go to work
is that I can make a difference.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.190
The team depends on me.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.640
Maybe that's architecture
design, or production.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.860
Whatever it is, that excites me.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.620
And I am a role
model for my kids.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.170
They say, Mommy can do it?

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.958
I can do better than her.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.870
Thank you.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.160
SUZANNE FREY: Thank you.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.400
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.070
I'm here in the dark.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:26.770
Just a shorter way-- can women
over 50 raise their hand?

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.420
Thank you, guys.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.290
Thank you so much.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.570
There are some.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.860
So I'm not alone in this room.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.030
Last year, I was here, and
I was very much impressed

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.020
with different ages.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.820
But there were not so
many people of my age.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.960
I started as computer programmer
like 30 years ago plus.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.590
And I thought, I will
never program almost

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.000
to my retirement, but I am.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.770
And I just have to tell
you, in this technology,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.280
to stay on bar with
everybody, you have to run.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.320
You have to study.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.630
You have to get new
stuff all your life.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.160
And it is enjoyable.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.117
I love my work.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:08.075
I am software engineer.

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:10.520
I'm not a manager,
never been a manager.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.500
And so, it's investigative work.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.750
It's analysis work.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.940
Woman suited for that,
not any worse than man.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.580
I work for HP.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.330
I am software engineer,
and we have at least half

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.770
of software engineers
are women there.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:31.340
So for me, priority
would be education.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.020
When I came, I came here
from Soviet Union then.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.400
And I was floored when I
realized all of this stupid

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.790
prejudice that
blondes are stupid,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.650
that woman cannot no math.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.480
I mean, it's so prevalent here.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.380
I was very much surprised.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.900
So I would love to
overcome it, and to tell

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.600
every girl that she's smart.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.520
She can learn math.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.750
She can do computers.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.500
She can be software engineers.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.020
And it is a good
career for whole life.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.880
And I have adult children,
and I have grandchildren.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.880
SUZANNE FREY: Thank you.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.379
We have time for
two more questions.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:08.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Alexandra.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.320
I'm a software
engineer at Polyvore.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.250
And what really
excites me is getting

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.997
to build things that delight
millions of people every day.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.330
I think that's something
that's really cool that you can

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.250
do with technology, is you can
affect the lives of millions

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.680
of people and make their days
just a little bit better.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.880
And what I look
forward to with tech

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.650
is a day when technology is
a universally accessible tool

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.340
for absolutely everyone,
and they think of it

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.060
just as another way
to build something.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.590
And no one has to say,
oh no, that's not for me.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.490
Or oh no, I'm never
going to try it out.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.198
You don't have to be
a software engineer,

00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:44.162
but it can still be
something that you can use.

00:15:44.162 --> 00:15:46.869
SUZANNE FREY: Awesome.

00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:47.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.270
This is Chloe.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.620
So I'm a master's student
in [INAUDIBLE] University.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.920
So I actually come from
a finance background.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.430
So in my work, we use a
lot of finance models.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.740
And what motivates me to
come into this industry

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.030
is that I want to know how to
build a financial model out

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.120
of scratch.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.170
So everyone think I am
crazy to change my career

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.930
path from a financial analyst
to a software engineer.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.330
But after I come
to Silicon Valley,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.570
I can see with my own eyes how
the technology is valued here.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.060
And how education and
technology can make a difference

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.900
in almost every industry.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.310
So I'm very thankful for
you holding this event,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.550
so I have a chance to meet so
many women in this industry.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.860
And I'm really ready
to get motivated.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.360
Thank you.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.276
SUZANNE FREY: Awesome.

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:40.720
Thank you.
