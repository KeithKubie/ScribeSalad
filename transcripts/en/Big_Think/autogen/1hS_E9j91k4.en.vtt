now we just have 6th graders and it's a
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.179
now we just have 6th graders and it's a
school that has been designed from the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
school that has been designed from the
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130
school that has been designed from the
ground up to try to pay attention to the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
ground up to try to pay attention to the
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.300
ground up to try to pay attention to the
notion that we have a whole generation

notion that we have a whole generation
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.720

that because my interest is in game
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.930
that because my interest is in game
design and there's been increasing kind

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
design and there's been increasing kind
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.209
design and there's been increasing kind
of research around the fact that kids

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
of research around the fact that kids
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.250
of research around the fact that kids
playing games today are learning to see

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
playing games today are learning to see
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.450

digital generation and designing to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
digital generation and designing to
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529
digital generation and designing to
school but also begin to think about

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
school but also begin to think about
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060
school but also begin to think about
well how could the structures of games

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
well how could the structures of games
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.660
well how could the structures of games
be used to design a school in a way that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
be used to design a school in a way that
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150
be used to design a school in a way that
was really engaging for kids really got

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
was really engaging for kids really got

at content expertise but also began to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
at content expertise but also began to
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.799
at content expertise but also began to
work on some of these 21st century

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
work on some of these 21st century
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240

skills that people thought are talking

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
skills that people thought are talking
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.270
skills that people thought are talking
about collaboration working in teams

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280
about collaboration working in teams
 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.330

complex problem solving systems thinking

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340
complex problem solving systems thinking
 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.980

being able to kind of design and find
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350
being able to kind of design and find
resources and so the schools really been

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
resources and so the schools really been
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.160
resources and so the schools really been
designed as a school that uses games as

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
designed as a school that uses games as
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.999
designed as a school that uses games as
a pedagogical kind of structure so it's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
a pedagogical kind of structure so it's
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.260
a pedagogical kind of structure so it's
not a school where kids are playing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
not a school where kids are playing
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330
not a school where kids are playing
video games all day which is a common

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
video games all day which is a common
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060
video games all day which is a common
misperception but it's a school that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
misperception but it's a school that
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.540
misperception but it's a school that
uses game like learning

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550
 
 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.370
 
there's many different kinds of tools

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380
there's many different kinds of tools
 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.980
there's many different kinds of tools
that we use so sometimes we do board

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990
that we use so sometimes we do board

game design with kids sometimes we have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530
game design with kids sometimes we have
 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.160
game design with kids sometimes we have
been doing mobile game design with kids

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
been doing mobile game design with kids
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.040
been doing mobile game design with kids
so kids designing games with cell phones

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050
so kids designing games with cell phones
 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.780
so kids designing games with cell phones
and so they may be using Bluetooth

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790
and so they may be using Bluetooth
 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.580
and so they may be using Bluetooth
technology they may be using something

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590
technology they may be using something
 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.520
technology they may be using something
called QR code or semi code technology

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530

learn about predator prey and we're

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
learn about predator prey and we're
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.480
learn about predator prey and we're
going to like read about it in a

on your challenge is to design a game
about a predator and prey those kids

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890
about a predator and prey those kids
 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.120
about a predator and prey those kids
will spend hours and hours researching

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130
will spend hours and hours researching
 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.070
will spend hours and hours researching
like what's an interesting predator and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
like what's an interesting predator and
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.350
like what's an interesting predator and
prey that they want to work with what

are the specific relationships that they
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.070
are the specific relationships that they
know they need to develop they start

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
know they need to develop they start

drawing drawing the elements of the game

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
drawing drawing the elements of the game

they begin to really understand the
landscape and they go deep deep deep

system that models that idea so kids go
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.140
system that models that idea so kids go
deep into content when they design games

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
deep into content when they design games
 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.250
deep into content when they design games

outset the designer has to think about
their user and this is actually very

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
their user and this is actually very
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.690

design areas of design with a game you

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550
design areas of design with a game you
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.940
design areas of design with a game you
bring a player in right away even when

you just have a paper prototype of it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
you just have a paper prototype of it
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.080
you just have a paper prototype of it
and that player starts playing with your

and for kids this is a profound moment

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610
and for kids this is a profound moment
 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.699
and for kids this is a profound moment
where they suddenly begin to really

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
where they suddenly begin to really
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.460
where they suddenly begin to really
understand notions of point of view they

understand notions of point of view they
really begin to understand ideas and

about their experience in this game and
 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.250
about their experience in this game and
that for me also was a very eye-opening

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260
that for me also was a very eye-opening
 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.320
that for me also was a very eye-opening

to begin to use game design as a way to
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.240
to begin to use game design as a way to
get kids to think more broadly about

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
get kids to think more broadly about
 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.820
get kids to think more broadly about
opinions outside of their own ways of

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830
opinions outside of their own ways of
 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.770
opinions outside of their own ways of
collaborating and so those are two

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780
collaborating and so those are two
 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.750
collaborating and so those are two
really big things that I find game

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
really big things that I find game
 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.030
really big things that I find game
design gives kids when they have the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
design gives kids when they have the
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.460
design gives kids when they have the
opportunity to do it

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470
 
 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.960
 
one of the arguments we make around game

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970
one of the arguments we make around game
 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.850
one of the arguments we make around game
design and also just the way that play

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860
design and also just the way that play
 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.460
design and also just the way that play
happens and games is that you have to

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470
happens and games is that you have to
 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.020
happens and games is that you have to
learn how to how to problem-solve and

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030
learn how to how to problem-solve and
 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.340
learn how to how to problem-solve and
iterate and things are constantly

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350
iterate and things are constantly
 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.770
iterate and things are constantly
changing and so you try something out it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780
changing and so you try something out it
 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.410
changing and so you try something out it
doesn't quite work you try something new

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420
doesn't quite work you try something new
 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.700
doesn't quite work you try something new
you look for a certain kind of resource

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710
you look for a certain kind of resource
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.010
you look for a certain kind of resource
it's there and that is gone so we have

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020
it's there and that is gone so we have
 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020
it's there and that is gone so we have
to find another kind of resource and so

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030
to find another kind of resource and so
 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.420
to find another kind of resource and so
that Billy ability to resource

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
that Billy ability to resource
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.210
that Billy ability to resource
intelligently the ability to find stuff

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220
intelligently the ability to find stuff
 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.620
intelligently the ability to find stuff
when you need it knowing who to go to

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630
when you need it knowing who to go to
 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.650
when you need it knowing who to go to
the ability to understand that

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660
the ability to understand that
 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.470
the ability to understand that
everything is in process that nothing is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480
everything is in process that nothing is
 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.420
everything is in process that nothing is
really ever a final solution that

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
really ever a final solution that
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.920
really ever a final solution that
certain kind of tools are effective at

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930
certain kind of tools are effective at
 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.480
certain kind of tools are effective at
one moment it may be less effective at

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490
one moment it may be less effective at
 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.950
one moment it may be less effective at
another moment technology is changing

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960
another moment technology is changing
 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.770
another moment technology is changing
all the time we have to constantly learn

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780
all the time we have to constantly learn
 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.590
all the time we have to constantly learn
how to do new stuff every day if we

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600
how to do new stuff every day if we
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.230
how to do new stuff every day if we
don't equip kids with an ability to

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
don't equip kids with an ability to
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.090
don't equip kids with an ability to
understand that and know how to do it

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100
understand that and know how to do it
 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.070
understand that and know how to do it
they're not just going to like learn it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080
they're not just going to like learn it
 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.690
they're not just going to like learn it
on their own schools actually have a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700
on their own schools actually have a
 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.280
on their own schools actually have a
pretty important role in helping kids do

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290
pretty important role in helping kids do
 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.550
pretty important role in helping kids do
that

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560
 
 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.260
 
I had some great math teachers in high

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270
I had some great math teachers in high
 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.590
I had some great math teachers in high
school and I was a kid that was

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600
school and I was a kid that was
 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.909
school and I was a kid that was
interested in conceptual things and so I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919
interested in conceptual things and so I
 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.700
interested in conceptual things and so I
loved things like geometry and I love

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710
loved things like geometry and I love
 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.440
loved things like geometry and I love
things like trigonometry and calculus

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450
things like trigonometry and calculus
 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.560
things like trigonometry and calculus
and doing proofs was something I got

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570
and doing proofs was something I got
 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.170
and doing proofs was something I got
incredible pleasure doing and I think it

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180
incredible pleasure doing and I think it
 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.909
incredible pleasure doing and I think it
was because it was about solving

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919
was because it was about solving
 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.060
was because it was about solving
problems and it was about thinking

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070
problems and it was about thinking
 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.010
problems and it was about thinking
through how you could sequence a set of

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
through how you could sequence a set of
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.890
through how you could sequence a set of
ideas in such a way that you actually

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900
ideas in such a way that you actually
 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.090
ideas in such a way that you actually
arrived at a pretty interesting

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100
arrived at a pretty interesting
