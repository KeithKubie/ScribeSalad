00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.490
Researchers in Israel paired the smell of
rotten eggs with cigarettes to form a negative

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.519
association to help smokers quit while they
sleep.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.849
And a new aquatic exosuit will help archaeologists
explore deep sea shipwrecks for longer periods

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.849
of time.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.610
It’s outfitted with cameras, can be controlled
remotely and is basically like wearing a submarine.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.610
Vsauce!

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.610
Kevin here.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.270
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.040
rHealth is a universal health sensor that
allows people to diagnose themselves anywhere.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.570
Using a single drop of blood the device can
test for hundreds of lab values including

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.670
vitamin D, calcium and red or white blood
cells by using nanoscale test strips read

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.930
by laser.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.410
NASA helped fund its development to better
monitor the health of astronauts and it uses

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.530
1500x less blood than conventional lab tests.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.210
It recently won the grand prize from Xprize
and they say it can help diagnose diseases

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.220
before you have them including cancer.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.149
Rescue operations could get a huge boost from
cyborg cockroaches.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.759
Researchers at North Carolina State University
are attaching circuit boards and unidirectional

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.569
microphones to the insects so they'll be compelled
to move towards the sounds of a person struggling

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:18.240
or crying for help.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.270
An army of these biobots would be released
to help first responders gather information

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.909
in areas they can’t initially enter.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.880
And cockroaches are ideal candidates because
they’re small, hard to kill, and do not

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.570
likely experience feelings of pain.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.100
The food and fuel of the future could be grown
on highway algae farms.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.049
An experimental garden in Switzerland on a
viaduct over a small highway uses the unobstructed

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.060
sunlight and overabundance of Co2 from vehicles
to grow algae.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.149
Built this summer it proves how highways could
be easily modified to grow food, biofuel,

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.939
and clean the air.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.749
Male Bustards are promiscuous birds that may
cure their sexually transmitted diseases by

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.490
eating poisonous beetles.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.490
So yeah.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.780
Retroreflective projection technology could
make cars see through.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.300
Developed at Keio University in Japan it uses
mirrors, cameras, and fabric lined with tiny

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.569
glass beads to project outside images inside
the car.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.061
Aside from eliminating blind spots in your
car, it could be used to let pilots see the

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:25.660
runway beneath them, create gloves that allow
surgeons to see through their hands, and put

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.849
us one step closer to invisibility cloaks.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.810
The Altaeros BAT is a wind turbine that floats
in the sky.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.470
The helium-filled device is designed to reach
altitudes of 1,000 feet, where air currents

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.319
are 5-8 times more powerful.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.412
Set to debut in Alaska for an 18 month testing
period, the BAT (Buoyant Airborne Turbine),

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:48.989
will bring power to families living off of
the grid while also providing WiFi and cell

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.140
phone service.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.560
Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis)
employ a form of sonar jamming that prevents

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.090
other bats from catching their food.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.880
And the bertholdia moth (Bertholdia trigona)
jams bats to prevent themselves from becoming

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
food.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.010
That's a lot of ja

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.430
Researchers have devised a mathematical model
for “white smell,” the nasal equivalent

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.440
to white noise.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.549
The formula combines 38 different compounds
and so far can cancel out the smell of onion,

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.260
sauerkraut, fermented tuna, and even the notoriously
stinky durian fruit.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.049
But right now no device has been built - this
is just math.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.049
Smelly math.

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.400
ROVER turns bomb-sniffing dog training into
a video game.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.390
Utilizing the Xbox connect, soldiers can communicate
with a virtual dog via gestures in order to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.299
learn how to correctly lead a bomb-sniffing
dog on a hunt for an IED.

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.099
Practicing virtually is especially important
because out in the field handlers can accidentally

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.019
un-train their dogs by not being attentive
and picking up on subtle cues from their animals.

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.849
Finally, researchers at MIT have found a way
to get inside their robots heads.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:05.090
Using ceiling mounted projectors, animation
software, and motion capture technology these

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:27.850
holo-testing grounds can visualize a robot’s
intentions in real time.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.860
I’m gonna leave you with a humanoid robot
autonomously playing the Metallophone…

00:04:34.860 --> 00:05:15.700
And as always - thanks for watching!
