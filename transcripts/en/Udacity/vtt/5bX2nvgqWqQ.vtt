00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the best way to solve this is to say well,"What sides do I know?"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Relative to α, this is the adjacent side. This is the hypotenuse.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If I look over here, I see that cosine uses the adjacent and the hypotenuse.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Okay, so cos α is equal to 401.0 over 523.5.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When I plugged that in, I get an answer of 0.766.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now I can go back to my table of cosine values and see--oh hey, 0.766

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's the cosine of 40 degrees.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Alpha must have been 40 degrees. Great work. This is a lot of material we've just covered.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We've learned the first two weeks of any normal trigonometry class,

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you've done it all just now--I'm very impressed.
