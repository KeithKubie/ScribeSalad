00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.740
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: This
session is going

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.130
to be called The Emergence
of Life in the Lab.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.910
The last session we learned about
how to get clues to the origin

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.960
of life by going to lots of
interesting and difficult to get

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.780
to places, like the
bottom of the ocean,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.260
and earlier someone had mentioned
about the recent discovery

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.470 position:56%
of fossils, which may be the oldest
fossils of life on earth dating back

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.830
over 3.7 billion years
which come from Greenland.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.850
These are tough places to get
to and you get little clues,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.860
sometimes very indirect clues.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.160
You know, if you're
looking at things

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.570
that are alive today you're not
really looking at life as it began,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.780
and if you're looking at fossils
you're looking at these very kind

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.010
of faint shadows of
life that once was.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.250
So another way to think
about the origin of life,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.230
another way to study it is to
say, hey, it's life and it's made

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.010
up of molecules so let's just put
them together and test them out

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.570
and see if we can make life
or if we can carry out some

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.650
of the actions we think were
important for making life

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.530
and let's just do it in the nice
comfortable confines of a lab

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.830
where you can get lots of coffee

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.950
when you need it and
everything is great.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.310
Not that easy, actually, either.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.400
And so we're going to be hearing
from a scientist who does this kind

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.770
of research, as well a historian
and an anthropologist about sort

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.590
of the culture of life in the lab.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.760
And so we'll start
with Steve Benner.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.290
Steve is a Distinguished Fellow
in the Westheimer Institute

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.000
at the Foundation for
Applied Molecular Evolution

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.560
and he has taught at Harvard
and other places, as well.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.290
I've had the privilege of writing

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.390
about Steve's work several
times over the past few years.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.000 position:56%
I wrote a piece in 2013 for the New
York Times about some of his musings

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.400
about whether life is more likely
to have originated here on earth

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.000
or have it started on
Mars and come here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.790
So if you just Google our names

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.130
in the New York Times
that should pop up.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.060
And I do remember, I just wanted to
recall like when I first met Steve,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.730
which was awhile ago
and may have been, gosh,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.030
maybe 15 years ago or something.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.180
I went to - I was going
to do a profile

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.650 position:56%
of Jack Shostack [Assumed Spelling],
who is also a very important person

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.290
in the origin of life research

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.420
who is building these
kind of protocells.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.580 position:56%
And Steve was visiting and they were
just hanging out in a coffee shop

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.970
and they just said - Jack
just said, just meet us here.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.210
So I sit down and I'm introduced to
Steve, who I've never met before,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.470
and he says, so what
do you think, you know,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.510 position:56%
how much money do you think it would
take to set up a lab to be able

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.320
to invent life from scratch,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.790
like how much money given what
we know, just what do you think?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.080
And I just thought about
it and said, $20 million.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.790
And he just paused and he
thought about it, it's like,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.900
yeah, that sounds about right.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.230
So that gives you a sense

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.510
of how Steve thinks and
without further ado.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.100
[ Technical Difficulty ]

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Benner: This is on?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.170
I guess it is on.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.160
This is quite a diverse group and
I'm going to start first by talking

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.110
to those of you whose only
interaction with science was

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.040
in a bad eighth grade middle
school science course,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.450
where you were taught about
these scientific methods,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.690
which had questions and
hypothesis and observations,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.630
entirely constructed experiments
that tested the mechanism

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.400
or the hypothesis or
not the hypothesis,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.990
but really missed all
the basic issues.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.440
And so I mean I've given up
judging science fair projects,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.450
but you can actually look at some
of the problems that you have,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.410
like here's a guy who has
got a poster who wants

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.540
to know why chicks dig
me, there's a hypothesis.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.930
Remember all these posters
in a science fair have

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.840
to state a hypothesis and the
background and all the rest of it,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.290 position:56%
but rarely is the language discussed

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.970
as to what language will be
used to answer the question.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.020
This is certainly a problem
with the origins of life.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.210
Now what do you expect,
a mathematical formula,

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.360
do you expect a chemical reaction,
do you expect a geological model?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.170
And, of course, for any of
you who have a small child

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.330
and you say chicks dig me because
I have nice hair, the question is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.720
but why do nice hair
have chicks dig me?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.570
And, of course, if you're
a good Darwinian at the end

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.820
of the day you say that, well,
chicks dig this nice gentleman

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.970
because they think
that his DNA paired

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.890
with theirs would give their
offspring the highest chances

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.370
of surviving itself, getting
married and having children.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.560
But, you know, here's a great guy
who had an interesting question,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.010
will there be minorities in heaven?

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.040
That's not his question, his
question is is there a heaven?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.050
And then some science
fair adviser insisted

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.030
on a purpose hypothesis variable
format and so he had to come

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.550
up with a new poster,
which is unfortunate.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.020
Now simple questions are easy
to answer, like this one,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.890
how long will a dead body float?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.210
[laughter] Right?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.730
And, of course, answers can
also be put to practical use.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.700
Here's a science fair project
called Getting Away With It,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.120
proper corpse disposal,
in case you're interested.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.100
But keep in mind that it's the
simple questions that are easy

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.460
to answer by this hypothesis based
direction, but not the big ones,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.000
and unfortunately the big
questions are the interesting ones.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.400
So I got tired of my
kid being abused

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.270 position:56%
by eighth grade science fair project
leaders, so I wrote this book, Life,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.100
the Universe and the Scientific
Method, a copy of which I have here

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.170
which I will autograph for
you if anybody wants one.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.050 position:56%
Basically, science is not hypothesis
testing, it's a back and forth

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.980
between two sides or maybe
five sides or maybe even more,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.640
but everybody is trying to
place the burden of proof

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.590
on something, somebody else, right?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.380
Nothing is proven in science,
nothing actually is disproven

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.320
in science, Carl Popper [Assumed
Spelling] and our education

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.270
of scientists notwithstanding.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.070
It's an operational
science as the back

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.970
and forth can be very well
organized and people understand

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.070
who has the burden of
proof, but when you say

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.990
that metabolism comes
before biopolymers,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.550
this is metabolism
first or DNA first,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.100
that becomes a confused
burden of proof to assign,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.180
or life arose at deep-sea thermal
vents, which is what I put in just

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.080
after hearing the last talk.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.210 position:56%
These are not so much yes or no
questions as what do you really mean

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.070
and given the state of the
field discussions are often,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.190
you'll see this semantically
confused

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.490
without understanding
where the burden is.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.540
And really we have to decide
who must show what in order

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.490
for this field to advance?

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.400
Now we've been involved in
what we call the four paths

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.700
to understand origin.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.390
It's a little Chinese,
a little Confucianism,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.900
but the northern path is
where we try to build life.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.770
And the pieces, the bottom, the
right, the eastern path is the path

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.640
which we discussed a
moment ago by where we try

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.200
to construct our own life forms.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.010 position:56%
Obviously, we are desperately trying
to get married to get us an alien

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.360
from Mars, if we can just
get another species from Mars

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.200
who arose independently of Mars we
would have a great insight to this.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.730
But I'd like to start
with the bottom one,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.830
which actually somewhat
makes the most sense, right?

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.200
If you have a biosphere
full of life, you know,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.150
you might as well try to
look at that biosphere

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.900
and see how it might have worked.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.310
And keep in mind your problem
is that as we have shown

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.220
on this green tree there
is a natural history,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.370
which relates all the organisms
that we know to each other

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.020
by common molecular structures.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.430
Now that's a bit circular because
the way we look for organisms

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.590
on earth is by looking for
those molecular structures,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.810
so it is conceivable that
there is a shadow bias here.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.770
And that's Carol Cleland's [Assumed
Spelling] term, which might be

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.920
under our feet, which uses
a different biochemistry

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.680
which we don't see because we
don't know how to look for it.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.660
And in some sense Carl Woese,
who you've already seen a picture

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.370
on the slide, has perhaps
discovered one of those many years,

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.660 position:56%
I don't know 50 years ago about now.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.710
But working backwards in time
we are using sort of a process

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.080
and this process is a
principle of mineral motion.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.440
We use it, for example, when we
construct Indo-European languages.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.620
This is just the Indo-European
language of Slavic, Germanic,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.650
Romance languages, Celtic,
which has the word for snow,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.540
it's present in all
of those languages.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.090
Of course, in some cases it's quite
recognizable, so German it's schnee

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.550
and in Slavic it's snijeg,
and French, of course,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.900
the Romance language decided
that s-n was hard to pronounce

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.110
so they dropped the s-n so you have
just the words beginning with n,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:10.440
like nieve in Spanish
or neige in French.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.430
What's important, of course,
is now you can actually look

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.440
at the structures and you see them
in common from all the descendants.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.740 position:56%
And the principle of minimal motion,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.280
some people call it
maximum parsimony,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.900
is to say that if I assume
that languages change as little

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.090
as possible I will try to
construct the ancient word for snow

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.600
in the last common ancestor of all
the modern Indo-European languages

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.080
with a little, the smallest
amount of phonetic or change.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.520
And to do that you can come up with
the word snig, which is written

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.610 position:56%
at the top of this chart, as to what
you would say to an Indo-European

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.030
if you were to encounter
him or her in the street

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.330
and wanted to talk about snow.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.460
Now if you put these words

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.020
into natural context they get
more than just that, right?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.120
And the natural context,
all of a sudden you realize

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.740
that Indo-European has more
words that tells you not just

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.900
about what you would say to the
Indo-European if you encounter him

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.320
or her on the street, but
it also tells you something

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.780
about the Indo-European society,
specifically, that live in a place

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.420
where it snowed which
rules out say Zaire.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.480
But the reconstruction,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.440
the Indo-European language
does not have a word for gold,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.850
it does not have a word for
silver, it does not have a word

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:28.520
for tax exempt and mutual bonds,
but it does have words for dogs

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.380
and for sheep and for oxen
and for pigs, they have grain,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.320
they can put them in vehicles which
have wheels, and they can count

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.830
to 100, and we know that
by looking at the context

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.140
of the modern languages
set into a model

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.780
of how you infer ancient
ancestral structures

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.070
from the structures
of descendent words.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.810
So we could do the same thing now

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.230
by replacing the phonetic
letters by molecular structures.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.450
And let me just do something that's
important because I'm a chemist

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.910
and you've heard Wally Gilbert,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.220
mentioned he was a physicist
turned molecular biologist.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.880
We chemists look at
molecules atom by atom, right?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.570
We don't - and we look
down upon and you'll find,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.320
probably get the tension in
my voice, we resent personally

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.140 position:56%
that Wally Gilbert, a physicist
turned molecular biologist who looks

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.600
at structures only letters at
a time, does not look at atoms,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.910
but nonetheless wins the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.720
That gets us real tense.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.110
But let me go back,
and I'm not sure,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.290
who looks at their vitamin pills?

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.240
Please, raise your hands
if you actually study?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.640 position:56%
So if you look at this you'll notice
that there's a whole bunch of stuff

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.710
in here and what these
generally are are what we'll call

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.160
enzyme cofactors.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.280 position:56%
You've heard enzymes a couple
minutes ago, these are the catalysts

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.170
that catalyze transformations.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.150
I've just put down here
a structure of ATP.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.610
ATP is well known as being a
very common molecule involved

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.250
in phosphate transfer,
phosphorylation,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.530
but also energy economy of cells.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.700 position:56%
And I've structured it to show you
that there's a piece of RNA attached

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.890
to it, and the black part is the
phosphate that's actually been

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.850 position:56%
transferred, the orange part is RNA.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.040
And all modern organisms, at
least that we know of on life

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.080
on earth, have ATP in them.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.050
And so we infer from that and
the principle of minimal motion

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.200
that the last universal
common ancestor,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.980
which charmingly has the
name LUCA, also had ATP.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.440 position:56%
But, of course, it's more than that,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.530
it's the last universal
common ancestor had ATP it was

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.000
also phosphorylatic.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.140
Now that's a belief that
requires a logical premise,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.060
is sort of the same kind of logic
that if I gave you a T-rex tooth,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.330
right, and it looks like it's ideal
for chewing meat then you infer

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.810
that the T-rex was a meat-eater.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.650
That's a deep Darwinian
statement, actually.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.010
But the bottom line is that if
all descendants of LUCA have ATP,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.560
the ancestor LUCA had ATP,
all descendants use ATP

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.870
to transfer phosphate, therefore,
the ancestor transferred phosphate.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.230
And if you go back to your vitamin
pills you'll notice that these are

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.740 position:56%
so important that there's niacin,
which I have as the structure there.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.060
I'm thinking it shows up
on the screen, does it?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.640
We have, of course,
thiamine, we have coenzyme A,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.190
which is in the vitamin
pills is pantothenic acid.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.850 position:56%
All of these molecules end up in
your metabolism with a reactive part

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.990
in black and an RNA piece
attached to it doing nothing.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.920
And the reason why we
know it's doing nothing is

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.070
because for all those structures
I put a little blue structure,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.730
which is the same molecular
structure

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.700
that can do exactly the same
thing as the RNA cofactor can do,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.960
but it is not used very widely in
enzymology, the ancestral state.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.630 position:56%
LUCA had RNA attached to everything.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.490
Now that leads to an obvious
question, it was a question raised

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.640
by Harold White, a chemist at the
University of Delaware in 1976,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.220
it was raised by Cornelius Visser,
a chemist, and Richard Kellogg,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.170
a chemist, both in the
Netherlands in 1998.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.720
That paper in 1998 is how biotin's
reactivity can be understood,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.200
biotin being one of the things you
eat, in terms of the RNA world.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.500
We're 10 years ahead of
the molecular biologists.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.330
I'm hoping Wally is not
watching this because I'm going

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.050
to get a long letter from him.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.410 position:56%
We're 10 years ahead of the
molecular biologists because we look

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.910
at the chemistry and, of course,

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:23.190
that paper from the 1970s is what
persuaded me that the RNA world was

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.410
so likely to be the case
because it explained so much

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.190
about the molecules that we
have in our everyday life.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.140
Everybody with me?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.670
Cool. So it turns out that
there's lots of other things.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.280
The RNA world, of course, as
you've already heard today,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.010
is defined as an episode
in natural history on earth

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.060
where RNA was the sole
genetically encoded biocatalyst.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.120 position:56%
It explains these RNA cofactors with
RNA handles to bind RNA enzymes.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.250
Again, DNA later emerged,
more stable genetics,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.970
you heard that a few minutes ago.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.780
And then RNA catalysts later
emerged and made proteins.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.370
That structure in blue and
orange is the ribosome,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.870
it's the machine that
makes proteins.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.870
And I've color coded it,
so the orange is RNA.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.160 position:56%
You've probably got the thread here.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.560
The blue is proteins slapped
on the surface, which help out.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.710
But the ribosome making proteins
is an RNA catalyst and that is

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.200
in addition to the structure
of the RNA world cofactors.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.830
Now for this to make sense, okay,

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.860
RNA world must not only
have had the cofactors,

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.450
but also the reactions
that use the cofactors.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.210
The RNA world must have
had a complex metabolism

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.530
with [inaudible] metabolism,
that is oxidation and reduction,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.770
because that's what niacin RNA
cofactors do and that's what Flavin

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.840
or riboflavin is what's in
your bottle cofactors do.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.180
Claisen carbon-carbon bonding
reactions - I won't go through all

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.930
of the chemical jargon

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.260
that describes the reactions
the RNA world was catalyzing.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.680
But if this theory or if this
explanation, if this why question

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.870
for your eighth grade science
fair posters to make any sense,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.230
it's got to be the case that not
only did the RNA world have those

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.530
cofactors but it used them

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.670
and it must have used them
in a complex metabolism.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.480
And we actually in 1989 wrote
this paper with Andy Ellington,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.210
now at the University of
Texas, modern metabolism

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.240
as a polemicist [Assumed Spelling]
of the RNA world, and then in 1993

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.620 position:56%
in the book that you've already seen
mentioned we actually wrote 50 pages

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.660
to write out all the details of
what that metabolism looked like.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.360
And so we've heard already
this is the same thing now

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.660
with the niacin cofactor.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.070
You heard a moment ago about
Bill Martin's view, Bill Martin,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:42.060 position:56%
a bunch of people looking at organic
biomolecules as if they're strings

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.230
of letters, not looking at the
individual atoms and they had come

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.690
up with a conclusion that
completely denies this.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.670
Now in our view that's wrong,
their view, of course, we're wrong,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.490
so we can go back and forth trying
to shift the burden of proof

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.500
to each other as we duke it

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.500
out in the bold alpha male
world of modern science.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.690
Okay, fair enough.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.970
So that's a problem for us because
working backwards in time is going

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.340
to fail to get us anywhere
near origins, right?

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.200
You believe Bill Martin,
you don't agree with this,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.270 position:56%
but remember if you believe Bill
you can't explain the RNA cofactors.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.020
You can explain the RNA
cofactors - this is what I think I

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.670
like about my Willard Vandermyde
Klein [Assumed Spelling] moments.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.180
I mean I don't know for those
of you are into philosophy,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.580
Klein basically made a remark
about Carl Popper's statement

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.740
that science was associated
with disprovable hypotheses.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.160
And Klein's comment was, no, you
can't disprove anything either

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.910
because there's always
these auxiliary hypotheses.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.210
The experiment failed,
disproves the theory?

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.070
No, no, it proves the
machine was broken, right?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.680
I mean there's all sorts of stuff.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.300
But one of the nice
things that Klein does talk

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.410
about is these packages of
logical statements that you choose.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.920
So Martin is right, can't
explain RNA cofactors,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.750
can explain RNA cofactors
then Martin is wrong.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.990
And so what emerges, we have
to really be forced now to go

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.620
into the north quadrant
of this plot.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.460
We actually have to
worry about this model.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.960
And, of course, what going
backwards in time has done

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.250
for us is not nothing, it
has done something for us.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.780
It does suggest an origin
that must be dependent on RNA,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.480
that's what that story
has done for us.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.450
The story is, and there's John
Luke Picard [Assumed Spelling]

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.450
with Q [Assumed Spelling]
who is flitting in and out

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.670
of the continuum, taking John
Luke Picard precise as the time

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.450
where life originated on earth.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.870
The argument is that
RNA emerged able

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.160
to catalyze template directed
synthesis of with errors,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.980
but where the errors are replicable

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:48.350
if you're a good hardcore molecular
Darwinist that's all you need

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.160
to have this process of
having kids with mutants

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.540
and having the better ones
survive and the worst ones die,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.880
produce all the behaviors
that we value in life.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.250
Now the first person I know

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.960
who did this was Alex Rich [Assumed
Spelling] in 1962 and, frankly,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.120
he wrote that out much better
than Woese, Orgel or Crick.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.870
It was a very clear statement.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.830
And Alex died last year,
he's a great hero of mine,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.820
but he was also very persuasive.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.140
But I did not know about it until
I gave a seminar where he was

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:24.400
in the audience where I cited
Woese and Crick, Orgel and Woese.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.730
So now there are molecules.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.010
Phil Holliger, actually a former
student in my lab, for those of you

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.190
who have been in my lab you'll
know that I will take credit

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.570
for everything you do ever after.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.980
I actually had nothing
to do with this.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.970 position:56%
He's at MRC in Cambridge, he made an
RNA molecule that is actually able

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.980
to catalyze the template directives
of RNA, but they're replicable.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.520
So are we done, done
and done, right?

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.700
Well, not so fast.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.320
This is a detailed hypothesis.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.420
I would prefer the word model.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.080
You can say that the burden of
proof has shifted and I can insist

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.980
that others now disprove
the hypothesis.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.040
Well, good luck with that.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.270
And so the question
now comes back to us,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:10.130 position:56%
how can this model meet a convincing
burden of proof, convincing people,

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.230
the people needing
conviction are creationists,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.440
as well as our professional
colleagues in molecular biology,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.210
as well as of course the chemists?

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.580
And that's a big problem because
we should be able to assemble

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.360
in the modern lab components of
RNA from prebiotic precursors,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.160
especially since we're not
operating under the constraints

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.500
of a prebiotic soup, right?

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.090
I mean compared to the prebiotic
earth modern molecular biologists

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.020
have the power of God, right?

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.220
And we ought to be able to go
back and do this trivially.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.730
And so, but keep in mind, I'm
now going to pass these samples

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.880
around because this is
what we're looking for.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.250
This is a stromatolite, this is 3.4
billion years old, it's not the 3.7

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.380
that has just recently - and
I expect these to come back.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.900
I do, however, want you - this
looks like an honest crowd, yes.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.060
But I just wanted to -
there's Cambrian explosion,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.040
that's actually somebody that
you might say looks like you,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.220
that's the origin of
life sort of, I guess.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.980
I mean, but there's twice as much
time between the origin of earth

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.290
and this guy as there is
between this guy and you.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.760 position:56%
So you should keep that in mind when
you are - so here, pass these around

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.450
and then drop them off in
the back when you're done.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.750
&gt;&gt; Set them down here?

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Benner: There, yes.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.540
Well, so we ought to
be able to do it.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.510
And what's happened when
people have tried and it's

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.070
about 50 years of failure?

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.260
Ah, so what does one do?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.620
Now you've already
heard this before,

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.920
what you want to do is you want

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.000
to in this business
follow the paradoxes,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.670
you want to understand what it
is that is so God damn difficult?

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.780
And then you want to go back and
look at that with intense focus,

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.670
one at a time, because there
will be one God damn thing

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.030
after another as you
go through this.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.370
So I've put out five
paradoxes for you.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.420
One is the so-called tar paradox,
which is if you give enough energy

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.570
to organic matter, which
happens to not have access

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.260
to Darwinian evolution, you
don't get life, you get tar,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.180
and it's a well validated
observation

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.190
and you probably have validated
it yourself in the kitchen

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.840
if you've left the oven on
too long, right, you get tar.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.000
The phosphate paradox, we'll
talk about in a minute.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.890
Phosphate is the linking
groups in RNA.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.820
It's hard to get phosphate
in the presence of calcium

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.360
because you get something
that looks like this.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.600
This is apatite, it's
calcium phosphate.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.890
The other thing that is
also possible is your bones.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.540
So lovely, these are
lovely stones, by the way.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:39.450
Yes, I don't mean to disrupt your
- so the third paradox we'll talk

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.180
about is the water paradox.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:46.720 position:56%
We say that life requires water, but
water is a very corrosive solvent

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.750
and it basically destroys all
the biopolymers and a good deal

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.110
of the other molecules,
including a lot

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.910
of the cofactors that I mentioned.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:59.770 position:56%
Next, suppose you get over that, you
get the tar, manage to evade tar,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.800
prevent the organic molecules
from devolving to get asphalt,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.480
you manage to get the phosphate,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.550
you manage to assemble
RNA, you manage to keep it.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.400
The next paradox that
you will encounter is

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.020
that once you've made the RNA it's
not stable enough to accumulate,

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.810
and so you have to worry
about recovering the RNA.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.620
And, finally, even if you can keep
RNA it's far easier to get RNA

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.060
that destroys RNA as a catalyst,
we can do that roughly one molecule

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:32.320
in 10 to the 14th of RNA molecules
is a catalyst able to destroy RNA.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.590
Much more easy to get stuff
that destroys than to create.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.010
We don't know the actual likelihood
or the odds for making RNA,

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.730
but it's somewhere
in the 10 to the 30s.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.020
So let me go through and just tell
you a little bit about what goes

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.280
on here when you focus
on these paradoxes.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.850
And I'll start with the tar
paradox, which is well validated,

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.620
it's known in sugars,
there's sucrose.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.080
Who here, rock candy,
raise your hands?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.540
That was in seventh grade, right?

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.690
So, but if you heat it a little bit
you'll get caramelization, right,

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.580
and you're looking at it, right?

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.380
More heat, more carmel, and
this is well known to you and,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.160
unfortunately, that's the sugar
but RNA has a sugar component,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.910
which is unfortunately R. Since
Miller's experiment was named,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.070
I want to point out the
power of rhetoric in science.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:24.370
Left is Stanley, himself, the great
man who arguably founded modern bio

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.820
or prebiotic chemistry, with
his machine in a press photo.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.490
The right picture shows
what it actually looks like.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.920
What Miller showed is that if
you put energy into organics

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.830
without Darwinism you get tar.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.240
So why do you get tar?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.460
Well, the answer is because of
the - chemists, I'll talk to you,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.080
we talk about enolization
and aldol reactions -

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.640
for the non-chemists I just want
you to look for C double bond O,

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.440
carbon joined by two
bonds to an [inaudible]

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.150 position:56%
because that can do these reactions.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.700
Enolization, which is shown
here, and aldol addition,

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.370
which is also shown here,
that give you complexity

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.670
which looks like that.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.770
And, of course, I've only
put part of the complexity,

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.300
and we've worked out
all these reactions.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.380
One of the problems with ribose is
it also has a C double bond O unit

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.260
and, therefore, it can
enolize, there's that reaction,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.290
and reacted with itself
and it can form asphalt.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.720
In fact, it's so bad that in 1995
Stanley Miller wrote a paper,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.430
which I've written on this slide,
where he says and I'm quoting now,

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:29.620
stability considerations preclude
the use of ribose and other sugars

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.630
as prebiotic agents, they fall
apart, ribose falls apart,

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.160
it follows that ribose and any
other sugars were not components

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.950
of the first genetic material,
and that's a real problem

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.250
for the RNA world molecules

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:47.030
because if there's no R,
ribose, there's no RNA.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.820
So, you know, we've been now
for 15 years making this plea

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.880
for minerology partly because when
I was a kid I was a rock hound,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.600
and life did not begin
in a Pyrex baking pan

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.880
or in a Pyrex beaker
for that matter.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.500
It began in a mineral environment,
and I'm going to actually pull up -

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.810
here's a wonderful mineral
for you, actually hard to say,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.880
these are tourmalines, these would
probably be better on the picture,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.990
it's even better down the
street in the jewelry store.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.910
Tourmalines contain the
element boron and boron

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.780
with oxygen gives borate and borate
is something that gets excluded

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.180
from rock forming minerals and
comes to the surface and it washes

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.190
out into alkaline streams.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.930
You've heard serpentinization,
that's coming from peridot.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.110
There's an example of peridot,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.470
which you can actually
see the serpentinization.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.540
Borate has a magical property,

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.020
it binds to two adjacent
OH hydroxyl groups.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.410
Ribose has adjacent
OH hydroxyl groups.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.720
Once borate binds it causes
the whole molecule cyclizing,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.640
get rid of the C double
bond O group.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.300
The C double bond O
group is what gives you

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.230
so much trouble in
prebiotic chemistry.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.150
It also happens to guide the
reactions of carbohydrates and,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.730
in fact, if I just go back to
the picture I showed you before,

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:12.350 position:56%
borate constrains the reactivity to
just that little region of the plot.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.920
Wonderful, so there's a lot
of stories on the tar paradox,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.540
that's just one, but let me now
move on to the phosphate paradox,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.100
which comes from the fact that it's
hard to get high concentrations

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.340
of phosphate in the presence
of calcium, which precipitates

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.300
as apatite, which is now
circulating throughout the room.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.040
And apatite does not phosphorylate
ribose or sugars and, in fact,

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.180
does not allow itself to easily
go into the backbone of RNA.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.020
But here is a shout out for
astrobiology because astrobiology

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.560
as an institute, the
NASA/Astrobiology Institute,

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.330
went out of its way to create
what we call multi-disciplinarity

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.460
but then they did so by
having a virtual institute.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.830
They did not require universities
to move people from place to place

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.710
and build a building to house them.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.230
Multi-disciplinarity is certainly
accessible by the internet.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.950
And so you've got to really enjoy
browsing geological reports.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.090
I don't know who, the people
who are geologists, you sit back

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.600
and I'm sitting in the sunroom
one day doing the crossword

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.110
and then I pick up
this geology report,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:16.940
and I notice here gypsum
occurs within the sequences,

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.470
geological sequences, containing
luneburgite [Assumed Spelling].

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.620
Huh, well, okay, what
the hell is gypsum,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.920
what the hell is luneburgite?

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.780
Well, gypsum is calcium sulfate.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.100
Mineralogists have this name
just to keep the club small.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.970
Luneburgite is a magnesium
boro-phosphate.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.470
And the fact that they occur
together has significance.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.250
So what does it mean if
gypsum, which is a combination

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.840
of magenta calcium and yellow
sulfate and luneburgite,

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.480
which is a red magnesium,
a blue boron

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.030
and a green phosphate,
occur together?

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.600
Well, as I mentioned, the phosphate
problem in the RNA first model has

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.430
to do with the need for a
lot of phosphate to make RNA

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.940
and phosphate green and calcium
magenta generally precipitate

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.510
as magenta green apatite.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.870
But in the presence of borate what

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.810
that geological report
told us was that, no,

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.600
if you actually have
borate present, blue,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.800
it will sequester the
green phosphate away

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.620
from the magenta green apatite.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.660 position:56%
And, in fact, instead of having the
two boxes on the left, where calcium

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.900
and phosphate precipitated
to get useless apatite,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.580
and magnesium sulfate precipitate
to get useless epsonite,

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.590
borate present, phosphate,
borate and magnesium go together

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.710
to give you luneburgite and
calcium and sulfate are separated.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.260
You've rescued the
phosphate from the calcium

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.810
and this also happens
in the laboratory.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.030
So a different question, right?

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.850
A minute ago we used boron to
stabilize organics to prevent them

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.570
from forming tar, here
we're now using boron

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.980
to sequester phosphate
away from calcium

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.020
so that it doesn't get
lost in a useless mineral.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.610
Two questions, same answer,
it's a wonderful thing.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.540
And it turns out that
luneburgite does a wonderful job,

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.800
not only in making the phosphate
available, but once the nucleoside,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.330
which I have drawn on the
right-hand corner of that slide,

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.460
extracts the borate out of the
mineral it then gets itself

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.730
phosphorylated and,
more to the point,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.640
it actually gets phosphorylated
just at one place,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.460
the five prime position which
is where you want it to.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.680
By the way, we're talking
about continuity, right?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.530 position:56%
You don't want to have a step happen

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.650
and have an intelligent
designer have to come in

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.430
and take the material that
was made in the first step

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.300
of prebiotic chemistry
and redo it, purify them,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.720
and put it into the second step.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.130
If you can get all these
steps working together,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.060
okay, you're in great shape.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.310
I've actually put a structure
up here, which is nucleoside,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.610
it's a building block for RNA.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.640
You might ask where do
nucleosides come from?

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.090
In a desert about four months
ago Tom Corel [Assumed Spelling]

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.090
actually proposed a route for
this, which I've shown here.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.070
So what we're doing here, building
what will emphasize the weakness

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.370
of this model.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.870
The weakness of this model
is it is still discontinuous,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:10.730 position:56%
which gets us from gases like carbon
dioxide and hydrogen, hydrogen oxide

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.790
and dinitrogen and
methane, to formaldehyde.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.090
I wish that Jim had been here

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.760
because he actually wrote the
distinctive review of this.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.260
We then get to the other processes.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.060
In step-wise form,
going from atmospheric

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:31.500
to in this case ribose
nucleosides phosphates.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.150
How we doing?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.150
A lot of chemistry.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.560 position:56%
Obviously, the next question is even

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.840
if you make RNA how do
you get it to accumulate?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.300
Well, it turns out that
minerals in a desert also bind

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.150
to the RNA and stabilize it.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.180
This is work that's just
appearing from a release

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.930 position:56%
of Beyonde [Assumed Spelling] in our
group, where she is absorbing RNA

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.080
that is made onto the support.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.870
And so the next question is even
if you can keep RNA it's far easier

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:08.160
to destroy RNA than it is - easier
to get RNA that destroys RNA

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.960
than it is to get RNA
that makes RNA.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.260
How much time do I have?

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.490
I'm looking at three minutes, but
we started quite late, right, so?

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.800
But let me just spend the
three minutes now just

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.450
to give you the final
paradox, right?

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.570
Keep in mind that RNA is a bad
reservoir of catalytic activity.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.880
The reason it took so long
for Tom Cech and Sid Altman

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.210
to win the Nobel Prize,
finding catalysis out of RNA,

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.860
it is not a very good molecule,

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.650
and that's because it has only
four building blocks and not a lot

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.690
of functional groups, like you
have in amino acids and proteins,

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.520
which is what makes proteins
so powerful as catalysts.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.180
However, if you again do
what I showed you before,

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.180
looking at the modern life forms
and going backwards in time,

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.540
you'll discover that LUCA
does not just have RNA,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.610
it has RNA with these magenta
side chains attached to it

00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.910
which are functional groups.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.600
In fact, some of them are very
close to the functional groups

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.780
that are found in proteins.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.610
And so maybe, maybe, maybe

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.650
at some point LUCA decided maybe
before it invented translation,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:16.780
maybe terran life may have tried to
improve the catalytic power of RNA

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.000
by adding functionality
to the standard basis.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Now, of course, you and I
descended from an organism,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.920
which as Mary pointed out, which
the winners did not do that.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.800 position:56%
But maybe we as synthetic biologists
can create an alternative path

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.050
and do what natural
history did not do on earth.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:36.690
And so this is now not backwards
in time, it's not forwards in time,

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.870
it's the east quadrant, where
we're actually going to take DNA,

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.300
which I'm just going to
use the Lego structures

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.570
to illustrate how DNA
works with a big

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.450
and a small base, with
prongs and holes.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.400
We're going to complete
this Lego set,

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.870
so we actually have all possible
combinations of big basis

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.920
and small basis and prongs and
acceptors, there's the chemistry,

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.800
there's some more chemistry.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.250
We're going to add functional
groups to them and we're going

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:10.010
to have our own little private
personal evolving Darwinian system,

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.610
following a path that terran life
could have taken but did not.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.000 position:56%
And the reason why we can do this is

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.400
because we are Gods compared
to the prebiotic earth.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.030
So I won't describe this,
as we're out of time.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.450
I will just say that we are
able to apply Darwinism.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:27.000
Keep in mind that we do pay
the bills in our laboratory

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.200
by binding to cancer cells.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.390
Why? Because that's a much more
important thing to bind to.

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.910
But once you have just four letters
in your nucleic acid alphabet

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:40.260 position:56%
and you try to evolve from that four
letter alphabet DNA or RNA molecules

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.410
that bind to cancer cells, but not
to non-cancer cells that's a lack

00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:46.510
of specificity, it's hard to do.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.470 position:56%
But if you add letters to the
genetic alphabet you get those that,

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.820
in fact, bind quite well.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.380
So there is the paradoxes that
you can go back by focusing

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.810
on these individual details,

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.010
bringing in the geological
environment and the minerals.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.540
Well, you can ask were
these minerals

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.430
and deserts present on early earth?

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.020
Bob Hasen [Assumed Spelling] and I
have had a long discussion of this.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.510 position:56%
Were deserts available on early
earth we could have had these things

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.700
evaporate, a similar discussion?

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.250
What's nice is that the minute our
geologists look for [inaudible]

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.310
and borate they discover it.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.210
So luneburgite, for example
is unstable to metamorphosis,

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.940
it gives monazite, it gives
apatite, it gives tourmaline,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.030
but you can find all
of those minerals

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:32.370
in 3.8 billion-year-old
geometric, metasedimentary rocks

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.590
from Greenland, which
Carl mentioned.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.710
Are deserts available
on early earth?

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.750
Joe Kirschvink says, no,
water inventory much too high

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.040
for there to be any dry land.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.820 position:56%
So Joe has suggested the Kirschvink
model, which was that all you've got

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.920
to do is go to Mars, which
has always had less water.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.400
The logic tree, of
course, is you've got

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.330
to decide now whether the
burden of proof has been met?

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.630
RNA first, yes or no?

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.880
If it's no you have a
different set of problems.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.780
Benner's chemistry, if the
answer is no, my response is, no,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.260
get your own God damn chemistry.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.010
If it's yes, you need an
oxidized desert and also a desert.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.310
Can we have those in Mars?

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.230
You've got to decide if the answer
is no - sorry, can you have them

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.840
on earth, then you have to
decide, if the answer is no, well,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.610
then Mars is an option, if not,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.420
you can actually have the
discontinuous model occurring

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.720
on earth.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.020
With that, let me stop.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.890
I've said too much
chemistry, that's for sure,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.590
but I think the chemistry
is very important.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.510
And we'll go on to the next.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:36.050
[ Applause ]

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.770
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: For the
interest of time we're going to -

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:43.110
we can take questions at
the end from everybody.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.740
We're going to do our
best to catch-up a bit.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.780
We may run a little
bit late at the end

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.670
of this session, but
we'll do our best.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:57.350
And I guess you can see why
whenever I interview Steve I make a

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.300
recording, I can go
back and reflect.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.190
Anyway, our next speaker
will be Luis Campos,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.240 position:56%
who is an Associate Professor of the
History of Science at the University

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.220
of New Mexico and the
Secretary Elect of the History

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:18.700
of Science Society and will soon
be the next Blumberg NASA Library

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.460
of Congress Chair of
Astrobiology here.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:26.360
So, Luis, please come join us?

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.780
&gt;&gt; Luis Campos: Good morning.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.480
Soon, we are confident, life
will appear in a test tube

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.220
and our world will
never be the same.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.380
Although this passage comes
from a book published in 2000,

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.260
the idea that it's merely a matter
of time before life can be created

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.770
in the test tube is hardly
a new one and it's come

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.590
in many different flavors
at many different times.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:00.610
In 1837, for instance, by
running an electric current

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.820
through a laboratory apparatus
the experimenter, Andrew Crosse,

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.220
was astonished to discover
crawling out one day a species

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.500
of a caras mite, and a
heretofore unknown one at that.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.870
These experiments in electrobiology
proved to be remarkably popular.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.100
Although his laboratory set-up
was later disparaged by critics

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.140
as an obstrico-galvanic apparatus,
his efforts were described

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.460
by the Historian James
Secort [Assumed Spelling]

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.810
as the most famous experiment of
the first half of the 19th Century.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.110
For most readers, he concluded,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.730
the creation of life
was an experimental fact

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.760
by the end of January 1837.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.150
I want to start off today
by suggesting that claims

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.380
to have artificially
synthesized new forms of life

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:46.610 position:56%
in the laboratory are not only oddly
recurring, but a characteristic

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.890
and a regular feature of the
history of modern biology.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:53.040 position:56%
From late 19th Century announcements
of Luther Burbank's' new creations

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.310
in fruits and flowers,
up to the promises

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.050
of contemporary synthetic
biology today.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.210
Far from being solely
sensational or merely curiosities,

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.890
these claims to have
synthesized new forms of life

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.320
when we examine them collectively

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.620
and historically all
share a similar structure.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.160
The most recent of these
are all cast in the tense

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.400
of the future perfect, that
we've not yet created life

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.610
but we will have done
so someday soon.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.690
The creation of life in the
test tube is always imminent,

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:24.270
but it's also always proved to
be deferred as our understanding

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.870
of life shifts from cell to
protein, to gene, to DNA and so on.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.800
What we once thought was
the next obvious step

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.610 position:56%
that would finally reveal the secret
of life with the creation of life

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.460
in the test tube as the
principle is always deferred.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.430
As we heard from Matt this
morning, we're still a long way

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.850
from the first functioning
protocells.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.020
So understanding the structure,
the history of these claims,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.130
may give us some valuable
insights into the prospects

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.520
for any future synthesis of life
and, more to our point here,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.650
I want to suggest we can learn
something from this history

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.110
that might help us
understand our current position

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.730
in astrobiology in a new way.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.640
After all, we haven't
found life yet,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.880
but we will someday or
at least we hope to.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.740
And the discovery of life in other
elsewhere's is always imminent.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.680 position:56%
So as we hope to realize a more
perfect future we should see what we

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.220
can gain from analyzing these
claims of the future perfect

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.600
in synthesizing life and in
discovering it beyond the earth.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.880
And since I'm a Historian the
way that I do this is by thinking

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.040 position:56%
through some cases, and so I'd like
to share some cases from my research

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.490
in this very earlier history

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.890
of origins life research
and history of genetics.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.920
So history is not in the prediction
business, I'm sorry to say,

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.310
but I hope to show it can
be good to think with here.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:36.010 position:56%
So 60 odd years after Crosse's
electrobiological experiments brings

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.380
us to another set of experiments

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.470
that were also described
as sensational.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.550
And these involved the new
phenomena of radioactivity,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.170
in the hands of a curious
Cavendish laboratory physicist

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.220
and again it's the physicist
there, J. Butler Burke.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.030
Burke, like Crosse, was
something of a one-hit wonder

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.820
when it came to great experiments.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:59.200
His 15 minutes of fame
came in the summer of 1905.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.750
Plunk a bit of radium chloride or
bromide from an ordinary test tube

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:07.130
into sterilized beef gelatin
or bouillon, Burke said,

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.300
nothing more than beef tea,
as one observer reported,

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.360
and the result was strange
growths in the medium.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.530
Over the course of their existence
these growths were found to grow

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:20.590
in the dark, decay in
sunlight, multiply by division

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.700
and even it appeared show the
structure of the nucleus of a cell

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.990
with the attendant
phenomena of karyokenesis,

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.900
the movement of chromosomes.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.640
Something queer has happened in his
bouillon, reported some observers.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.560
This got reported fairly early on.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.720
I took the story on the
right-hand column there

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.070 position:56%
and blew it up so you could read it.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.770 position:56%
So unlike some of his contemporaries
who were engaged in projects aimed

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:45.070
at mimicking some fundamental
life processes in inorganic media,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.370
he didn't just want to
mimic life, he wanted to get

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.670
at its underlying features.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.980
And he held that his
experiments showed a kind

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.080
of physical metabolism,
as he called it,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.130
somewhere between accretion
and assimilation.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.260
It was clear to him that what he
had produced were not bacteria

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.340
or recognizably life as we know it,

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.480
they were something
else all together.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.820
Neither radium nor microbe,
Burke took these radiobes

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.850
to be a new transitional form, not
quite living but exhibiting many

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.560
of the characteristics
essential to life here.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.130
Burke's experiments in artificial
life, and he uses that term

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.400
as his own, and the claims he
made for it were quite modest

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.280 position:56%
when compared with the enormous stir
that his experiments had aroused.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.400
He published his findings
in Nature in 1905, but time

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.930
and again the newspapers
were reporting

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.170
that Burke was getting
at the secret of life.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.870
According to the Daily
Chronicle these radiobes existed

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.110
in the critical state of
matter between the mineral

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.430
and the vegetable, in
fact, on the borderline

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.270
between the living and the dead.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.730
According to the New York
Times these creatures were

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.890
on the frontiers of life where
they trembled between the inertia

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:50.460 position:56%
of an inanimate existence and the
strange throb of insipient vitality.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.140
They were the prehistoric ancestor
of the microbe, the Times reported.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.060
Another newspaper reported
that Burke had succeeded

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.490
in producing cultures bearing
all the semblance of vitality.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.350
Radium, with its half-lives
, had produced radiobes

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.150
that were themselves half alive.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.840
Burke, himself, noted that the
radiobes appeared possess many

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.060
of the qualities and properties
that enabled them to be placed

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.570
in the borderland, so to speak,
between crystals and bacteria.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:18.990
Organisms, in the sense in
which we've employed the word,

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.700
and possibly the missing link

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.090
between the animate
and the inanimate.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.050
Although they, quote, obviously
lie all together outside the beaten

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.610
track of living things,
yet they were, he said,

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.960
within the realm of biology.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.790
The question of whether these
microscopic forms described are

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.570
or are not living things, he
says, depends all together

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.170
on what our conception of
life is and upon how broad

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.750
or narrow is the definition
that we're willing to accept

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.570 position:56%
of the phenomena of vital processes.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.640 position:56%
So, while Crosse with his electrical
mites had produced obviously living

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.800
things, just what Burke had
produced was eminently contestable

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.460
and his discovery was
described as one

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.420
that has provoked more
discussion perhaps than any event

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.600
in the history of science
since the publication

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.920
of the Origin of Species.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.430
Had he produced living things
or only life-like things?

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.760
Any claim to have produced life

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.940
in the laboratory would be
controversial by this point,

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.930
an example of mostly
discredited theories

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.690
of spontaneous generation
by around 1900.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.100
And, as he himself noted, to expect
to make a full-blown bacillus

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.260
at the present day
would not be more absurd

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.800
than to try to manufacture a man.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.330
But to bring about certain
phenomena by the action of radium

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.610
that approached the
properties of a living thing,

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.660
that approximated life was
to be properly scientific

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.800
and might even give insights
into other realms in biology.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.750
Burke held, in fact, that
his radiobes gave insight

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:38.010
into a potential angle for
research into the origin of life

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.930
in the distant and remote past.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:45.960
In his 1906 book about his
experiment, The Origin of Life,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.980
Its Physical Basis and Definition,

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.980
he described how his
radium based approach,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.240 position:56%
and radium was all the rage in 1904,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.690
meant that there was now
experimental access to the question

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.880
of the historical origin of
life, there was a new way

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.900
of reading what he
called an obliterated page

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.830
in the history of our planet.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.270 position:56%
Simply put, the early earth must
have been more intensely radioactive

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.960
so there would have
more radium available

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.320
to act upon the earthly
bouillon in such a manner,

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.860
so maybe primordial soup is out

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.520
but this is even before
the primordial soup,

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.440
we have this bouillon here.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.000
So this planetary conception
for the origin of life was seen

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.190 position:56%
by a wider readership at the time as
essential to understanding the place

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.740
of life in the universe
more generally.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:31.250
It's more than probable, The Daily
Chronicle said, that radium is one

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:35.660
of the ABCs of the stepping
stones to a law of cosmic life.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.380
So these are the so-called
radiobes and these are the images

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.320
that he publishes in his book.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.900
And our standards for presenting
images have changed quite a bit

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.940
since 1905, but I thought you
might like to see what it is

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.680
that he had presented, that he
showed as evidence of these growths

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.350
that grew and subdivided.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:57.530
So introducing a half living
thing that possessed, he said,

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.870
N minus 1 of the N
properties of living bacilli,

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.810
Burke was broadening the
understanding of what it would mean

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.890
to study the emergence of life
on earth or in the universe.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.030
Now he's not the best role model
for scientific success and he ended

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.690
up going a little bit
off the deep end,

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:15.660
but by 1931 he had written a book
on the subject, entitled perfectly

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.520
for our purposes here,
The Emergence of Life.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.630
Now I wouldn't exactly recommend
that you read this book,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.140
it's rather far from the
mainstream even for his day,

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.670
but in this little case study
of his early experiments

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:27.910
that we're seeing here
is the very beginning

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.810
of an experimental approach
into the historical origin

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.160
of life on the early earth.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.700
And the question of the emergence
of life here is already placed

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.770
into what we might today call
an astrobiological context.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.710
I find that fascinating and
delightful and terribly relevant

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.130
for us as we consider what we might
learn from the history of attempts

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:48.240
to create novel forms of life
through laboratory experimentation

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.150
and what we think we can come
to know about the existence

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.550
of life elsewhere in the universe.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.390
Let me move ahead with the
story, through some other figures

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.150 position:56%
in the history of attempts to
create life in the test tube as part

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.980
of our efforts to truly
understand the nature of life.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.750
There are lots of investigators
we might point to in this time

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.580
and the sheer number of
attempted and failed attempts

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.120 position:56%
at artificial life led one author in
Scientific America in 1911 to say,

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.250
from time to time we're
informed that the riddle

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.840
of the universe has been solved by
the artificial production of life

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.470
from nonliving materials, but each
time we wondered how it was done

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.330
for a few days and then we
find out it wasn't done at all,

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.820
the riddle is still there.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.250
The expression artificial life
has also been used in recent years

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.910
for two entirely different
sets of ideas.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.200
So one of them was Burke's
approach, the production of life

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.530
that never before existed,
and the other one had to do

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.180
with altering the characteristics

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.550
or the distinctive
properties of living matter.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.910
At the top of this list was
Jacque Loeb's recent discovery

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.190
of artificial parthenogenesis,
that by changing the concentration

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.430
of salt in solutions surrounding
a sea urchin egg he was able

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.190
to cause the development of an
embryo without fertilization.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.090
The next generation came into
existence without a father.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.580
This most vital discovery in
the history of physiology,

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.900 position:56%
almost the manufacture of life in
the laboratory, as Loeb was reported

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.610
to have said, meant that we
have drawn a great step nearer

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.360
to the chemical theory of life
and may see ahead of us a day

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.490
when a scientist experimenting
with chemicals

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:14.350
in the test tube may see them
unite and form a substance

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.110
which shall live and move
and reproduce itself.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.500
Now for Loeb understanding a
phenomenon meant being able

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.770
to control that phenomenon, and
so the ultimate control over life

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.440
for him, what he called the
technology of the living substance,

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.620
was not only to be able to do with
life as one willed but eventually

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.410
to be able to create it from
scratch oneself in the test tube.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.930
So he wasn't trying to shock
with these sorts of statements,

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.440
it was just simply
concomitant of what he viewed

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.990
as a thoroughgoing
engineering approach to life.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.790
These sorts of exciting
claims, however,

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.220
about the newly discovered
potentials of life

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.520
and how we might engineer it,

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.780
these claims have never
been far from their publics.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:56.400
By 1938 Rutmein Boyntner in his
Life is Beginning on the Earth said

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.560 position:56%
that we must realize in all of these
scientific activities there are

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.250
certain rules that
cannot be neglected.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.700 position:56%
Scientists shouldn't draw suspicious
conclusions from their findings,

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:09.990
as for instance to say that moving
oil drops represent a form of life.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.090
He said if they violate
this unwritten law all

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.660
of their results will be dumped
into the wastebasket of disregard,

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.470
even if real treasures
are contained therein.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:18.770
Another unwritten law, he said,

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.400
by which every scientist must
abide forbids the announcement

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.100
in the lay press of unverified
results that may give rise

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.950
to general misconceptions.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:29.050
The public, of course, cannot
possibly be informed on all details

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.520
of every line of scientific
research,

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.220
hundreds of which are being
pursued, and any announcement

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.050
that artificial cells have been
made may be hastily seized upon

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.640
as the dawning of a new era.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.090
Alexander Oparin, with his
influential early theory

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.080
of coacervates as primitive
cells seems not

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.760
to have heeded this advice.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.310
So rather than attempting a
synthetic approach to the origin

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:52.090
of life he argued in 1934 for
a more analytical deduction

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:54.710
from postulated early conditions.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.680
He said we're faced with
this colossal problem

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.120
of investigating each separate
stage of the evolutionary process.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.290
We have to delve into the
properties of proteins,

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.610
we must learn the structure
of colloidal organic systems,

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.770
of enzymes, of protoplasmic
organization.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.090
The road ahead is hard and
long, but without doubt it leads

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.500
to the ultimate knowledge
of the nature of life.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.530 position:56%
The artificial building or synthesis
of living things is a very remote,

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:20.470
but not an unattainable
goal along this road.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.280
So as we near mid-century
then the process

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.240
of conceptually distinguishing the
spontaneous generation of life,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.390
the question of a historical
origin of life,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.380
and efforts to produce
life artificially

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.880 position:56%
or synthetically is nearly distinct.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.300
The first one is entirely
out of court.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.990
The second one is of great
interest and current research.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.430
And the third is the eventual, but
still distant and deferred goal.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.470
By 1953, of course, we have the
famous Urey-Miller experiment we've

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.710
heard about several times, another
approach intended to give insights.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.480 position:56%
And just as Oparin had
acknowledged but ultimately deferred

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.480
to the synthetic goal, so Miller's
experiment was also reported

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.950
in the press as heralding,
though not yet bringing

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.150
about the eventual
artificial synthesis of life.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.670
And in the context of Herman
J. Mueller's [Assumed Spelling]

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.410
important studies on the gene
and virologists' work on viruses,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:07.160 position:56%
among others, genes and viruses were
increasingly seen as natural bridges

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.550
of sorts between the
living and the nonliving.

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.530
And at the same time
this increased study

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.490
of real living things became
increasingly connected to questions

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.300
of how one might engineer
such systems?

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.070
And so my point here is
that evolutionary novelty

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:24.310
and engineered novelty have
never been very far apart.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.640
While J.B.S. Haldane believed

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.480
that a self-contained organism
will not be made for centuries

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.420
and N.W. Pieri [Assumed Spelling]
had provided some pretty good

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.280
criticisms by mid-century
of any attempt

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.970
to produce life artificially,

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.740
by 1964 Oparin had become more
optimistic about the possibility.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.550
And by 1967 J.D. Barnaul
[Assumed Spelling] wrote

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:44.890 position:56%
if life once made itself it must not
be too difficult to make it again

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:48.100
and elsewhere, but the final proof
remains to be found and that is

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.860
by actually making what
we're talking about.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.140
Or as David Grinspoon has
said even more recently,

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.070
if we succeed in creating
life from scratch

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.800 position:56%
in the lab we may still not know how
it actually happened historically,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.550
but our belief that it did
happen will gain several notches

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.440
in credibility.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.880
So such efforts in the laboratory
may well give us insights

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.340
into how life has emerged in
other times and other places.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.450
So this brings us back then
to the world of astrobiology.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.400
Attempts to produce life
in the test tube have

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.880
for decades been closely
associated with the quest

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.900
to understand how life may
have emerged on the early earth

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.460
or in the universe, and
this was certainly the case

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.520
in the early years of exobiology.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.240
James Strick and Steven Dick
[Assumed Spelling] tell the story

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.890
of an exobiologist entering the new
lab at NASA Ames and being, quote,

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.230 position:56%
a bit horrified to find when I first
got there a secretary answering the

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.950
telephone with, Life Synthesis.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:41.530
[laughter] So from this I want to
suggest that the history of claims

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:46.010
for the production of life in
vetro and its discovery in astro,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.990
both the engineering of new life
forms and the potential discovery

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:52.430
of new life forms elsewhere in
the universe share common futures.

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.650
And it might be useful to think
through the history of the one

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.350
in order to help understand
our position in the other.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.790
I want to suggest that
it's not simply a matter

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.080
of finding another instance of
life, so that our understanding

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.450
of biology is not parochial as
the early exobiologists had hoped

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:08.450
and many of us still do,
but also of understanding

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.290
that the constant deferral
of our hopes

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:14.710
to have definitively located
signs of life elsewhere is a sign

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.100
of the success of our approach.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.470
When Burke created radiobes
in the test tube the idea

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.390
of having created cell-like
forms that grew

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.080
and subdivided was later discounted

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.590
because then we thought proteins
were more fundamental to life

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.830
than just cell-like forms.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.700 position:56%
Then proteins weren't central enough
for our explanations and we began

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.820
to focus on gene centered
theories for the emergence of life.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.430
After Arthur Kornberg's
synthesis of DNA

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.230
in the 1960s not even
the laboratory synthesis

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.460
of the hereditary material
was sufficient to hold

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.540
for long the claim that life had
just been or would soon be produced

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.250
in the test tube, although
many journalists tried.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.500
As we get evermore knowledgeable
about how nature has evolved

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.430
and even as we become
evermore accomplished

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:56.100
at engineering biological systems
to obtain outcomes not seen before

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:00.570 position:56%
in nature what we understand to be
central or fundamental or sufficient

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.140
to our understanding of life
continues to shift, as it should.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.540
We've never been able to reach
that moment where we produce life

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.700
in the test tube because we keep
on improving our understanding of

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.370
and our ability to
manipulate living systems,

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:14.450
whether natural or designed.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:18.180
That's a feature, not a bug.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.190
This history of ever
constant deferral

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.770
that we might someday be able to
produce life in the test tube,

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.080
but can only produce
N minus 1 right now,

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.490
or that we might someday be able
to find life beyond the earth,

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:31.160
but we have only our one
local case right now,

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.000
reminds me of the Philosopher
Kant's brilliant description

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.180
of a flamenco dance -
the sudden transformation

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.750
of a strained expectation
into nothing.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.470
[laughter] Why is it that what
seems most interesting is always

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.360 position:56%
at the horizon of our understanding?

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.300 position:56%
It's a consistent feature of our
efforts to understand the conditions

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.100
for the emergence and the evolution
of life in the universe and it's

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.890
that very process of resolution,
of deciding what counts

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:59.540
as relevant evidence or proof,
of shifting the burden of proof,

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:03.160
of deciding what approaches to
characterizing life we want to use,

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.200
that's actually at the
heart of what origins

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.130
of life investigators
have long done,

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.940
of what many astrobiologists today
do and what we do when we gather

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.470
at meetings like this
to refine our thinking.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.930
So what might it mean
to use this history

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.780
that I briefly discussed
here as a tool to think

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.550
through our current
situation in astrobiology?

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.680
If claims for the synthesis
of life in vetro has

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.610
or have these constant features

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.780
of constant deferral how might this
better inform our understanding

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.540
of what we're doing when
we look for life in astro?

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.550
And so here's what I'll suggest, it
might challenge any easy assumption

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.260
that in our quest to understand
the history of life on earth

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.350
and in the universe that we will
reach clear unambiguous answers,

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.850
that the silicon giraffe will walk
in front of the Viking camera,

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:50.030
that the life detection experiments
will give us a clear signal,

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.130
that we'll find nano bacteria
in these Antarctic meteorites

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.900
from Mars, that we'll be able
to confirm a bio signature.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.030
It will challenge the idea that
we should think of the search

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.250
for life beyond the earth
in the future perfect.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.330
Now we might find silicon
giraffes, but we might not, right?

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.570
What would it look like if we
had a different development

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.260
of our science?

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.920
So rather than hoping for a
parallel aha moment of discovery,

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.790
which would be akin to
creating life in the test tube,

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:18.910
we can acknowledge a more
complicated and a gradual building

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.210
of knowledge and capacity
that over the course

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.830
of time fundamentally transforms
what it means to find life.

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.400
Maybe we'll find more radiobes
before we find microbes.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.660
The fact that we haven't found life
in other elsewhere's so far then

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.510
and to use Nathaniel's wording here
then, isn't a flaw but a virtue

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.590
of our ongoing efforts to produce
and to refine our knowledge

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.740
in this compelling area of inquiry.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:46.110
After all, isn't the history of
recent biology and astrobiology

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:48.410
in many important respects
the history of the expansion

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.510
of our understanding of life, of
the conditions for its emergence

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.900
and evolution and where
else we might find it?

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.910 position:56%
And I certainly don't need to
remind this audience of our studies,

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:59.390
of extremophiles, of hot
springs, of deep-see vents,

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:01.990
of finding amino acids
in space, of our shifting

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.470
from a habitable zone idea
defined by a planet's distance

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.860
from the star, to envisioning
the ways

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.060
in which more localized
gravitational processes may provide

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.140
other sources of energy,
which might expand

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.010
where we would think
to look for life.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.120
Ocean worlds, as we
heard about this morning,

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.360 position:56%
or our many proposed theories for
the emergence of life from ribozymes

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:22.550
and RNA worlds, bird-like dinosaurs
and even more provocative claims

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:26.400
that we may be thermodynamically
downhill from an abiotic world.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.190
The history of astrobiology
is already one

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:31.390
of the most remarkable stories
of scientific achievement,

00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:34.720 position:56%
but using other histories of
biology might help give us a new way

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.980
to think about our studies of life
here on earth and in the universe

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.070
as we search for these new
natures, both ones that we invent

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.760
and ones that we discover.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.020
And, indeed, both today's
synthetic biology

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.260
and astro biology are
fields deeply concerned

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.360
with developing a comprehensive
understanding of the full potential

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.970
of living systems, with
understanding life as it could be,

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:57.280
and that's as true today
as it was a century ago.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.080
Thank you.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:07.830
[ Applause ]

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:09.780
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: Thank you, Luis.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:14.830
Our final speaker for this
session will be Sophia Roosth.

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.930
She is the Frederick S.
Danziger Associate Professor

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:22.330
in the Department of the
History of Sciences at Harvard.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:27.670
She is an Author of
a number of articles,

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.450
and her first book is going
to be forthcoming called,

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:33.220
Synthetic, How Life Got Made.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.850
And her talk today is
entitled, Analysis Synthesis.

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:40.150
Sophia?

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.500
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Good afternoon.

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:53.970
Bear with me while I get
my technology in order.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.980
Historians and Ecclesiastes
be damned.

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.380
In the first decades of the 21st
Century a number of things are,

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.340
indeed, new under the sun.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:33.610
Living things bearing genomes
paired down, streamlined

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:37.280
or cobbled together from bits
of synthesized DNA scurry,

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.260
swim and flourish in test
tubes and glass bioreactors.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.530
These include creatures as
unlikely as viruses named

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.960
for computer software, bacteria
encoding passages of James Joyce,

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.720
and klymeric [Assumed
Spelling] yeast buckling

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.760
under the combined metabolic strain
of genes harvested from wormwood,

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.720
petunias and Icelandic microbes.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.990
My forthcoming book,
Synthetic, How Life Got Made,

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:07.950
is an anthropological account
of synthetic biologists,

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:13.130
a group of researchers who
manufacture these novel organisms.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.430
Now this new breed

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:16.770
of life scientists has
received much press attention.

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:21.210
I think some of these passages
are actually from Carl.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:25.660
And they assembled in the last
years of the 20th Century.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.840
Researchers from computer
science and mechanical, electrical

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.560
and chemical engineering
together resolved that if the aim

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.440
of biology was to understand how
life works then manufacturing life

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.210
would yield better theories
than would experimentation.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:51.420
They advocated not experiment,
but manufacture, not reduction,

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.240
but construction, not
analysis, but synthesis.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.890
New biotechnology techniques,
notably faster

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.950
and cheaper DNA sequencing

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:06.460
and synthesis have aided
them in these efforts.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.930
In addition to techniques
and practices borrowed

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:12.980
from their home disciplines, they
carried with them a rich trove

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.690
of analogies and metaphors
that directed their thinking

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:19.370
about how to manufacture life.

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:22.990
So life as code or
computational logic aids,

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:27.180
if you ask computer scientists,
or circuits if you talk

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.470
to an electrical engineer,
perhaps as a chemical factory

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:34.190
for those coming from
chemical engineering.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:39.410
Since I began my research synthetic
biology has grown considerably.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:44.190
Its laboratories now spread across
the United States, the UK, Germany

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:47.010
and the Netherlands,
and at last count

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:52.330
over 174 American laboratories
report currently conducting

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:55.340
synthetic biology research.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.380
Between 2005 and 2010
when I was doing the brunt

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.830
of my research synthetic
biological research was funded

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:08.000
by over $430 million dispersed by
the US Federal Government alone,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.190
so that's not including
funding from other countries

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.540
or from private organizations.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.770
So, like I said, I've been
studying this community since 2005

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:23.200
and in doing so I've participated
and observed as people, like this,

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.260
these are some of my primary
informants from Gingko Bio Labs,

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.900
worked in labs, such as this one,

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.170
this is the ND Laboratory [Assumed
Spelling], to engineer new forms

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:37.660
of life in the laboratory.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:43.450
But to what end do they fashion
such a fantastical bestiary?

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:47.250
Coaxing new creatures into
recombinant life, I argue,

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:52.920 position:56%
is a way for life scientists to make
a persuasive argument about life.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.210
In short, synthesis
now advances analysis.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.790 position:56%
To understand their ambitions I want

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:05.360
to first offer a much abridged
history of 20th Century biology,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.780
some of which you've already
heard today, but I want to do this

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.310
in order to explain precisely
what synthetic biology is not.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:16.040
Since the advent of biology as a
professional discipline at the end

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.220 position:56%
of the 19th Century life science has
for the most part been experimental,

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:28.980
but as biologists took organisms
apart, flaying flesh from limb,

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.110
in order to understand their
structure and function beginning

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:40.400 position:56%
in the 1930s life science came
under the sway of molecular biology.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.700
Which in investigating the
four organic molecules common

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.870
to all living things, that
is proteins, nucleic acids,

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.630
lipids and carbohydrates, stressed

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:54.060
above all the unity
of all life on earth.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.000 position:56%
By the start of the Cold War Jacques
Monois' [Assumed Spelling] notorious

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.920
announcement that anything found to
be true of E.coli must also be true

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.650
of elephants had sunk into a
kind of generalized common sense.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:11.440
So what I'm trying to
suggest here is that for most

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.910
of 20th Century biology this has
been a project of experimentalism

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.550
that thinks of life as
something primarily mechanical

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.240
and most importantly unitary.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.110
Life for these molecular biologists
was coherent, it was uniform,

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:28.850
it was even at times simple
and its essence was reduceable

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.550
to a genetic command line.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.120
Life for synthetic biologists still
remains thoroughly materialist,

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.960
molecular and reductionist.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.390
That being said, their approach
to studying life departs radically

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:47.830
from their predecessors
in molecular biology.

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.310
Take, for example, this
following definition

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.540
that two synthetic biologists gave

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.570
to their nascent field
in the pages of Nature.

01:04:56.570 --> 01:05:00.670
They write, synthetic biologists
seek to assemble components

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:03.610
that are not natural,
therefore, synthetic,

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.090
to generate chemical systems

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:09.310
that support Darwinian
evolution, therefore, biological.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:11.960
By carrying out the assembly
in a synthetic way we hope

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.700
to understand non-synthetic,
that is natural biology.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:25.120
So here creating with understanding
and synthesis with analysis,

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:30.410
it is clear that making life for
these researchers is not an end

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:35.600
in itself, but rather a technique
for plumbing life's limits.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.300
It is also, as this
quotation suggests,

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.260
a way of querying seemingly
common sense terms, like natural

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.680
and unnatural, biological
and synthetic.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.960
And here I hope you can
hear the scare quotes

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.770
that I'm placing around
the word natural.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:57.780
So I'll now hone in on a project
that MIT bioengineers launched

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:03.950 position:56%
in the very first years of the 21st
Century, the so-called T7.1 project.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:07.900
The protagonists of this story is
the minimal bacteriophage virus,

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:14.580
a creature so small that it is
arguably only marginally alive,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.040
bearing a slim genome.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:21.290
In 1983 T7 became one of the first
living things to be sequenced

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:25.800
as it weighed in at fewer
than 40,000 base pairs.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.000
Biologists have described
such infectious agents as,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.790
and these are quotes from
recent articles - pseudo living

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:37.550
or as existing on the
very edge of life.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:40.100 position:56%
And in the image that you're looking

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.220
at the T7 phage is what's
surrounding that large thing,

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.770
the very big spheres of bacterium.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:51.370
My story begins in the mid-1990s.

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:54.540
A scruffy Dartmouth grad
student named Drew Endy,

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.010
a former Amtrak employee,
trained in mechanical engineering,

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:00.990
had recently decided to
apply his engineering skills

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:03.180
to living creatures.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.310
Twenty years later Endy
would become a larger

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.300
than life charismatic
promoter of synthetic biology,

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.630
but where I begin he was merely a
frustrated grad student facing an

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.740
intractable problem.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.950
His goal was to build
a software simulation

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:21.370
that would predict the behavior of
the T7 virus, which was a workhorse

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:24.870
of molecular biology and
genetics and continues to be one

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.650
of the most comprehensively
understood tools

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:30.720
of biological experimentation.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.660
Building such a computational model

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.850
on his reasoning should effectively
verify the sum total of all

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.840
of the data that molecular
biologists had gathered

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.500
about bacteriophage since it had
first entered research laboratories

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.800
in the mid-1940s.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.780
So the idea is that this predictive
model is going to encompass all

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.770
that we experimentally
know about the virus.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.030 position:56%
And all Endy needed to do was
computationally model the two things

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.620
that this virus can do.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:06.090 position:56%
And if you look at this image behind
me it diagrams what those two phases

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:10.440
are, that is once a bacteriophage
infects a bacterium it can either

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.430
remain burrowed within the
bacterium's genetic material

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:15.240
which is what you see in
the upper right-hand corner,

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.340
this is a phase called lisogeny,
or it can replicate itself,

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.330
burst through the cell's walls
and infect more bacteria,

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:27.380
and you see that on the left-hand
corner, this is called lysis.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.040
Endy's computational model was,
however, an abject failure.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.880
It was incapable of predicting
this very simple behavior of T7.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:41.260 position:56%
The problem haunted Endy and he took
a post doc to learn more biology.

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.520
Endy later recalled in a series
of lectures for MIT's Department

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.330 position:56%
of Bioengineering, which I attended,
that those years were, as he put it,

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:52.730
pretty depressing to me because
now I'm coming back to this problem

01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:55.870
where I want to understand how
this thing works and I want

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.810
to understand how this
thing works when I shuffle

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:01.690
up all the genetic elements.

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:05.250
And if I've got 72 elements and
I've got 72 factorial permutations,

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:09.110
more than the number of protons
in the universe probably,

01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:11.490
and so it's not clear if I can
build-out a computer model that's

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:14.840
going to let me explore this,
that I'm ever going to be able

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.120
to get traction on this problem.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.860
Simmering down his question
to its essence, Endy snapped,

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.100
what's wrong with the T7 genome?

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.710
Now I'd like to pause
here and marvel

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:34.020
at what bizarre question this
is for a biologist to ask.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.410
What sort of question is it?

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:39.830
Is it an anthological question, is
it a normative one, is it ethical?

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:45.120
Wrong to whom or wrong
by what metric?

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.510
Here is precisely where
the engineer's penchant

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:51.540
for synthesis meets
biological analysis.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:56.480
By his logic his own failure was
nothing less than a failure of all

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.050
of experimental discovery
based biology.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.700
All the knowledge that had
been painstakingly gathered

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.900 position:56%
by classical geneticists,
molecular biologists and virologists

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.440
over the course of 60 years of
laboratory experimentation was

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.330
to him simply not enough to
predict the behavior of an organism

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:20.490
so simple that it's arguably
only marginally alive.

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.640
Endy's proclamation that
T7 was wrong meant for him

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.460
that the virus was
disorganized, that it was cluttered

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:31.680
with genetic junk, and we already
heard about junk DNA earlier today.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.000
It resisted his best efforts to
simulate, model or understand it.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.210
So, in short, it was badly designed
and so he set about redesigning it.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:45.330
Upon his arrival at MIT Endy
tasked two of his grad students

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:49.030
with rebuilding the genetic
material of the virus, itself,

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:52.740
in hopes of manufacturing a virus
simple enough that it might accord

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.430
with computational models.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:56.090
And I want to make sure
everyone gets this,

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.020
so I'm going to repeat it.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.410
The computational simulation
didn't work,

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:05.440
so instead of scrapping the model
they're going to modify the virus,

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.360
itself, to accord with the model.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.850 position:56%
The very fact that these researchers
choose to rebuild the physical virus

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:17.320
to conform to a model and not
vice-versa suggests the lack

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.550
of a coherent and meaningful
substrate

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:22.360 position:56%
for this kind of biological inquiry.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.440
Unable to understand how a living
thing works they remade it in order

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.860
to make it easier to understand.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.190
Engineered organisms,
as we will see,

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.330
now function as proofs of concept.

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.600
Demonstrations of accumulated
biological knowledge,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.170
as well as science about what about
life remains to be discovered.

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:48.950
The logic goes like this, the best
way to prove a biological theory

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:51.870
or learn more about
how life works is

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:55.040
to build a new organism
from scratch.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.680
So if I were to put this in
Aristotelian terms of logical proof

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.310
such thinking is neither deductive
nor inductive or if you're going

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.030
to follow semiotician Charles
Sanders Persse [Assumed Spelling],

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:08.050
it's not even abductive,
rather this is a logical proof

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:10.990
that is being forward
constructively.

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:15.880
But back at MIT in 2002 this
task fell to two grad students.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.850
The first was Shiram
Kasseri [Assumed Spelling],

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:19.580
a new doctoral student
in bioengineering

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.070
who had just done a degree
in biology from Berkeley,

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.710
and Leon Chan [Assumed Spelling],
who was a senior graduate student

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:27.950
in MIT's Department of Biology.

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:36.570
And what happened was this, armed
with new biotechnology techniques,

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.700
like faster and cheaper DNA
sequencing and synthesis,

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.470
they set about redesigning
the viral genome.

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:45.520 position:56%
Their first step, and you don't have
to understand what's happening here,

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.830
I'll walk you through it, the first
step was to take the entire genome

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:51.340
and separate overlapping
elements from one another.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.550
The idea was that these
overlapping elements would code

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.480
for separate proteins and that
these genes should be able

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.520
to be manipulated independently
of one another.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.820
The reasoning is

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.850
that a well-designed
genome should be modular.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:06.150
And once they had separated

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.040
out those overlapping
elements they began

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.050
to successively delete those genes
that had no known function in order

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:16.760
to generate a virus that would
bear what they considered

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.270
to be only the minimal number
of genes necessary for life.

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:26.470
So, to clarify, there are 60
genes in bacteriophage T7,

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:30.500
35 as of right now have a known
function, and they decided

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.390
to cut the remaining
25 to see what happens.

01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:38.250
In their published paper
Kasseri and Chan posed a question

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:43.060
to their readers, they said should
we also expect that the design

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.970
of an evolved organism would be
further optimized for the purposes

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:49.430
of human understanding
and interaction?

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:53.800
This virus obviously predates
humans by a long shot.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.960
So should it be optimized
for human understanding?

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.760
Evidence drawn from fields
outside biology suggests

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.770
that the answer is no.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:05.390
After hearing numerous synthetic
biologists pose this same question,

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:08.870
I began to ruminate on
what life has become

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:12.730
when it is something
amenable to rational design.

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.530
What sort of rhetorical
possibilities are conditioned

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:20.020
by this application
of design to life?

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.500
By 2005 MIT grad students had, and
here I'm borrowing the terminology

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:30.070
of computer scientists, refactored
and rebooted the T7.1 virus,

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:34.870
which they named T7.1
following software nomenclature.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.550
So follow me now into their
laboratory to peer at this sort

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:42.680
of unlikely creature they
had brought into existence.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.590
So here you see four Petrie dishes.

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:50.240
On the left is an unengineered,
that is a wild type of virus

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.350
and it's flourishing in
the bacterial culture.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:56.310
On the right you see the
engineered T7.1 virus,

01:14:56.310 --> 01:15:00.430
which has infected the same
kind of bacterial culture.

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.790
Notice that the bacterial plaques
bearing the reengineered virus are

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.210
puny and sparse.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.680
Simply put, T7.1 is much worse than
its naturally occurring predecessor

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.720
at doing precisely what these
viruses have evolved to do,

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.240 position:56%
which is infect bacteria, replicate
itself, burst open the host, repeat.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.750
If natural selection is the
gradual modification of an organism

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:26.350 position:56%
to be better suited to its
environment then what is good design

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:30.490
if better genomes make
worse viruses?

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:32.960
Before I could ask my
interlock heeders this question,

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.750
they asked me.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.080
A few months after the
bacterial plaques had been grown

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.290
in the lab I went out for
dinner with Endy and some

01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:43.080 position:56%
of his grad students at a restaurant
just off of the MIT campus.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.110
And as plates of appetizers
were cleared away

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:48.250
and the wine glasses were refilled
Endy asked me this question,

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:52.170
which I had myself been pondering
- he said is there an environment

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:56.010
that would naturally
give rise to T7.1?

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:59.500
This question was a provocation
and a test, he was tangling

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.100
with questions of nature and
artifice and evolution and design.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.780 position:56%
And I paused for a moment to think
about it before replying, well, yes,

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.300 position:56%
it's called a synthetic biology lab.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.440
And Endy laughed approvingly
and he says, great,

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.150 position:56%
that's exactly what I say when
people pose the same question to me.

01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:17.910
And he continued and he
says, so in nature, right,

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.680
the wild type one is totally going
to rock - this is a direct quote -

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.680
whereas, in my lab this
one is going to survive,

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.900 position:56%
meaning this engineered one, but the
other one isn't going to survive.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:33.490
So by synthetic biologist's logic
biological fitness is defined not

01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:37.850
by adaptability but
by comprehensibility.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.030
Synthetic biologists as engineers
bending design principles

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:45.840
to living form build living systems

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.160
that are more suited
to human understanding.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.810
As biological making converges with
biological knowing or if you want

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.540
to use $10 words, as techni
[Assumed Spelling] joins episteme,

01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:00.850 position:56%
a well-designed organism is one that
is optimized for human understanding

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:04.060
and most evolved organisms
just don't pass

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.950
that comprehensibility test.

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:11.030
The rational for such thinking I
believe is the circularity built

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:16.140
into this merging of making and
knowing, that is composition

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.290
for synthetic biologists
furthers biological understanding,

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:24.670
but sometimes composition is
also guided by understanding

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.370
as itself a design principle.

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:32.800
So to clarify that many synthetic
biologists, quote Richard Feynman,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.510
a famous physicist who wrote on
his Cal Tech chalkboard the day

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:40.200
of his death, and you
can see the quote right

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.560
in the upper left-hand corner.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:48.280
He said what I cannot
create I do not understand.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.220
But in the case of T7.1 a more
accurate pronouncement would be I

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:58.580
only create what I can understand.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.670
But otherwise when making new
biological things becomes the path

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:05.240 position:56%
by which biology is best understood,

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.940
then understandable biological
things get preferentially made.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:14.880
Exegeses becomes its
own evolutionary force.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.710
The unlikely lives borne by
synthetic biologists grow

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:20.740
and mutate, metabolize
and divide and synapse,

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:25.100
yet they also speak eloquently of
nature and artifice, of analysis

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.850
and synthesis, of theories
of life and their limits.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:33.950
And, so to close, I want to expand
outward from this case to speak

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:37.360
to synthetic biology more broadly.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.110
This approach to knowing life

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:43.050
by remaking it inhabits a
different sort of epistemic space

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.330
than the other methods
typical of the life sciences,

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:50.910
namely and as I said earlier
it's not deductive or inductive,

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.700
it is at times indebted to things
like collection, classification

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.320
and experimentalism, which
are the traditional methods

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.620
of the life sciences.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.550
But it does not neatly
align with the kind

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:05.490
of practically driven design and
manufacturer that one associates,

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:09.890
for example, with the biotech
industry or with pharmaceuticals.

01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:14.100
Rather, it's something in
between, it is interested making,

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.040
by which I mean making
with a question attached,

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.700
it is a way of theorizing
the biological.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.680 position:56%
The objects of this manufacture
incarnate and exemplify answers even

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.660
as they point toward as
yet unasked questions.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.300
And, in fact, I would further posit

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:38.200
that such active interested making
is not limited to T7 or even

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.080
to synthetic biology, but
rather is endemic to the natural

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.820
and social sciences of our moment.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.510
Thank you.

01:19:47.510 --> 01:20:01.040

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.020
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: Well,
thank you, Sophia.

have gone way over schedule,

and so the plan is we're
going to break for lunch now.
