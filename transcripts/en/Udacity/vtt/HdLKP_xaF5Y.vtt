00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.230
Your red blood cells are the life givers. They

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.500
carry oxygen to all the nooks and crannies of

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.320
your body in exchange of the waste product carbon

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.500
dioxide. Now hemoglobin is the actual protein molecule responsible

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.270
for directly binding the oxygen inside your red blood

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.750
cells. And if we exclude water, hemoglobin makes up

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.300
over 95% of all the cellular protein inside red

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.530
blood cells. Now hemoglobin itself is actually a superstructure

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.150
of multiple proteins. And mutations in any

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.580
one of the individual protein sub-units has the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.920
potential to cause serious problems. Affecting one of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.050
the most fundamental processes necessary for survival. The

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.860
supply of oxygen. One of the most important

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.880
proteins, hemoglobin beta is encoded by the HBB

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.946
gene. Now in humans, HBB can be found

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:51.860
on the 11th chromosome in the human genome.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.810
Now, chromosome 11 is about 134 million base

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.460
pairs long and the HBB gene can be found

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.570
somewhere close to the end of it. Now the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.019
HBB gene itself consists of three exons spanning 1,700

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.468
base pairs of DNA. This is actually kind

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:09.170
of small in comparison with some of the other

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.650
genes we've looked at. After transcription and splicing, the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.880
resulting mRNA has 444 nucleotides of coding region between

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.630
the start and stop codons. And after translation, we

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.740
get a protein with 147 amino acids. Remember we

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.520
just divided 444 by 3, the number of nucleotides

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240
in a codon. And then subtracted that number by

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.660
1 to get 147 because the last stop codon

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.218
doesn't have an amino acid, it's just empty. Now

00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:38.714
as you can imagine this HBB protein, haemoglobin beta

00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:42.134
is pretty important and so that any changes could have

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:45.098
a drastic effect on the overall function of the

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:48.620
protein. There was one quite famous allele of the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.330
HBB gene that ultimately changes the structure of hemoglobin

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.930
and the red blood cell, thus causing sickle cell anemia.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.579
Now this particular allele contains an A to T

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.197
mutation, an adenine to thymine mutation, at position 20 of

00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:09.030
the coding region. So using the genetic code that we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360
learned about in lesson three and which you can find

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.690
in the instructor's notes on this page. I want

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.980
you to determine the change in the expected amino acid

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.850
sequence from the adenine to the thymine position, and then

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.530
select the type of mutation that's best used to describe

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.500
the T-allele from the list here. If you have

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.657
any trouble answering this, just review mutations from lesson six.
