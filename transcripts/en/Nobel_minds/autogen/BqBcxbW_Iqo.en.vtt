of the electrical and electronics

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240
of the electrical and electronics
 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.390
of the electrical and electronics
engineers magnetics community the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
engineers magnetics community the
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000

question is will spin transfer torque

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
question is will spin transfer torque
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160
question is will spin transfer torque
research be awarded a nobel prize in the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
research be awarded a nobel prize in the
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.879

future a spinto sweat dog this fear of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
future a spinto sweat dog this fear of
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.060
future a spinto sweat dog this fear of
his sir she is very active today and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
his sir she is very active today and
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.240
his sir she is very active today and
very exciting ok you can do many things

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
very exciting ok you can do many things
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.390
very exciting ok you can do many things
with spin transfer you can switch the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
with spin transfer you can switch the
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.060
with spin transfer you can switch the
magnetization of a magnet with

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
magnetization of a magnet with
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070
magnetization of a magnet with
electrical currents these will be used

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
electrical currents these will be used
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.910
electrical currents these will be used
for example in the next generation of em

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
for example in the next generation of em
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.530
for example in the next generation of em
ha the STT spin prosthetic arms and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540
ha the STT spin prosthetic arms and
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.139
ha the STT spin prosthetic arms and
certainly this will have a strong impact

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
certainly this will have a strong impact
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.410
certainly this will have a strong impact
on in electronics this can be used also

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
on in electronics this can be used also
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.900
on in electronics this can be used also
to generate oscillation in the high

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910
to generate oscillation in the high
 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.770
to generate oscillation in the high
frequency hinge certainly with many

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
frequency hinge certainly with many
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.660
frequency hinge certainly with many
applications in telecommunications so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
applications in telecommunications so
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760
applications in telecommunications so
this is a very exciting field we in this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
this is a very exciting field we in this
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889
this is a very exciting field we in this
laboratory are working a lot in this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
laboratory are working a lot in this
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.130
laboratory are working a lot in this
field in particular on generation of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
field in particular on generation of
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.789
field in particular on generation of
microwaves so for a Nobel Prize I don't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
microwaves so for a Nobel Prize I don't
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160
microwaves so for a Nobel Prize I don't
know I don't know maybe it's a little

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
know I don't know maybe it's a little
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800
know I don't know maybe it's a little
too close from the beginning of the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
too close from the beginning of the
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.530
too close from the beginning of the
spintronics that is from GMO and GMO and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
spintronics that is from GMO and GMO and
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.260
spintronics that is from GMO and GMO and
so but it would be great if a Nobel

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
so but it would be great if a Nobel
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.200
so but it would be great if a Nobel
Prize is given for this the ocean of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
Prize is given for this the ocean of
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.659
Prize is given for this the ocean of
inertia
