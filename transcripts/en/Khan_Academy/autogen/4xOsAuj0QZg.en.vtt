00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:02.512
 In the video about competitive inhibition 

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:06.189
 we saw the basic idea of ​​having a substrate 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.135
 or a potential substrate and inhibitor that compete 

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.259
 for the enzyme. 

00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:12.880
 Who gets first gets the enzyme. 

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.080
 If the inhibitor reaches first, 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.397
 the substrate can not be connected 

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:19.814
 and the reaction can not be catalyzed. 

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.110
 If the substrate gets first, 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.142
 the inhibitor can not connect 

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:27.108
 and the reaction is catalyzed. 

00:00:27.108 --> 00:00:28.612
 Both the inhibitor and the substrate 

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.761
 can compete for the active center, 

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.508
 when talking about competitive inhibition. 

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.454
 In allosteric competitive inhibition 

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.587
 there is again competition for the enzyme, 

00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:40.761
 the molecule that gets first gets the enzyme. 

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.240
 But the inhibitor does not bind 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.714
 with the active center, but with an allosteric center. 

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:48.136
 However, the idea is the same. 

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.026
 If the inhibitor reaches the allosteric center 

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:52.992
 before the substrate reaches the active center, 

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.247
 the conformation of the protein changes, 

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:57.909
 the active center also changes slightly. 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.013
 I will draw it in the same color. 

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:03.902
 The conformation of the protein is changing 

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:08.760
 and then the substrate can not connect to the active center. 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.791
 If the substrate is bonded, 

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.803
 this slightly changes the conformation 

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:15.302
 of the allosteric center and then the inhibitor 

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:16.765
 can not connect. 

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:18.573
 In competitive inhibition 

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:20.787
 the substrate and the inhibitor fight for the enzyme. 

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:23.652
 And what happens to uncompetitive hiring? 

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:25.365
 I will draw it. 

00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:28.148
 In uncompetitive inhibition - 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.300
 In uncompetitive inhibition - 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.134
 The main idea with it is, 

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.531
 that both the substrate and the inhibitor can bind. 

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.213
 Whether one molecule is connected does not affect it 

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:45.838
 of the other. 

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.450
 Let's talk about uncompetitive inhibition a little bit more. 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.497
 This is our enzyme. 

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.453
 Right here. 

00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:57.622
 The subtratum 

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:01.868
 reaches the active center, 

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.794
 after which the reaction will be catalysed. 

00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:07.354
 We saw this case here above. 

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.853
 The substrate binds to the active site 

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.560
 and the reaction is catalyzed, 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.429
 in this case the substrate is separated 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.334
 of two molecules. 

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.345
 Incompetitive inhibition 

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:20.499
 the substrate can be connected, 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.831
 but an inhibitor can also be linked. 

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.980
 The inhibitor may be linked to the allosteric center, 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.272
 so this is our inhibitor here. 

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:32.994
 The inhibitor may be linked to the allosteric center. 

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:34.335
 When both the inhaler and the substrate are connected, 

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:36.773
 they do not compete for the enzyme. 

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:38.276
 Both molecules may be linked to the enzyme at the same time. 

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:41.324
 This can be associated with the enzyme, regardless of whether it is 

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.092
 the substrate is bound or not. 

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:44.900
 If this molecule is linked to the enzyme, 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.871
 the substrate will also be able to connect, 

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.634
 but the reaction will not go away. 

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.884
 So now the reaction will look like this: 

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:57.253
 there will be no reaction. 

00:02:57.253 --> 00:03:01.478
 If this happens, the only option is for both molecules to detach from the enzyme. 

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.018
 This molecule will leave 

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.420
 active center. 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.687
 The reaction is not catalysed. 

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.734
 It's prevented. 

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.188
 Maybe this molecule also leaves. 

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:18.484
 The way I showed uncompetitive inhibition 

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:20.455
 is through an allosteric center, 

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:23.766
 the inhibitor binds to an allosteric center. 

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.717
 But it is not always necessary for uncompetitive inhibition to look like this. 

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.464
 - 

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:31.649
 Connection may occur near or in the active center, 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.579
 as long as it does not interfere with the substrate 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.245
 to connect to the active center. 

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:38.055
 We may also have the following situation, 

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:45.091
 which is often given as an example 

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.001
 for non-competitive inhibition. 

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.972
 We have an inhibitor that binds to the allosteric center, 

00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:51.674
 but the idea is that both the inhibitor and the substrate 

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:53.949
 can be linked to the enzyme. 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.392
 If one of them connects first, 

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:56.773
 the other can still connect. 

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:59.496
 If the substrate binds first, 

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:01.975
 the inhibitor can still be linked to the enzyme. 

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.376
 If the inhibitor binds first, 

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.063
 the substrate can still be connected. 

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:10.063
 But the reaction will not be catalysed. 

00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:14.734
 We can also have a situation, 

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.598
 wherein the inhibitor and the substrate 

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:21.093
 are bound in or around the active site. 

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:25.603
 This is the inhibitor, and this is our substrate. 

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:27.411
 This is the substrate. 

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:30.500
 But in this case, the reaction will not go away. 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.060
 We have uncompetitive inhibition. 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.868
 They do not compete for the enzyme, 

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:37.184
 Both molecules are linked to the enzyme if one is linked 

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:39.012
 does not depend on whether the other has contacted. 

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.324
 If the inhibitor is connected, it will not allow 

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:46.286
 catalysing the reaction. 

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.013
 In contrast to competitive inhibition, in which 

00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:49.496
 the molecule that binds first with the enzyme, 

00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:51.446
 gets control over it. 

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:52.795
 I hope this video clarifies things.
