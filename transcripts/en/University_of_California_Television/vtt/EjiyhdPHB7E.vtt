00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:12.312
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.601
Bipedal.

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.810
Naked.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.977
Large-brained.

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.465
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.882
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.223
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:31.390
Yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.034
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:37.439
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:39.522
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.624
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:44.624
of the past.

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:50.150
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.317
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.930
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.013
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:38.066
- Darold Treffert could
not make it in person.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.233
But he did manage to videotape the talk.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.742
- [Narrator] The human brain
is the most mysterious piece

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:53.421
of matter on Earth.

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:54.845
And the more we know about it,

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.268
the more magical the
whole system seems to be.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.529
However, it is only now
in the 21st century,

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.784
with new techniques,

00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:04.839
that scientists can for the first time

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:06.947
open up the secret chambers in our heads

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:08.589
and watch the complex system

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.172
of hundreds of billions
of neurons at work.

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:16.773
Among scientists' most
fascinating subjects of study

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:19.246
are a small group of enigmatic talents,

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:21.481
the so-called savants.

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.301
The knowing ones.

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:26.713
Savants can multiply five-digit
numbers in their heads.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.712
Or know 12,000 books by heart.

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.368
Or play a melody on the piano
after hearing it only once.

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:34.744
Over half of savants are autistic.

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:36.693
Others develop these superhuman talents

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.885
only after a brain injury.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.628
Experts all over the
world are now starting

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.590
to ask themselves is it, in fact, a defect

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.030
that turns a person into a genius.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.530
Is there a hidden genius within all of us?

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:54.315
- Till we can understand the savant,

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:56.117
we can't understand ourselves.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:58.688
And no model of brain
function is gonna be complete

00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:00.023
until it can fully account

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:03.807
for this incredible disparity.

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:06.307
Hello from the Treffert Center

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.643
in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin,

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:10.226
a unit of Agnesian Healthcare,

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:13.175
dedicated to better
understanding the human brain

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:15.051
and human potential.

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:17.200
What I want to do today
is to share some things

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.480
that we do know about savant
syndrome 120 years later

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.113
after J. Langdon Down first
described savant syndrome.

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:27.983
Savant syndrome is a
remarkable condition in which

00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:31.581
persons with a developmental
disorder, including autism,

00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:34.394
or other central nervous
system disease or injury,

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:36.681
have some astonishing islands of genius

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:39.515
that stand in marked, jarring contrast

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.028
to overall handicap.

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:43.970
Savant syndrome occurs in
approximately one in 10 persons

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.643
with autism and in approximately
one in 1,400 persons

00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:49.891
with over developmental disabilities

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:52.783
or other central nervous system disorders.

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.298
Since these other developmental disability

00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:56.906
and central nervous system disorders

00:03:56.906 --> 00:03:58.651
are more uncommon than autism,

00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:03.044
it turns out that approximately
75% of savants are autistic

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:07.070
and 25% have other central
nervous system disabilities.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.502
Therefore, not all savants are autistic,

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:12.038
and not all autistic persons are savants.

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:14.143
Savant skills occur on a spectrum.

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:15.807
First are splinter skills.

00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:17.926
The second level are talented savants.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:20.279
And the third level
are prodigious savants.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.470
Prodigious savants are
persons whose skills

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.462
are so remarkable that they
are called prodigy or genius

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:29.506
if they were to occur in a
person without disability.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:32.269
Savant syndrome is always
associated with a massive memory,

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:34.445
a memory that is extraordinarily deep

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:36.414
but very narrow within its confines.

00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:39.820
Savant skills typically
increase and persist

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.942
rather than diminish or disappear.

00:04:41.942 --> 00:04:43.740
Savant abilities are not frivolous.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.028
Instead, they can act as a
conduit toward normalization

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:48.933
with an increase in language abilities,

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.588
social strengths, and daily living skills.

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:55.651
I met my first savant in 1962.

00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:57.400
Now, 55 years later,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.457
it's rather hard to
summarize in 18 minutes

00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:03.268
my journey with savants.

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.171
So what I want to do
instead is to concentrate

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.304
on the savant I know best,

00:05:08.304 --> 00:05:10.218
who is Leslie Lemke, who demonstrates

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:14.292
many of the characteristics
of savant syndrome.

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:16.489
I have known Leslie Lemke for 30 years.

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.765
He is a prodigious musical savant.

00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:21.554
Like all savants, he knows
things he never learned.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.105
He instinctively knows the rules of music,

00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:26.024
put there by genetic memory.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:27.098
Genetic memory,

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:30.073
which congenital acquired
savants demonstrate,

00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:32.457
is the genetic transmission of knowledge,

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.713
equals nature,

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:36.264
and it can be expanded by learning,

00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:37.972
which equals nurture.

00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:42.139
("Hello, Dolly," playing
piano and singing)

00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:46.539
- [Narrator] It's hard to
say what's more striking

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.965
about Leslie Lemke,

00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:52.132
his skills as a pianist
or his amazing life story.

00:05:54.558 --> 00:05:56.624
Leslie was born with cerebral palsy

00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.809
and a rare disease that
necessitated the removal of his eyes

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.026
when he was only a few months old.

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.564
Many might pity, but who
could handle the challenge

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:08.137
of raising such a child?

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:11.502
May and Joe Lemke of
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, did.

00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:15.180
They adopted Leslie when
he was just six months old.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.035
Using patience and love
as their inspiration,

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:19.547
May and Joe worked with Leslie,

00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:22.403
attempting to achieve not the miraculous,

00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:24.468
but the mundane.

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:26.388
Function such as walking, swallowing,

00:06:26.388 --> 00:06:27.979
and eventually swimming

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.062
all took effort and endless practice.

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:35.723
It seemed the only way Leslie
would ever even approach

00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:38.962
a normal life would be through a miracle.

00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:42.936
Late at night one evening,
a miracle did occur.

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:44.755
- When he was about 14 years old,

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:46.763
they watched a Sunday night movie,

00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:48.716
which happened to be Sincerely Yours,

00:06:48.716 --> 00:06:50.437
and the theme song is
Liberace's theme song,

00:06:50.437 --> 00:06:53.915
which is Tchaikovsky's
First Piano Concerto.

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:56.552
They watched and Leslie
listened, 'cause he's blind.

00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:58.253
And they went to bed.

00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:01.076
And then about two or
three in the morning,

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.272
May woke and heard some music coming.

00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:04.938
And she asked Joe,

00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:07.513
hubby, did you leave the television on?

00:07:07.513 --> 00:07:09.358
No, so, she went, and there was Leslie

00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:11.952
playing Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto

00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:14.815
from beginning to end
having heard it one time.

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:18.373
- And I said to Joe, hey, Joe,

00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:20.844
did you leave that television on?

00:07:20.844 --> 00:07:22.884
He said no, why?

00:07:22.884 --> 00:07:27.051
I said, listen, where's that
beautiful music coming from?

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.079
And he said...

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:34.364
So I got up, went to the boy's room,

00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:37.849
and I had got that
little piano in his room.

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.682
And the boy...

00:07:39.682 --> 00:07:41.221
And suddenly,

00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.963
he slid over like this,

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.955
onto that chair,

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:48.181
playing all the way through.

00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:52.348
(Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No 1)

00:08:03.037 --> 00:08:05.986
- Leslie is blind, has spastic diplegia,

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.499
and has never had a
piano lesson in his life.

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:10.371
Leslie knows things he never learned.

00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:12.290
That is genetic memory.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.643
Leslie has a measured IQ of 68.

00:08:14.643 --> 00:08:16.826
But in this segment,
instead of asking Leslie

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:19.778
to play a piece after hearing
it for the first time,

00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:22.627
he is asked to play the
piece with the person.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.602
Leslie then plays with the person,

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:28.071
receiving, processing, and
outputting simultaneously.

00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:29.855
That's called parallel processing.

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:32.690
That is not consistent with an IQ of 68.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.599
IQ testing in savants is not reliable.

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:39.766
Savants point in the direction
of multiple intelligences.

00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:44.461
(piano music)

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.007
Leslie has shown a transition from recall

00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:46.875
to improvisation to creation,

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:49.483
as all savants do if followed long enough.

00:09:49.483 --> 00:09:51.240
Savants can be creative.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.891
In his concert now, there is always

00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:54.808
an audience request portion.

00:09:54.808 --> 00:09:58.070
In this 2015 concert,
Mary, May's daughter,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.300
asks Leslie to play audience requests.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.989
All right, let's go to see
how fast we can do this.

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:05.822
Eternal...

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:06.655
I don't know if he knows these now.

00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:07.813
I'm just gonna play through.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:11.324
And if you know about
Leslie, he will never deny

00:10:11.324 --> 00:10:13.007
he doesn't know one of the songs.

00:10:13.007 --> 00:10:14.084
(audience laughing)

00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:16.151
He's always gonna say
yes, and he will play it.

00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:19.202
And if he doesn't get
the one you requested,

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.351
he's making one up.

00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:22.903
(audience laughing)

00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:24.570
That's what he does.

00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:30.560
This one's called Eternal
Father the Navy Hymn.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.425
He don't know it.

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:36.592
("Eternal Father Strong to Save" on piano)

00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:43.229
And I don't know if that's right.

00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:45.504
Is that right? Is that right? Okay.

00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:47.754
(applause)

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:53.115
("Piano Man" by Billy Joel)

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:03.697
Those Endearing Young
Charms, an old Irish song.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:05.913
I don't think he knows this one.

00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:06.746
You know this one?

00:11:06.746 --> 00:11:07.686
- Yes, I know it.

00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:09.831
- Those Endearing Young Charms?

00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:13.748
♫ Those endearing young charms

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:20.415
- Are you making it up?

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:21.643
- Yes, I'm making it up.

00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:24.948
(audience laughing and applauding)

00:11:24.948 --> 00:11:29.115
(Leslie playing piano and singing)

00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:49.688
(audience cheering and applauding)

00:11:54.784 --> 00:11:57.784
This is a pretty good one, isn't it?

00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:08.933
Where'd you hear that one?

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:10.266
- On television.

00:12:12.621 --> 00:12:14.444
- We don't watch television.

00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:16.132
- No, you don't?

00:12:16.132 --> 00:12:18.932
(Mary laughing)

00:12:18.932 --> 00:12:20.182
- No, we don't.

00:12:24.628 --> 00:12:27.628
(audience cheering)

00:12:33.895 --> 00:12:37.481
- Leslie demonstrates that
savants can be creative.

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:41.298
They are not mere tape
recorders or copy machines.

00:12:41.298 --> 00:12:43.060
If you follow savants long enough,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.329
there's a transition

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:47.314
from massive recall

00:12:47.314 --> 00:12:51.177
to improvisation to creation.

00:12:51.177 --> 00:12:55.334
Savants can be creative, and
Leslie demonstrates that.

00:12:55.334 --> 00:12:57.611
Supporting and loving
families are such a vital part

00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.555
of bringing savant syndrome to full bloom.

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:02.890
May Lemke, the Woman Who Willed a Miracle,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.372
died in 1993.

00:13:05.372 --> 00:13:09.312
In her final years, May had
developed Alzheimer's disease.

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:13.282
Just before her death, Leslie
played for her one more time.

00:13:13.282 --> 00:13:14.924
Just as she brought him to life,

00:13:14.924 --> 00:13:17.699
his music lifted May from
her Alzheimer's disease

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:19.384
for a brief time.

00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:21.441
A fitting payback of love

00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:23.505
and the power of music.

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:27.672
(Leslie playing piano
and singing, May singing)

00:15:00.813 --> 00:15:03.925
I think Daniel's ability
is at a prodigious level,

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:05.346
because it would be spectacular

00:15:05.346 --> 00:15:06.986
if that were to be seen in any of us.

00:15:06.986 --> 00:15:08.986
It would be spectacular.

00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:12.741
- [Narrator] Equally though,
Daniel has been blessed

00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.741
with almost miraculous good fortune.

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:21.367
- The line between profound talent

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:22.920
and profound disability

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.003
seems really and surprisingly fickle.

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:28.948
- [Narrator] The way
that Daniel can describe

00:15:28.948 --> 00:15:31.202
his inner world is giving scientists

00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:35.324
a window into the brain
that they've never had.

00:15:35.324 --> 00:15:38.555
But the truth is, their
journey of exploration

00:15:38.555 --> 00:15:40.852
is only just beginning.

00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:42.497
- The bigger question
is whether we all have

00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:44.552
some of those abilities within us.

00:15:44.552 --> 00:15:48.394
And that is what I refer
to as the little rainman

00:15:48.394 --> 00:15:49.894
within each of us.

00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:52.207
- What I do, it isn't...

00:15:52.207 --> 00:15:53.919
I don't think it's supernatural.

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:56.383
I think it's something
that can't be explained.

00:15:56.383 --> 00:15:58.049
Who knows? There may
be abilities here that

00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:02.149
everyone can perhaps tap into in some way.

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:05.193
- Savant syndrome is challenging
us to think in new ways

00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:08.860
about intelligence and
what intelligence is.

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:16.193
Savant syndrome has
tremendous implications

00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:20.845
for better understanding both
the brain and human potential.

00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:24.514
Savants are not mere copy
machines or tape recorders.

00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:29.115
They can be creative with a metamorphosis

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:31.422
from recall

00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:33.974
to improvisation

00:16:33.974 --> 00:16:35.206
to creation.

00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:37.314

or www.terffertcenter.com.

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:48.418
Dedicated to preserving,
sharing, and expanding

00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:50.729
research into savant syndrome,

00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:53.306
other forms of exceptional
brain performance,

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:54.973
and human potential.

00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.665
(upbeat New Age music)
