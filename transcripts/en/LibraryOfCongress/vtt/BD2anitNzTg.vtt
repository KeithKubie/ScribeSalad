of science fiction and fantasy.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.550
His debut novel the "Windup
Girl" shows a vision of humanity

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.050
after being nearly wiped
out by genetic engineering.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.880
It is chalked full of weird
foods and strange beasts.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.500
It's one of the top ten
fiction books of 2009 by Time.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.090
Won the Hugo, Nebula, and John
W. Campbell awards in 2010.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.150

novel published in 2010,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.460
was award the Michael L. Printz

Paolo Bacigalupi has written
fiction for the magazine of "Fantasy

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.690
and Science Fiction" as a
model of science fiction

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.650
and the "Environmental
Journal High County News."

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.120
In an article last
summer on wired.com,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.900
"How Cyberpunks Saved Science
Fiction" Paolo Bacigalupi wrote

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.180
that science fiction was stuck in
a complacent groove by the 1980s.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.260
A lazyboy recliner
experience of the future.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.470
Competent men of science did
competent things aerospace was the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.810
coolest tech.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.770
And politics revolved around
the conflicts of nation states.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.440
Paolo Bacigalupi looks to inspire
and lead a new breed of writers

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.400
who looked to touch on raw
issues that interest us all.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.280
In that vein, "Zombie Baseball
Beatdown" bashes you on the head

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.170
with your very own funny bone.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.840
Explores raw themes if food
safety, racism, and immigration.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.220
No. Trying to understand who this
gentleman is he'll certainly tell

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.670
his own story well enough shortly.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.970
But I did a little looking.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.650
And I came up across a site
that said that it stems from --

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.670
it was a very old name Bacigalupi

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.480
that goes back to a
Italian mythology.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.500
Meaning something along the
lines of a kiss of a wolf.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.310
Although couldn't really
tell if that was true or not.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.610
There was alternate meaning of it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.580
that said some person
of dubious integrity.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.860
So I'll leave that to
all of you to decide.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.430
But please, join me and welcoming
one of the great emerging writers

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.510
in this genre Paolo Bacigalupi

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.390
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you [applause].

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.120
I've got a tail with me here so.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.750
Wow, hi, everybody.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.530
It's great to see you.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.890
It's also terrifying to see you.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.420
Whenever I stand up in
front of people and talk,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.870
I have this almost immediate
fight or flee reaction.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.620
And so my first urge just as I
was standing down there was maybe

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.140
if I can just go hide behind here
I'd throw up for a little while.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.640
I'll be fine.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.100
But, yeah, thank you very much.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.600
So as you know now my
name is Paolo Bacigalupi.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.380
I do write science fiction.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.600
And I do watch people
sort of immediately sort

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.150
of flinch whenever I say that.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.850
I've sort of got this sort
of theory about which version

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.400
of literature is most despised.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.700
Is it romance?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.100
Is it science fiction?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.610
Is it children's literature?

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.630
And whichever one it is that
you're sitting next to somebody

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.930 position:56%
and they say, oh, what do you write?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.230
You say I write science fiction.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.720
And they go, oh, I don't read that.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.750
You say, well, that's nice.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.910
Or you say, oh, well,
I write for children.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.980
Oh, that's easy writing, right?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.270
I wish it was easy writing.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.430
But so -- but I actually write
science fiction for children,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.990
for young adults, and for adults.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.390
And I'm really interested in
speaking to different age groups

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.600
because I feel like I
have different stories.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.200
And i have different ideas
I want to share with people.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.700
And it's also the most
satisfying thing for me as writer

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.000
because it feels like I get

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.820
to stretch different literary
muscles each time I write

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.610
for a different age range.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.590
So, yeah, so that's kind
of a little bit about me.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.160
I did actually want to ask you
guys a question because a lot

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.360
of the inspiration for
"Zombie Baseball Beatdown" --

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.640
I still love saying that title.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.710
Came from the sort of
very specific realization.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.630
And I just want to ask you all
how many of you have been forced

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.740 position:56%
to read a book that you didn't like?

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.900
How many of you have been forced to
finish a book that you didn't like?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.620
Right. Okay.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.930 position:56%
How many of you have been forced to
finish a video game you didn't like?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.760
We got one [laughter].

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.810
How many of you have been forced

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.770
to finish a TV show
that you didn't like?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.160
All the way through to the end?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.770
Yeah, a few.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.640
Okay. So it's interesting to me
that like when you look at media

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.870
and we look at something like
books and then we look at something

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.050 position:56%
like video games, it's
interesting to me that we've decided

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.150
to turn books into a
medium that's also a misery.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.850
And I'm not quite sure
why we do that.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.210
We seem to have some
idea that books,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.950
even if we're suffering,
it must be good for us.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.250
It must be worthwhile.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.550
It must be important.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.060
In fact, maybe even
the more we suffer,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.610
the more you know grimy
oatmeal we're forced to shove

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.580
down our throats, the
healthier we'll be

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.350
if we read these good
books that are good for us.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.870
For me, actually my
experience with this was

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.200
when my stepmother decided I would
not be allowed to read another book

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.250
until I read John Steinbeck's
the "Red Pony."

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.590
And this book for those of
you who haven't read it,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.890
I'd say don't [brief laughter].

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.200
For me as a kid in middle
school reading this book

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.500
that was good literature --

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.710
my experience of it wasn't that
it was sad or anything like that.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.700
It was that it was dead boring.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.450
It was a slog.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.730
It was a fight to get
through every page.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.250
The words blurred on the page as I
just waited for the page to turn.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.170
And I hated that so much.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.540 position:56%
And it was interesting because at
the same time I was actually reading

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.840
quite a lot.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.140
But I was reading science fiction.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.930
I was reading stores
about rocket ships.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.030
I was reading fantasy
stories about dragons.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.380
I was reading about great
quest with great swords.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.310
And there's, you know, something in
here where I was experiencing joy

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.110
in reading in another space
that my stepmother called trash.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.870
And then she wanted to hand me
something that she's called good.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.900
And that was where I was
supposed to reside with reading.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.420
If she had had entire control
over my reading experiences,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.740
I would not have become a reader.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.430
And one of the things that
I've noticed in our schooling

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.210
and in the way we treat books
oftentimes is that we know

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.510
which books are good for us.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.810
And we know which books
are bad for us.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.020
And never the twain shall meet.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.760
And that's a fascinating sort
of value set that we apply

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.950
to this specific media more than
any other media that I've seen.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.130
And when I go and --
so all of that said,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.660
then my wife is school teacher.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.550
And she teaches children who are
generally in the range of 4th, 5th,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.040
and 6th grade, that age group.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.620
So -- and she has some
kids who hate reading.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.780
And so one day she said to a couple
of these kids, she says, well,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.520
what do you want to read about?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.820
Like, let's start with that.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.600
And all the kids sort of
look at her and say zombies.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.490
And sure enough if you go out
and you look at what's available

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.830
for a 4th grader or a 5th grader
or a 6th grader about zombies,

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.390
there's a little bit available
in books about zombies.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.180
But it's all really cute zombies.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.270
They're all the, you know, the
zombies that just need a hug.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.170
They're the zombies that you
can defeat with hot sauce.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.380
Now, at the same time
that this is going

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:25.320
on my 9-year-old son is playing an
iPod game called "The Earn to Die."

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.260 position:56%
Where you level up by getting bigger
and bigger vehicles so you can drive

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.150
over more and more zombies.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.610
And you drive over them
and the zombies splatter

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.010
and blood goes everywhere.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.480
And, you know, he's driving faster.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.910 position:56%
And he's laughing the whole sometime
while he's playing this little iPod

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.280
game and driving over zombies.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.160
And here we got for his age
range in books; you have stories

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.890
about zombies that need a hug.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.340
But the iPods giving him what he
really wants, which is he wants

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.650
to drive over a bunch of zombies.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.280
In that moment, I think you have
to look at where your reader is.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.530
And if you're going to have
somebody become a reader,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.670
you're going to connect
with their desires.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.740
You're going to connect
with the things they love.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.040
You're going to reach
out, and you're going

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.520
to meet them where they want to be.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.820
You're not going to tell them, no,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.410
reading is the "Red
Pony" here try this out.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.360
You're going to say,
you want zombies,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.440
I'll give you some zombies, kid.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.910
And that's where I wanted
to be with this book.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:22.930
I think that the thing for me
that started me as a reader

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:28.280
and made me eventually a writer was
that I found that books were joy.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.630
That books were a pleasure.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.930
They were excitement.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.410
They were, you know,
they were getting

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.710
to watch characters do
death defying things.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.260
With "Zombie Baseball Beatdown"
I wanted to write a story

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.310
where kids got to fight
off the zombie apocalypse.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.560
Where a bunch of kids
with their baseball bats

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:50.570
and their teamwork skills were
going to fight the zombie hoard.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:10:01.050
And they were going to
save their small town.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.350
And I love that feeling.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.650
That as soon as I started thinking

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.000
about that story I started
getting chills I was

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.300
so excited about writing it.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.600
So I wanted to meet kids
right where they are,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.900
which is they want
to be entertained.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.200
They want to be engaged.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.830
And they want to have a
joyful experience in books.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.720
They don't hate reading, they hate
the crummy stories we give them

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.020
to read.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.400
And so I'm going to read just
a small section from this.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.920
And then I'm going to
talk a little bit more

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.510
about also what else I'm
thinking about writing

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.810
and reading in literature.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.030
And then after that, assuming
that I don't get a buzz here,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.330
I'd like to take questions.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.630
If you guys have any questions.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.930
So this scene happens
some of the kids --

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.690
when I started thinking
about the zombie apocalypse

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.960
and creating a zombie apocalypse,
one of the questions that came

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.060
up was where was does the
zombie apocalypse come from?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.910
And for me, the perfect
location for a zombie apocalypse

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.440
to start spreading from was
the local meat packing plant.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.910
You know, meat handling is a
very, very interesting thing:

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.470
Where our meat comes from;
how our meat gets raised;

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.960
how our meat gets slaughtered.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.450
It's interesting stuff.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.400
And there's all sorts of ripe,
you know, opportunities for abuse

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.700
in our meat packing system.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.090
So this was where I decided to
start my zombie apocalypse from.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.110
And in this scene, the kids have
snuck into a meat packing plant

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.190
to try to find where the source
of the infection is coming from.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.940
It's here, Miguel said, standing
in front of some steel doors.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.190
What is? He didn't answer.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.120
Just swung the doors open.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.830
We stood in a cavernous
factory room tangled

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.470
with conveyers and equipment.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.090
Meat hooks dangled
from chains overhead.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.400 position:56%
Conveyer belts went every which way.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.900 position:56%
And massive boxy machines that might
have been grinders or other things,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.360
but I couldn't tell,
were everywhere.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.400
The place was so big you couldn't
even see the far side of it.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.220
We eased into the space.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.440
It was scary with all the
chains and hooks hanging

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.370
down from their conveyers.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.640
What are we looking for, Joe asked?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.400 position:56%
Something that looks zombie, I said.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.810
Anything. The concrete floors all
glistened with water and blood.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.380
And everything gleaned.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.140
It was chilly, and it had
the scent of a meat locker.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.520 position:56%
It was like smelling life gone cold.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.110
Our breath steamed in front of us.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.560
What about the cows, Joe asked?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.000
Where did they go?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.690
Miguel waved to the far side
of the huge factory floor.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.960
A bunch of them are in the
next room over in a huge pen.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.830
The cows get herded up one by one
up a ramp that leads into here.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.560 position:56%
Suddenly there was a rattling sound.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.440
Hi. We ducked behind
the conveyer lines.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.900
Footsteps echoed along with
voices calling out to one another.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.680
I thought they were all
supposed to be gone, I whispered.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.910
Another shift, Joe asked?

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.070
No. It's only supposed to be
cleaning crews, Miguel said.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.480
The guy I talked to
said they were going

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.780
to be cleaning the whole plant.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.190
So the nightshift wasn't
going to run.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.100
Just cleaning.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.040
Lights buzzed and flickered on.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.130
Workers in white, full body
jump suits streamed in.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.180
Joe found a spot under
some of the machinery.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.480
Hide here.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.260
We just barely squeezed under.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.950
Don't let your feet stick
out, Miguel whispered.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.640
They'll see us for sure.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.730
It was tight but we all fit.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.970
From our hiding place, we watched
as more and more workers came in.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.890
Who do those guys remind
you of, I asked?

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.470
Clean up squad, Joe said grimly.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.490
Yeah, none of these are
regular workers, Miguel said.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.020
Not with those clothes covering
their whole bodies like that.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.760
And they don't have aprons
like my uncle and aunt used.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.810
These have got to be some
other kind of Milrow people.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.660
The conveyer line started up.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.190
A door rattled, and suddenly
we could hear cows screaming.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.650
More workers came in with huge
knives and chain saw like machines.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.430
They fired them up as
the lines started moving.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.970
The first cow appeared.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.360
It had a huge hole in its head.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.670
But that didn't seem to
bother the cow at all.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.970
A bunch of hooks snagged it

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.250
and swept it off the
ground as it struggled.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.230
Moo, the workers went after
it with knives and saws.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.660
The cow tried to bite
them, but they were fast.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.070
Cutting and chopping
peeling away the skin.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.370
The head came off.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.670
The belly opened up.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.970
The guts went down the drain.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.880
The cow's head fell to the floor.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.200
Moo it said.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.100
It's hooked body was still jerking
around even without its head.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.460
A zombie cow for sure, Joe said.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.740
As if we needed him to tell us.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.360
The cow was still alive even
though it was completely dead.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.350
One of the workers got
kicked by the dead cow.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.910
But he got right up and
chopped the carcass in half.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.890
Then water sprayed it and the
next worker whacked off the legs.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.370
The carcass whizzed along
carried by the hooks with more

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.210
and more workers slicing
cuts of meat

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.730
from the body even
as it kept wiggling.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:29.600
The cow -- look at the rain --
the zombie cow became smaller

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.900
and smaller and less
and less like a cow

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.070
as each worker took a whack at it.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.620
Pieces and parts were slashed
and sliced away and dropped

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.740
onto conveyer belts that whisked
the meat this way and that way

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.140
through the processing plant.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.000
Heading for who knew where.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.870
Another cow entered
the production line.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.430
And the clean up squad
went up to that too.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:54.430
Moo, slice, hack, chop [chain
saw sounds] went the chain saws.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.160
Another cow whacked
into little red pieces.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.600
More of the line was gearing.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.680
It was crazy loud in the
factory now like we were

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.590
in the belly of a clanging monster.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.870
Ground up meat oozed
out of delivery tubes.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.420
And newly cut steaks whipped

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.770
down the conveyer lines
shrink wrapped in plastic.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.120
More and more cows were
being herded into the doors.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.280
And every single one
of them was mooing even

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.350
after it was chopped up and dead.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.270
The cow heads that
had been discarded lay

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.400
in a huge pile snapping
at one another.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.090
And at any workers
who walked past them.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.130
Pound after pound of
red hamburger poured

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.460
out of the machines around us.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.320
Globs of beef that dropped
on to Styrofoam plates.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.680
And then went through shrink
wrapping machines so that they came

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.530
out on the other side
looking shiny and fresh

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.320
with Milrow meat stickers
on the plastic.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.390
Labels sped past us.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.150
Farmers Feast 100 percent
all natural ground beef.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.680
Forest Glen Acres pure ground beef.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.690
High Plains Ranches USDA
natural ground beef.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.210
Milrow Meats top quality beef

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.000
from our family ranches
to your family table.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.980
Joe had his cell phone out, and he
was snapping pictures looking sick.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.910
I think I'm a vegetarian, he said.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.930
Miguel gave him an annoyed glance.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.840
Where did you think
your meat came from?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.140
You think it just [inaudible]

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.000
into the night supermarket
like night crawler?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.640
I had to agree with Joe though.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.430
It was brutal and nasty.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.820
None of the workers
seemed to be worried

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.150
about what they were doing at all.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.370
They were just being
super efficient.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.550
Even if it hadn't been zombie cow
heads lying on the ground mooing

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.260
and rolling their eyes
and snapping their teeth,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.020
the whole set up didn't
feel good to watch.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.840
I mean, I went out to
a farm with my dad once

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.140
where we bought a sheep for mutton.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.710
And we saw the farmer
kill the sheep.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.550
He stuck his knife in
the sheep's throat.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.250
And we watched him kill it.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.000
And it was uncomfortable
because you could see

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.500
that something was dying
so you could eat it.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.260
But killing a sheep up close
and personal wasn't like this.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.870
The sheep bled and got chopped up.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.860
And dad and I ate it, sure.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.430
But this Milrow factory
was something else.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.700
Cow after cow coming into the
plant and getting ripped to pieces.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.690
High speed chopping,
ripping, tearing, shrinking.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.620
I wondered what kind of people
could create a factory like this.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.340
All for tearing animals
apart as fast as possible.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.030
It scared me.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.600
They're turning all the zombie
cows into food for people, I said.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.900
I can't believe it.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.320
They're insane.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.900
It was all zombie cows.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.860
Not a single real cow
in the whole bunch.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.070
So this is what ground zero for
the zombie apocalypse looks like.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.620
Joe snapped more pictures.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.930
I sort of thought it would be a
military science lab somewhere.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.440
We've got to stop this, I said.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.200
We can't let them do this.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.300
There's a stop button
on the line, Joe said.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.740
Miguel whacked him upside the head.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.140
Not just now, idiot.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.440
We got to report it.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.120
We got to make sure
this all gets stopped.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.790
We need something they can't
sweep under the table, I said.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.190
Something the cops can't ignore.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.690
Real zombie proof, Joe murmured.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.850
Something you just couldn't
make up, Miguel said.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.760
Moo, moaned the cow heads lying
in a giant pile at the beginning

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.420
of the meat packing line.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.660
Moo, we all looked at each other.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.510
A mooing zombie cow head, yeah,
that would probably do the trick.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:16.930
[ Applause ]

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.670
All right so I loved
writing this book.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.570
I had far too much
fun doing this book.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.510
No one of the things that I
also kind of wanted to talk

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.620
about was the idea that we know
what's good for us in literature.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.500
And we know what's bad
for us in literature.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.850
We know what's trashy.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.120
And we know what's healthy for our
kids to read or for us to read.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.310
And we separate those things
out in really interesting ways.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:43.700
And I'm not sure that I believe
that that's actually the right way

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.240
to think about storytelling.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.320
I have this feeling that
it's possible for us

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.170
to have our cake and eat it too.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.710
That we can have all
the joys of running

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.130
around in the pop culture
space of zombies.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.340
But we can also talk about other
things that are extremely serious.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.150
The opportunity to talk about
where does our meat come from?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.450
How do we treat it?

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.750
What do we eat?

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.050
Who's in charge of it?

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.350
How does it get regulated?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.650
Who protects our food?

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.990
All of those questions
are also in this book.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.420
And it's one of the things that's a
huge pleasure for me is to be able

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.390
to say I'm going to
tell you a fun story

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.440
about kids beating back the zombie
hoard with their baseball bats.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.590
Oh, by the way, let's think about
how food works in our country too,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.890
because that's interesting.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.400
And I think you can have
both of those things.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.470
And it can all be a
fun, thrilling package.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.670
And there's none of this,
like, oh, it sucks to read it.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.520
This is actually going to
be fun all the way through.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.820
I get to learn.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.480
I get to have joy both
at the same time.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.910
And that's where I think that
sort of literature needs to be.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:42.170 position:56%
And that's where unabashedly we know
that almost all other media wants

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.080
to be, is they want
to sort of spread joy.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.430
They want people to be
engaged and entertained.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.450
Video games movies, TV
shows, are all trying

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.400
to engage and entertain first.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.010
Everything else comes second.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.570
And I think that books have made a
mistake somewhere along the line.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.730
And definitely our teaching
establishment has made a mistake,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.050 position:56%
you know, the way we do our testing,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.450
everything to say no
good for you first.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.970
Oh, if you have fun, well,
we'll try to accept that.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.200
But please, you know,
don't have too much fun.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.240
And I really sort of want to
bring those two ideas together.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.640
It's like, yeah, we
can think about things.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.940
We have been thoughts.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.240
Big themes.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.980
And also big, big zombie battles.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.510
So -- thank you.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.780
[ Applause ]

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.300
So if anybody has any questions
I'd be happy to answer questions.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.460
I'm happy to talk about
almost anything.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.880
So feel free and fire away.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.880
I guess there are microphones
on either side here so.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.180
[inaudible comment]

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:44.580
&gt;&gt; Hi, as an educator of teachers,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.540
I agree with a lot of
what you're saying.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.090
But I would also ask the question
of how many people have been forced

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.300
to read a book that they
turned out that they loved it?

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.160 position:56%
And that could be the book that
you're talking about, as well as any

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.060
of the other literature
in the world.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.300
So I think that that's an
important question to ask as well.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.750
&gt;&gt; It's an interesting
question is --

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.900
the question is sort of how
many people have been forced

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.580
to read a book and then found
that they did love it later?

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.570
And I think that that's possible.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.750
Certainly I had a teacher
in high school who forced me

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.610
to read Shakespeare for a semester.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.320
And eventually I did
come to love Shakespeare.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.760
I was taught to eat the
right kind of food I suppose.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:31.100 position:56%
I think though that especially when
we talk about our classic literature

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.820
that we forget how our classic
literature knew that it needed

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.780
to earn it's keep in its time.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.050
Shakespeare didn't
sit down to say, oh,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.870
I'm going to force
you to enjoy this.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.000
He was actually writing
exactly for his popular culture.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.570
And so I feel like there's a --

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.530
we've decided that because
it's hard therefore it's good.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.510
As opposed to, because it's
enjoyable therefore it's good.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.430
Because it's engaging
therefore it's good.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.970
I feel like we've somehow managed
to sort of worship our past enough

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.400
that we've forgotten that our
present is actually what most

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.840
writers -- the reason why
writers are classics now is

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.190
because they were deeply
embedded in their present moment.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.510
And writing very, very specifically
for their present readers.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.640
And we sort of managed to separate
that within our educational system.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.940
I'm not saying that
it can't be done.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.940
I'm not saying that we can't
be taught to enjoy new things.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.040
But especially at younger ages,
I think that it's a horrible,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.370 position:56%
horrible thing to do somebody is to
say, no, no, keep going, keep going,

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.670
keep going and suffering.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.020
It's like I think you
start with the sweets.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.150
You assume that -- for me
at least, I think about this

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.140
as being the question of, like,
you assume that if I can get kids

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.730
to start reading and enjoying
reading and loving reading,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.330
this is not going to be
the last book they read.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.980
The idea is it's the
first book they read.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.610 position:56%
And that gets them on a journey that
goes all kinds of different places.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.260
But if I start out with something
that's horrible and boring

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.570
and difficult and not engaging
and not relevant to me,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.000
then it will be the last book.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.300
And that's sad.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.600
And then they -- and the iPods

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.900
and everything else
will take them instead.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.410
I do think that there's
a point in our lives --

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.510
and for me I didn't
actually read any, you know,

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.590
major what we would call
like quality literature

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.800
until after I was out of college.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.930
Until then I read science
fiction entirely.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.400
That was what I read, and
that was what I truly loved.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.480
And then there was a
point when suddenly I was,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.780
like, oh, this is interesting.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.370
You know, Hemingway,
oh, fascinating.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.670
Oh, "Virginia Wolf."

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.000
Oh, fascinating whatever
those things were.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.330
I was finally ready for that.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.460
If I had stopped reading
at an earlier stage though,

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.730 position:56%
I would have never even had a
chance to pick up those later books.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.190
So it's kind of what I think about.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.490
Other questions [brief applause].

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.790
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] what exactly
made the cows zombies?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.000
&gt;&gt; What exactly makes
the cows zombies?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.120
Well, I don't do spoilers so,
like, you'd have to read the book.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.730
But you can get it
at the library too.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.460
I'm not just trying to sell them.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.060
The things that they
start to suspect.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.360
I'll tell you this much.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.750 position:56%
That they start to suspect that
there might be something in the food

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.220
that the cows are eating.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.640
And they start to think also that
the way that the cows are being fed

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.030
and raised in the feedlots
at the meat packing plant

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.330
which are very, very dirty.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.950
Feedlots tend to be very, very
dirty infected places already.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.890
And so when the kids go out
and investigate in the feedlots

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.290
and they see the conditions there.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.020
And they see some of the drugs that
are getting used on the animals

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.130
to make them grow bigger
they start thinking

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:21.330
that there might be something
connected to that so.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm mom of three sons and
an elementary school librarian.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.660
So I want to say thanks
for writing what they love.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.140
It's a huge challenge
to get boys to read.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.450
And we're listening to you with
[inaudible] and all the stuff

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.280 position:56%
that they love, so that's fantastic.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.650
And also for including --
you're making them think.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.660
They're enjoying it, but
then they're going to think

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.050
and make some really
good evaluations as well.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.820
So my next question is going to
be what the kids always ask me

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.500
when they find a book that
they fall in love with,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.680
which they probably
will, which ones next?

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.130
How many are in the series?

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.200
And how long do I have to wait?

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.500
&gt;&gt; [brief laughter]
And this is actually --

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.340
this is a difficult
one for me to answer

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.410
because normally I don't
normally do series.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.930
I normally will write a book,
and there's a set of ideas I want

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.370
to open up inside of that book.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.360
And it's oftentimes it
becomes a stand alone.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.890
In my young adult work,
the "Ship Breaker"

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.860
and the "Drown Cities" I manage

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.870
to still keep the books
in the same world.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.900
But I found that I
couldn't write a series.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.020 position:56%
I needed to explore different ideas.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.880
So with "Ship Breaker" it was
really about family and about sort

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.250
of a boy learning to sort of
find his way into a better life.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.790
And with the "Drown
Cities" it was really all

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.010
about politics and
fighting and wars.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.020
And how we either negotiate or
don't negotiate to get along.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.540
And with different themes,
very, very different themes.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.610
I do really want to go
back into the space though.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.620
And I keep having this
vision of these kids.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.860
I have more ideas.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.670
So, yes [inaudible] --

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:57.120
&gt;&gt; Why did you use zombie cows
instead of regular zombies?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.100
&gt;&gt; Why did I use zombie cows
instead of regular zombies?

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.570
Actually I used both.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.110
So there's zombie cows.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.550
And then later on when the
people eat the zombie cows,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.100
then they become real zombies.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.990
And so there's a whole
bunch of scenes of the kids

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.680
with their baseball bats having
to fight real human zombies also.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.640
So both of those things
are in there.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.680
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is just
you talked a little bit

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.780
about where you got the idea
for "Zombie Baseball Beatdown."

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.380
What was your inspiration for
"Ship Breaker" and "Drown Cities"?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.140
&gt;&gt; Okay. What was my inspiration

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.850
for "Ship Breaker" and
the "Drown Cities"?

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.130
Originally my -- the
biggest inspiration

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.850
for "Ship Breaker" actually
came from the idea that I wanted

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.750
to write about broken futures.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.230
I really am interested in
sort of the bad futures

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.920
that our present day
decision-making might create.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.200
But I also wanted to write about
something that was inspiring.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.670
And so I was really interested
in writing about [inaudible]

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.610
like high technology,
sustainable technologies.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.970
And I really wanted to introduce
the idea of a new age of wind

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.980
that would say we can have a global
economy that's based on wind.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.400
We used to in the 1800s.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.910
We did all the way up until
coal and steamships took over.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.650
And so I really wanted to sort
of think about new technologies

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.220
that were inspiring to me.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.020
That I wanted to make them seem
inspiring to the new readers.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.870
Because I kind of wanted
to inspire people to go out

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.490
and build new high
technology [inaudible].

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.150
Kind of like the things that
are in the America's cup.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.600
Or things like that but bigger.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.530
And, yeah, so that was part of it.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.000
There's almost always a lot
of different inspirations.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.940
For the "Drown Cities" actually
my big inspiration was our current

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.770
political problems.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.200
Our inability to talk
across political lines.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.760
Our inability to talk
across differences.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.590
And asking the question really if
this goes on where do we end up.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:46.700
There was a line in a very early
draft of the "Drown Cities"

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.920
that I ended up throwing
away everything else except

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.710
for this one line.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.990
And these characters are
sailing pass the "Drown Cities."

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.350
And the "Drown Cities" are
a terrible war torn area.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.080
And this kid asks he says,
well, how did we get this way?

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.620
How did this place
turn out this way?

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.730
And the captain of
the ship says, well,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.160
a nation this powerful doesn't
just fall apart by accident.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.350
Somebody has to tear it apart.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.400
And he says the demigods
whipped up the people.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.800
And the people bit
on their own tails.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.650
And they chewed and they chewed
until there was nothing left

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.830
but the snapping of teeth.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.130
And that was important to me.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.920
The idea that we can
actually chew ourselves up.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.700
And I wanted to write
about that kind of a world.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.240
And say, hey, maybe
we shouldn't do this.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.610
Maybe we do need to find some ways
to talk across our differences.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.520
So that was the inspiration
for that.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.420
So thank you, yeah.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.720
Yeah.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.940
&gt;&gt; For the concept
of the infected cows,

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.800
did you get that idea
from Mad Cow Disease?

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, actually.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.400
Did I get the idea
from Mad Cow Disease?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.870
Yeah, I'm really interested in
actually Mad Cow Disease, BSE.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.610
Creutzfeldtz-Jakob Disease, yes.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:56.020
But also from other kinds of meat.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.190
Food safety outbreaks like E.coli.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.120
You hear a lot of about
E.coli in hamburgers.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.490 position:56%
You here about salmonella sometimes.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.810
You also hear about this
and other kinds of parts

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.590
of our industrial food system like.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.750
You know, I remember
peanuts got infected I think

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.360
with salmonella a while back.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.930
You know it's, like,
oh, this is interesting.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:13.940
And you find out almost all of
your peanut butter is coming

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.880
from two factories so that's it.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.340
Like, you know, it's all these
different brands are all affected

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.370
by this one peanut
factory or whatever.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.770
And so that was all of
those kinds of food --

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.620
sort of food disasters that
we have were real interesting.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.880
Yeah.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.140
&gt;&gt; Hi. And just want to say that
we share the same hated book.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.430
The "Red Pony" was the first book
I ever read that I did not like.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.870
So I feel your pain on that.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.640
I'm a middle school
teacher librarian.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.010
And I absolutely loved "Ship
Breaker" and "Drown Cities."

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.570
I like speculation with
interconnected issues

00:29:45.570 --> 00:30:02.040
and how it gives the
reader a sense of potency.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.650
An idea that they actually
can steer things.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:11.570
But one thing that I
think is not really talked

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:16.300
about a lot is underlying
diversity issues linking all these

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.600
things together.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.600
Those books tend to
have, in my opinion,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.440
really notable representation
of different cultures

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.500
and backgrounds -- people with
disabilities, people of color,

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.850
people of different ages.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:34.820
So I'm assuming that you, you
know, did that sort of on purpose

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.860
or least were cognizant of that.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.120
So I wondered if you could
just talk a little bit

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.140 position:56%
about why you think diversity is
important in young adult literature.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the question of
diversity and the idea of lots

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.440
of different kids being
able to find themselves

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.660
in books is really,
really important to me.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.090
And you see this sort
of joy that a kid has

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.500
when they find somebody
who's like them in stories.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.020
And they can connect to that.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.610
And you do notice that in a lot
of our literature and in a lot

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.340
of our movies, a lot of our TV
shows there's an overwhelming sort

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.640
of middle American whiteness to it.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.420
That doesn't really represent
what we are as America today.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.720
It doesn't really represent
the globe.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.020
And it's a missed opportunity.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.320 position:56%
For myself, you know, and especially
it is actually absolutely deliberate

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.670
that I trying to make more and
more diverse cast of characters.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.990
All engaged in doing
interesting and amazing things.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.340
You know in "Zombie Baseball
Beatdown" actually it was --

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.640
the main character is named
Rabi Chatterjee-Jones.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.940
And he's half Indian.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.240
And that's because my
son is half Indian.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.540
And one of the things that
I noticed was that he --

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.840
when he's able to read a book or
see a story or see a TV show --

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.140
I remember the first time
he saw some Disney TV show.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.440
He said, dad, I saw this show.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.740
And there's an Indian in it.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.040
And he's smart like me.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.340
I was like -- and you're
just heartbroken

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.640 position:56%
because you realize how scarce that
is for him that joy and that appeal.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.940 position:56%
And so you sort of want to open your
arms really wide and bring in lots

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.240
of different people to
experience great stories.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.540
So thank you.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.840
Thank you.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.140
And I think that's everything.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.440
So I'm over time now.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.740
So they're going to
grab a hook with me.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.540
So thank you so much.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:56.250
