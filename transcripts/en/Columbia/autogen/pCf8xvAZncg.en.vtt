and I think from those various points of
 

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.639
and I think from those various points of
view I'd be curious to hear your

the film about its veracity and etc it's
 

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.930
the film about its veracity and etc it's
of the tone that it strikes shall we say

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:19.940

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.920
know exactly how that works we can
discuss that but maybe we could open up

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:26.930
discuss that but maybe we could open up
 

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.210

was compromised to some degree in the
 

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.450
was compromised to some degree in the
making of this film because of the

making of this film because of the
proprietary fight among the King

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:09.650
proprietary fight among the King

proprietary fight among the King
children and that really broke my heart

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:12.500
children and that really broke my heart
 

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.919
children and that really broke my heart
to think about the fact that this

00:24:14.919 --> 00:24:14.929
to think about the fact that this
 

00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:16.890
to think about the fact that this
actually is now taking place in a world

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:16.900
actually is now taking place in a world
 

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.830

where I think all of our civil rights

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840
where I think all of our civil rights
 

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.289

struggles are taking place against a

00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:23.299
struggles are taking place against a

backdrop that is so denominated by
 

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.110
backdrop that is so denominated by
proprietary battles over everything so

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120
proprietary battles over everything so
 

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.360
proprietary battles over everything so
the intimacy of this was to some degree

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.370
the intimacy of this was to some degree
 

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.730
the intimacy of this was to some degree
disrupted by the fact that I you know at

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:33.740
disrupted by the fact that I you know at
 

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.409
disrupted by the fact that I you know at
the age of 12 13 it almost memorized

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:35.419
the age of 12 13 it almost memorized
 

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:37.860
the age of 12 13 it almost memorized
every word that King said and it was

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:37.870
every word that King said and it was
 

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.690
every word that King said and it was
disconcerting to have well written but

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:40.700
disconcerting to have well written but
 

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.120
disconcerting to have well written but
clearly not the kind of singing rhetoric

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.130
clearly not the kind of singing rhetoric
 

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.760
clearly not the kind of singing rhetoric
that were his precise words they were

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:45.770
that were his precise words they were
 

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.070
that were his precise words they were
very very carefully chosen words and

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080
very very carefully chosen words and
 

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.030
very very carefully chosen words and
this was written so it was a

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.040
this was written so it was a
 

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.340
this was written so it was a
representation with some sense of

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:51.350
representation with some sense of
 

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.020
representation with some sense of
fiduciary duty and that's what really

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:53.030
fiduciary duty and that's what really
 

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.299
fiduciary duty and that's what really
intrigues me about the it is not a

00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:55.309
intrigues me about the it is not a
 

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:57.580
intrigues me about the it is not a
documentary but a film has of this that

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:57.590
documentary but a film has of this that
 

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.260
documentary but a film has of this that
stature has some sort of fiduciary

00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.270

responsibility was standing between that

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:01.910
responsibility was standing between that
 

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.419
responsibility was standing between that
and it's rendering was again a kind of

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:04.429
and it's rendering was again a kind of
 

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:08.820
and it's rendering was again a kind of
propriety proprietary world that I think

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:08.830
propriety proprietary world that I think
 

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.770
propriety proprietary world that I think
has become the new edge of politics

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:11.780
has become the new edge of politics
 

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.090
has become the new edge of politics
because it is proprietary not just about

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:16.100
because it is proprietary not just about
 

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.520
because it is proprietary not just about
owning particular words it is you know I

can thinking what would happen what will
 

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.450
can thinking what would happen what will
happen in today's world if there is a

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:22.460
happen in today's world if there is a
 

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.730
happen in today's world if there is a
need for this kind and there certainly

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:24.740
need for this kind and there certainly
 

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.220
need for this kind and there certainly
is a social movement that we need in all

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.230
is a social movement that we need in all
 

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.250
is a social movement that we need in all
kinds of things but could we have this

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:30.260
kinds of things but could we have this
 

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.850
kinds of things but could we have this
kind of march on pettus bridge in

kind of march on pettus bridge in
 

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.620
kind of march on pettus bridge in
today's world and it seems to me that

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.630
today's world and it seems to me that
 

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.180
today's world and it seems to me that
there are a lot of things militating

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.190
there are a lot of things militating
 

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.490

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:47.929
sort of doing what they could to secure
 

00:29:47.929 --> 00:29:50.799
sort of doing what they could to secure
the right to march and the the tensions

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:50.809
the right to march and the the tensions
 

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:52.480
the right to march and the the tensions
in the social movement right that were

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:52.490
in the social movement right that were
 

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.460
in the social movement right that were
there then that are that are present in

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:54.470
there then that are that are present in
 

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.230
there then that are that are present in
any social movement right but that run

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240
any social movement right but that run
 

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240
any social movement right but that run
through every social movement and one of

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.250
through every social movement and one of
 

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.490
through every social movement and one of
the challenges and I think I see this

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:00.500
the challenges and I think I see this
 

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.769
the challenges and I think I see this
with in talking with students often as

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:02.779
with in talking with students often as
 

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:05.409
with in talking with students often as
the expectation that you know there is a

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:05.419
the expectation that you know there is a
 

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:07.450
the expectation that you know there is a
social movement that has a vision and

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:07.460
social movement that has a vision and
 

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.909
social movement that has a vision and
and it's not successful unless it sort

00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919
and it's not successful unless it sort
 

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:11.049
and it's not successful unless it sort
of achieves that vision

00:30:11.049 --> 00:30:11.059
of achieves that vision
 

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:12.999
of achieves that vision
lock step and it's never been that way

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:13.009
lock step and it's never been that way
 

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:15.009
lock step and it's never been that way
I'm part of what you see is even with

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:15.019
I'm part of what you see is even with
 

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:17.470
I'm part of what you see is even with
the diversity of views and the diversity

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480
the diversity of views and the diversity
 

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.230
the diversity of views and the diversity
of strategies there is this way that a

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240
of strategies there is this way that a
 

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.560
of strategies there is this way that a
shared end goal comment from many

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.570
shared end goal comment from many

different perspectives can be moved

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:25.580
different perspectives can be moved
 

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.249
different perspectives can be moved
forward there are ways to get there and

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:27.259
forward there are ways to get there and
 

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:28.840
forward there are ways to get there and
I think that for me as part of what is

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:28.850
I think that for me as part of what is
 

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.909
I think that for me as part of what is
inspiring and reinvigorating one I think

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919
inspiring and reinvigorating one I think
 

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:33.460
inspiring and reinvigorating one I think
about steps that we are all or each of

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:33.470
about steps that we are all or each of
 

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.930
about steps that we are all or each of
us is trying in different ways to take

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:34.940
us is trying in different ways to take
 

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.090
us is trying in different ways to take
today Sam do you want to weigh in with

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.100
today Sam do you want to weigh in with
 

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.289
today Sam do you want to weigh in with
your some of your thoughts about the

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:38.299
your some of your thoughts about the
 

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:40.119
your some of your thoughts about the
film as well actually I think for

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:40.129
film as well actually I think for
 

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:42.340
film as well actually I think for
instance you do quickly yeah I just want

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.350
instance you do quickly yeah I just want
 

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.529
instance you do quickly yeah I just want
to briefly comment on some of the things

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:44.539
to briefly comment on some of the things
 

00:30:44.539 --> 00:30:47.379
to briefly comment on some of the things
that Pat and you mentioned which I think

00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:47.389
that Pat and you mentioned which I think
 

00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:48.249
that Pat and you mentioned which I think
one of the things that struck me

00:30:48.249 --> 00:30:48.259
one of the things that struck me
 

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:50.649
one of the things that struck me
politically of the film precisely had to

00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:50.659
politically of the film precisely had to
 

00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:52.060
politically of the film precisely had to
do with I mean many people have pointed

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.070
do with I mean many people have pointed
 

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.799
do with I mean many people have pointed
out the continuities the police

00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:53.809
out the continuities the police
 

00:30:53.809 --> 00:30:56.230
out the continuities the police
brutality that kind of thing but some of

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240
brutality that kind of thing but some of
 

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.220
brutality that kind of thing but some of
the things that struck me are the

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.230
the things that struck me are the
 

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.739
the things that struck me are the
discontinuities one of which is that

00:30:59.739 --> 00:30:59.749
discontinuities one of which is that
 

00:30:59.749 --> 00:31:04.090
discontinuities one of which is that
although the film attempts to create a

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.100
although the film attempts to create a
 

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.489
although the film attempts to create a
private sphere for Martin Luther King

00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:06.499
private sphere for Martin Luther King
 

00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:08.320
private sphere for Martin Luther King
and include women to some extent in that

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:08.330
and include women to some extent in that
 

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.139
and include women to some extent in that
narrative we're still talking about a

00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:11.149
narrative we're still talking about a
 

00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:14.259
narrative we're still talking about a
movement that had a clear leader a model

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:14.269
movement that had a clear leader a model
 

00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:17.109
movement that had a clear leader a model
of organization that I think has become

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:17.119
of organization that I think has become
 

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:20.350
of organization that I think has become
impossible so I think one of the

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360
impossible so I think one of the
 

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.419
impossible so I think one of the
questions that the film asks for me is

00:31:22.419 --> 00:31:22.429
questions that the film asks for me is
 

00:31:22.429 --> 00:31:24.489
questions that the film asks for me is
that is precisely has to do with how

00:31:24.489 --> 00:31:24.499
that is precisely has to do with how
 

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:27.159
that is precisely has to do with how
much things have changed in terms of how

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:27.169
much things have changed in terms of how
 

00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:29.019
much things have changed in terms of how
we conceive of social movements for

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:29.029
we conceive of social movements for
 

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:31.690
we conceive of social movements for
instance we have a huge social movement

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:31.700
instance we have a huge social movement
 

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.710
instance we have a huge social movement
in this country around immigration

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720
in this country around immigration
 

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.200
in this country around immigration
rights does anybody know who the leader

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.210
rights does anybody know who the leader
 

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:40.269
rights does anybody know who the leader
is there is no leader you know there's a

00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279
is there is no leader you know there's a
 

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:42.519
is there is no leader you know there's a
multiplicity of actions in various

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:42.529
multiplicity of actions in various
 

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:44.680
multiplicity of actions in various
fronts with various tactics and various

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:44.690
fronts with various tactics and various
 

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.989
fronts with various tactics and various
relationships to each other using media

00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:46.999
relationships to each other using media
 

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:48.369
relationships to each other using media
which is something that the film and the

00:31:48.369 --> 00:31:48.379
which is something that the film and the
 

00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:50.169
which is something that the film and the
moment about the moment and the film

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:50.179
moment about the moment and the film
 

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:52.600
moment about the moment and the film
capture and anticipate that that would

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:52.610
capture and anticipate that that would
 

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.129
capture and anticipate that that would
be a very important aspect of

00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:54.139
be a very important aspect of
 

00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:56.169
be a very important aspect of
mobilization but with the contradictions

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:56.179
mobilization but with the contradictions
 

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:58.899
mobilization but with the contradictions
that you have been mentioned or the

00:31:58.899 --> 00:31:58.909
that you have been mentioned or the
 

00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:03.129
that you have been mentioned or the
paradoxes of this new digital moment so

00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:03.139
paradoxes of this new digital moment so
 

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:04.600
paradoxes of this new digital moment so
in that regard I think one question to

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:04.610
in that regard I think one question to
 

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.359
in that regard I think one question to
be explored it's actually not only the

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:07.369
be explored it's actually not only the
 

00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:09.220
be explored it's actually not only the
continuities that are the questions that

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:09.230
continuities that are the questions that
 

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.769
continuities that are the questions that
the film raises that we might recognize

00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:11.779
the film raises that we might recognize
 

00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:14.019
the film raises that we might recognize
as still problems to this day but also

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:14.029
as still problems to this day but also
 

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:15.789
as still problems to this day but also
the discontinuity because that does

00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799
the discontinuity because that does
 

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:18.200
the discontinuity because that does
raise the questions of strategies

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.210
raise the questions of strategies
 

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:23.030
raise the questions of strategies
and modes of mobilization yeah I

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.040
and modes of mobilization yeah I
 

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.640
and modes of mobilization yeah I
particularly like that point as well and

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:25.650
particularly like that point as well and
 

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.010
particularly like that point as well and
one of my reactions to the film this is

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020
one of my reactions to the film this is
 

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.720
one of my reactions to the film this is
might as well my second time seeing it

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:29.730
might as well my second time seeing it
 

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.030
might as well my second time seeing it
and I'm also having a different reaction

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:32.040
and I'm also having a different reaction
 

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.180
and I'm also having a different reaction
to it as well I do have first of all I

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:35.190
to it as well I do have first of all I
 

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.060
to it as well I do have first of all I
like the film I'm not a filmmaker so you

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.070
like the film I'm not a filmmaker so you
 

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.620
like the film I'm not a filmmaker so you
want me to take issue with it I like to

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:39.630
want me to take issue with it I like to
 

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.840
want me to take issue with it I like to
lose executed I thought the acting was

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:41.850
lose executed I thought the acting was
 

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.880
lose executed I thought the acting was
particularly good I'm again I'm not even

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:43.890
particularly good I'm again I'm not even
 

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:49.580
particularly good I'm again I'm not even

a film critic so as well but i also have
and this goes back some of the gym said

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:51.510
and this goes back some of the gym said
 

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.410
and this goes back some of the gym said
earlier i do have some questions about

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:54.420
earlier i do have some questions about
 

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.980
earlier i do have some questions about
the differences or what are the elisions

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:57.990
the differences or what are the elisions
 

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.710
the differences or what are the elisions
or the very fine lines between dramatic

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720
or the very fine lines between dramatic
 

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.120
or the very fine lines between dramatic
license and even though i am a historian

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.130
license and even though i am a historian
 

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.430
license and even though i am a historian
I will allow dramatic lights inside I'm

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440
I will allow dramatic lights inside I'm
 

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.590
I will allow dramatic lights inside I'm
not you know i don't kind of fetishize

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600
not you know i don't kind of fetishize
 

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600
not you know i don't kind of fetishize
the archive and every my new detail has

time then i believe that there should be
 

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.090
time then i believe that there should be
literary license but there are some

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100
literary license but there are some
 

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.250
