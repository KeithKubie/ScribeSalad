were coniferous reptiles that thrived

under water they had the upper part of

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
under water they had the upper part of
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.630
under water they had the upper part of
the paddle essentially so just imagine

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640
the paddle essentially so just imagine
 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.530
the paddle essentially so just imagine
the shaft of the limb bone coming down

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540
the shaft of the limb bone coming down
 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.880
the shaft of the limb bone coming down
broadening out in this way and also

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890
broadening out in this way and also
 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.000
broadening out in this way and also
going from round to flat again along

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010
going from round to flat again along
 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.670

along the end of this bone would have

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680
along the end of this bone would have
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.159
along the end of this bone would have
been what are equivalent to our wrist

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169
been what are equivalent to our wrist
 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.790
been what are equivalent to our wrist
bones and then beyond that extending out

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
bones and then beyond that extending out
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.930
bones and then beyond that extending out
would have been what are equivalent to

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940
would have been what are equivalent to
 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940
would have been what are equivalent to
our finger bones just like in a in a sea

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950
our finger bones just like in a in a sea
 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.279
our finger bones just like in a in a sea
turtle today or in a dolphin today the

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289
turtle today or in a dolphin today the
 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.370
turtle today or in a dolphin today the
finger bones have been elongated and

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380
finger bones have been elongated and
 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.830
finger bones have been elongated and
there's many more than just the three

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840
there's many more than just the three
 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.350
there's many more than just the three
finger bones and each of our fingers

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.050
