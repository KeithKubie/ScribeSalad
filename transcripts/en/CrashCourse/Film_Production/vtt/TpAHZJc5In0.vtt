00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.180
Making a film can seem... daunting.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.740
After you have a screenplay and have done
your pre-production, you still have to film the thing.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.060
And you’re gonna need help.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.540
Orson Welles once said, “A writer needs
a pen, an artist needs a brush, but a filmmaker

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.540
needs an army.”

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.730
But he also co-wrote, produced, directed,
and starred in Citizen Kane.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.730
So which is it?

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.260
Do you need hundreds of people, or a couple
of disciplined artists doing everything?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.920
Well, It depends on your movie.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.140
Every successful film production has the same
kinds of jobs, but the scale can vary a lot.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.660
Every story has different needs.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.040
And maybe the best place to start sizing up
the needs of your project is in the inner

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.110
workings of a film set, where the actual filming
takes place.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.570
And then of course there are the people – the
crew that work on and off set during principal

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.700
photography, when most of the movie is being
filmed.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.520
I'm Lily Gladstone, and this is Crash Course Film Production.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:00.340
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.720
Some people refer to different positions in
a film crew as “above the line” or “below the line.”

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.359
This idea is a holdover from the studio days,
when budgets on paper had a literal line between

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.359
different jobs.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.090
The people “above the line,” like writers,
directors, producers, and certain actors,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.049
negotiated payment before shooting began.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.599
And those “below the line” were paid a
rate for every day they worked.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.140
If we’re sticking with Orson Welles’ analogy,
everyone “below the line” is a filmmaker’s army.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.659
The General of that army is the Unit Production
Manager, or UPM.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.070
Usually, the director picks key creative roles
to support the vision of the film, like the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.149
production designer and cinematographer

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.140
But the UPM is responsible for hiring everyone
else and managing all the moving parts of a production.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.140
They oversee pre-production, from picking
locations to planning out the shooting schedule.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.249
And sometimes they’re on set when a scene
is being filmed.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.249
But not always.

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.590
They might be checking in with the Art Department
to make sure sets are ready for the next day’s

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.899
shoot, or visiting the Production Office to
work with someone like the production accountant,

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.270
who makes sure everyone gets paid.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.240
The UPM is also the point of contact for any
local authorities and companies the production

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
is working with.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.149
Now, the person running a film set is the
head of the Production Department: the 1st

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.909
Assistant Director, or 1st AD.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.539
They work with the director to schedule the
details of each day’s shoot and communicate

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.099
what every department needs to do.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.480
Plus, they’re responsible for keeping everyone
safe.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.080
If you’ve ever visited a film set and saw
someone you thought was the director, it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.340
was probably the 1st AD.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.879
They’re the ones “calling the roll”
to tell people to do specific things at specific

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.000
moments – shouting things like “roll sound,”
“roll camera,” and sometimes even “Action!”

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.860
While the 1st AD is always on set, the 2nd
Assistant Director, or 2nd AD, is usually

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.659
at base camp, which is just off set.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.030
Base camp is the behind-the-scenes of the
behind-the-scenes.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.790
It’s usually where the crew eats lunch,
where the bathrooms are, and where the department

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.819
and actor trailers are.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.300
The 2nd AD is the main point of contact between
the set and the actors when they’re not acting.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.180
They make the daily call sheet, which is the
document that tells everyone in the cast and

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.630
crew where they need to be, when, and who
they report to the next day.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.010
When a scene has extras, or background talent,
the 2nd AD may go on set to work with these actors.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.560
They also oversee the rest of the production
hierarchy – any other ADs, and Production Assistants.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.680
We call them P.A.s.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.790
PAs are the lowest rung on this ladder, but
they’re still super important.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.269
There’s a pretty good chance that everyone
on a set has been a PA at some point.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.660
Their main job is anticipating needs and communicating
between departments, like by making sure everyone

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.530
hears all the 1st AD’s calls.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.370
So, the production team is the glue that holds
the film set and all the crew together.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.290
And there are a bunch of departments.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.580
Let’s start with the Camera Department.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.930
The person responsible for the look of the
film is the Director of Photography, or DP,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.459
also called the cinematographer.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.370
They work with the director to translate the
script into a shot list, which is a plan for

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.769
how to visually convey every single scene.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.290
The 1st AD uses the shot list to plan the
daily schedule.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.760
On an independent film, the cinematographer
might also be the camera operator.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.400
But, usually, the cinematographer directs
the camera crew, which includes operators

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.260
and camera assistants, or ACs.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.159
While ACs aren’t actually framing shots
and operating the camera, the First AC helps

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.010
focus the camera, so they’re sometimes
known as the Focus Puller.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.480
ACs also maintain equipment and keep camera
notes for continuity.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.549
Cinematographers need to understand story,
cameras, and lighting to pack a visual punch.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.779
So they work with the Gaffer, also known as
the Chief Lighting Technician.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.540
They’re the head of the Electric Department,
and design and implement the lighting of each scene.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.100
The Gaffer’s second-in-command is called
the Best Boy or Best Boy Electric – no matter

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.109
their gender.

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.389
Both the titles “Gaffer” and “Best Boy”
have been around since at least the 1930s,

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.970
but it’s unclear how the names came to mean
“head electricians.”

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.609
On smaller crews, the Electric Department
might be just a Gaffer and a Best Boy.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.740
But on larger crews, these two might organize
dozens of electricians and lots of equipment.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.180
And you can’t talk about Electric without
talking about the Grip Department.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.949
These departments are close buddies, and are
sometimes called G&amp;E.

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.800
While Electric oversees lighting and getting
power to the set, Grip oversees all the rigging for lights.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.220
That includes all stands for lights as well
as flags, silks, and nets, which are fabric

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.610
used to control or block light.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.990
Grip also handles specialized rigging for
other departments too, like cranes, dollies,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.050
and dolly track, which help with specific
camera movements.The Key Grip leads the team,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.860
and their number two is the Best Boy Grip,
who carries out the Key Grip’s plans for rigging.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.740
G&amp;E is often the largest department on set
during filming.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.080
But the smallest department is only one person:
the Script Supervisor, or “scripty,” who’s

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.440
in charge of – you guessed it – the script.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.340
Here at Crash Course, we call them "Supes."

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.470
They make sure the actors stay true to the
writer’s dialogue.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.500
So if you ever hear an actor call “line,”
they probably forgot what to say and are asking

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.050
the Script Supervisor for help.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.800
This department is also called Continuity
because the “scripty” is responsible for

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.650
thinking ahead to how the editor will cut
everything together.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.889
To hear all the words being said, the script
supervisor needs to work with the Sound Department.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.610
The head is the Sound Recordist, or Sound
Mixer, whose job is to hear everything.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.680
They’re usually just off-set, monitoring
sound in a slightly quieter place.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.970
They manage the boom operator, who’s on
set and trying to get the microphone as close

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.690
as possible to the actors’ mouths without
being in the shot.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.190
Now, all the departments we’ve talked about
so far are involved in capturing the film.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.940
But there are a bunch that work both on and
off set to create the world that’s being captured.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.979
The Art Department, for instance, designs,
builds, or transforms sets, finds and creates

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.759
props, and dresses each location to match
the director’s vision for each scene.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.450
Their fearless leader is the Production Designer,
who works with the director in pre-production

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.919
to create the look of the world.

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.940
Then, the Art Director organizes everyone
else and makes the Production Designer’s

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.940
plans real.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.729
Everything in the mise-en-scène is found
or made by the Art Department.

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.130
So the more complex a film is, the larger
the team tends to be.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.419
Similarly, the Wardrobe Department is responsible
for channeling the themes of the film, time

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.129
period, setting, and character traits into
the clothing of each character in each scene.

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.590
Even if it looks like someone doesn’t have
any costume changes, they probably have different

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.290
versions of the same outfit – like a bloody
shirt, or ripped pants – depending on what

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.290
happens in the film.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.319
The Costume Designer is responsible for pre-production
planning.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.410
While everything on set and in the wardrobe
trailer is overseen by the Costume Supervisor.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.490
Set costumers dress and undress actors before
and after shooting, paying close attention

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.780
to continuity between scenes.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.780
And to complement Wardrobe, there’s Hair
and MakeUp, or HMU, which tend to get lumped

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.870
together as one department.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.870
Of all the crew, Wardrobe and HMU spend the
most one-on-one time with actors, and play

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.440
an important role in making them feel safe
and confident while doing their work.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.639
A film with a very small cast might have one
person who does all the makeup and hair styling,

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.870
while larger casts might have an HMU artist
for each lead actor.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.569
Most makeup artists can make people look really
good or bad or rough, depending on what a

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:02.569
scene calls for.

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.030
And if a film needs a lot of specialized makeup,
like scars for a war or full-on monster faces,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.060
then you call a Special Effects MakeUp Artist.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.000
They’re the bridge between HMU and the Special
Effects Department, which is led by the Special

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.289
Effects Supervisor.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.750
Special Effects is in charge of every on-set
effect, from creating artificial snow or rain,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.470
to orchestrating a car crash or an epic explosion.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.199
I’ve mentioned safety before, but it’s
worth repeating over and over again.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.400
Especially when we’re talking about special
effects or stunts, which are cast and choreographed

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.599
by the Stunt Coordinator.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.740
Before potentially-dangerous scenes, the 1st AD will repeat all the general safety instructions on set.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.840
Then, either the Special Effects Supervisor
or Stunt Coordinator will talk through what

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.680
should happen, and what everyone should
do if something goes wrong.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.270
Most crews will have at least one trained
Set Medic, like an EMT.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.629
Or a special team might be brought in, if
a potentially dangerous scene is being filmed.

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.259
Now, we’ve talked about almost everyone
you might find on a set.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:55.240
But where the set is changes throughout
a film – thanks to the Locations Department.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.479
In pre-production, the scout will search for
places to film, based on the script and practicality.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.960
Once the director and producers approve of
the locations, the department keys will go

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.759
on a “tech scout” to make sure they can
do their work, too.

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.110
What we see on-screen is actually just one
small part of the location!

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.909
The location manager and location assistants
plan where everything will go, from the set

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.930
that will appear on camera to all the trailers
in base camp.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.910
They’re first to arrive and last to leave.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.940
The second people to arrive are usually drivers
in the Transportation Department, which is

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.569
overseen by the Transportation Manager.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:27.139
They get all the large equipment and trailers
to the set, and shuttle cast and crew

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.139
back and forth.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:30.360
Obviously, the more people you have, the bigger
the team you’ll need.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.040
And, speaking of big teams, the one job that
should never be forgotten, is actually two jobs.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.580
And it’s feeding all these people!
Catering companies are contracted by the UPM

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.890
to cook 1 to 3 meals per day.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.840
And the Craft Service person is the crew member
that manages a station of snacks and drinks

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.840
on set.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.930
Both the person and station can be affectionately
called “Crafty.”

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.960
During a difficult day of shooting, “Crafty”
might be the only thing keeping you going.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.910
The power of a granola bar and a friendly
face should never be underestimated!

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.610
Like, ever.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.320
Seriously, feed your cast and crew.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.700
And make sure you're paying attention to allergy and dietary restrictions.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.680
No one is doing that to be high maintenance.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.720
Crewing a film set is demanding work, but
it’s work that attracts people who really

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720
love it.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.470
We could easily make a 90-minute video about
all these talented people… but, y’know,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.470
scale!

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.700
Today we discussed scalability and how the
needs of a film dictate the size of a film crew.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.980
We learned about the different departments
and jobs on a set and how they interact.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.040
And next time, we’ll start diving into these
roles in more detail, starting with that piece

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.130
of equipment at the center of every set: the
camera.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.090
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.440
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.970
PBS Infinite Series, Deep Look, and Brain
Craft.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.760
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.600
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
