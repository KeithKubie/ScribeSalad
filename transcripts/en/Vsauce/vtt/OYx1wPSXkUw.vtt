00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
Macaroni and cheese scented air fresheners
and bacon and egg earrings.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.400
It's episode 19 of LÃœT.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.420
This clock tells the correct time, except

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.460
it runs backwards.
And Thailand Unique will sell you a bottle

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.060
of whiskey with a cobra in it, delicious chocolate
covered silkworms, a can of BBQ scorpions

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.900
or a nice bag of edible pregnant crickets.
If the thought of eating bugs leaves you with

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.580
cold feet, make them colder with this snowball
shooting crossbow and then warm them back

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.920
up with these USB powered heated slippers.
Or, show your team spirit with Vat19's giant

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.310
puffy NFL sneaker slippers while feeding your
baby with an Enterprise spoon that can drip

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.870
food all over a flashing LED tricky bib.
Your bib, of course, should be formal.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.450
Buy a baby rattle that makes your baby look
buff and when they get older don't give them

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.460
army men, give them breakdance men.
Or treat yourself to a cute cuddly stuffed

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.799
animal cupcake, a pistol with a cowboy hat,
a slice of pizza, a stack of pancakes or,

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.439
my favourite, the zebra rabbit with a moustache.
Get your lady a pair of hand-painted Star

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.280
Wars shoes or these eye shadows from GeekChic
cosmetics, based on the colours of the Mushroom

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.950
Kingdom.
Oh, and don't forget this shade of lipstick,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.170
it's called Hipster Ariel.
Be even hipper with a levitating lamp that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
looks like it's been slashed by a light sabre.
And here's a wire frame you can use to make

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.829
any chair suggest the idea of a throne.
Ferrofluids are colloids containing magnetic

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.520
material, so they respond to magnetic fields
and their own cohesion and surface tension.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.740
You can buy a whole play kit or a litter of
the stuff.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.620
Now, just don't drink it.
Instead, drink some civet coffee.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.600
This coffee is produced by having civets run
around eating the very best beans they find.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.259
These guys swallow it, digest it and enzymes
in their intestine change the beans, which

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.799
they poop out completely whole.
So farmers collect the poop, wash it off,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.300
roast the beans and produce for you the best,
smoothest and most expensive coffee on earth.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.060
Full disclosure - I bought some of this last
year for my dad on Father's Day and it was

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.340
delicious.
I'm gonna shout out ScienceBob.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.040
Now, you Leanbackers know him, his site store
is cool.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.480
He's got smoke shooting guns and smoke guans,
owl pallets that you can dissect to get rat

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.750
bones out of.
Science for the win.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.530
And as always,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.670
thanks for watching.
