00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.910
With our routes and

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.080
database in place, we can now add the
actual CRUD Functionality to our page.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.960
Write in the appropriate SQLAlchemy
statements for the following methods.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.220
We also need to add url_for and

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.600
redirects to our application,
when necessary.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.850
Some of our routes need to be able to
respond to get, and post requests.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.910
Be sure to add this functionality,
as well.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.230
When you are done with this step,
you should have a prototype,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.560
where all the CRUD operations
are fully functional.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.850
This might be a time consuming iteration
to get everything working, but

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.330
I encourage you to stick with it,
and not give up.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.300
Use the documentation on the Python
Flask in SQLAlchemy websites if

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.350
needed, as well.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.940
Also do not hesitate to reach
out to your fellow students.
