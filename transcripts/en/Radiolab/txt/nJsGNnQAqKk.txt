Speaker 1:          00:03          You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio, W, C, n, n. P. R.

Speaker 2:          00:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:23          This is Radiolab on Jab and Rod. Today we're in a doctor Frankenstein sort of mood, so we figure we're better to start death test and at the museum, American Museum of natural history where they have on a kind of Frankenstein exit. Okay, I'm Laurel Candle. I curate the American Museum of Natural History is exhibit mythic creatures. We're standing in front of a dragon now. Why would there be a dragon at the Museum of Natural History? Well, according to the curator, Laurel Kendall, yes, the human mind loves to wonder, well, what would happen if we put wings on a horse or put a tail on a beautiful woman? Dad is human justified, however you want that belongs in the museum. What you see before you, we'd begin these all strange twisting creatures, a dimly lit, and when you look more closely, you realize that they're all mashups from the natural world. For example, she takes us over to one corner points at a class case we're inside. What you're seeing is this creepy little hybrid skeleton thing. Look at this spaced and see how it really is a composite. Half of it is a monkey, the upper half monkey skull and the lower half is a fish tail. Like some kind of trout with some scales, places full of stuff like this. A Elian with an eagle head. Humans with snake tails, just spending thing. You can imagine. Very operatic. Oh, and I forgot to mention the most important part. Kid.

Speaker 3:          01:46          Tons and tons of kids completely in awe. Oh my God. Your uniform. What are we standing under here? The Pegasus. Can you describe what we're seeing here is a horse. The body's like a horse. He has these really big wings, wings like birds, like an eagle. Maybe somehow his parents were a horse and a bird in there. Their genes, um, together too. Make a Pegasus. Just what I see that what I see. It just looks so exciting that it just looks really cool. And when you ask these kids, is there a producer? Little Miller did. Why is it cool? Like why is it fun to see two animals mashed together? Um, will they just look at you like you're dumb. So Horse [inaudible] yes. Um, birds, they're not mythical. They're like the regular every day you see them, every time you just see a pigeon you're like, oh, whatever. Maybe it's that simple. Yeah. Any case the kids would get sick of us and are dumb questions ran off to this kiosk at the museum and set up around the corner right here where they could actually build their own creatures. Okay. Now can you, your guy here? Well he has um, seven heads and he has a tail with fire on it for a lay. He has a long body and the thing is how the legs are though, you can't help them.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Chicken leg, like these same kids in about 30 or 40 years might actually be able to do this for real.

Speaker 4:          03:17          Where did that grown up? Those kids will be at home in the new world of biotechnology. They won't be ready to put their skills to use. That will be do it yourself kits to breed new varieties of pigeons and parrots and lizards and snakes.

Speaker 3:          03:30          I buy like a snake and then like a bird. Oh, can I do it? Cause I never got

Speaker 4:          03:35          genetic engineering. Once it gets into the hands of housewives and children will give us an explosion of diversity of new living creatures.

Speaker 1:          03:43          That is physicists, Freeman Dyson. We'll hear more from him later. Now, whether it's true or not, what he's saying, it does seem to be the case that we are at this pivotal point now where the stuff that we used to only imagine might actually turn into reality, which is why maybe you get an exhibit of fantasy creatures at the Museum of natural history. This is a celebration of the human imagination. Human Ingenuity. Human. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:14          [inaudible] name of God. Oh, I know what it feels like to be gone.

Speaker 1:          04:35          That's our show today. Life, but not as we know it. Life as we might invent it, tweak it, augment it. Yes. But if you augment, tweak, and remake, people will quickly come to you and say, Hey, don't fuss with this. It's not natural. It's not right. Speaking of right and natural and fussing. Who are you? Oh I'm sorry. I, Robert Krulwich who was always right, always naturally and always fussing that word you, you mentioned um, natural. Yeah, that one. Natural. What does it mean exactly? Let's just think usually means what it means, what's familiar, what we know, who we know. Let's say. Let's just muck that up a bit because it turns out when you look in nature you will find things that are frankly very strange and not familiar. Like, well, let me tell you a story. It's an amazing story about a woman heard about it from a reporter, Soren Wheeler.

Speaker 1:          05:23          I sworn right. Hey, it's a Soren. Tell me about Karen. Well Karen is, I'm a mother of three, a middle aged woman living outside of Boston and the suburbs of Boston and uh, she lives there with her husband Pete. The kids are out of the house now. Tell me what you were thinking when you walked up to her door. Well, I, I was nervous. I was kind of strangely nervous about meeting her. Hi Karen. Hi. But I got there and she was just friendly as can be, bring in a couple of cups of tea. She made me tea, we sat in the living room and talk and uh, she was just

Speaker 5:          05:58          normal, which it's kind of weird given the story that she was about to tell me. So let's start at the very beginning. Oh, well in 1995, I was told that I needed a kidney transplant immediately. What's that like? Like what are you going through? It was frightening. The doctors told Karen they needed to act fast. They asked me who in my family might be willing to donate a kidney. The two older boys, that's Matt and Jess and Karen's husband Pete, you all went in to get what should have been a pretty routine DNA test. Yup. They had the blood work done and they waited. A couple of weeks later I got a phone call from the hospital and they said, Mrs Keegan, um, this is a very unusual situation that we're, uh, going to explain to you. It's something that we've never seen before. But uh, when the DNA testing was done on your sons, we found that they didn't match your DNA.

Speaker 5:          07:10          Is that how they said it? They said they match the father, but they're not a match for you. What does that mean? That they didn't match her DNA? She's not their mother ready much here. And this was crazy. Yeah. I mean she told them, well I was there. This could not possibly be. I gave birth to these kids. I felt the pain. You know, you better do the test again because you're obviously wrong. And so they did do the test again. Same result. The read was correct. There was not a laboratory error. This is one of her doctors when you, we, we felt particularly after the second time that it was real. And then they said, now we have had situations where the husband's DNA didn't match, but we've never had a mother whose DNA didn't match their children. Mm hmm.

Speaker 1:          08:02          So wait, if the DNA saying she's not the mom, then what would explain that? Well, first thought was that there was some kind of mix, some switch babies or something like a baby switch right after birth kind of thing. Yeah. But the problem with that is that the dad is, the dad is, or the fathers. Right. So you have to figure out like how could they have gotten the wrong kid, but the right dad says, then what if, if that's the case, here's the thing at this, at this point, as we got further involved with this, people are thinking maybe Karen's done something kind of fishing. There must be something that you're not being told. Like maybe she implanted her womb with another woman's baby and then she just kind of lied about it. Yeah, that she lied about it. They said, well, could you tell us what hospital you had these children and how exactly how, what would, I'm still confused as being accused of being some kind of monster who maybe

Speaker 5:          08:56          wish they had children stolen that child or something had to be, because obviously DNA is never wrong. It's never wrong. Wow. So how did she talk to her family about this? What are those conversations like? I do remember some very sort of sad moments. Bless my sons. Yeah. You know, I told them, I don't think they maybe even completely realized what I was saying. Lynn, Karen's doctor couldn't get this out of her head. Something wasn't adding up. Didn't make sense. So she thought about the fact that they'd done all of the tests on Karen's blood, only in our blood cells. So Lynn started thinking maybe the next step they ought to look at some other parts. And to do that we would need to test other tissues, scrape the inside of your mouth and get a little saliva and maybe a hair or to thyroid and a skin biopsy with you're getting all sorts of parts, you're getting a law parts and all kinds of parts from me.

Speaker 5:          10:02          That's when things started to get strange. When we got the results of the tissue studies, we identified two, two, two, two sets of DNA. Two people to what? Another person in Karen, she had another person inside her. Well sort of. She did have a separate set of DNA. So it was like she had another person with its own genetic identity in her body. And the thing is that that other person that was the mother of the boys, well how did they get there? That, I mean that's what the doctors were wondering. So they all sit down, put their heads together and try to figure it out and then it hit him. You were a twin. You are a twin. She, I mean she had a twin. No, she's both twins. Here's what happened in Karen's mother's womb. Originally there were two eggs, two fertilized eggs, twin girls side by side, developing in their own separate sacks. Then after a couple of days, something strange happened. Somehow the two embryos bumped into each other and they fused into one unit and that one became Karen. Like a mixture of the two of them. Well, no, they didn't blend according to Lynn, what happened is they kind of claimed different parts of, they still had their own, I want to say boundaries. One twin claimed her blood and the other twin claimed her thyroid and her bladder. And Karen is a plural.

Speaker 6:          11:37          Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          11:41          is this, has this, has this happened before? Well, supposedly it's pretty rare, but it does happen. In fact, there's, there's a scientific word for this condition. Karen first heard that word from her doctor, Margo cres. Margo came to my bedside, explained that I was a Chi. Mira a term which I had never heard of.

Speaker 7:          12:02          Did she fall? Did she come and say, you're a Chi Kymera and it, yeah.

Speaker 5:          12:05          Yes. Now that was interesting because I called my son the English major and said, Matt, I've found out I was a Chi Mira, and he said, oh, well, you know what a Kai Mira is, don't you? And I said, no. And he said, well,

Speaker 2:          12:23          in the ancient Greek myths, I, Thai Mira is an animal that has like a lion, has a donkey's a goat, Kale, you know, it's a mixture and Greek myths. The Camaro was a monster that the heroes opposed to slay. That didn't make me feel very good.

Speaker 7:          12:52          Then Karen learned more about what Kymera meant medically and what could've happened to her.

Speaker 5:          12:58          If the eggs hadn't fused. Within four days, I would have become a Siamese twin. When you hear that, you immediately have a more concrete vision of two selves. It brought home the reality that I really was a twin. She is a twin. One doctor said, do you think you have two souls? I think of myself,

Speaker 8:          13:35          yeah. There is

Speaker 5:          13:38          almost a sort of subtle sadness to sink did I would've had a sister. Yeah. And so there is sort of a shadow feeling of loss.

Speaker 8:          13:54          There could have been more

Speaker 5:          14:01          thanks to reporter Soren Wheeler for that.

Speaker 9:          14:07          Let's make things a little more disturbing now because human beings, scientists are now capable of creating kindnesses purposefully. And we talked to Lee silver who is a scientist at Princeton elite. Okay. Lee, you have to say something.

Speaker 7:          14:21          Okay. You know my left ear is receiving more than my right. Is there a, when he told us about an intentional Kemira, a creature created by a Danish embryologist named Steen Wilson. Keith took a goat embryo and a sheep embryo and he pushed them together in his petri dish. But that mixture of embryo back into a female, I don't remember which species. And then what was born was an animal that was part part sheep and he called that agape. Was it visibly kind of goatee and kind of sheepy? Well it was actually, yes, it was very visible. And what happened because of the way development occurs, parts of its body looks, sheep like and parts of its body look goat. Like which parts? Well, he did this multiple times and so he actually got multiple gifts and sometimes the animal would have for goat had, but then parts of his body would be sheep, like with wool. Other times it would have a sheep. How confusing it would be at the dance. You wouldn't know like who was supposed to dance with home? Could, could gifts relate with one another in that way. I don't remember. It's not a deep, as you may look, a little beard and everything in the hooves.

Speaker 2:          15:38          Ah,

Speaker 1:          15:39          I mean, just to give you a visual, we've got a picture here of three beeps hanging out near a tree. Do you want to describe it? Well, the Geeks, one of them looks like a naked animal wearing the coat of shaggy hair is, it's got this streak of sheep wool running on its back, but the rest of it looks kind of Godi. Which deal do you find a cute? I kind of do find it cute. Well, Bucknell, it's an cuted a bit. Suppose instead of talking about mixing sheep with goats, okay, since you're not a sheep or a goat, let's make it more personal.

Speaker 7:          16:15          People are most worried about combining human embryonic cells and monkey or chimp embryonic cells. And so the idea is if you took a chimp embryo in a human embryo and you push them together based on the Geek results, based on lots of other data that scientists have accumulated, it's very likely that you'd have an organism born that was part chimp, part human. Well, there once was a creature like that because

Speaker 9:          16:42          if you believe in evolution, you believe that chimps eventually became humans. So somewhere in history there is someone who is 10% chimp and 90%

Speaker 7:          16:54          and that common ancestor evolved continuously and slowly from a chimp like, um, individual to human. And in every point along the 100,000 generations, the children didn't look very different from their parents. But here's the,

Speaker 9:          17:09          here's the very sad Hollywood movie. I go and I go and I create a creature, a jeep like you know, amalgamation, which is 50% chimpanzee, ape and 50% human homosapiens and he's the only one that's like creating a tragedy. It seems like because you'd be creating someone who is isolated in his physiology.

Speaker 7:          17:39          Yes. I mean this is agreed with him on, maybe they could, but at the cost of you're taping us opening something. I'm opening something for good. This is actually a play here. You can look at this. It's going to be performed next week. Sweet. Sweet Motherhood, isn't it? Yes, that's it.

Speaker 9:          17:58          So this is a play at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Shelley McCann wants to baby a human chimpanzee baby. Oh. Shelley's been spending too much time partying to build up a respectable grade point average. So she proposes the following senior thesis, fertilized one of her eggs with the sperm from a chimpanzee in her womb. It's an interesting term paper. So professor Harry Stein must do everything he can to stop her. The play is inspired by a true event. Really?

Speaker 7:          18:32          This is your play. Yes. Jeremy character is the main playwright and I've collaborated with him. What is the true truth? And I watch this, his base, the true event is that, uh, about 10, 12 years ago now, I was talking to my usual flippant way to a bunch of students and a sequence information had just come out showing that chimps and humans were almost 90% the same at the DNA level. And so I just threw out the idea, well, based on what we know about goats and sheep and everything else, you probably could have a hybrid developed between a chimpanzee and human beings. It was a thought experiment. What would it be? How would it developed which of its characteristics be human, which would be chimpanzee? The next day a student, a junior came to my office and said she wanted to do the experiment inside her own womb.

Speaker 7:          19:25          Ah, and uh, so then yes, uh, in real life, what did you do? He hit her on the head with a baseball bat or, well, no, I had a long, I was flabbergasted. She was absolutely serious because she is actually true. She, she was this student who partied a lot and she needed and the senior thesis at Princeton counts an enormous amount in towards your final GPA. So, uh, she wanted to do this unique experiment hoping she'd get an a plus in her senior thesis. And she was very naive obviously. That was the last time I saw this little chimpanzee up for adoption. As soon as it was born. Well, no, no worse. She posted that she, I asked her, what would you do with this individual? I said, well, if it's a human being, you have to raise it like a human being and as rights, like human being, if it's a chimpanzee, you put her in a zoo or you use it, use it for experiments and what's it going to be? And her answer to that question was she would abort right before it came time to go into labor, she'd board. And so the whole idea of the senior thesis was to study the development of this hybrid inside of her womb. She really wanted to do this for real, not just on paper for a project, but actually she wants, yes. Now, there are many, many, many, many problems. Do meaning liberal arts education, really liberal here. We talked for about an hour. Um, I dissuaded her. I never saw her again

Speaker 9:          20:54          except in a way in his play. The, when he cowrote road. This is the play about the teacher at the fancy university. It happens just to be teaching a biology class, the human ovary within the masters. But it happens to have this notion about what would it be like if chimps and humans had babies together. Actually in a number, I am more similar to a MailChimp than I am to my sister happens to have in the play. The student who comes up after class and says, I want to combine one of my eggs with chimpanzees wants you to do this except by the way in the play checks he goes through with it.

Speaker 7:          21:31          But you know, he, he wrote the play to keep a conversation going that wouldn't get out of his hand. And the question is what is a human being? Um, if you look at a developmentally, evolutionarily through these hybrids and time areas, where's the boundary between human being and non human being? And at the end of my quest, I personally concluded that there is no boundary. No, no, no, no. It's fuzzy. So in other words, if you look at, the analogy I like to give is look at the color spectrum between green and blue. When you go from green to blue along the color spectrum, it's a continuous gradual change from one to the other. There's no point in which you say, here's the boundary between green and blue. And if you take that analogy, which I did, two human beings, you say during development or in evolution in the, in terms of a Kemira, there's no boundary.

Speaker 7:          22:26          But the social effect of having staked out that position is that you aren't going to defend our species against all kinds of amendments. There is a consequence to this kind of thinking, right? I mean, you can't do it cold porter, anything goes, can you know? No, I don't believe you can do anything goes. My purpose is to say, not that anything goes, but that in theory, all these outrageous things could happen and actually are happening. Here's an example, since 1980 scientists have been taking human genes, genetic information, putting it into mice. I mean this is sort of a routine procedure and for people who do mouse molecular genetics, and in fact the really exciting thing that people are doing now is they're making cows that are engineered to produce human blood. And the idea is that you want to change all the genes in the cow that normally produce the proteins in cow blood.

Speaker 7:          23:27          You want to make them all human so you'd have a cow making human blood. I don't think most people would mind that. And then you could use it for blood transfusions. Wow. Could you make a cow with human blood and a human kidney so that you could use that to, well, actually, uh, Ma, uh, Israeli scientists have already created a, that has a tiny little functioning human kidney can't out. I could show you the picture. Yeah. So, I mean, and you know when there are other people who are working with sheep and trying to make human livers and side sheep and the whole ideas is regenerative medicine, sacrifice the animals to get a new kidney for you. Now, I actually think that as long as you don't play with the external features, I think society walks up to it. I mean, you know, people eat pigs and if you can eat a pig, why not grow a pig to have a human liver or kidney or heart? As long as it still looks like a pig, you're saying that's right. As long as it still looks like a pig and it's still behaves like a pig. You know, if you put a human arm onto a pig, I don't think people would like that. But you acknowledge that the distinctions you're drawing are emotional distinctions and not rational. Absolutely. There are emotional, and I'm saying that sometimes emotional distinctions matter. I mean, I have no solutions. I mean, I don't know where to draw lines. Society has the draw lines.

Speaker 2:          24:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          24:44          radio, Radiolab. We'll continue in a moment.

Speaker 10:         24:46          Message one. Hi, this is Lee silver. Radiolab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation. Radiolab is produced by W N Y C York public radio and distributed by NPR national public radio.

Speaker 9:          25:11          Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Our topic today is, um, what is our topic today? Robert today is making life that isn't there before you arrived in the room. Okay. Uh, life not as we know it yet, but as we might invent it or make it. Well, let's talk about life. You and I. Okay. So when you look around in the world at living things, and I say, Look Dad, there's a cat and next to that is a dog and that's a tree. And you noticed that those things of course are different. Yes. And later when we go to school, we learn about phylum's and categories like kingdoms and stuff. So we've learned about the nature of those differences. And then you're taught about struggle and competition. Darwin species, there is a new theory that's being talked about that turns all of that on its head. I heard it first from this guy. I'm Steve Strogatz. I'm an applied mathematician at Cornell and the story he told me, which is based on analysis of DNA and very tiny organisms, microbes, is that once upon a time he says, life began with a very primitive, very simple collection of cells and these cells

Speaker 11:         26:22          [inaudible] like to shoot. It appears that legend, when you go back far enough, there's a kind of rampant sharing of molecules. It's a kind of orgy in which there are no well-defined species or organisms and I can give you my genes and you can pass. We're a commune. It was a calm year. What?

Speaker 9:          26:41          What does that mean? He's like, it was a, what do you mean? What does it mean? I know what it means in the 60 screen. Love sets, but what does it really mean? What are, what cells are exchanging is chemicals, chemicals that give them talents and traits. Genes. Here's what happens. I did this with [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         26:56          that are in our ancient puddle in Darwin thought the life might've begun in a warm puddle. Let's say that you and I are both cells. Okay? So once upon a time there was you and a puddle and I'm in the same Preble as you and it gets a little colder in the puddle. So we should all get sick. But you don't get sick, you don't have some kind of accidental talent. You can handle cold water. I'm shivering. Describe again what happens in it at this point in the glorious old days, my membrane that is I, I'm a cell, I've got a membrane, I've got my outer layer, maybe a little bit porous and maybe Lipson. I'm on my jeans just leaked out. Okay. We're not talking sophisticated organisms and maybe your poorest too and oh wow. You just absorbed some of those genes. So now we both have this, we both got and you both come. And if I've got this clean now I can survive cold water. And because it's part of me and if I bump into you now it's part of you. So now the Steve Jean has become a Robert King, which has then become Jag gene and we're doing it over and over and over and we're getting really um, come here.

Speaker 13:         28:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         28:06          it sounds so friendly. I actually don't think of sounds like, yeah,

Speaker 9:          28:10          people shout out all these exchanges. This gene swapping was not intentional. It's not purposeful sharing. That's Nigel Goldenfeld. I'm a theoretical physicist at the University of Illinois and he and his colleague Carl woes did the science that led to some of these kind of goofy ideas. It's not me sort of saying, hey, I'm going to just help out my buddy over there. Here's a couple of jeans. I think you'll find handy. It's not something like that. You can still, if we're swamping jeans so much and you know, you're giving me yours and I'm going to be mine, what does it actually mean to be me? Yeah. So much of me is spread around. Well, would be very weird. Imagine a world in which for a while I have your nose, God forbid, and then I get my nose back. You'd have Steve's hair, then I, Steve would get my ear. Then he would get your nose on to stall, having a lot of exchange. Take Your Chin. Okay. And you can have my, um, allergies. And then you start even asking what does it mean, um, to be a species. You can have my love affair with doubt. You may not even be able to talk about individuals. Yeah. If the mixing is good enough, we're all kind of indistinguishable. So identity would be very strange in this ancient world, but a lot of the concepts that we take for granted, the

Speaker 12:         29:24          biology become more and more nebulous as you get further and further back to the roots of the origin of life. Take for instance Charles Darwin. What Nigel is really saying is that for the first billion years of life with the be good to be everything that Darwin teaches, all that stuff happened in no borders, no individuals has no species. That is Darwinism evolution as we now understand it. That's an interlude

Speaker 2:          29:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         29:51          and the real story of life, it's only what's happening now. What you got back at the very beginning was a whole bunch of cells swapping genes, swapping advantages, swapping disadvantages, and this kind of goes wild, Huh? Tremendous explosion. What diversity in a way that life has not seen since then.

Speaker 2:          30:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         30:17          until one dark and terrible day, 3 billion years ago, as interpreted by Freeman Dyson, sweetening famous physicist and delivered here. Now our friend, the mathematician, Steve Strogatz, hears d one evil day, a bacterium anticipating Bill Gates by 3 billion years.

Speaker 14:         30:38          Refuse to share, refuse to share. Ooh, the first bad guy is this cellular bill. K Two who decides that you, I've got an innovation that I don't feel like sharing or possibly by found a way to keep my membrane from leaking. That is, I'm not going to be a sharing soul anymore. And why? I mean what made that one little cell decide to stop sharing? That's a good question. We don't really know, but what we do know this is was maybe the most dramatic moment in the history of life on earth. This transition from the age of, if you want to call it the age of sharing to the age of selfishness

Speaker 9:          31:17          and gradually once one creatures stopped sharing, pretty soon the others followed and then more and more did the same thing. And now for the first time in the history of life, finally we get Darwin. Now we get species. Now we see

Speaker 14:         31:30          differences. Yes, it's the age of identity of individualism. It's also the age of, of stasis. Things change, but they change much more slowly. And any great thing, you know, like you are a bat and you've figured out sonar. I don't have sonar, I can't get sonar. I mean I used to have sonar. Like you're at a little electric fish that lives in the muddy waters of the Amazon. You don't care. It's totally dark. You can see, because you can see with electricity, I can't see with electricity. If I'm in the dark, I'm bumping my head.

Speaker 15:         32:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          32:05          okay, so here's go. We end up chapter one one a greed orgy of genes swapping chapter two, do your g ends. We passed genes. Now, not two other guys, not randomly, but just to our own children. And finally here comes chip proposed by Freeman Dyson, the physicist in Dyson. After 3 billion years of life, slowly evolving through random mutations who bumps in the night? One species. Jad Human beings, you and me, we have become so smart, so well some of us so advanced that we can swap genes. We now decide who gets what genes and thanks to us evolution as Darwin described it is beginning to end and now we welcome evolution as described by Freeman Dyson to the graduating class at University of Michigan. I see it.

Speaker 4:          32:58          Bright future for the biotech industry becoming small and domesticated rather than big and centralized

Speaker 9:          33:04          Freeman thinks that in the future everybody means everybody. They will all be creating new life forms and why? Because they can. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          33:12          that will be do it yourself kits for gardeners who will use genetic engineering to breed new varieties of roses and Dawkins kits for lovers of pigeons and parrots and lizards and snakes to breed new varieties of pets. Genetic engineering. Once it gets into the hands of housewives and children will give us an explosion of diversity of new living creatures.

Speaker 2:          33:40          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          33:40          The final step in the domestication of biotechnology will be biotech games designed like computer games for children down to kindergarten age, but played with real eggs and seeds rather than with images. On the screen playing such games, kids will acquire an intimate feeling for the organisms that they're growing. The winner could be the kid who is seed grows the picklist cactus or the kid whose egg hatches the cutest dinosaur

Speaker 2:          34:20          [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          34:26          So there's your future. I'd like to make it your future for the moment, but it doesn't sound that bad. I mean, maybe a little cy fi. Well, actually the, here's the interesting thing is that what he's describing has already begun. There are kids doing this right now or something very close to it. How old were you when you did this? I guess I was 20 and 21 right now. Okay. Who are you, what's your name and what do you do? Uh, I'm Steven Payne. I'm a senior in biological engineering at MIT. Oh, here's the thing about Steven. He like most kids who are in the sciences in college had to spend hours and hours and hours in the lab waiting for eco lie slowly grow in a petri dish. Eco Lie, like the stuff that gives you food poisoning, it's the stuff, it's common bacteria that lives naturally in your gut. And it's, by the way, a big laboratory favorite. And the problem is, has Rashman said he was a grad student at MIT. Is He [inaudible] in the Ra actually smelled really bad. What does it smell like? I actually kind of smell, I guess maybe like pool. What do you think? It smells like feces. Anyway, Steven and his friends got into their heads that they could make Nike colada smell no nicer, nicer, like cinnamon or cherry or I like minty fresh. We ended up deciding on Wintergreen, wintergreen. Oh, you've got something against wintergreen. Let me know. In the real world who has winter green? Ah, it's the Petunia plant. Petunias have wintergreen. I have no idea.

Speaker 16:         35:51          Yeah. A lot of folks study. Why plants make nice smell. So why do roses smell nice? Why do Petunia Smell Nice? So what we did was we were requested from one of these folks and Italia Dude River from Purdue university. We asked her to send us a sample of one of the genes she had studied that produces this winter green smell. Oh, she mailed it through the mail. We opened it up. They took it.

Speaker 9:          36:11          What were you taking out? A little bit of gum. It's actually living cells. Living dried cells. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         36:16          We pulled out the DNA, put it into a new cell

Speaker 9:          36:19          and once the new DNA had done its thing, Steven called everybody into the lab

Speaker 16:         36:23          and then we all came over and were like, Whoa, these, you know, the sea cola culture actually does smell like mint.

Speaker 9:          36:29          And we were like, Yay, that's crazy. And so instead of smelling pool all day, they get to smell a winter green. Well actually there was more than that because after their winter green success, Steven and Rashman decided, you know, why should we stay in the, in the lab all day, even though it smells nicer now because we have to sit there and watch these ecol I grow and grow and grow until they are ready to be experimented on. We could be outside playing Frisbee. So they decided to put a little trigger inside the ecollege. So when it's done growing, it switches from winter green to banana. Banana,

Speaker 16:         37:01          yeah, the banana show. But yeah, it smells like a banana milkshake. I mean, and it smells more like a banana than a banana does.

Speaker 9:          37:08          So winter green means it's still growing and banana means we're done. Yep. Wow. That's kind of awesome. Awesome is a word I want to discuss. The awesome question here. Okay. Were you at all intrigued by the idea is that, as far as I know, and I'm maybe as far as you know, maybe as far as anybody know in the history of the eco-line creature, there has never been an eco lie that smelled like winter green. Yeah. You made it yourself. Well, with the help of my team members, yes ma'am. Did you feel a little spooked by the fact that you just created a life for them? New to new to creation? Um, I mean at least we're doing something that's, you know, smells pleasant, but you didn't feel like a doctor Frankenstein or a god or a not at all. What does it feel like to make something that's never existed before? Just feels like basic engineering, right?

Speaker 16:         38:06          Yeah. Or engineers. I would say we're engineers. We're building stuff,

Speaker 17:         38:09          building stuff, building [inaudible] stuff, stuff, stuff, living stuff. The Rhoda Dan [inaudible] will fix the problems of today by building stuff with [inaudible]. We're slicing genes, we're building creatures that being extra useful features more waiting daughter when styling and slopping jeans as long as small

Speaker 1:          38:40          stuff building stuff.

Speaker 17:         38:48          [inaudible] goes whereby it's mankind's only fighting chance designer jeans, not Denny bites. We'll stop disease and greenhouse gases when seeing nucleic acids. We've seen the light where the [inaudible] is fried and clear. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          39:21          thanks to Josh curves and Shane Winter for that music radio lab will continue in a moment. My name is Alyssa Hargrave and I'm calling from Shakopee, Minnesota where it is currently negative 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Outside Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org hello, I'm Chad and I am Robert. This is Radiolab and today our topic is tinkering, tinkering with nature or life. Yes, but don as we know it. No, because before the break we heard about some kids doing something that they call directed evolution. By sticking wintergreen into a place where wintergreen has never been before, which definitely qualifies as life, not as we know. Now let's get into the true grit of this because those kids are looking at life in a, in a fairly different way than most of us do.

Speaker 1:          40:20          Yes. It's very interesting that the people who are creating these living systems are engineers. This is Lee silver from Princeton University. I mean, they, they really look at a living system as no different than a computational, uh, electronic device. And you, your hunches there, right? Am I have, they're wrong. I don't know quite why by hunches. They're right. But, um, most of the world doesn't believe that, which would include me because I just make it very hard to imagine that I've got a life form talking. This animal leaves for a span of years and then dies. You know, it's like when they die and the spirit kind of goes on, it's hard for me to believe that that is just a chemical machine of several from parts. Really. Yeah. Well, okay. I mean, I guess I can understand that, but let me introduce you to a guy now who's whole.

Speaker 1:          41:14          Uh, admittedly young career is based on the idea that life is a machine, that it's made of parts, parts that he can build and sell. Okay. So I'm, I'm Brian Bains. Brian, we met actually just down the street from those MIT kids. He is 31. That's right, just 31 and he runs his own biotech company, one of the founders of caught on devices here. We make custom synthetic genes from scratch and he's doing pretty well. The industry is gray, sickly doubling every two years at this point. I mean, just to give you a sense of what Brian does, you with me? Yep. Just take your example. Those MIT kids, let's say I'm one of those kids or someone else who's heard about them and I want to take my stinky bacteria and make it smell better. Or maybe I want to make it glow. All I have to do is call Brian.

Speaker 1:          41:59          Sure. Cause he'll sell me a simple gene like that for about 1500 bucks. I just have to go online. Look up the chemical recipe for darn yes. Here it is. 1200 letters, t, G, Z, Cesar, letters of DNA, g, a t and a c of for fundamental building blocks of DNA. The next step, just list out those A's, g's and t's and C's. Just type them into an email. Generally they're not typing at themselves and imagine trying to type in 2000 letters by hand without making a mistake and it would take too long. All right. Just copy and paste them into an email. Send them to Brian. When we get that in house, we, um, we're going to take that into our facts.

Speaker 6:          42:42          Brian then plugs the string of letters into this machine, which is about the size of a desktop computer. We have a census system where it literally has a bunch of little A's and a jar and a bunch of g's in a jar and t's and C's. These chemicals are inert. They are store bought hundred dollars a bottle. The machine, they're all connected to reads all the letters that Brian plugs in and when, if he's in a machine, squirts out some pay. Duck is a t words out some t test, we can add an a or a g or a t or a c to a growing strand of DNA. And so we literally adding one base at a time fee fees. So what starts as one letter pieces then grows to 50 then grows to maybe 500 then it grows to be 5,000 and at a certain point all of these inner chemicals hold hands.

Speaker 1:          43:38          And that's literally how you make DNA chemically. That is how you go from dust to something that is not exactly alive. But if I take this little speck of DNA and stick it into my cell, amazingly, it will start to glow or smell better or whatever it is that I want it to do, it will do it. It's almost as if the cell is a computer and this little bit of DNA is a software program. That's the way synthetic biologists think about hm. And what synthetic biologists are hoping for us as leads that the software, quote unquote will get standardized. It will come down in price. So that one day installing new features into organisms. We just as easy as when you install new software on your home PC, but a word processor, you put a spreadsheet program user friendly. That's kind of the logic.

Speaker 1:          44:27          Yeah, but that's not that. That's that. We're talking about life here. Life like you know, a game of Lego's. What if it is, I mean I know it's weird to think it's wrong in other words to describe it, but what if it's not wrong? Just imagine you can start to look at things in a completely new way. You can look at that creature over there and say, that creature right there has a talent that I really like and that one over there. The second one, it also does something cool. Maybe if I take talent one and talent to stick them together, put 'em into a third creature. Then I've got a little factory that can do really cool stuff for gait living, things that have very important functional values. As an example, in our earlier conversation with Lee silver, he brought up a guy named George Church, George Church as a scientist at Harvard medical school. He's thought to be absolutely brilliant by everybody that knows him. Well. He actually happened to have a picture of Georgia on him and he and he showed us. Oh, is that he does. He does look like a radical. Describe him. He's wearing an army shirt of some kind. He's got a nice bushy beard and a spit curl. Oh, was Santa Claus played by Clark Gable?

Speaker 1:          45:33          Well, we had to visit him and George is unusual as scientists go. I'm George Church professors genetics at Harvard Medical School in the last 20 years. He's been going further and further and further in terms of synthesizing life. Okay, I'll slide. You know what I'll do? I'll slide. He he's, he's stuffing some kind of big black rod up my nose. That would be the Mike. Now the kind of creatures, the George Church engineers are the same kind of those MIT kids use eco lie. By taking these little tiny Nikolai and adding a few genes from other organisms and and tweaking the internal chemistry. He has gotten the Nikolai to suck in sugar, which is what they normally like to eat, poop out all kinds of things. Most notably drum roll please. Diesel for real. Oh yeah. And the company I co founded has produced hydrocarbon status. Just a fancy way of saying among other things, diesel, three different kinds to run in three types of engines, cars, trucks and planes.

Speaker 1:          46:40          I was curious to see how it all works. So he took me to a room at the back of his lab where he's perfecting the process and he pointed to a small container. So here's an example where we might grow up a large batch of of cells in a, in a fermenter. So this big Vat right here, which is, I don't know how, what's the size of a couple of leaders? Pretty small. It's about the size of a coke bottle. And right now he can only make a few drops. So there are some scale issues to solve. But I asked him you to close your eyes and you know, where does he imagine this stuff going and project forward into the future? And he painted. Describe it for me. What would it look like? An amazing picture of huge bodies of water. Giant pawns or lakes of gas. I mean, just imagine we could take a boat, paddle around and be beautiful birds chirping except under the surface. Trillions of bacteria, gloomy, busily eating plant life, burping out diesel fuel, which they float to the surface as this kind of gassy foam. And you can skim it off, skim it off, throw into a pipe. There you have it.

Speaker 1:          47:46          I mean, this could be the oil refinery of the future. No more pumping out of the ground and fighting wars. Forget that. That's old. Now we're talking to Mike Robes and Mike Rose.

Speaker 9:          47:56          And this could be just the beginning. I mean, according to Lee silver, people are hoping that this kind of bioengineering can produce all kinds of stuff. You know, a drug that cures malaria. Something that makes plastic, I mean, anything. Well I, they would be good. Yeah. But there is part of it that makes me a little uneasy. Why? And, and then, well, I wanna introduce you to another bioengineer. He's often called the leader of the pack, like the rat pack. Sort of like the rat pack. His name is Craig Venter and like the Red Peg folks, he's very talented. He very ambitious. He's very driven. He's also working on a bug for fuel. He also thinks that the earth is in trouble. We're messing our nests, something terrible. And when we were at the 92nd street y in New York, he said to just right out loud bio engineering, creating new life is our last hope.

Speaker 9:          48:44          It's probably our one major chance of having our species survive on this planet. I mean this is the engineering of the rest of this century and that's a little, I mean, stand beside young lamb. I'll rescue now with my magical scientific ability and my natural engineering skills. Kids saved the world that stand aside and throw them a parade. Well, except that you don't realize just how ambitious these these guys are. What's wrong with ambition? Nothing really. But what you don't know is just how bold this guy is. He not only wants to mix and match traits that already exist in, in, in life to make new funds or life, he wants to do original design. He wants to think of things that life is never done before. Things that are in his head that are entirely new. He even dreams of life life form from scratch, from scratch, completely, like 4.1 billion years ago.

Speaker 9:          49:35          Kind of like in Genesis. It'd probably take a little longer, but I think there will be new life forms. You think it will be possible in your lifetime that someone will go into a store, buy dust, figure out what it is that they have to do with that desk so that what they make will be unmistakably alive, not alive than alive. Yes. Yes, but using the knowledge that we have from studying this 4 billion years of evolution. What? What if I told you that I thought no, I don't know why. Just know. I think you reviewed my grant.

Speaker 9:          50:19          Nobody. There's a, there's a candidness to scientists that I, that puzzles me a little bit. Isn't there something that you think, and this would be really close, it creating life that just might be out of our grasp. It might be forever and mysterious and yet you guys like, is there anything in the way of engineering life? Is there anything that you think is not doable? Do you think it's never going to happen, that you'll meet, create a conscious life form from scratch or it will never happen that you will create a morally, you know, a sense of a creature with moral sense of right and wrong, but I don't know. I think you think that everything is possible. Everything. I think you're right.

Speaker 18:         51:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          51:10          okay. I get that Craig and people like him might have a little bit of a, of an attitude about what they can accomplish, but is that your problem that hit that he, it's his attitude? No, no, no, no. It's a sense of life, I think is wrong here. I really appreciate because of Darwin and Darwinian evolution, that it takes 100 million, 200 million a billion years for creatures to figure out how to live in the neighborhood of life, how to know what to eat, what to avoid, how to fit in, how you, you know, if you're going to sustain, you've got to learn how to live harmoniously with the rest of nature. It takes awhile, but here come these engineers over some weekend think I have a new ideal, maybe the lead oil or audible and then you stick it into the world and you've just stuck something into a rich fabric of life and you have no idea of all the different consequences that could follow from that decision.

Speaker 9:          51:59          I look at, look at what happens right now with antibiotics. That scientist Nigel Goldenfeld, who we heard from, you know before, 50 years ago we declared war on microbes. We fed antibiotics to cattle, to kids when they had virus infections. We put so much antibiotics into our bodies and into our food, but the bacteria we were trying to kill figured out a way to avoid our medicines and now they're stronger than ever. Melt smart. We didn't know there were things that we didn't really understand that we didn't know that we didn't understand and we're paying the place for that now. I am frightened that these people have so much ambition and so much certainty in them that frankly they

Speaker 14:         52:37          don't fear what biologists don't know about life. It's a really a Frankenstein story that is there. So much hubris in this and as Steve Strogatz will tell you, biologists and pic scientists in general, no veer. We now know how much we don't know about life. If biology really is about collective behavior, the interaction of billions of molecules, billions of species, and this network of of life we barely understand. You know, we keep being surprised about life. On the one hand we can tinker in this engineering way like the MIT students do or like venter is doing. But on the other hand, the best biologists are still mystified that we only have that about the same number of genes as a worm. We're really still missing 99% of the picture, literally. So it's a scary time today to start playing doctor given how ignorant

Speaker 9:          53:26          do you know that it Stony Brook University, where your mom worked for all those years, there was a scientist, maybe a few doors down from your mom who, who made from scratch using the dust particles. We've talked about the polio virus, which the whole world has been working to eliminate. Polian made a new polio virus. Why? I don't know. I, there was a lot of controversy about it, but there is a guy could perhaps in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan who wants to make a polio virus and who will use it against this technology. You're right, you are right that there is, there are some bad things that can happen. Very bad. So the question is then what? Like what do you do in the face of that risk? How do you proceed? Do you say to these guys, stop. Would you have these guys stop doing what they're doing? Stop doing their experiments. Asking questions, being curious. Oh, that'd be ridiculous to tell a science not to do science. So what then I, I don't know. I have to, I don't, I don't know exactly, but do I want them to, to not do experiments?

Speaker 14:         54:32          No, I'm not saying don't know. So I'm not going to be a troglodyte and say we shouldn't play with these. And Steve Strogatz agrees. I think it's great to play with them. But I'm scared too. I Dunno. I'm confused about it because we have to play. That's how we make all science, you know, they speak of Homo Lutens human beings as the player that we, we are what we are because we like to play with nature, with ideas, with language. This is how we learn things. So we're gonna play, but we have to be very careful about how we play. And we don't want to fall into the idea that we know more than we, we do.
