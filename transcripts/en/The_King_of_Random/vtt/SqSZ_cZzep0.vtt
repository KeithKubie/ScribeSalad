00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.330
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to hack an N64 game controller, into a

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.420
rocket launch controller, that’ll ignite
fireworks up to 30 feet away, or launch a

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.340
rocket the moment you say so.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.500
Let’s start this project with a Nintendo
64 game controller. I chose yellow because

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.940
this way it’ll match the Randomizer rocket
I’ll show you how to build in another project

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.320
video. Keep an eye out for that.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.550
Now if we flip the control over, you’ll
see there are 9 screws holding the two halves

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.390
together, and all it takes to remove them,
is a small phillips head screwdriver. Make

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.010
sure you save the screws in a really safe
place, because we will need them to put the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.379
controller back together at the end.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.170
With the screws removed, let’s separate
the two halves and take a peek inside.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.100
You can see the upper half is the more complicated
side where all the buttons and electronics

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.070
are, so let’s just leave that alone for
a second and work on the bottom half instead.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.870
Grab a pair of pliers and look for the plastic
support where the “A” button goes, then

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.850
grip it firmly and tear it off, because we
don’t need it. While we’re here, let’s

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.909
rip the top off the housing where the controller
packs go as well. It’ll all make sense in just a second.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.460
Now it’s really helpful to file and grind
down the little ridges on the inner walls

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.930
of the slot, and clean up the rough edges
where any plastic got removed. It’ll take

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.720
a bit of work, but when the walls are relatively
flat and you’ve smoothed down most of the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.220
rough edges, you’ll find that you can push
two 9 volt batteries inside, and they fit

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.840
perfectly. That means, we can make an improvised
power pack to keep the whole system portable, and self-contained.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.880
Ok, we’re finished with the bottom half
of the controller for now, so let’s move

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.560
over to the top side.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.450
Go ahead and rip the circuit board right out
of the casing, but make sure you keep all

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.940
the buttons in safe place so you don’t have
to waste time looking for them later.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.790
I removed the 3 small screws that hold the
thumbstick assembly to the casing, and, as

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.860
you can see, the whole thing just pops out
now in one piece. Before we start modifying

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.920
this unit, there are a few quick adjustments
that need to made to the understand of the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.020
casing, like breaking off the plastic ridge
right above the start button area, and tearing

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.480
off the support walls where the “A” button
used to be. This’ll free up some space for a few new components.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.240
Now we also need to drill a couple of holes
in the top, so I’m using a 15/64” drill

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.020
bit to cut a hole directly in the center of
where the Nintendo logo would normally be,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.650
and a 3/32” bit to cut a sound hole just
below that.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.920
At this point the upper casing is completely
finished, so let’s get back to modifying the thumbstick assembly.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.040
Only one screw holds the assembly together,
but you need to be extremely careful when

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.819
removing it because the whole casing is spring
loaded, and will try to burst open on you.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.469
It’ll be a lot easier if you don’t let
that happen.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.450
The bottom part of the assembly is where the
trigger button used to be, and our goal here

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.379
is to replace it with a momentary pushbutton
switch. Of course that means we’ll need to cut a space for it.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.049
I tried using a 5/16” bit to carve a channel
halfway through the casing, which apparently

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.769
keeps the brackets for the circuit board intact,
while creating just enough room to accommodate

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.510
the button on the inside.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.450
Now if we dig up the original “Z” button
circuit board, and cut a 5/16” hole straight

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.810
through the contact pad, we should end up
with a hole the right size for our switch.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.950
I found this momentary switch in packs of
4 at a local electronics shop and we
don’t need the cap, or the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.519
little tip on the end, so go ahead and snap it off with
a pair of pliers.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.579
Flip the switch over, and solder insulated
copper wires to each of the terminals for

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.790
durability and good electrical contact, and
when the solder cools, you can see that connecting

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.230
the button to the circuit board is as simple
as pushing it through from the underside,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.219
then tightening the washer and hex nut securely
on the top. With the circuit board locked

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.959
back in place, you should be able to see how
this new trigger button mimics the old “Z” button almost perfectly.

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.900
Let’s go ahead and replace the joystick
components so we can reattach the spring-loaded

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.389
assembly, and screw it all back together.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.930
With that, the modified assembly is finished
so it can go back into place on the control

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.219
cover, and we can replace the 3 screws that
hold it in position. Now before you do anything

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.419
else, it’s a good idea to put the control
casing back together and make sure the new

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.510
switch aligns with the trigger button.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.249
I hooked mine to a multimeter to be extra
sure, and tested for electrical continuity

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.209
each time the button was pressed. It seems
like everything’s working perfectly, so

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.189
that means it’s time to load the controller
with a few more goodies. And you’ll see

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.260
what all these do in just a minute.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.790
I found a red pushbutton that’s an awesome
replacement for the old “A” button, and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.239
this is going to become the ignition switch
for the actual rocket launch. It’s got a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.450
plastic nut holding it from the back side
which keeps it tight, and helps prevent it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.730
from popping back out. ‘

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.040
The next step is attaching the buzzer and
a green LED.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.700
I found that a ring of hot glue around the
center hole is all it takes to hold the buzzer

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.230
right where we need it. And of course it works
best if you can line the center up with the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.469
small sound hole we made earlier.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.889
Now you should find that the subminiature,
green LED makes an excellent fit with the

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.190
other hole we made at the top, and this one
will need to be held in place with hot glue

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.349
as well because there’s no room for the
hex nut. Just use a liberal amount of hot glue, and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.750
when it cools, that LED won’t be going anywhere.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.280
At this point, all the major components are
installed so let’s solder them together,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.560
and bring this launch controller to life.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.270
I cut up the cord from an old cell phone charger
and wired everything together, using this

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.569
schematic. I designed the circuit to run on
two 9 volt batteries in parallel, so it has

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.080
a higher current. The LED and buzzer are set
in parallel as well, but only work if the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.569
button in the trigger is pressed. When the
trigger is pulled, a very small electrical

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.759
current will pass through the ignitor to check
whether it’s intact or whether it’s damaged.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.169
If the connection is good, then the small
electrical current continues to flow through

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.099
the circuit, lighting up the LED and sounding
the warning buzzer, letting you know that the ignitor

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.740
has continuity, and is ready for ignition.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.919
Now even though electricity is flowing, it’s only around 40mA, and

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.669
that’s not near enough to set off the igniter. It actually needs closer to 2 amps, or 50 times

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.840
more power for proper ignition.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.370
If you’re ready to launch, keep the trigger
pulled, and press the red button simultaneously.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.340
This opens the electrical flood gates, and
sends a surge of around 6 amps through the

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.310
ignitor, firing it off instantly.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.759
Alright, now that all the connection points
are soldered and insulated with electrical

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.599
tape, we’ve just got a few finishing touches
left.

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.139
Find the circuit board you ripped out earlier,
and draw two lines. One on the bottom side

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.919
of the controller pack connection, and another
that humps up and over the contact pad for the “A” button.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.560
We can make things a little more tidy by ripping
all the wires and cords off the board, and

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.909
if we use a large pair of pliers to grip the
slot for the controller pack, and give it

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.129
a good twist, it’ll snap right off.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.449
Now carefully break off pieces of the board
around the “A” button, then grind down

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.190
any rough edges with a file to clean it up
and make it look a bit nicer.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.000
Find the silicone button pad next, with the 6 contacts on it, and if you use a marker to

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.099
draw a line separating out where the “A”
button would be, then simply use a pair of

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.229
scissors to cut it off, then that’s it.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.259
We can go ahead and gather up all the buttons
now, and put the whole thing back together.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.550
When the components are back in place, go
ahead and lay the modified button pad in position.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.689
And now it should make sense why we had to
make that cut.

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.860
The circuit board goes in next to help keep
the buttons from falling out, and to make sure

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.800
they look, and act like normal.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.180
Now before we screw the casing together, there’s
just one thing left to do, and that’s to

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.409
add 30 foot lead wires so we can ignite rockets
from a distance. And for that, I’m using

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.199
a 100ft roll of 24 gauge speaker wire I found
at the hardware store.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.220
I soldered and taped the wires into position,
then tied a knot on the inside of the casing

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.009
to protect the wire from getting pulled out
accidentally.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.710
At this point let’s feed the two 9 volt
battery clips through the slot for the controller

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.500
pack, and screw the two halves back together.
Just like that, our N64 rocket launch controller

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.620
is completely finished, and ready for testing.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.770
I hooked up two 9 volt batteries and pushed
them into place, then gathered a handful of

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.509
my homemade rocket ignitors. Which you can
learn how to make in another project video.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.889
Just for convenience, I attached alligator
clips on the ends of each wire so the leads

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.309
will bite onto the igniters. This way we can
hook up, and even change ignitors, within a matter of seconds.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.000
Now if the electric match has continuity,
then when we press the trigger button, a green

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.509
light and a buzzer come on telling us the
system is armed and ready for launch. And

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.139
pressing the red button next will light it
up.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.819
And of course, 30 foot lead wires, mean we
can remotely launch our rockets now, from

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:15.599
a pretty good distance away.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.259
I took this launch controller out into the
desert to test on homemade Rockets, and sugar

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.139
motors that I showed you how to make in another
project video.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.520
You can see that with everything connected
properly, the controller works exactly how

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.060
we hoped it would, so we don’t have to worry
about lighting a fuse and running away anymore,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.180
because instead, now we have the ability to
launch rockets or even light pyrotechnics,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.289
with the simple push of a button.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.639
Well now you know how to convert an old video
game controller, into a remote controlled

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:43.919
rocket launch controller, that not only looks
awesome, but launches freakin’ rockets in real life.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.659
By the way, if you’re wondering what to
do with the leftover cord from the controller,

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:51.839
don’t throw it away. Instead, use it to
mass produce another round of igniters, for future launches.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.340
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
