00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.740
You are listening to radiolab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.330
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.350
Okay. From the top. You Ready? Yup. Hello. How are you doing?

4
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.500
We're going to start things off today with this lady, Zelda. Gamson.

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.110
Come to our little spot. It's beautiful.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.030
She's 80 years old and these days Zelda lives a quiet life by the sea on

7
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:31.690
Martha's vineyard. Did you have some coffee? She visits with their grandkids,

8
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:32.650
does some gardening.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.910
We have a bird feeder and it is the bird show of the world.

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.920
The life for Zelda wasn't always so calm back in the 60s when our story begins,

11
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.210
she was a very different kind of lady. She even went by a different nickname,

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.050
just z. Okay.

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.450
I was a smoker 30 years.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.660
I started when I went to college in 1954 first it was just a cigarette here or

15
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:58.210
there,

16
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.890
letting the bad girl out a bit and then I got hooked really and I couldn't stop.

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.690
Went to graduate school, smoked, got my dissertation, smoked,

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.100
got my degrees, smoked in somewhere in the fog. She meets. Hi,

19
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.230
my friend Mary. Also a smoker.

20
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.830
Loves smoking made me feel very elegant.

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.990
We were very good friends.

22
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.020
We were part in the early sixties of the congress on racial equality together.

23
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.060
They'd organize protests, we would demonstrate,

24
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.260
and the two of them would even go undercover to fight housing discrimination and

25
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.040
the backdrop to all of this social change. Smoke. Yeah. You got it.

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.970
I mean, a houses were filled with these ashtray.

27
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.790
How much were you smoking at that point? Probably smoked a packet of day.

28
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.530
I was aware, smoker than Mary and I was sometimes up to two packs a day. Wow.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.120
You know, I had kids, I was pregnant. Um, [inaudible] while you're pregnant.

30
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.430
Guy Did. Wow. Yeah. I feel so guilty about that.

31
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.380
So at a certain point, Zelda and Mary decide they want to stop. Yeah. No.

32
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.100
Mary who had never been as badly addicted to Zelda. It wasn't easy.

33
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.450
It was agonizing, but eventually she's able to do it. Zelda now,

34
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.070
I thought sometimes that I could stop and so I would over and over,

35
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060
she throw out her cigarettes. Okay. Done. But then,

36
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.940
then I'd be around somebody with cigarettes. Oh yeah.

37
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.560
Any reason that you'd give yourself cancer? My kids, the smell,

38
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:33.060
the fact that I could die. You'd always lost out to the urge.

39
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.400
And I'd always start smoking again.

40
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.900
<v 1>And this is how it would go. Resolve failure,</v>

41
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.330
resolve failure. Okay.

42
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.030
So this is not the most unusual situation in the world.

43
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.080
But the question you want to ask right now is like, how do you get out of this?

44
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.340
You want to do something? They happily, but then another part of you says, no,

45
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.200
I don't want to that. So if you against you, what do you do?

46
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.050
I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

47
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.700
and today we the little deal that you make when you are stuck with yourself.

48
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.790
Okay? So before talking with Zelda,

49
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.150
just so happened that I went with Adam Davidson,

50
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.690
one of the planet money guys to visit this fellow Nobel prize winning economist

51
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.620
named Thomas Shelling me.

52
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.820
You're the fifth who's written a whole lot about the seemingly simple idea of

53
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
commitment, arranging it so that you can't compromise.

54
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.710
I'll give you an example. Here's the one from ancient Greece, Xenophon,

55
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.711
the Greek who was being pursued by a huge army of Persians had to make a stand

56
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.400
on a hillside, and one of his generals said,

57
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.190
I don't think this is a good location to make our stand.

58
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.970
There's a cliff behind this. There's no way we can retreat if we need to.

59
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.010
And Xenophon told his general exactly. Welcome the cliff. In fact,

60
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.300
he said, here's what we're going to do.

61
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.900
We're going to march our armies that their backs are directly to the cliff.

62
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.530
That way the Persians will know that we can never retreat.

63
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.490
We're bound to fight to the death. You're really binding yourself.

64
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:14.140
You're not binding the other side. Yeah.

65
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.340
It's attempting to influence somebody else's choice by restricting your own

66
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.640
choice. But then we asked them,

67
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:23.230
what if your adversary isn't on the outside like the Persians,

68
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:28.180
but rather it was you. How do you do with Xenophon? Did to yourself?

69
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.320
Yeah, I, uh, I began smoking when I was 17 years old.

70
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.540
I did quit several times,

71
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.650
<v 2>but I always say</v>

72
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.050
I back. Ooh.

73
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.130
<v 1>But he did tell. He did give us some suggestions. [inaudible] one in particular.</v>

74
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.180
There was so awesome to use your favorite words.

75
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.190
So diabolical. Yeah.

76
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.240
That we just didn't think anyone would ever do it. Oh,

77
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.120
that is until we met Zelda. Yeah.

78
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.610
Fast forward a few decades,

79
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 0>1984 Marion Zelda now live in different parts of the country.</v>

80
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200
I happened to be going to a conference in Vermont and Mary picked me up at the

81
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:16.770
airport, right. And I was smoking when she picked me up,

82
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.970
which was curious because nobody smokes anymore. She said,

83
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:25.470
why Celta are you still smoking? And Zelda said, yeah,

84
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.180
and don't tell me to stop. I was very belligerent.

85
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.070
Yes. So I went to the conference and smoked.

86
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.520
And were they guilty cigarettes? No, they were delicious.

87
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.630
But what Mary said was starting to worm its way into her brain.

88
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.730
Are you still smoking? Still Smoking, still smoking stores.

89
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.900
And when she dropped me off at the airport, I said, okay, Mary,

90
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.170
as if she had been putting pressure on me, which she wasn't at all.

91
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.150
If I ever smoke again,

92
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.450
I'm going to get $5,000 to the Ku Klux Klan.

93
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.420
What did she say? $5,000 to the Klu Klux Klan, correct?

94
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.713
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

95
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.660
<v 1>this was shelling suggestion. It couldn't work,</v>

96
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.520
but he didn't think anyone would ever do it.

97
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.840
<v 0>$5,000 to the Ku Klux Klan. It just came out of my math.</v>

98
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.970
You know how horrible they are, right? Sure. So heinous. But

99
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.120
<v 1>her and Mary made a deal. A pact. If sell the smoked,</v>

100
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.300
she'd have to tell Mary to send the KKK her money,

101
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.140
<v 0>take it out of my savings or something. And you were really serious.</v>

102
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.670
You were going to do this. Yeah,

103
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.710
but I have to say after I made this pledge to marry under my breath,

104
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.600
I said, but I can't be responsible if she smokes again.

105
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.730
What if she smokes again? If she smokes again?

106
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.620
Who's the she in that sentence? Me You.

107
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.600
What does that mean? Well, that means that a part of me,

108
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:07.601
the part of me that was smoking and that might pick up smoking again was an

109
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.500
alien part. You're saying you were two people at that moment? Yeah.

110
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.490
And she z didn't really want to stop smoking.

111
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.540
She she, yeah.

112
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.410
<v 1>After the pact, Zelda says that often when she would fall asleep,</v>

113
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.060
I would dream of myself smoking and she'd wake up in a terrible sweat reach for

114
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:32.510
her cigarettes. But every time she says this other thought,

115
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:37.010
we just rush into her mind. The KKK robes burning crosses,

116
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:41.150
lynchings. Oh Gosh. She'd throw the cigarettes down. I could.

117
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.700
The idea of them having her money,

118
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.770
<v 0>I can't even imagine it.</v>

119
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.260
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.410
<v 0>sounds like you really backed yourself up against the cliff. I did.</v>

121
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.590
<v 1>Zelda had found a thought that was hotter than the years</v>

122
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.460
<v 0>and she didn't smoke again. Never again. No. That was it.</v>

123
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:06.300
Cold Turkey.

124
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.330
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

125
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.163
<v 0>look at this.</v>

126
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.970
There's a picture of me on a cruise that bill and I took your sheet. Yes,

127
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.990
it's a profile picture of the cigarette.

128
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.910
I look gorgeous there. That's best picture ever taken of me.

129
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.790
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

130
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.040
<v 1>now, if we are many people on the inside,</v>

131
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.230
and we've talked about this on the show before,

132
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:38.120
how like our brain is literally divided into these camps that sometimes wrestle,

133
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.020
right? Fight. Well, the problem,

134
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.250
I think the problem is quoting to Thomas shelling is that these cells never

135
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.090
exist simultaneously. We're never at the table together.

136
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.680
The one who's in charge never confronts the other.

137
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.200
I guess that makes it hard to compromise.

138
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.340
<v 4>Well though, you know, there is another way to think about the problem.</v>

139
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.370
Things that are offered right now have so much more power than things that are

140
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.840
offered in the future. Oh, this is David Eagleman.

141
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:07.970
He's a neuroscientist and he says, you know, really,

142
00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:11.480
you could think about this whole thing as a battle about time.

143
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.730
We'll make all sorts of very poor economic decisions now versus later. We,

144
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.230
if something is offered right now versus later,

145
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.630
and when you look at the neuroimaging,

146
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.670
it becomes clear that there are different parts of the brain that are,

147
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.940
that are battling this out in the now. Parts are way stronger. Yes.

148
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.930
Here's the key. What she's doing in the case of the cigarettes is she's saying,

149
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.260
I know that I want to win this longterm battle,

150
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.180
but I'm having a heck of a time doing it.

151
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.210
But if I can make the longterm plan tied into a different immediate feeling of

152
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:45.710
disgust, then all I have to do is have the disgust battle. The the desire.

153
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.850
I see. So she's,

154
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:50.630
what she's done is she's turned this battle into a present tense battle on both

155
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:55.220
sides. I want a cigarette now versus I hate the KKK now.

156
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.771
Precisely.

157
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:59.870
So it's a now versus now thing and I think that's the only way we ever win these

158
00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:04.310
longterm battles is to give them some sort of emotional salience.

159
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.360
Some reason why they matter to us right now. Otherwise it will never work.

160
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.720
And there are any number of ways of doing this. Here

161
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.310
<v 1>is how Thomas shelling did it,</v>

162
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.460
1980 gather my children together and I said I quit and that they should never

163
00:10:21.231 --> 00:10:23.360
have respect for their father again if I

164
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.980
returned to smoking and he never, he never did. And that was it for him.

165
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.610
<v 2>Huh?</v>

166
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.120
<v 1>The thing I like about about those two stories is that like there's a case where</v>

167
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.090
like, okay, say you've got these cells battling in your head,

168
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.520
I've got the now part in the later part and the later parts week. Yeah.

169
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.830
In this case, the later part found a way to trick the now parts,

170
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.110
and this has a name, this kind of approach.

171
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:50.740
It's called a Ulysses contract in the Iliad.

172
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.440
This is a moment where you list these in as men have to sail past the island of

173
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:59.270
the sirens and you list these nos. If they hear the siren song, they're dead.

174
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.530
Sailors were so attracted to these melodies that they would steer towards them

175
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:08.060
and crash their ships into the rocks and die. So on his way there,

176
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:11.450
before the music started, he came up with a plan.

177
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.430
He had his men lash him to the mast with ropes so that he couldn't move and he

178
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:20.540
had them fill their own ears with bees wax. And he said,

179
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:22.040
no matter what I do, no matter how,

180
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:24.590
I'm just sticky waiting or shouting or acting like a crazy man,

181
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.580
just keep rowing. Just keep going. And so when they got to the sirens

182
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.870
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

183
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.680
<v 1>Ulysses,</v>

184
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.680
he goes nuts and he's screaming and yelling and telling the men go towards the

185
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.790
women. We don't want to pass this up.

186
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:42.950
And of course the men have bees wax in their ears.

187
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.850
They're not swayed by the siren song because he had planned for this,

188
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.590
the present tense Ulysses,

189
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.650
by using his men and the rope had literally bound the future Ulysses to the mast

190
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 5>because he knew that guy would be weak.</v>

191
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:02.420
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

192
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.840
<v 5>we can just move off the ocean for just a moment. Gun. Get out of your ocean</v>

193
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.430
<v 7>radio. What a weird medium. Anyway,</v>

194
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.410
what is the bargain that you strike isn't just about something, you know, very,

195
00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:19.200
very small. And now like this puff of smoke,

196
00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:23.190
what if it's a deal that you have to do that we'll decide what you're going to

197
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:26.970
do for every day of the next 40 years. Yeah. What that,

198
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.110
<v 5>well, this brings us to a story from our producer pap. Walter's ready. Okay.</v>

199
00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:36.000
Set it up. Okay. Uh, okay.

200
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:40.590
I'm in Chinatown about a year ago corner of Hell. And, uh,

201
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.580
my friend Jenny posted something on Twitter. It said, overheard.

202
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.180
I flipped the coin and I lost my life.

203
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:49.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.580
<v 5>I flipped a coin and lost my life. Yes. And what's Twitter? Yeah.</v>

205
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.270
I mean she, she actually heard someone say this. Yeah. She was just like,

206
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.640
she's a reporter. She was just chatting with the guy and he's,

207
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.690
and he said he said that to her. I flipped a coin and I lost my life. Wow.

208
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.200
What was the context I, while she was getting a massage in Chinatown.

209
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.130
And how would that phrase come up in the middle of a massage? I don't,

210
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.750
I honestly don't know. But she's a reporter. Did she, did she ask? I say,

211
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:17.670
get your hands off me man, and tell me the story.

212
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.660
I don't know exactly what went down, but I asked her what the situation was.

213
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:23.940
She said that she basically didn't know anything,

214
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:28.530
but she just heard that she heard it and she told me that it was at this place

215
00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:33.531
that was like either at one of seven different addresses that she gave me.

216
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.160
So I just wondered around,

217
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.350
do you know of some place around here called health trail massage place has no

218
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:41.184
idea. No.

219
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.170
Wandered around to several different addresses and eventually I found this tiny

220
00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:47.790
little storefront. There's a little sign,

221
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.640
<v 3>the fee kind of hidden.</v>

222
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.250
<v 5>Oh, you want to see my,</v>

223
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.070
my son and I found the guy who said the thing. Hi. Hi. How are you?

224
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.180
I'm okay. His name is Dennis Dennis.

225
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.330
And you just asked him how you tell me about this coin flip. Can you tell me,

226
00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.720
can you, so when did this happen? How about four years ago?

227
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.250
A was 26 and my brother was uh, 21.

228
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.990
Both of them had gone to college, dentist for photography, his brother for art,

229
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.100
joy, and they'd come out of school with these big dreams in new places,

230
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.610
meeting New People, making a live and making money.

231
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.340
But that hadn't really worked out. Yeah, no, Jeff for me,

232
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.700
you're having a hard time finding jobs and they ended up living at home with

233
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:34.230
their dad. Yeah, with my dad.

234
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.740
So basically I had to stay in home two picture and my brother,

235
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.910
he's just working at a restaurant. No life either.

236
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.170
So this is basically post college flail. Yeah. Like they're stuck.

237
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:46.110
Stuck in the middle of the road. That's what happened to us.

238
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.680
One day their dad comes up to them and says, look guys,

239
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.480
one of you guys gotta follow. I need one of you.

240
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.710
I don't care which one of you,

241
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.730
but I need one of you to take over the family business.

242
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.740
My father's getting all just designed.

243
00:14:59.741 --> 00:15:04.030
I eat above you come out or one of your [inaudible] so one of them now has to

244
00:15:04.031 --> 00:15:07.120
carry on his, his thing. Yeah. What is it they do here?

245
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.200
Into this massage parlor? Yeah. Since we're not interested. Yeah. Nieto.

246
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.300
There's what really want to do it. That's Chi Chi.

247
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.090
Will Dennis's little brother cause touching people food.

248
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.010
It's some kind of disgusting. Right. You know,

249
00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:21.760
there's always a hairy guy or like some girls like busted toes.

250
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.780
Disgusting and annoying. Facing your father for 24 hours. Seven days a week.

251
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:28.150
Yeah. A little more than I can take. Like, I love my dad,

252
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.690
but you just don't want to follow your dad with footstep. But the dad says,

253
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.420
get over it. It's about family, keeping the business alive,

254
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.390
keeping the technique he has alive in the whole channel town.

255
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.920
Don't take any massage place or any therapy place.

256
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.650
We'll have my father tell me it's a special kind of thing. Yeah,

257
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:49.250
it's this like deep tissue acupressure, painful type massage. I don't know.

258
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.840
Have Jenny told you? That is really, really painful. Anyhow,

259
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.890
they're sitting at home and this question is kind of like silently hanging over

260
00:15:56.891 --> 00:16:01.840
them for days and weeks till one day at a friend's place, having some tea,

261
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.490
talking about their dad and Dennis looks up at his brother and says as make a

262
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:10.710
bet. Let's do the tease thing. The one,

263
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.080
let's see what the, what does TD saying? Well,

264
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.630
Dennis says when you're drinking loose tea, the Chinese, right?

265
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:20.230
You put the leaves right in the bottom of your cup and you pour the water over

266
00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:24.430
them and usually the leaves float up to the top flat on the surface of the tea.

267
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.990
But every now and that every tank cuff you might see the tips is floating and

268
00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:32.720
the rest of the body is inside a water. So like the stem sort of yeah.

269
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.450
And then the leaf is hanging down. Yeah.

270
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.210
Do you mean like every so often instead of the whole leaf being on the top of

271
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:40.880
the water, the leafy park just falls to the bottom and yeah,

272
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.190
and just the tip of the stem is touching the surface of the water.

273
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:49.090
Almost like it's hanging down from the surface of the water. And this is rare.

274
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.520
Yeah. So when you get that estimate, it's good luck.

275
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.350
And is that like a traditional, this one out over people and it was doing that.

276
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.890
That's how we understand that. And we was kid, so we just decide, okay,

277
00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:03.370
well we get that whoever gets the most lucky tea leaves,

278
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.390
well we'll win you out. You don't need to worry. My Dad,

279
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.980
whoever lost from a font of footstep, they trusted their whole future to this.

280
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.520
Yeah. It was like a spur of the moment thing. They were, didn't we? Yeah.

281
00:17:17.521 --> 00:17:18.500
We didn't really plan anything.

282
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.410
Some pipe people just flip a coin and they can't figure out which way should

283
00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:24.210
they go. So this is flip a coin.

284
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.760
When you pull all the hot water in,

285
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.380
they will like rolling out loud like a small tomato inside they are spinning

286
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.780
and then once it's done,

287
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.490
each cup has a layer of tea leaves on the surface and Dennis notices. So whoa,

288
00:17:44.491 --> 00:17:49.290
look at it that he'd gotten one, one piece that was a wow. As an incredible.

289
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.570
Then you looked over to his brother's cup.

290
00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.930
<v 8>Oh my God.</v>

291
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.900
<v 5>Way More of these lucky leaves. It was pretty obvious. You know,</v>

292
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.860
he lost and there wasn't even close. No.

293
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.880
Do you remember if he was like angry or looks like he was deepen thought.

294
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.790
I don't thing like damn, this is like as the west thing in my life.

295
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.160
<v 2>Um,</v>

296
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.160
<v 9>and it basically was because now he was bound by these tea leaves to go and work</v>

297
00:18:23.951 --> 00:18:26.770
for his dad. Oh, what happened

298
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.450
<v 5>Ben? Did you first come here to work? I don't feel like touching anybody foot.</v>

299
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.170
So he forced me to touch me for did he have to like grab your hands and sit

300
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.870
down, take off his shoes? What are washing his feet. Okay.

301
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:44.190
That's kind of disgusting. So is this telling me to try to work on it?

302
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.110
His Dad eventually said practice on your friends. Oh, is that Oh god, no,

303
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.110
they still hate me right now for giving them all the pain. When that was gone,

304
00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:55.090
do you remember like what was going through your head? Were you like,

305
00:18:55.091 --> 00:18:59.660
what am I doing? Like did you feel like you're on the wrong track? Well,

306
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.370
um, I don't know how to explain. Here's the funny thing.

307
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.030
Then it says that there came a point after a month,

308
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.730
look at all my father fear that of the disgusting anymore.

309
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.880
I feel kind of like it. He likes it. I don't know why. It's just like making me,

310
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.720
ah, they seem nice to work on people. Um,

311
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.610
I don't know how to explain. I just stopped fall in love with this job.

312
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.490
Yeah. I don't know. How's it happen? I just, I,

313
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:33.920
I working here seven days a week, so become part of my life.

314
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.410
Wake up in the morning, come here, work, go home, sleep,

315
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.280
come and work. So as those become part of my five year, when I got a day off,

316
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.910
I don't know what to do, where to go and just staying at home,

317
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.000
let me come back out here and work as what happened.

318
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.580
It's just that I think that's how I fall foreign love is,

319
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.910
you don't know how to happen when it's happened. It just happened.

320
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.460
It was a good lows. I was thinking, I left this job.

321
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So it sounds like you made this deal with fate and he just got lucky.

322
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.320
No. Now Kai has a slightly different read on the whole thing. So if he had one,

323
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:21.180
would you have had to do it? No, no, no, no, no.

324
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.510
Kai says the whole Tealeaf deal. It was really just about Dennis.

325
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.930
I think at that point in the back of his head, he wanted to do it.

326
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.920
Just an excuse. I think he was just looking for a sign. I'd have to ask him,

327
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.430
I guess. And when I did ask Dennis, he didn't really agree with this brother.

328
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.120
It's just a how you say sorry. But he didn't entirely disagree either.

329
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:45.300
Not that because I wanted to do it just like it's kind of,

330
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm using my brother to push me to work. My Dad. That's what he,

331
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:51.820
what do you mean by that? I don't think he wanted to make his own decision.

332
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.090
It might be better. I just worked for my dad, but I don't want him to face him.

333
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.800
So if my brother just pushed me, okay, I'll be facing him. Ah,

334
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.093
that could be what happened.

335
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.870
<v 4>So we just needed a push.</v>

336
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.300
<v 3>Would you be thing to do?</v>

337
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.490
<v 4>No. You know, when you think about it, why is that wimpy? Well, I mean, he did.</v>

338
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.070
He wanted to be a Massoud, you know, and he didn't know what he wanted. Yo,

339
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.340
he knew and he set up his brother to make him do it. So it's very know,

340
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.730
if you call it wimpy, call it wimpy.

341
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.410
I call it a powerfully wimpy, muscularly wimpy.

342
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.670
Meaning what? What does that mean? Meaning that, oh, I got one for you.

343
00:21:29.671 --> 00:21:30.900
I'm going to lay this. You ready for this?

344
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.590
Maybe the new strength is understanding your own wind penis.

345
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.940
What do you think about that? Ooh, I just tie.

346
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.960
Just tied you into a philosophical, not right there, buddy.

347
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.930
You're going to be thinking about that one for years. I'm thinking about it.

348
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:46.050
I'm over thinking about it. Then take it into the complexity.

349
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.270
Can I speak now? Yeah. David's going to say something. This is who we are.

350
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.240
I mean, that's the reality on the ground. We're just weak. We need help,

351
00:21:56.241 --> 00:21:57.710
and I actually think this gives,

352
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.820
this gives us a new way to think about and understand virtue.

353
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.580
<v 5>I think it gives us a much richer view of human nature.</v>

354
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.300
<v 4>It's the Pat Walters, our Chinatown correspondent, and two Thomas Shelling,</v>

355
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.440
who's written many, many books,

356
00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:20.490
including the strategy of conflict and to Adam Davidson from the amazing planet

357
00:22:20.491 --> 00:22:25.290
money team and to David Eagleman whose latest book is incognito.
