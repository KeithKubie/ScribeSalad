so what are we doing about the
 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.160
so what are we doing about the
challenges the challenge of

collections and disseminating is
 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.250
collections and disseminating is
actually one of the more difficult of

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260
actually one of the more difficult of
 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.440
actually one of the more difficult of
these and I think not preferred to this

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450
these and I think not preferred to this
 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.740
