00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:11.250
The Time That Pre-Sliced Bread was Illegal

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.110
In 1943, Claude R. Wickard, the head of the
War Foods Administration as well as the Secretary

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.130
of Agriculture, got the bright idea to ban
pre-sliced bread in America, which he did

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.560
on January 18, 1943.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.289
The specific reasons behind this aren’t
entirely clear, though it was about conservation

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.300
of resources, particularly generally thought
to have been about conserving wax paper, wheat,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.309
and steel.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.390
With regards to the wax paper conservation,
by FDA regulations, pre-sliced bread used

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.879
much thicker wax paper than loaves sold whole,
due to the fact that sliced bread, not surprisingly,

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.899
goes stale significantly faster than loaves
left unsliced.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.609
While this was the official stated reason
for the ban, there was no shortage of wax

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.019
paper at the time the ban was put in place;
according to the War Production Board, most

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.030
bread making companies had wax paper supplies
on hand to last several months, even if they

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.550
didn’t buy anymore during that span.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.740
It has also been suggested that a secondary
goal was to try to conserve wheat and to lower

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.530
bread and flour prices.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.820
Around WWII, the Office of Price Administration
had authorized an increase in flour prices

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.290
by about 10%.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.990
This naturally resulted in the price of bread
increasing.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.740
When pre-sliced bread was first introduced
nation-wide, it drastically increased bread

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.740
sales.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.950
So, the thought was that by banning pre-sliced
bread, the amount of bread consumed would

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.990
go down.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.200
This would then reduce the demand for flour
and wheat, and, thus, decrease prices of those

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.190
products while simultaneously increasing stockpiles
of wheat.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.660
As with the wax paper reasoning, the idea
of conserving wheat seems an odd thing given

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.880
that, at the time of the ban, the U.S. had
stockpiled over 1 billion bushels of wheat.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.240
This is enough to meet the United States’
needs for about two years, even if no new

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.190
wheat was harvested over that span.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.650
Finally, bread making machines themselves
used quite a bit of steel in their production;

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.510
so it has been suggested that one of the reasons
for this bread ban was to conserve this metal.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.040
This line of reasoning also seems somewhat
dubious as most bread manufacturers weren’t

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.560
actively buying new bread slicing machines
at any given time; so the benefit would be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.030
marginal, even accounting for the machine’s
large size and significant amount of metal

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.040
used in its production.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.930
As you might imagine, banning pre-sliced bread
didn’t go over very well with the masses.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.540
“The best thing since sliced bread” is
an expression for a reason.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.870
As one woman aptly put it in a letter appearing
in The New York Times:

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.319
I should like to let you know how important
sliced bread is to the morale and saneness

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.319
of a household.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.130
My husband and four children are all in a
rush during and after breakfast.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.760
Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing
for toast—two pieces for each one—that’s

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760
ten.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.840
For their lunches I must cut by hand at least
twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.810
Afterward I make my own toast.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.620
Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a
hurry!

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.960
Within about three months of the ban being
introduced, on March 8, 1943, it was rescinded.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.350
Upon lifting the ban, Wickard stated, “Our
experience with the order, however, leads

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:37.960
us to believe that the savings are not as
much as we expected…”
