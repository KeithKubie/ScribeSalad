00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, the first thing I want to clear up is that the earth is not an insulator.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The only reason this method works at all that we can draw this electrons up from the earth

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is because the earth is more of a conductor than an insulator.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That was a bad answer. Also the earth is not able to create electrons.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Nothing can create an electron without also somehow creating a corresponding positive charge.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The truth is part of the reason why we can do this is because the earth is just gigantic.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What if I take a few negative charges from the earth.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Eventually, they'll probably wine up back in the earth.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The truth is, the earth serves as an infinite source and sink of electrons.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Source means for all affective purposes, we can count on the earth to provide us

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with whatever electrons we need in this situation.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Likewise, we can also deposit electrons into the earth, essentially infinitely.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This idea that the earth is an infinite source and sink of electrons,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
well that's what the word grounding means.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's talk to Lucio Fregonese to see what he has to say about the topic.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We say that the body is grounded when it is an electrical communication with the earth,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and so there is an electrical conductor and electrical path connecting it to the earth,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and making it one conductor together with the earth.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it is a good situation sort to say because the earth is a big conductor,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and so quantities of charge if ones eat little.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This thing might be a useful concept, this idea of grounding when we have a lighting strike and we

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
need somewhere to put all of that electricity.--Looks like we're making some serious progress.
