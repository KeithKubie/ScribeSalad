00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.663
Voiceover:We have a graph right over here,

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:07.888
and we have 4 potential function
definitions for that graph.

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:10.634
What you might want to do
is pause the video right now

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.301
and think about which of
these function definitions

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:17.000
are actually being depicted
in this graph right over here?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.900
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
Now let's work through it together.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.034
Before we even address these,

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:24.233
we all see that they all have a log base 2

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.911
in the function definition.

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's just remind ourselves

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.033
what y equals log base
2 of x even looks like,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.500
and then we could think about what happens

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.900
if we were to add 1 or subtract 1 from it,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.471
or if we were to shift it a little bit.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.666
Let's just think about some
interesting values here.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.766
Let's think about some interesting values.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.167
Let's think about what happens.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.567
We'll have x and y.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.434
Let's think about when x is equal to 2.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.235
I picked 2 because if x is equal to 2,

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:55.367
you're saying log base 2 of 2,

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.433
what power do I have to
raise 2 to to get to 2?

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.668
We'll have to raise it to the 1st power.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.500
What about when x is equal to ...

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.569
Actually, let me do several of them.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.848
Let's do an x is equal to 8.

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:10.500
Log base 2 of 8 is 3.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.301
I raise 2 to the 3rd power.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:13.500
I get 8.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.102
Let's do 4.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:18.633
Log base 2 of 4 is 2.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.833
2 to the 2nd power is equal to 4.

00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:24.866
Let's do 2, where we started off with.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:28.434
That log base 2 of 2 is going to be 1.

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:31.333
2 to the 1st power is equal to 2.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.833
Now let's think about
when x is equal to 1.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.566
We'd have to raise 2 too to get to 1.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.166
Well, I raise it to the 0th power.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.900
2 to the 0th power is equal to 1.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.600
Now let's think about
how we would get to 1/2.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.735
What do I have to raise
2 to to get to 1/2?

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:57.100
2 to the negative 1 power
is going to be equal to 1/2,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.833
and I can keep going.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.400
What about 1/4?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.449
That's 2 to the negative 2 power is 1/4.

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:03.767
I could go to 1/8.

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:10.333
2 to the negative 3 power is equal to 1/8.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:12.300
Now let's just graph some of these points.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.367
When x is equal to 8, y is equal to 3.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:20.700
When x is equal to 4, y is equal to 2.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.100
When x is equal to 2, y is equal to 1.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.833
When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 0.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.500
I think you see the general
shape already forming.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.966
When x is 1/2, y is negative 1.

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:38.633
When x is 1/4, y is negative 2.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:39.966
I think you see where this is going.

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:43.100
When x is 1/8, y is negative 3.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.267
See, you have a graph that
looks something like this.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:48.767
It looks something like this.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.600
I'm just connecting the dots.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:55.501
This is the behavior that we would expect.

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.566
As x becomes really, really, really large,

00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:00.366
you think about what power
do I have to raise 2 to,

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:01.633
2 to to get that x?

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.233
Well, it's going to increase,

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.233
but it's going to increase
at an ever-decreasing rate.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:11.501
Then we see that as x
approaches 0 from the right,

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.233
to get closer and closer to 0,

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.566
you have to raise 2 to more and more

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:17.233
and more negative values,

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.966
so the log, as we approach 0, it becomes

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.000
very, very, very, very, very negative.

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.433
We could never quite get to x equals 0.

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.833
If you put an actual 0 right over here,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.702
what power would you have
to raise 2 to to get to 0?

00:03:30.702 --> 00:03:31.633
Well, you can't.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:35.302
You could get close to 0
by raising 2 to a very,

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.367
a very, very, very negative

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:38.901
a very, very, very negative value,

00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:40.967
and this thing right over
here is not going to be

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:44.501
even defined for negative, for any,

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.100
for non-positive x's.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.301
That's why we have it not
defined for anything less than

00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:51.366
or equal to 0.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:55.366
This domain right over here
is only for positive x's.

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.301
That's log base 2 of x.

00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.372
How is this thing right over here,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.850
how does this thing right
over here look different?

00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.033
Well, the obvious thing
that jumps out at me

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:08.100
is that it's flipped over the x-axis,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.367
so that's a pretty good
sign that this is going ...

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.333
we're going to have a
negative log base 2 of x.

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.510
Let's actually now graph.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.575
Let's graph that.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:20.370
What's y is equal to
negative log base 2 of x

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.700
going to look like?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.978
Each of these points, we're
just going to flip it over,

00:04:23.978 --> 00:04:26.054
we're just going to
flip it over the x-axis,

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:27.542
so we're going to go there.

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:30.133
We're going to go there.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.035
We're going to go there,

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:34.100
and then this,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.167
this is going to go through
that point right over here,

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:39.317
and then let's see,

00:04:39.317 --> 00:04:41.871
instead of it 1/2, it's
going to be like this.

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:44.309
y equals negative log base 2 of x

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:45.898
is going to look something like this.

00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:47.933
Let me see if I can draw it neatly.

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:53.800
It's going to look something like this,

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.300
something like this.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.235
We're getting close to the blue graph.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:01.733
That's y equals negative log base 2 of x.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:02.767
What's the difference

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.066
between the green graph
and the blue graph?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.918
If you look carefully, you see,

00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:10.500
you see that the blue graph is essentially

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.066
the green graph shifted to the left by 2,

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.700
shifted to the left.

00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:19.367
We've shifted it to the left by 2.

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.053
At every one of these points,

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.533
we have shifted to the left by 2.

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:28.800
How do you shift to the left by 2?

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:33.466
You would replace the x with an x plus 2.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:37.266
You would replace the x with an x plus 2.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.556
One way to think about it is

00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:43.927
in the original negative log base 2 of x,

00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:48.633
we see this asymptote at x equals 0.

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:50.663
Now we're going to see the asymptote

00:05:50.663 --> 00:05:52.700
when this whole expression,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.700
x plus 2 is equal to 0,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.166
x plus 2 is equal to 0 when
x is equal to negative 2.

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.767
When x is equal to negative 2,

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:02.266
you see the asymptote right over there.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:05.300
I encourage you, you could
try values out if you like.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.766
You could essentially
take all of these values.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:11.033
You could take all of these
values and subtract 2 from them,

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.300
and then when you add 2,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.300
you're going to get back to these values.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.700
If you shift to the left by 2,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.833
that's like replacing
the x with an x plus 2.

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:22.566
This is what is being graphed.

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:26.601
Once again, try out the values
if you don't believe me.
