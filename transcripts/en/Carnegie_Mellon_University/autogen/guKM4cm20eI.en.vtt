through the textbook but what I really

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:15.770
through the textbook but what I really
 

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.559
through the textbook but what I really
really like about it is the feedback

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:17.569
really like about it is the feedback
 

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:19.869
really like about it is the feedback
that you receive whether it's correct it

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879
that you receive whether it's correct it
 

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:22.300
that you receive whether it's correct it
tells you why you're correct and if

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.310
tells you why you're correct and if
 

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.520
tells you why you're correct and if
you're incorrect it's it's red and tells

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530
you're incorrect it's it's red and tells
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.370
you're incorrect it's it's red and tells
you why you're incorrect and it helps

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:27.380
you why you're incorrect and it helps
 

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.350
you why you're incorrect and it helps
you out to answer correctly the second

it's pretty much the same except that

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:36.380
it's pretty much the same except that
 

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.449
it's pretty much the same except that
you actually able to do it just right

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:37.459
you actually able to do it just right
 

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:39.579
you actually able to do it just right
then and there and get the feedback so

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:39.589
then and there and get the feedback so
 

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:42.250
then and there and get the feedback so

you know when I think about going
forward and I look at how can we address

environments and learn about the

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:15.750
environments and learn about the
 

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.150
environments and learn about the
learning sciences we're learning

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160
learning sciences we're learning
 

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.820
learning sciences we're learning
organizations in higher education I mean

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:19.830
organizations in higher education I mean
 

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.620
organizations in higher education I mean
we're never going to stop learning but

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:21.630
we're never going to stop learning but
 

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.780
we're never going to stop learning but
the bottom line is are my students going

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:23.790
the bottom line is are my students going
 

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.310
the bottom line is are my students going
to acquire that content are they going

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320
to acquire that content are they going
 

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.930
to acquire that content are they going
to be ready for the next level of course

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940
to be ready for the next level of course
 

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.850
to be ready for the next level of course
and are they going to stay on track to

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860
and are they going to stay on track to
 

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.580
and are they going to stay on track to
finish and that's a big challenge for us

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:31.590
finish and that's a big challenge for us
 

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.680
finish and that's a big challenge for us
going forward so I think you know when

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:33.690
going forward so I think you know when
 

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.990
going forward so I think you know when
you see the the the date of the research

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000
you see the the the date of the research
 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.730
you see the the the date of the research
the evidence to say students are

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740
the evidence to say students are
 

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.160
the evidence to say students are
finishing in a shorter amount of time if

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.170
finishing in a shorter amount of time if
 

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.380
finishing in a shorter amount of time if
we could get students at least

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:42.390
we could get students at least
 

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.090
we could get students at least
twenty-five percent hopefully fifty

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100
twenty-five percent hopefully fifty
 

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.130
twenty-five percent hopefully fifty
percent more students finishing their

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.140
percent more students finishing their
 

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.570
percent more students finishing their
degrees in less time we will actually be

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:50.580
degrees in less time we will actually be
 

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.030
degrees in less time we will actually be
providing more into the economic base of

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040
providing more into the economic base of
 

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.590
providing more into the economic base of
this country we're going to be

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600
this country we're going to be
 

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.270
this country we're going to be
populating the two to three million jobs

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:56.280
populating the two to three million jobs
 

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.000
populating the two to three million jobs
and the economy that are unfilled today

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.010
and the economy that are unfilled today
 

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.700
and the economy that are unfilled today
we're going to sort of stop the tide of

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:01.710
we're going to sort of stop the tide of
 

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.340
we're going to sort of stop the tide of
the declining role that students are

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:04.350
the declining role that students are
 

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.810
the declining role that students are
playing in the economy because they're

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:05.820
playing in the economy because they're
 

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.300
playing in the economy because they're
not prepared for the jobs of the future

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.310
not prepared for the jobs of the future
 

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.470
not prepared for the jobs of the future
so I'm really inspired by the open

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480
so I'm really inspired by the open
 

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.760
so I'm really inspired by the open
learning initiative i think it's

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:10.770
learning initiative i think it's
 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.000
learning initiative i think it's
tremendously important secretary Duncan

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.010
tremendously important secretary Duncan

about an online resource center and what
 

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.950
about an online resource center and what
would it look like for the nation and it

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960
would it look like for the nation and it
 

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.990
would it look like for the nation and it
was proposed as a vision what actually

education sectors so that they can take
 

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.630
education sectors so that they can take
advantage of these new ways that

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640
advantage of these new ways that
 

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.100

today you know the president proposed in
 

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.030
today you know the president proposed in
the last couple of weeks since the State

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.040
the last couple of weeks since the State
 

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.880
the last couple of weeks since the State
of the Union a couple of ideas that we

of the Union a couple of ideas that we
 

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.680
of the Union a couple of ideas that we
hope to see going forward one is called

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:17.690
hope to see going forward one is called
 

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.470
hope to see going forward one is called
a race to the top for higher education

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480
a race to the top for higher education
 

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.240
a race to the top for higher education
focused on college affordability and

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.250
focused on college affordability and
 

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.960
focused on college affordability and
quality and completion so we are

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:25.970
quality and completion so we are
 

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.090
quality and completion so we are
reaching out to higher education and

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.100
reaching out to higher education and
 

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.590
reaching out to higher education and
policy makers to say what would this

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600
policy makers to say what would this
 

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.380
policy makers to say what would this
look like to incentivize these kinds of

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.390
look like to incentivize these kinds of
 

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.750
look like to incentivize these kinds of
environments to increase student success

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760
environments to increase student success
 

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.300
environments to increase student success
and what can we do in a shared

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:37.310
and what can we do in a shared
 

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.220
and what can we do in a shared
responsibility environment so that

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.230
responsibility environment so that
 

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.620
responsibility environment so that
states can play their part public

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:41.630
states can play their part public
 

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.510
states can play their part public
institutions can thrive private

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520
institutions can thrive private
 

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.790
institutions can thrive private
institutions can lead the way and we can

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:45.800
institutions can lead the way and we can
 

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.250
institutions can lead the way and we can
work together so that institutions can

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.260
work together so that institutions can
 

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.250
work together so that institutions can
really get those graduation goals far

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:51.260
really get those graduation goals far
 

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.500
really get those graduation goals far
more accelerated than we have in this

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:53.510
more accelerated than we have in this
 

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.140
more accelerated than we have in this
last generation and we think that also

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.150
last generation and we think that also
 

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.600
last generation and we think that also
you know a fund which the president has

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
you know a fund which the president has
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.400
you know a fund which the president has
called first in the world he did say

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.410
called first in the world he did say
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.470
called first in the world he did say
that he would like to get America back

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480
that he would like to get America back
 

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.720
that he would like to get America back
to be first in the world in the number

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:04.730
to be first in the world in the number
 

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.420
to be first in the world in the number
in the proportion of college graduates

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:06.430
in the proportion of college graduates
 

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.920
in the proportion of college graduates
across our nation when compared to other

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:08.930
across our nation when compared to other
 

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.380
across our nation when compared to other
countries so proposing a first in the

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:11.390
countries so proposing a first in the
 

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.750
countries so proposing a first in the
world competition would give professors

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760
world competition would give professors
 

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.310

look that you'll hear from today and

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320
look that you'll hear from today and
 

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.320
look that you'll hear from today and
others around the country the chance to

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:17.330
others around the country the chance to
 

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.240
others around the country the chance to
really innovate and take this kind of

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.250
really innovate and take this kind of
 

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.340
really innovate and take this kind of
work and double and triple the results

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.350
work and double and triple the results
 

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.140
work and double and triple the results
going forward that's what we want to see

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.150
going forward that's what we want to see
 

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.540
going forward that's what we want to see
we have too many students that are under

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.550
we have too many students that are under
 

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.480
we have too many students that are under
prepared at too many levels so it's very

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.490
prepared at too many levels so it's very
 

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.760
prepared at too many levels so it's very
exciting work in my opinion we've got a

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:30.770
exciting work in my opinion we've got a
 

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.830
exciting work in my opinion we've got a
couple of proposals that I think can be

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840
couple of proposals that I think can be
 

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.660
couple of proposals that I think can be
really helpful to us going forward and

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:34.670
really helpful to us going forward and
 

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.910
really helpful to us going forward and
you know as educators let me just close

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:36.920
you know as educators let me just close
 

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.430
you know as educators let me just close
off by saying you know every having been

off by saying you know every having been
 

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.380

strategies into into our classrooms and

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:48.340
strategies into into our classrooms and
 

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.630
strategies into into our classrooms and
to our universities I'm a believer that

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640
to our universities I'm a believer that
 

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.230
to our universities I'm a believer that
it is important to focus initially on

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240
it is important to focus initially on
 

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.390
it is important to focus initially on
the low-hanging fruit I would call it

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:57.400
the low-hanging fruit I would call it
 

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.169
the low-hanging fruit I would call it
the large lower division stem courses i

00:29:01.169 --> 00:29:01.179
the large lower division stem courses i
 

00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:03.390
the large lower division stem courses i
think they are particularly well

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:03.400
think they are particularly well
 

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.780
think they are particularly well
designed for these strategies and they

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:06.790
designed for these strategies and they
 

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.910
designed for these strategies and they
are the important courses to focus on

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:08.920
are the important courses to focus on
 

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.470
are the important courses to focus on
because we lose so many students out of

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480
because we lose so many students out of
 

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.260
because we lose so many students out of
the stem pipeline in the first two years

day that only a third of the students

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880
day that only a third of the students
 

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.210

measure major in stem ever end up with a

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.190
measure major in stem ever end up with a
 

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.290
measure major in stem ever end up with a
stem degree so in this part because they

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:31.300
stem degree so in this part because they
 

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.910
stem degree so in this part because they
get turned off in those first two years

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:32.920
get turned off in those first two years
 

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.000
get turned off in those first two years
that's the magic of this of this

approach as we saw from those students
 

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.890

in the community college I think the I

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:40.900
in the community college I think the I

in the community college I think the I
just want to make that point that the

that that the another value
of this approach is it is right for the

and they didn't know what to do so they

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:54.110
and they didn't know what to do so they
 

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.230
and they didn't know what to do so they
can ask for a hint and the system will

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240
can ask for a hint and the system will
 

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.420

the first step is so they click there

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200
the first step is so they click there
 

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.990
the first step is so they click there
and resolve each of the forces into its

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000
and resolve each of the forces into its
 

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.180
and resolve each of the forces into its
components and again the student can ask

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:07.190
components and again the student can ask
 

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.590
components and again the student can ask
for a hint if they're not sure how to do

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:08.600
for a hint if they're not sure how to do
 

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.510
for a hint if they're not sure how to do
that and the system walks them through a

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520
that and the system walks them through a
 

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.090
that and the system walks them through a
hinting sequence that is scaffolding the

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:13.100
hinting sequence that is scaffolding the
 

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.070

trying to solve the problem until they
 

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.740
trying to solve the problem until they
get what we call the bottom out hint

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:18.750
get what we call the bottom out hint
 

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.470
get what we call the bottom out hint
which is the answer and we give them

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480
which is the answer and we give them
 

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.210
which is the answer and we give them
that so they don't get stuck so they can

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220
that so they don't get stuck so they can
 

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.430

safe drinking water is and they can look

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560
safe drinking water is and they can look
 

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.230
safe drinking water is and they can look
at the analysis in the virtual lab and

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240
at the analysis in the virtual lab and
 

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.000
at the analysis in the virtual lab and
they can see how many moles of arsenic

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.010
they can see how many moles of arsenic
 

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.190
they can see how many moles of arsenic
are in that water but the World Health

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200
are in that water but the World Health
 

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.540

micrograms of arsenic are safe to drink
so in order to even answer that first

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:41.190
so in order to even answer that first
 

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.130
so in order to even answer that first
question they have to be able to do the

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140
question they have to be able to do the
 

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.250
question they have to be able to do the
conversion from moles to micrograms per

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260
conversion from moles to micrograms per
 

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.240
conversion from moles to micrograms per
liter and so what you can't see this

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:50.250
liter and so what you can't see this
 

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.310
liter and so what you can't see this
happening is as the students are

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640
 

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.010
what we know about our own learning is

what we know about our own learning is
 

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.080
what we know about our own learning is
this tip of the iceberg here and what's

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:09.090
this tip of the iceberg here and what's
 

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.860
this tip of the iceberg here and what's
really going on when we learn is much

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:12.870
really going on when we learn is much
 

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:16.210
really going on when we learn is much
bigger and it's much more complex and

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.220
bigger and it's much more complex and
 

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.830
bigger and it's much more complex and
because we have this impression that we

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:18.840
because we have this impression that we
 

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.560
because we have this impression that we
understand learning we are our decisions

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:21.570
understand learning we are our decisions
