00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.959
Graphene holds the promise of the future of
engineering and technology, it’s like a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.270
miracle substance!

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.160
It was discovered in 2004, and we’ve had
a lot of trouble making it… until now.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.390
Hey graph-heads, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.230
Remember wayyy back in 2013 when we learned
graphene capacitors might make our phones

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
magical?

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.040
We said someday they’ll charge in five seconds!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.349
Then graphene sort of… disappeared.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.560
I mean, it was out there, and we knew it was
cool, but we had trouble making a lot of it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.370
at one time, or doing things with it.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.860
So, time for an update.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.860
Let me catch y’all up.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.000
Graphene is a one-atom thick lattice of carbon
atoms.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.940
It’s super-capacitive, electrically conductive,
biodegradable, 200 times stronger than steel,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.200
can take pretty much any shape, and is ultralight.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.260
It’s been theorized to help clean up nuclear
waste, easily filter the salt from seawater,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
could make ridiculous headphones, is biocompatible
-- meaning you can hook it right to biological

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.350
cells (read: cyborgs)... um, what else….

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.300
Oh right, help make space elevators a reality,
create flexible computers, unbreakable phone

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.460
screens, and create the base for new supercomputers…
needless to say, the shiz is tight.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.460
The problem iiisss...

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.080
It’s kind of really super hard to make in
large quantities.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.810
It’s what supply chain management people
would call an issue with scale.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
Until very recently, graphene could only be
made in tiny quantities or using difficult

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.670
processes.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.090
For example, a study from 2015 in Nature Communications
detailed the growing -- yes growing -- of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.430
the nanoscale graphene lattice on a copper
base.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.520
But, from that they only got a sheet of 8
by 13 millimeters.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
SO GREAT.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.800
(whisper: not great).

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.560
Though admittedly, they say this could scale
up…

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.880
This stuff is so incredible, that everyone
is working to try and figure it out.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.700
But, it’s just too expensive to make it
at a large scale outside of a laboratory.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.290
Though, a 2017 study in Nature Communications
detailed how to make graphene in a single

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.479
step: heating soybean oil to 800 C on a nickel
foil causes the carbon to arrange into a single

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.069
(one atom-thick) sheet of graphene -- slightly
hotter temperatures made the sheets of graphene

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.080
thicker!

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.069
This method is fast, works out in the open
air (most others require a vacuum chamber),

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.530
and could cut the cost of making this stuff
ten-fold!

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.900
Though they’re still not scaling it… the
largest sheet created thus far was about the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.220
size of a credit card.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.800
But funnily enough, a physics professor just
patented an accidentally discovered “high-yield”

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.209
graphene creation system!

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.550
It’s scalable, affordable, and (like the
soybean method) doesn’t use the “nasty

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.709
chemicals” used by older methods.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.000
To create it, they literally explode acetylene
and oxygen using a spark plug.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.990
Acetylene provides the carbon for the graphene
to create itself in the heat of the explosion,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.650
but they don’t come out in nice sheets,
rather, in chunks.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.920
Grams of chunks!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.400
While the yield of other methods is measured
in milligrams, this makes way more!

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.820
Their problem (because nothing is easy) is
the graphene isn’t as high quality… so

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.690
they have to fix that, maybe by getting it
out of the explosion chamber sooner?

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.690
We’ll see.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.990
At least one group of researchers is looking
ahead to when all these problems with making

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.760
graphene are worked out, and are molding the
ultra-light material into a fluffy, “cobwebby”

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760
network.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.290
The design, published in Science Advances
details how MIT researchers addressed a problem

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.180
with graphene: when turning it into shapes,
you lose some of its incredible properties.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.280
By looking at the atomic structure, they found
part of the magic of graphene is the way the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.099
atoms are interconnected.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.950
By mimicking that atomic design on a macro
level -- they created this weird shape.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.640
That mimicked shape lets graphene keep its
amazing properties.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.610
We just have to figure out how to use it to
construct buildings!

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.959
It’s lighter than a plastic bag, but stronger
than steel.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.319
Someday, they could grow graphene in or on
molds like this one, and use that product

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.780
to build a bridge!

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.879
Assuming… of course, we can ever make it.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.769
Look, however you feel about graphene.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.430
Get out there and become an engineer.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.360
Not only do we need more people figuring out
how to design bridges based on carbon atoms,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.210
but we need more people blowing up stuff to
try and invent the world’s strongest material.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.079
And, that person could be you.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.169
Science is the best.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.180
Want more information on graphene and find
out how it can charge your cell phone in five

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.180
seconds?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.509
Watch this super old video I edited myself
in 2013.

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:26.509
Yeah, I know.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.509
I KNOW.

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.509
Those were the days.

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.979
What do you guys think about super-strong,
ultralight graphene?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.979
What would you build?

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.009
