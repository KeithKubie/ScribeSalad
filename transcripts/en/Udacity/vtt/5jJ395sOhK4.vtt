00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So welcome to our very first homework assignment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is number 1. [Homework Assignment #1]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Just to recap, in the class we learned about localization. [Localization]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We learned about about histogram filters. [Histogram filters]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we programmed some in Python. [Python]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So the homework assignment will cover this plus some very basic probability. [Probability]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
[Question 1] In the first question, I'm going to ask you some very basic probability questions.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We have random variable X and the probability of 0.2.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What's the probability of the complement?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We have 2 random variables, X and Y, whose probability individually is 0.2.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And X and Y are independent. [X, Y independent]

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What's the probability of the joint X, Y?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we have the variable P(X) with probability of 0.2,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we have 2 conditionals, P(Y|X) and P(Y|Â¬X), both 0.6.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What's the probability of Y?

00:00:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Here you have to apply total probability.
