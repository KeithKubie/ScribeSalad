SUMIT CHANDEL: Hi , guys.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:01.730
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.640
My name is Sumit Chandel,
Developer Advocate on the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.290
AdWord API.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.640
What I'll be talking about
today is mobile best

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.330
practices, catching up
with a moving target.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.710
So this is the agenda.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
The first item is just how
important is mobile?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.860
So we'll look at that and
look at some trends.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.870
After covering how important it
is, then we'll look at how

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.440
to set them up using the API.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.795
We'll look at targeting
campaigns, so how to target

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.530
mobile campaigns, setting up
mobile extensions, using call

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.990
metrics, which is a new feature
introduced in the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.050
AdWords front end and is
available to some degree

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.630
through the API as well.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.050
And then finally, mobile
campaign performance

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.470
reporting, and we'll look at
how to track performance of

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.400
these campaigns using the
new reports for this.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.980
OK, so just how important
is mobile?

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.600
The answer is really
important.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.300
In fact, there's a whole mobile
movement going on.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.550
Now I'll apologize because I'm
about to show you guys a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.295
YouTube video, which is loaded
with marketing terms, and I

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.160
know that we are mostly
engineers here.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.480
But there are some really
interesting numbers that are

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.890
presented in that video, so
it's somewhat appealing.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.790
At least it was to me
when I first saw it.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.360
So hopefully, it's appealing
to you guys as well.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.300
Getting back to my slightly less
interesting slides, this

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.130
is a quote from Mary Meeker.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.090
Some of you guys might
recognize her.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.960
She actually wrote "The Internet
Report" back in 1995

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.250
and talked about the internet
movement and how important

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550
e-commerce was going to be and
how important it was to get an

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.800
online presence.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.440
She also recently was quoted
saying mobile is ramping

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.320
faster than any other
technology

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.090
we've seen in the past.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.580
So that's a pretty strong
statement considering that she

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.590
wrote "The Internet
Report," which

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.670
itself was a huge movement.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.711
So the move to mobile
is happening

00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.800
even faster than that.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.260
Some more interesting stats
to share with you guys.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.050
So the mobile web
is exploding.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
The graph here shows US mobile
queries and the growth that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.260
we've seen over the last year.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.880
As you can see, the y-axis is
in net so we don't actually

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.310
show the exact numbers.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.830
But it's just to give an idea
what the trend looks like and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.480
that in the last year we've
seen a 4x growth in mobile

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.930
search queries in the US.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.140
Another trend we've seen is that
mobile internet usage is

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.620
soon going to surpass desktop
internet usage.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.130
So it hasn't happened yet.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.010
But if current trends continue,
we do see that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.110
happening in mid-2013.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.270
Another interesting data point
is mobile allows for constant

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.590
connectivity.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.440
For an average user, on an
average day, the usage of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.398
internet through a PC or through
a mobile device-- so

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:32.380
you can see around lunchtime
when people leave the office,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.220
it dips for desktop usage.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.990
That's when mobile actually
picks up.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.150
Later on in the evening around
6:00 PM, desktop

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.930
usage again drops off.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.070
And you see mobile is actually
rising and actually surpasses

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.880
desktop usage near the late
hours of the night.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.770
Mobile usage also complements
desktops.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.260
So you can see, throughout
the week there

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.650
are dips on the weekend.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.160
You can see throughout that,
there's still high or constant

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.915
mobile usage.

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:59.140
It spikes where desktop drops.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.390
Some more interesting data,
actually this is a really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.600
great website,
ourmobileplanet.com.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.490
We, Google, are a partner with
that, and there's other

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.830
companies as well who apply
their data there.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.740
This is a graph that
I generated from

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740
that website, actually.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.560
It's just tracking different
actions that users take after

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.160
performing a local
search and which

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.940
percentages take what actions.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.170
So, as you can see, for example,
in the US, about 51%

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.990
of users who perform a local
search will end up calling the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.210
business afterwards.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.750
That speaks both to location
extensions for the local

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.760
search and mobile extensions
for the click-to-call, the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.390
call to the business
afterwards.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.840
So having seen just how
important mobile is, now let's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.800
talk about how do we
set them up, so

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.690
getting to our main objective.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.360
So the first step is targeting
campaigns.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.280
We actually have criteria now
for all the different campaign

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.450
targets we might want to set.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.590
So that's what we are
going to do here.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.100
So we have a campaign let's
say we just created.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.600
And now we want to set up the
targeting for this campaign.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.970
We're going to look at the
different targets or criteria

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.130
objects that we'd want to set on
it to properly target this

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.770
new campaign, the first of which
will be the platform.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.180
The different platforms
are desktop,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.770
high-end mobile, and tablet.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.850
These now correspond to these
criteria, these on the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.050
right-hand side in
that table there.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.140
This is an excerpt
from the SOAP that

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.620
you'd send in and request.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.470
So you'd set a criteria on the
type of platform and set the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.243
ID to 30001.

00:04:28.243 --> 00:04:30.170
That corresponds to the
high-end mobile in the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.010
previous slide we just saw.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.480
The stuff in the grayed out
text, that's optional on

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.180
input, which you'll get
back in response.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.430
What else might we
want to set?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.600
The carrier.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.210
That's another important target,
something that's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.190
existed in previous versions
and something

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.820
that has changed now.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.100
This is how you'd set it
in the new service.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.590
So we have a different carrier
name and country code

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.480
combinations.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.300
This is just a list
of some of them.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.045
So let's say if we were to
target NTT DoCoMo in Japan.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:01.450
The criteria ID there
is 70000.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.440
And so similar to our previous
criteria type that we set, we

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.420
have another one that we set.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.850
That's type carrier.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.570
This time the ID is 70000.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.690
And again, the grayed out text
is just to show that that's

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.330
optional on input that, which
you get back in response.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.980
OK, so we've set the carrier.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.730
We've set the platform.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.310
What else might we set?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.770
Operating system version.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.570
So this is currently how we're
exposing the different mobile

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.250
OSes that we can target.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.610
This might actually expand to
desktops as well and different

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.460
operating systems you
can target there.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.020
For the time being,
this is the only

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.500
platform you have there--

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.990
Android, iOS and Palm.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.460
Let's say we're going
to target Android.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.790
So in this case, we also have
the criteria type that we're

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.400
going to set.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.630
This time the type is
OPERATING_SYSTEM_VERSION.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.590
And the ID we pass in
there is 630159.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.610
That corresponds to Android.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.060
Next, let's set up mobile
extensions.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.980
So a mobile extension, like a
location extension, which I

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.350
also strongly recommend to use,
allows you to apply a

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.040
fifth line of text to the text
ads that you serve and

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.000
provides that extra line there
that you see at the bottom

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.500
with a phone number to call.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.430
So you can set the mobile
attention of the campaign

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.440
level and any ads that are
living under that will show up

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.130
with that fifth line if they're

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.010
served on a mobile device.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.900
So let's look at
how to do that.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.110
This sample is actually
using v201101 Java

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.600
Client library code.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.630
It's going to look
exactly the--

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.615
I think almost exactly the same
in the new version, so

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:25.700
the example is still
useful here.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.195
So we create the mobile
extension.

00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:30.280
We set the phone number--

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.460
it's a 514 number--

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.178
country code, and finally a
Boolean to set as call only.

00:06:38.178 --> 00:06:41.267
It controls whether or not you
want the text to show up with

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.900
it with the ability to click
through to your web page or

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.390
only click-to-call.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.090
So in that case, if it's set,
it's calling the false.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.130
It's means that the user
has both options.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.060
They can see the ad and click
through to your website, or

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.150
they can actually
click and call.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.740
If that was set to true,
they could only call.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.430
Next, we create the generic
campaign ad extension, and we

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.110
set the campaign ad extension to
the mobile extension, which

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.920
we just created.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.960
And then finally, we create
our operation.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.880
We set the operand, the
operator, and then we can

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.220
mutate call at the bottom
and get our result back.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.580
OK, so using call metrics.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.050
It's a number that we actually
generate on our side and that

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.720
we can put in as a click-to-call
number for your

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.150
ads, so we can basically
generate call metrics for you.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.705
We can know how many users have
called, how long have the

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.774
calls lasted, how many missed
calls do you have, all that

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:31.180
kind of information.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.100
So currently, call metrics can
only be set through the UI,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.420
and it only targets the US and
Canada for the time being.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.430
There are plans eventually to
expose it through the API and

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.310
that will be through the mobile
extension, through a

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.550
flag that you can set there.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.920
To specify whether or not you
want to use your own number

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.835
and in cases where you're using
your own call tracking,

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.620
you might want to do that, or
if you'd like to use call

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.800
metrics and have us
auto-generate the number and

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.220
place it into your
mobile extension.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.620
So this is just a screenshot of
what it looks like if you

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.750
want to set this in the UI.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.010
A bit more info about call
metrics is the pricing.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.200
So the way it works, if a user
does clicks and calls, it will

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.390
basically get charged the
same CBC that you bid.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.540
The only time that's not the
case is if the user calls the

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.740
number directly without
clicking.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.630
They just see the number and
pick up their landline phone

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.530
and then dial the number.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.060
That's going to be a $1.00--
a one US-dollar charge.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.480
Now, how do we track the
performance of these campaigns

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.420
that we're running?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.380
We do that in the same way that
we do for all reporting.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.430
We set up a report definition
that we'll pass in the request

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.380
payload where we're basically
selecting a bunch

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.360
of different fields.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.140
So we're selecting date,
campaign ID, ad ID, and so

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.530
forth, clicks, click type--

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.299
that's an important one--

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:47.890
and device as well as one of
the additional fields.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.270
Then we add predicates to the
filter on the fields that

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.440
we've selected.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.720
Those predicates will
be on click type.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.465
So this will help us isolate
calls, basically, click to

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:02.310
calls to isolate our mobile
campaigns, and then an extra

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.260
predicate there, which isn't
completely necessary.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.810
I think if you filter on click
type already, you've basically

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.250
isolated it.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.610
But you can also just
filter on device for

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.770
high-end mobile only.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.680
That way, the reports you get
back are strictly for your

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.380
mobile campaigns.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.170
All right, next is reporting
on call metrics.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.370
For that, we've actually--

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.770
with the v201109 release,
we've included some new

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.490
columns in the report service
specifically for call metrics.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.750
That's the ones that you see
here, so call duration

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.490
seconds, average call duration
seconds, number of calls,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.290
number of missed calls, number
of received calls.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.830
You can imagine that as this
call metrics feature matures,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.566
there will be other fields here
as well, which you might

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:46.640
be able to get out.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.300
For the moment, this is
what's available.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.190
So this is what you can
include in your report

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.050
definitions as selectable
fields to report

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.020
on your call metrics.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.110
And an important note about
this is that call metrics

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.440
reporting is only available
at the campaign level.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.210
So there's a very good reason
why it isn't set up that way.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.840
And you can only do it with
campaigns because we don't

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.870
have enough numbers to represent
the number of ads

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.950
that we're showing.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.000
OK, any other questions?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.250
All right, cool.
