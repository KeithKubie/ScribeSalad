00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.355
So we just found only one root for the polynomial 4x squared plus 4x plus 1. My

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:08.367
question is what does only having one real root mean for the graph of the

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:12.670
equation? Does it there's only on x-intercept? Does it mean there is only on

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.158
y-intercept? Does it mean that there is only one vertex, or does it mean that we

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:18.081
made a mistake?
