00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.830
The human race may be more unified by music
than we think.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.690
What if... across the world, specific patterns,
frequencies and rhythms tie to specific human

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.560
emotions and applications?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.920
What if music, is… universal?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.200
There is a cross-cultural connection and relation
when it comes to music, where people of all

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.770
different backgrounds might have the same
opinions on specific musical notes and songs.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.390
At Harvard University a researcher did a study
of 750 internet users in over 60 countries

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.530
and had them listen to portions of songs that
were collected from 86 different small societies

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.850
around the world.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.739
They then answered questions on what they
heard.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.379
Each multiple choice option asked what the
purpose of the song may have been for, such

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.719
as dancing, soothing a baby, healing illness
etc…

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.700
The study showed that despite the fact that
each participant had never heard the music

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.000
before, the MAJORITY of them were still able
to relate it to the true purpose of each song.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.379
For example, say there was a song used for
healing in its culture of origin.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.080
This study indicates that even people who
were unfamiliar with the music would likely

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.220
guess it was song written for the purpose
of healing!

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.470
So, the majority of participants efficiently
chose the correct corresponding mood, emotion

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620
or purpose, related to the song.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.800
One of the main distinctions found in the
study was also that certain songs seem to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.880
oppose each other musically.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.550
For example dance songs were normally faster
and more rhythmically complex, and participants

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.610
interpreted these to be happier and well,
more exciting…

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.480
Whereas lullabies, were slower, more simple,
and interpreted to be sad and less exciting.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.280
Future research will target participants that
live in smaller-scale societies that may have

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.660
never heard music outside of their own culture.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.680
That way we see what THEY have to say regarding
the purposes of different music too.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.980
But music isn’t only found in the human
race, there’s major similarities with humans

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.660
and animal songs as well.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.150
Take birds for instance!

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.270
One study showed the modal register - a.k.a.
the chest voice - is found in both human speech

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670
and animal song.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.670
In fact, they are surprisingly similar even
though we are very different species.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.090
Can this be a way of showing whether or not
music is truly universal?

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.580
What do you guys think?

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.650
Hello everyone, like science in your day?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.300
You should subscribe, and speaking of universal,
what sound do other planets make?!

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.280
Check Trace's video about the auroras on Jupiter.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
One last thing, In that same study, when it
came to detecting love songs, the participants

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.530
didn’t do so well in accuracy.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.060
Maybe love is just too complex afterall.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.420
Thanks for watching Seeker!
