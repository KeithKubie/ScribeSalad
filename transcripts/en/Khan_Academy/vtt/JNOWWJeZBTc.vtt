00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.290
- [Instructor] We are told,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.080
"A large nationwide poll recently showed

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.730
"an unemployment rate of
9% in the United States.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.100
"The mayor of a local town wonders

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.460
"if this national result
holds true for her town,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.370
"so she plans on taking a sample

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.000
"of her residents to see
if the unemployment rate

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.910
"is significantly different
than 9% in her town.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.000
"Let P represent the
unemployment rate in her town.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.480
"Here are the hypotheses she'll use."

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.850
So, her null hypothesis is that,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.190
hey, the unemployment rate in her town

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.500
is the same as for the country,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.100
and her alternative hypothesis

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.980
is that it is not the same.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.020
"Under which of the following conditions

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.320
"would the mayor commit a Type I error?"

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.960
So, pause this video,
and see if you can figure

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.910
it out on your own.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.570
Now, let's work through this together,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.320
so let's just remind
ourselves what a Type I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.470
error even is.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.900
This is a situation where we reject

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.140
the null hypothesis,
even though it is true.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.600
Reject null hypothesis,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.910
even

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.140
though,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.290
even though our null hypothesis is true.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.080
And in general, if you're
committing either a Type I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.810
or a Type II error, you're
doing the wrong thing,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.470
you're doing something that
somehow contradicts reality,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.000
even though you didn't intend to.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.020
And so, in this case,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.330
that would be rejecting the hypothesis

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.690
that the unemployment
rate is 9% in this town,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.620
even though it actually
is 9% in this town,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.300
so let's see which of these
choices match up to that.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.720
"She concludes the
town's unemployment rate

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.040
"is not 9% when it actually is."

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.210
Yeah, in this situation,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.990
in order to conclude that
the unemployment rate

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.220
is not 9%, she would have to reject

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.430
the null hypothesis, even
though the null hypothesis

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.520
is actually true, even
though the unemployment rate

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.310
actually is 9%.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.240
So, I'm liking this choice,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.610
but let's read the other
ones, just to make sure.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.200
"She concludes the town's
unemployment rate is not 9%

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.970
"when it actually is not."

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.590
Well, this wouldn't be an error.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.790
If the null hypothesis isn't true,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.440
it's not a problem to reject it,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.320
so this one wouldn't be an error.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.420
"She concludes the town's
unemployment rate is 9%

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.970
"when it actually is."

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.450
Well, once again, this
would not be an error.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.360
This would be failing to reject

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.750
the null hypothesis
when the null hypothesis

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.850
is actually true, not an error.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.590
Choice D, "She concludes the
town's unemployment rate is 9%

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.600
"when it actually is not."

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.130
So, this is a situation where she fails

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.250
to reject the null hypothesis,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.960
even though the null
hypothesis is not true,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.050
so this one right over here,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.270
this one would actually
be, this is an error.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.530
This is an error, but
this is a Type II error.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.430
So, one way to think about it,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.070
first you say, "Okay,
am I making an error?

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.190
"Am I rejecting something that's true,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.930
"or am I failing to reject
something that's false?"

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.320
And the rejecting something that is true,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.580
that's Type I, and failing
to reject something

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.360
that is false, that is Type II.

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.970
And so, with that in mind,
let's do another example.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.960
"A large university is curious

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.460
"if they should build another cafeteria.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.950
"They plan to survey a
sample of their students

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.180
"to see if there is strong evidence

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.810
"that the proportion
interested in a meal plan

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.890
"is higher than 40%, in which case they

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.720
"will consider building a new cafeteria.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.480
"Let P represent the proportion

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.860
"of students interested in a meal plan.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.300
"Here are the hypotheses they'll use."

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.620
So, the null hypothesis is that 40%

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.800
or fewer of the students are interested

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.190
in a meal plan, while the
alternative hypothesis

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.670
is that more than 40% are interested.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.200
"What would be the consequence

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.690
"of a Type II error in this context?"

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.140
So, once again, pause this video

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.940
and try to answer this for yourself.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.740
Okay, now let's do it together.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.980
Let's just remind ourselves
what a Type II error is,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.140
we just talked about it.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.480
So, failing,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.350
failing to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.600
reject,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.560
in this case, our null hypothesis,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.970
even though

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.270
it

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.810
is false.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.520
So, this would be a scenario
where this is false,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.180
which would mean that more than 40%

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.090
actually do want a meal plan,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.080
but you fail to reject this.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080
So, what would happen is,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.870
is that you wouldn't
build another cafeteria

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.790
'cause you'd say, "Hey, no,
there's not that many people

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.950
"who are interested in the meal plan,"

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.170
but you wouldn't, but,
actually there are a lot

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.370
of people who are
interested in the meal plan,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.870
and so you probably wouldn't
have enough cafeteria space.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.790
And so, this says, "They
don't consider building

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.740
"a new cafeteria when they should."

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.250
Yeah, this is exactly right.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.060
"They don't consider
building a new cafeteria

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.360
"when they shouldn't."

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.720
Well, this would just
be a correct conclusion.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.190
"They consider building a new cafeteria

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.940
"when they shouldn't,"

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.490
and so, this is a scenario
where they do reject

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.560
the null hypothesis, even
though the null hypothesis

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.450
is true, so this right over
here would be a Type I error.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.580
Type

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.600
I

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.780
error.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.190
Because if they're considering
building a new cafeteria,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.420
that means they rejected
the null hypothesis,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.410
even when they shouldn't.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.340
That means that the null
hypothesis was true, so Type I.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.060
"They consider building a new
cafeteria when they should."

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.520
Well, once again, this
wouldn't be an error at all,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.660
this would be a correct conclusion.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.960
This one and this one
are correct conclusions.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.340
A and C are the consequences

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.570
of a Type II and a Type
I error, respectively.
