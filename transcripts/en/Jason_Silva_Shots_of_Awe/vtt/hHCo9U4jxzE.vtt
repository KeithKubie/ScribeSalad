This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought you

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.930
by the Toyota Prius.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.834
Let's lead the way.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.345
So, I'm fascinated by the extent
to which our environment molds

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:30.560
and shapes us, how what is
without, becomes within.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.000
And so I recently
discovered this term

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.220
called ontological designing,
which is essentially

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.890
this notion that everything we
design is designing us back.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
We, we, from inside
out, we are designed

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.470
by that which we have designed.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.750
So there's this circularity,
this meaning making circle,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.150
this hermeneutic circle,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.260
You know, we're
like the Ouroboros.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.300
We're like the snake
eating its own tail.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.120
We're like Escher's hands.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.060
You know, the hand
that's drawing

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.980
that hand that is drawing it.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.630
These feedback loops
are where mind emerges.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.420
And it turns out that mind,
that really subjectivity, who

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.610
we are as life
beings in the world,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.690
exists in that feedback loop,
emerges in that feedback loop.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.340
We learn language but
then that language

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.780
molds our personalities.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.190
And then our molded
personalities

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.820
use language to speak out.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.810
And then that which we speak
and read in turn changes us.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.050
And there's this circularity.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.730
So Marshall McLuhan used to talk
about the role of technology

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.320
in this space, in this context.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.620
So we build the tools but
then those tools build us.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.350
We build these smartphones
and these smartphones change

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.970
how we think and they
change our behavior.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.330
That's why they used to say
that the PC, the computer

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.720
was the LSD of the '90s
because the computer

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.350
revolution literalized
the dream of expanding

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.860
our minds through the
use of our feedback

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.750
with these tools
and these computers.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.200
Stephen Johnson
takes it further.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.390
He talks about architecture.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660
He says our thoughts
shape our spaces.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.370
We design the world.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.900
But those spaces
return the favor.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.720
So we build these
cathedrals and then

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.450
those cathedrals build
cathedrals inside our minds

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.010
essentially.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.220
We mirror the environment
that we create.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.060
So what is our
responsibility then,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.480
when we build the cities of
the 21st century, the city

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.820
planners, the urban
designers, how

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.630
do we make better systems
thinking, better feedback

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.820
loops, to kind of like upgrade
how we function in the world,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.440
to upgrade mankind
and to understand

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.120
the city as an organism.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.680
And as Geoffrey West says
from the Santa Fe Institute,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.430
cities are like organisms.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.750
Alleys are like capillaries.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.500
And so understanding
these feedback loops,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.620
observing these feedback loops,
upgrading these feedback loops,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.800
allows us to raise the
stage in which we unfold.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.300
And that's why ontological
designing is an important idea.
