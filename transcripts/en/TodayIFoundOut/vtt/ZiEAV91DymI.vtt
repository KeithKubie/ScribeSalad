00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.020
Grape-Nuts is a wheat and barley cereal developed
by C.W. Post in 1897, and it has actually

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.380
made some interesting contributions to American
food history.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.830
A box of Grape-Nuts actually contains “whole
grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, isolated

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.960
soy protein, salt, whole grain barley flour,
malt extract, and dried yeast.”

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
It also boasts a number of essential vitamins
and minerals.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.170
From what I could find, the recipe has remained
largely unchanged since its introduction over

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.100
100 years ago, save for making the switch
to whole grains.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.809
So just how did Grape-Nuts get their misleading
name?

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.120
According to Post Foods, there are two versions
of the story about how Grape-Nuts got their

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
name.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.450
The most plausible theory is that, as Post
used maltose in the original recipe which

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.970
was called “grape sugar”, that’s where
they got the “Grape” part.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.630
The cereal also has a bit of a nutty flavour,
which is where “nuts” came from.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.111
Alternatively, some believe that the cereal
looks a bit like grape seeds.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:25.390
Those seeds are also sometimes termed “grape-nuts”,
even though grape seeds are not nuts, nor

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.410
are such things as almonds, peanuts, Brazil
nuts, etc.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.390
Personally, I’m strongly leaning towards
the former theory as the correct origin of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.390
the name.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.390
So I mentioned earlier Grape-Nuts have been
at the centre of several historical events.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.100
For instance, the cereal was the first wide-spread
product to feature coupons.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.440
In this case, they were “penny-off” coupons
which became a big hit in the 1890s.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.980
The coupons were for other Post cereals—they
were trying to get people to buy more of the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.980
product, and it worked.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.980
More importantly, Sir Admiral Byrd might never
have gone to Antarctica if it hadn’t been

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.980
for Grape-Nuts.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.980
The expedition was sponsored by the cereal
in 1933, making it possible to send the first

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980
two-way radio transmission.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.980
In addition, Grape-Nuts promoted the expedition
by putting maps of the route on the back of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.980
their cereal boxes.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
During World War II, Grape-Nuts were featured
in soldiers’ rations, fueling the troops

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.980
during battle.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.869
Because the cereal was light, compact, had
a long shelf life, and was nutritious and

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.750
healthy, it was a perfect item to include
in rations.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.650
Similarly, Grape-Nuts saw Edmund Hillary and
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay to the top of Mount

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.650
Everest.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.120
The two would, of course, become the first
people to reach the summit of the mountain,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.160
and they took Grape-Nuts along with them to
keep them fueled on the long, strenuous climb.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.500
In addition to expeditions and army rations,
Grape-Nuts also sponsored The Danny Thomas

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.790
Show, a popular series during the 1950s.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.840
If The Danny Thomas Show doesn’t ring any
bells, you might recognize a character that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.310
appeared in the show during an episode that
was promoting Grape-Nuts: Sherriff Andy Taylor.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.080
During the show, main character Danny visited
Mayberry where he met up with Andy.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.310
Viewers loved the Sherriff so much that a
spin-off series called The Andy Griffith Show

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.170
was born, which of course became an instant
American classic.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.420
Post ran a number of successful ad campaigns,
including several commercials that ran during

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.110
The Andy Griffith Show featuring Sherriff
Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.100
However, Post’s Grape-Nuts started becoming
less popular as time went on, probably due

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.280
to Post being sold from one company to another
and not having a consolidated, consistent

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280
marketing plan.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.390
That’s when they decided to make the switch
to whole grain, a staple in the cereal’s

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.470
recipe today.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.360
They thought whole grain would be more appealing
and keep up with the healthy image they were

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.600
trying to project.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.370
Ironically, in addition to being made of neither
grapes nor nuts, Grape-Nuts aren’t all that

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.840
healthy, either, though compared to most breakfast
cereals perhaps one can consider them relatively

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.240
healthy.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.040
Back in the day Post boasted that Grape-Nuts
would “fill you up, not out.”

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.240
However, it has since been found that the
cereal has a Glycemic index of 71, higher

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.880
than such sugary cereals as Fruit Loops and
Frosted Flakes.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.650
Further, table sugar only has a glycemic index
of 60.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.990
So Grape-Nuts is perhaps good for a quick
energy spike before a morning workout, but

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.330
the downside is that aside from scenarios
like that, the cereal inducing a pretty large

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.550
blood sugar spike could lead to insulin resistance
(and later potentially Type 2 Diabetes).

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.220
It is also fairly high in calories, leading
to a small recommended serving size which

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.970
most people promptly ignore, filling their
bowl up with an absolutely massive amount

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.220
of calories.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.500
This further potentially contributes to obesity.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:40.990
Therefore, it’s likely going

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:55.889
to “fill you out” along with “filling
you up”.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:30.259
So, essentially, the 
cereal

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:39.029
is a lie…
