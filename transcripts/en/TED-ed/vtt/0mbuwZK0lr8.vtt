00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.976
You've probably seen
an email or an internet post

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
about how weird and random
English spelling seems to be.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.976
But what if I told you that it
actually makes perfect sense?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
In fact, that's spelling's job:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
Making sense. Think of spelling a word

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
as peeling back the layers of an onion.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.976
The first layer
is a word's sense and meaning.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.048
Often there are multiple
layers of meaning.

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:40.976
Another layer is the word's structure.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.976
Think of the center of the onion
as a word's base element,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.976
its essential kernel of meaning.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.976
A free-base element, like O-N-E,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.976
or T-W-O,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.976
can stand on its own as a word,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.976
like one, or two.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.976
A bound base, like the R-U-P-T
of "erupt" or "rupture"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.976
needs another element in order
to surface in a word.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.976
Two or more bases

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.976
give us compounds, like "twofold"
or "someone" or "bankrupt."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.976
Once we figure
out a word's meaningful elements,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.976
We can peel back its history
to shed a little more light

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.976
on why it's spelled as it is.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.976
The word "two," for example,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.976
needs its "W" in order
to mark its connection

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
to words like "twice," "twelve," "twenty,"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.976
"twin" and "between."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.976
A word's history
is another layer of the onion.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.976
With that understanding,
let's investigate the word "one."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.143
First we need to check
in with what it means.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:39.976
Unique, single, solitary.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.976
"One's" historical layers
include its relatives

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.976
"only," "once," "eleven," and even "a,"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.976
"an" and "any."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.976
But it's the morphological relatives -

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
the ones that share the base O-N-E -

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
That are really astonishing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.048
There are the familiar
ones, like "anyone,"

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:03.976
and "one-track" and "oneself"
- those are obvious.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.976
But let's take a look
at some unexpected derivations

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.976
of the word "one."

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.976
The word "alone" is built from the prefix
A-L plus the base O-N-E.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.976
It's the same A-L prefix that we see

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.976
in "always," "already,"
"almighty" and "almost."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.976
It means "all."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.976
the word "alone" means "all one."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
It was misanalysed in the middle ages

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.976
as having the prefix "a," like in "asleep"
and "awake" and "around,"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
and a new base was born: L-O-N-E,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.976
which then developed into its own family.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.976
In the word "atone," we find
the familiar preposition "at"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.976
compounded with the base O-N-E.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.976
See, when we atone for something
we've done wrong,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
we attempt to make things whole again,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.976
to fix what's broken, to be
at one again with whomever we hurt.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.976
But here's perhaps the best one of all:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.976
the word "onion," which is also
frequently derided as irregular

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.976
or crazy, for its spelling
of "uh" with an O.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.976
But again, if we look
into the word's structure,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.976
and its history, it's a mystery no more.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
When we look at the roots of an onion,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.976
we learn that it is written
as O-N-E plus I-O-N,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.976
the same suffix we find
in "tension," "action," "union"

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.976
and thousands of other words in English.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.976
Unlike the many cloves
in a head of garlic,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.976
an onion has a single bulb.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.976
It is marked by the state
or condition of oneness.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.976
Like an onion, English is one -

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.976
one single writing system
shared across time and space.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.976
Its structure and its
history have many layers,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.976
and peeling them apart can really
add flavor to our language

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.976
and spice up our understanding. See,
spelling is never just about spelling,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.976
but about how written words make sense.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It's almost enough to make
you want to cry.
