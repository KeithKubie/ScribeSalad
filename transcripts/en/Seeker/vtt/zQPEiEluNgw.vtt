00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
One of the highlights of going to a natural
history museum is seeing the ancient, the

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.299
extinct, the giant -- animals like dinosaurs
are huge attractions, but the thing is…

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.539
what you can see isn’t entirely accurate…
the color’s all wrong.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.870
Some of the first dinosaur fossils were discovered
in the 17th century.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.900
The discoverer thought it was part of a giant
human!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.030
It wasn’t for nearly two centuries that
scientists would realize these bones belonged

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.560
not to giants, dragons or pre-flood Biblical
creatures, but to multi-million-year-old dinosaurs.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.950
Immediately, scientists started trying to
gather and arrange bones and fragments into

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.700
shapes and species -- many of which they (very
famously) got wrong.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.980
Putting bones together, and knowing what a
dinosaur looks like is a big leap.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.600
And that’s where PaleoArt comes in!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.559
Imagine for a second you have never seen a
living human, no one has.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860
But someone found a fossilized skeleton.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.150
You don’t know much about this animal, or
what it looked like on the outside.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.329
What does its skin look like, does it have
scales?

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.670
Fur?

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.010
Feathers?

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.310
What color would the skin be?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.780
Would it be camouflaged?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.500
Someone who looks into this, would be a PaleoArtist.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.850
These artists recreate extinct animals and
plants, and they’re they ones who decided

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.850
what color dinosaur skin actually is.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.970
Because tbh, no one knows.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.340
In the 19th century, paleoartists took dinosaur
bones; and they used contemporary giants like

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.439
elephants and rhinos as well as reptiles to
inspire their idea of what animals would have

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.439
that skeleton.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.060
This is how we got massive, tail-dragging
animals plodding hither and thither.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.060
Not accurate.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.159
Over time, scientists debated the finer points
of these animals.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.470
Like, whether the head was held up above the
body -- like a giraffe, or at body level.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.450
How would they pump blood?

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.500
How would these bones move if they had muscles…
and the drawings evolved...

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.390
By the 1960s and 70s, dinosaurs had trimmed
up, they were looking lighter and fitter -- and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.650
less grey!

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.650
More colorful!

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.770
But the skin…

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.770
THE SKIN.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.380
We’ve found fossilized skin, and it can
tell us the texture, look, and feel of a dinosaur,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.500
but not color.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.819
Fossilization turns dino hyde to stone -- meaning
no melanin, no melanosomes, no color.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.390
At least, not that we can see…

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.760
In 2013 a Canadian scanning company took a
textured bit of skin and bounced infrared

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.730
wavelengths off of it hoping to reveal the
fossilized melanosomes -- the bits of skin

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.310
that hold its color.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.470
They based this on earlier studies that tried
to see if fossilized melanosome shapes could

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.340
show us what color they were.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.470
People really want to know this y’all.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.040
Aaaaand, they’re still researching…

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.349
They’ve used this method successfully with
well-preserved feathers, which dinosaurs were

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.410
definitely covered in.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.720
And FEATHERS could have had numerous colors,
just like the birds dinosaurs evolved into.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.319
But feathers aren’t skin color.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.510
Though it’s maddening -- scientists are
still in the dark on this.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.420
The “most accurate depiction” of a dinosaur
(as it was billed) makes the tiny Psittacosaurus

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.860
look cute, and… brown -- which they found
by lasers scanning the melanosomes in the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.860
skin!

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.760
But the connection is debated.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.670
And, as long as we’re copying birds, coloring
is often sex specific.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.900
Females are brown, but males are flashy.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.650
That said the shading camouflage makes this
one of the most accurate dinosaur depictions

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.930
ever!

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.930
For now.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.319
Ultimately, and for much of our depictive
history of these animals, we’ve sort of

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.300
been… ‘winging it’ using data that’s
available at the time!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.980
But everything may change soon.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.310
In May 2017, a beautifully preserved fossilized
nodosaur was revealed… found in a Canadian

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.310
mine!

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.310
It was basically mummified!

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.310
They scanned the skin and found the presence
of reddish pigments!

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.310
RED.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.310
ISH!

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.310
Aaand that’s it so far.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.310
We can’t get pics.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.310
They’re exclusive!

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.310
But, I’m sure you can find them.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.310
This dinosaur is gorgeous, we got the hook
up on pics Royal Tyrrell Museum in Canada.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.310
If you notice, still no color.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.310
It just looks like stone.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.190
But, they scanned the skin and found the presence
of reddish pigments!

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.190
RED.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.190
ISH!

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.170
It’s not a much, but a start!

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.519
In the end, the dinosaurs in your imagination
was seeded by the imagination of paleoartists.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.849
Their work is what created dinosaurs in movies,
museums and theme parks.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.909
They fill in the skin on top of the skeletons,
creating this rich tapestry of ancient life…

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.590
and for now, a fictional one…

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.560
