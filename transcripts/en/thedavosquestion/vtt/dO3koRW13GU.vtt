00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; It's On

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.290
Ramazan: I'm Ramazan from Germany, I'm Muslim
and...

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.759
Soetendorp: I'm [inaudible] Soetendorp, a
Rabbi from Holland.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.900
Ramazan: Yes, and we want to give the world
a Muslim Jewish peace message.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.810
Soetendorp: Our heart is united, and we think
of the babies in Gaza.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.119
We hope that they will be healed and live.
And the babies in Israel together have a future

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.430
of security and friendship.
And we hope that our friendship is just a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.440
small stone towards building that new home
where we all feel comfortable.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.220
Ramazan: And as a Muslim, I want to say to
the Israelis to the Jewish people, I wish

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.460
you peace, I wish you security and I wish
you that we could be altogether friends in

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.410
the future.
We work on it.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.590
And I think two people have to find a learn
to other people and [inaudible] and then we

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.210
are much of people, much of people of peace.
And I believe in peace and freedom.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.769
And I think that Muslims and Jewish are Brothers
and Sisters.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.630
I think they can give together the world much
of things.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.369
We need the peace for us both.
Soetendorp: And you know

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.969
Soetendorp: And you know we didn't know each
other forty days ago, and we are Brothers.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.579
I will never go to sleep without thinking
of you, and wake up without knowing that you

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.330
are there.
And so to my Brothers and Sisters, Palestinians,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.450
in Gaza and everywhere, my dream is that your
dream fulfilled.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.090
Of peace, security, love, compassion.
And that the tremendous resources of the new

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.249
future that are in you will make the Middle
East not to a place of tears, but a place

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.560
of hope for all human kind.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.720
Ramazan: So I think my dream is going to be
a reality cuz [pause]

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.940
Peace and friendship for you, peace and friendship
is not future, is not dream is reality.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.940
Soetendorp: No

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.390
Ramazan: So listen to us and try the same.
Thank you very much.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.560
Soetendorp: Thank You.
