caring about fictional characters while
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.069
caring about fictional characters while
we know that these stories aren't real

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
we know that these stories aren't real
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380
we know that these stories aren't real
we still invest our emotions in them as

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
we still invest our emotions in them as
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.560

if they were so why do we do this well

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
if they were so why do we do this well
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479
if they were so why do we do this well
it might be that our brains aren't quite

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
it might be that our brains aren't quite
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369
it might be that our brains aren't quite
as good as we'd like at telling the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
as good as we'd like at telling the
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.520
as good as we'd like at telling the
difference between what's real and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530
difference between what's real and
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.470
difference between what's real and
what's fiction take this dot for example

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
what's fiction take this dot for example
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600
what's fiction take this dot for example
if it just stays there doing nothing as

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
if it just stays there doing nothing as

dots normally do then it's not showing

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
dots normally do then it's not showing
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340
dots normally do then it's not showing
any signs of life and so we react to it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
any signs of life and so we react to it
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439
any signs of life and so we react to it
as we would to any inanimate object

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
as we would to any inanimate object
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109
as we would to any inanimate object
however if I put it inside of a maze and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
however if I put it inside of a maze and
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120
however if I put it inside of a maze and
animate it then it appears as though the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
animate it then it appears as though the
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310
animate it then it appears as though the
dot has some kind of agency and we

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
dot has some kind of agency and we
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289
dot has some kind of agency and we
naturally start assigning motivations to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
naturally start assigning motivations to
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179
naturally start assigning motivations to
it like hey it's trying to escape the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
it like hey it's trying to escape the
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190
it like hey it's trying to escape the
maze and then we begin to empathize with

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
maze and then we begin to empathize with
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649
maze and then we begin to empathize with
it thinking about say how we might feel

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
it thinking about say how we might feel
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.390
it thinking about say how we might feel
if we were inside that place yay it did

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
if we were inside that place yay it did
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
if we were inside that place yay it did
it basically so long as something

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
it basically so long as something
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620
it basically so long as something
appears to be an agent

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
appears to be an agent
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.899
appears to be an agent
ie we see it displaying a certain level

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
ie we see it displaying a certain level
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270
ie we see it displaying a certain level
of autonomy then we react towards it as

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
of autonomy then we react towards it as
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340
of autonomy then we react towards it as
if it were alive regardless of whether

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
if it were alive regardless of whether
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160
if it were alive regardless of whether
or not it actually is now for early man

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
or not it actually is now for early man
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960
or not it actually is now for early man
this likely didn't make any difference

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
this likely didn't make any difference
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359
this likely didn't make any difference
if something showed had agency it was

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
if something showed had agency it was
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340
if something showed had agency it was
probably because it was actually alive

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
probably because it was actually alive
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.889
probably because it was actually alive
however these days it's possible for us

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
however these days it's possible for us
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620
however these days it's possible for us
to simulate agency so even when we know

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
to simulate agency so even when we know
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719
to simulate agency so even when we know
that something isn't really alive

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
that something isn't really alive
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969
that something isn't really alive
part of our brains still thinks that it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
part of our brains still thinks that it
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469
part of our brains still thinks that it
is and this has actually been shown

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
is and this has actually been shown
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480
is and this has actually been shown
experimentally when people witnessed

reactions towards the robot and the
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.420
reactions towards the robot and the
human were actually very similar

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430
human were actually very similar
