00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.389
Hi my little nuggets, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.120
Picking your nose.You all do it.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.920
I know you do, don’t lie to me.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.500
But once you’ve mined your golden gobs,
do wipe it in a tissue?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.980
Do you pick it and flick it?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
Do you….

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.710
Do you eat it?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.140
The behavior is not uncommon in kids at all,
and a lot of adults still do it.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.810
Usually when no one’s looking but they do
occasionally get caught on the jumbotron at

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.810
sports games.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.890
But is there a reason to be ashamed of it?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.270
Or worse, could it actually be unhealthy?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.890
Well the social stigma makes sense; mucus
is inherently gross.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
It’s stringy and sticky and drips out of
you when you’re sick.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
Once you learn the purpose of mucus, it adds
another layer to the yuck pile.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.670
Mucus’s job is to snag dirt, pollen, and
pathogens.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.670
It’s actually 95% water and 3% mucin, which
are lubricating gel-like proteins that hold

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.060
a lot of water and have a high molecular weight.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.500
The last 2% is assorted particles ranging
from antibodies to fungus balls.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.470
So knowing that one job of your nose goop
is basically to catch the nastiness in the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
air before it makes it to your lungs, why
oh why would anyone put a booger in their

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
mouth?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.270
Well, because they taste good… so I’ve
heard.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.440
Associate professor of biochemistry at the
University of Saskatchewan Scott Napper thinks

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.020
so too, and moreover thinks boogers are sweet
as a way of enticing us to eat them.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.319
Since they’ve got weakened pathogens in
them, perhaps eating them helps our immune

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.680
system learn to fight whatever might be in
the air around us.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.289
I’m going to call shenanigans right there
though, because you’re already swallowing

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.490
a ton of mucus without knowing it.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.160
You make about a liter to a liter and a half
of mucus daily, and much of that gets pushed

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.850
back by cilia and flows down the back of your
throat into your stomach without you even

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.850
realizing it.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.819
You’re basically swallowing oodles of snot
constantly, so a dried boogey that you put

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.500
their manually isn’t going to help you out
very much.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.970
Instead, I would like to offer a different
hypothesis on why boogers are allegedly sweet.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.830
Mucus also helps with your sense of smell,
cutting up molecules that enter your nose

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.220
and delivering them to receptors in your nasal
cavity.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.420
A 2007 study claimed that the delay in the
time it takes different pieces of the molecule

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.810
to reach receptors actually helps us differentiate
smells, and this was backed up in a 2010 study

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.989
where mice with inactive mucus lost the ability
to identify a target smell.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.770
When it’s dry out, the mucus dries up and
can’t transport those molecules well.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.840
Mucus also keeps the tissue underneath it
from drying out and cracking, keeping the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.510
blood vessels in your nose safe from infection.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.560
So in order for mucus to do all it’s jobs
of lubrication and protection AND smell reception,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.130
the mucin needs to stay full of water.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.180
And how does mucin trap water?

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.810
By being coated in hundreds of oligosaccharides.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.800
That’s right.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800
Sugars.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.200
Boogers aren’t sweet because you’re supposed
to eat them.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.640
Boogers are sweet because they’ve got a
job to do, and their taste is a byproduct

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.480
of their strategy to do it.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.720
So it looks like eating your goobers isn’t
beneficial but it’s not harmful either.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.100
Just don’t pick so much you scratch up the
inside of your nose and cause bleedings and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.100
infections.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.120
And probably avoid doing it on a date.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.370
But aside from that, science has no criticism
if you pick and lick.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.860
So boogers are gross but apparently, ACCORDING
TO A SCIENCE PROFESSOR, they taste good.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.060
But you know what doesn’t?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.060
Ear wax.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.600
What’s that stuff for?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:34.400
Trace tickles 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:44.570
your earwax here.
