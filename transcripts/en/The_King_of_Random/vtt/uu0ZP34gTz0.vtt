In today's video,

00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.900
we are taking a look
at the carbonation process,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.800
how it works,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.400
and finding out just what and
what shouldn't be turned

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.500
into a fizzy treat.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.560
[Music]

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340
Guys, you have seen both Grant
and Nate make different sorts

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.176
of carbonated treats
over the years.

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:23.714
You've seen Nate make
carbonated fruits for summer.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:26.100
And you've seen Grant make
carbonated ice cream.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
So today, I want to take that,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.100
push that limit, and see
what can be carbonated.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.400
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.752
We are taking a variety

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:35.900
of snacks to find out what can
and cannot be carbonated,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.340
and whether or not you should.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.640
To start out with,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.680
we're going to go
with some tried and true things.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.300
We're actually going to try
a cucumber and a bell pepper.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.801
Those are things that I'm
pretty sure can be carbonated

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.700
because they are
a little bit more porous.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.300
They hold a lot
of water in them.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.940
They should work,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.910
but the question here is,
do we want them to?

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.049
All right, to start out

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.300
with we have got a cucumber
and a bell pepper.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.436
Technically, anything

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.032
that is porous or liquid
should be able to absorb

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.900
the carbon dioxide from dry ice
in a sealed container.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.600
Now, this isn't going
to be airtight

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100
because that wouldn't be safe,
but it should still work.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.300
So that's why I'm going with
a cucumber and a bell pepper.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.400
These both have a very
high water content,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.042
and are technically
a porous sort of flesh.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.000
So the carbon dioxide
should absorb very nicely.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.380
[Music]

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.260
All right.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.100
To make fruits,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.600
vegetables, and literally
anything else carbonated,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.900
it's a very simple process.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.200
All you really need is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
your carbonated snack
of choice, a cooler,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and some dry ice.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.687
We're going to take our cooler,

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:41.300
and put a decent amount
of dry ice at the bottom.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.660
[Music]

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.200
All right.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
So we've got a lot
of dry ice in there.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.252
Now, I want to put my cucumber
and my bell pepper in there

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.660
with the dry ice to kind of
absorb that carbon dioxide.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.460
Here's the problem.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.870
I don't want them to freeze,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.500
so we have to make sure they're
elevated above the dry ice

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.200
so they don't have
contact with it.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.450
Easiest way to do that,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.200
I'm gonna put my slices
into a bowl.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.468
I'm going to elevate them
on top of a paper cup.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:06.080
And now, for the
really fun part,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.700
we're actually going to seal it
with some cling wrap.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.554
Now, normally,

00:02:09.554 --> 00:02:12.495
you do not seal anything
with dry ice inside of it.

00:02:12.495 --> 00:02:14.600
But even with cling
wrap on a cooler,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
it's not actually
going to be airtight.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.212
Some of that air still going
to escape to the carbon dioxide

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:20.936
isn't going to have
a chance to build up,

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:22.155
and make it to pressurized.

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:23.600
All it's going
to do is make sure

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.726
that pressure is more

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.300
or less staying internal
without being dangerous.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.600
Perfect.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.110
Let that sit for about an hour.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.400
We should have a fizzy cucumber
and bell pepper.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.100
Now, while we are waiting for
our bell pepper and our cucumber

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:37.500
to hopefully get fizzy,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.520
I want to try
something else, Jell-O.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.480
It is possible to
make a fizzy Jell-O

00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:43.147
if you mix it
with a seltzer water

00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:44.397
when you're preparing it.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.000
However, I've noticed that a lot
of the bubbles died out.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.119
So I want to see
if mixing it with dry ice

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.380
in the cooling process
will actually carbonate it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.200
as we go.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.620
[Music]

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.500
Let's put this into a container
that will hopefully,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.820
contain it a little better?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.911
All right, now normally,

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.200
you can add ice water to your
Jell-O to help it set faster,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.400
or just pop in the fridge
for a few hours.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.100
I'm just going to add dry ice
until it cools.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.060
Okay, I have dry
ice Jell-O.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.860
[Music]

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.430
Okay, so I got impatient
with the Jell-O.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.800
So I'm going to leave
it over there,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.692
let it do its thing,

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.700
and we're going to try
something even weirder.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.610
Guys, I want to know
if you can carbonate steak.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.377
Now, the reason

00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:30.500
that I'm using steak instead of
any other meat like chicken is

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.000
because steak tends to be
a little bit more airy,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.100
I guess you could say.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.817
It's very porous

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:36.035
so I'm hoping
that that means

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.774
that the carbon dioxide is going
to sink in a little bit easier.

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:40.400
Whereas if we used
a cooked chicken breast,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.300
it's a lot denser,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.900
and I'm not sure if carbon
dioxide could get through that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.500
All right.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.072
So I've left this steak
decently rare in the middle.

00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:48.230
I'm hoping that'll make

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.280
it a little bit easier
to absorb that CO2.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.235
So I'm going to cut
some really thin slices,

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:53.412
and I'm going to throw it

00:03:53.412 --> 00:03:55.200
in the cooler right
beside our veggies.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.100
Let's see how our cucumber
and our bell pepper turned out.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.780
[Music]

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.300
Oh, did they just
fall off of the cup

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.260
when I moved them?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.900
I can't tell if they're going
to need more time.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.700
Let's see.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.220
[Music]

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.700
They do not need more time.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.880
[Music]

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.140
That is bizarre.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.200
That was a fizzy bell pepper.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.800
It's not bad.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.700
It's just very strange.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.292
Now, I have had carbonated
watermelon before.

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:30.400
Cucumber tastes similar to me.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.560
[Music]

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.100
Now, that's also really weird.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.880
But awesome.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.480
Okay.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.900
Carbonated vegetables.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.917
I'm actually a fan,
that's kind of cool.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.700
All right, I'm going
to toss these back

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.160
in here with the steak.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.020
I want to see if we
can get these even fizzier,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.900
and see if the steak
is going to work.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.800
I want to add as much dry ice as

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.180
possible without freezing
the bottom of my bowls.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.003
Just the tiniest bit
of water to help

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:00.800
it sublimate a little faster.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.000
All right, I've cut

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.170
these little strips
of steak very thin,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.900
in hopes of making this work.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.400
Then close it back up,
seal it with Saran wrap again.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.700
Leave it for about an hour.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.500
All right, here's a sign that we
know that it's working already.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.560
Now, this isn't just
regular cling wrap.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.160
This is Press'n Seal,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.000
and it's still being puffed
up by the carbon dioxide,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which is perfect,
because it is escaping.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This isn't airtight
so it's not dangerous,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.300
but it is definitely
building up some pressure.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600
So what that means is
we're basically forcing

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.650
the carbon dioxide
into the flesh of the meat,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.040
and into the flesh
of our fruit and vegetable.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.800
We have a cucumber,
a bell pepper,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.300
and a piece of steak
being carbonated.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.900
Our Jell-O is still going.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.200
Let's make some ice cream.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.400
We're going to be using
Grant's recipe on how to make

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.676
carbonated ice cream today.

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:48.000
I want to try it for myself.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.000
That's going to be
2 cups of Half &amp; Half,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.458
half a cup of powdered sugar,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.200
and a teaspoon
of vanilla extract.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.360
[Music]

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.440
Yeah. It's gonna be very
sweet ice cream.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.180
[Music]

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.680
All right.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.160
Now, we just add dry ice,
and stir until it freezes.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:23.500
[Music]

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.400
I may have added
too much dry ice.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.200
But you know what?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.399
This is looking awesome.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.093
So if you decide
to make this at home,

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:31.200
just like Grant told you
in the previous video,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.100
make sure you don't swallow any
of these pieces of dry ice.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.700
That would not be good for you.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.380
But the ice cream on its own
should be carbonated now.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.180
[Music]

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.100
That's fun.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.300
That is really cool.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.900
I'm going to try and drop it
into some water, and see

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.743
if we can actually
see that carbonation

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:51.520
as it dissolves.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.660
Oh, you totally can.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.484
Just a little around the edges.

00:06:56.484 --> 00:06:58.840
We had some bubbles rising
to the surface there.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.520
[Music]

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.440
Little bit.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.300
You can see some
of that CO2 rising

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.860
to the surface just
around the edges.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.600
Our Jell-O is mostly solidified.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.500
But look at how many bubbles
are captured right underneath.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.900
Now, I've seen bubbles rise
to the surface in Jell-O,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.300
and stay there
as it solidifies,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.000
but these are massive bubbles.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.200
I've never seen that before.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.580
[Music]

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.520
Okay, that just
dissolved in my mouth.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.920
You know, it's just
like jello cotton candy,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.940
but a little bit fizzy.

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:33.901
That's really cool.

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:34.600
I am concerned

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.880
because that didn't have as
much fizz as I wanted it to,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.000
but that's just the bubble.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.500
So let's get down
to the Jell-O itself.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.400
And you can see our jello wasn't
completely set up in the middle,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.953
just try around the edge here.

00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:45.300
But look at those bubbles.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.601
These aren't bubbles anymore.

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.800
These are just divots
in the surface of the jello.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.040
Moment of Truth.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.340
[Music]

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.500
That's my favorite.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.400
Guys, you can make
carbonated Jell-O just

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.800
by adding dry ice to it.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.231
That is really really fun.

00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:05.600
That is easy to do,
and that tastes so good.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700
That's fun.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.700
All right, guys,
it's been a few minutes.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.000
And I have Josh with me.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.700
Josh, you ready to try
whatever I put in this cooler?

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280
Not really.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.100
You're gonna.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.500
If you had to guess

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.900
for something that I
may have tried to carbonate,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.300
what do you think it might be?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.640
I don't--

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.690
I mean, I don't really know
what you've got going on here.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.100
That's right, it's steak.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.900
Oh, sure.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.140
Of course.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.100
That was my second guess.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.000
Yeahm, of course.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.900
Of course, it was.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.400
All right.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.160
I'll try it first.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:39.900
How is that?

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.280
Okay.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.660
[Music]

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.220
Go on.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.000
Not only is it carbonated.

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:50.546
It's cold, I assume.

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:58.200
[Music]

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.880
That's weird.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.700
Fizzy steak.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.747
That's really weird.

00:09:00.747 --> 00:09:01.900
But we made it happen.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.479
Here, I'll try one of these.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.640
Are these--

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.500
That's a bell pepper.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.120
Oh, that's fuzzy as well.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.540
[Music]

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.760
That's weird.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.800
All right, so I think
out of all these,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.890
the cucumber is actually
got the most carbonated.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.400
They have the
highest water content.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400
They're very porous.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.950
It was easy

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.730
for the carbonation
to sink into them.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.100
So let's see.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.720
[Music]

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.520
Yep.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.933
That's like fruit pop rocks.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.200
That feels really weird.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.200
That's cool though.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.520
I'm getting a full meal here.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.200
Can you carbonate
most ordinary food?

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.100
Well, if they have
a high water content,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.220
yes, you can.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.280
Should you?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.107
Josh, should you?

00:09:48.107 --> 00:09:48.907
No.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.744
But you can,
and it's easy to do.

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:52.978
You can do this at home.

00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:54.239
All you need is a cooler,

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:55.929
some dry icem
and some cling wrap.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:56.497
Just make sure

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.542
that your food never touches
the dry ice itself,

00:09:58.542 --> 00:09:59.500
and you're good to go.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.100
Guys, that's not all,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.528
