00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.678
- [Voiceover] Alright I'll tackle.

00:00:01.678 --> 00:00:04.924
In the last video we did
the first part of part A,

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:07.606
now, so the second part of part A.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:11.466
So, the second part of part A,

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:16.262
they say, "Calculate the
number of moles of ethene

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.065
that would be produced if
the dehydration reaction

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.002
went to completion".

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:25.484
Well, this is the dehydration
reaction right over here,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.935
and they're telling us,

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:28.944
they're telling us that we start

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:32.769
with 0.200 grams

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.459
of ethanol,

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:36.811
so, if we start with

00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:41.541
0.200 grams of ethanol,

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.672
and if we figure out how many
moles of ethanol that is,

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:46.394
well, for every mole of ethanol,

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:48.992
if we have the reaction go to,

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:51.617
if the dehydration reaction
goes to completion,

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.392
for every mole of ethanol
that we start with,

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:57.017
we're going to have a mole of ethene,

00:00:57.017 --> 00:00:58.793
and a mole of water.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:00:59.732
So, if we can just figure out

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.573
how many moles of ethanol this is,

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:05.191
then we'll say, "Okay, if
this were completely react,

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.264
we would have that many moles of ethene".

00:01:08.264 --> 00:01:09.939
So, let's figure this out.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.951
So if we say,

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.698
so, we have ethanol,

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.212
so for ethanol,

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.275
we are starting with zero

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.745
.200 grams,

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.390
and we wanna convert this to moles,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.632
so we wanna multiply this times,

00:01:29.632 --> 00:01:31.490
we want grams in the denominator

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.953
to cancel out with this grams,

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.144
and moles in the numerator.

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:38.564
So, one mole of ethanol is,

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.104
as a mass of how many grams,

00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:44.147
well, they tell us that
earlier on the problem,

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.005
they say, "Ethanol,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.295
molar mass 46.1 grams per mol",

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:55.295
so, ethanol, molar mass
of 46.1 grams per mol,

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:56.963
or another way to thinking about it,

00:01:56.963 --> 00:01:58.874
one mole would have mass of 46.1 grams

00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:02.664
of 46.1 grams,

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:05.928
and so if we do this, we are going to get

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:10.058
0.200 over

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:12.268
46.1,

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:14.456
and then grams cancel with the grams,

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.526
and that going to be
how many moles we have,

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:18.592
and this is going to be equal to,

00:02:18.592 --> 00:02:20.125
we have three significant digits

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.807
that we're gonna be with
three significant digits

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.452
divided by three significant digits,

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:26.753
so this is going to be

00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:29.336
all right, so we clear this,

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.359
so .2, I could write 00,

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.485
but it's going to,

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.367
for the calculator's purposes
this is the same thing,

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:39.882
divided by 46.1 is equal to

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:43.772
0.0043,

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:45.908
I want three significant figures here,

00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:50.471
so 43 I'm gonna round up, 434,

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.997
.00434

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:57.997
so 0.00434

00:02:58.155 --> 00:02:59.165
moles.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:00.359
So, we've seen so far,

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.450
if the ethanol were
(mumbling) the reaction,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.488
if we have this many moles of ethanol,

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.581
well, and if they completely react,

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:12.416
well, then we should end up
with that many moles of ethene,

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.985
and so if we have,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:16.615
if it we get a dehydration,

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:17.449
I'm gonna write it this way,

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.751
if dehydration

00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:24.811
dehydration reaction

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.251
goes to completion

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.501
goes to completion

00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:34.908
every

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:38.128
every mole of ethanol

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.408
would be converted

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:51.761
to a mole of ethene

00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:58.041
and a mole of water.

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.064
I shouldn't write the shorthand there,

00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:02.446
a mole, if I'm writing it out,

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:06.217
mole of and a mole water.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:15.395
So 0.00434

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.385
mole of ethanol

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:21.525
would

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:23.905
yield,

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:26.710
that same number of moles,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.260
0.00434

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.520
moles of ethene.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.885
So, if the reaction went to completion

00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:39.342
that how many moles it would produce.

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:42.176
What we actually measure is
a smaller number than that,

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:45.145
so the reaction didn't
go fully to completion.

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:47.267
So now let's tackle part B,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:50.939
let's tackle part B, and they ask us,

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.641
"Calculate he percent yield
of ethene in the experiment".

00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.589
Well, the percent yield is
going to be how much we got,

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.914
divide by how much we
would ideally have gotten

00:05:00.914 --> 00:05:03.674
if the reaction went fully to completion.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:04.560
So yield

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.260
yield is going to be equal
to how much we actually got,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.109
which we figured out in part one,

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:16.352
so 0.00264

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:20.592
moles over what we
actually got, i'm sorry,

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:23.713
what we actually got over
what we'd have ideally gotten

00:05:23.713 --> 00:05:25.735
if the reaction went to completion,

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.638
so divided by

00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:32.538
0.00434

00:05:32.538 --> 00:05:33.548
moles,

00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:35.387
and this is going to be equal to

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:38.579
this is going to be equal to

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.761
so, 00264

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.581
divided by

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:52.141
00434, is equal to,

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.724
and let's see, we have three
significant digits here,

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:57.528
so 60, I can say .608,

00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:00.898
or I could say 60.8% yield.

00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:03.605
So, I'm gonna write this as

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:06.335
actually this is gonna, I'm rounding,

00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:11.335
so I can say 60.8% yield,

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.034
and there you go.
