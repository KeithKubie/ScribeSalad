that if we did a better job sharing in

just like a lot of our other assumptions

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380
just like a lot of our other assumptions
 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.770
just like a lot of our other assumptions
and maybe we don't need seven jobs maybe

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
and maybe we don't need seven jobs maybe
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.809

we just need to do a better job sharing
