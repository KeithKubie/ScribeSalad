00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.220
One benefit of cloud computing
is that it empowers anyone

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.220
to porpetually have infinite resources.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
As long as you can pay, you can have
the resources that are required to work

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.790
on maybe hard problems that
involve lots of data and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.120
that require lots of processing.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.400
Here are some illustrations that
I've found pretty informative.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.170
To illustrate how much of
data are we dealing with in

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.360
terms of our everyday life in our world.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.250
So if we just think about one year,
2011, there

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.830
were 1.8 zettabytes of data that
were created in that one year.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.650
This amount of data is
equivalent to everyone

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.200
in the US tweeting 4,320 times a day.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.240
Pretty much not doing much else.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.340
Or another way to think about
it's this amount of data

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.380
is 200 billion high definition movies
that are each about two hours long.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.200
If you lived for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.260
47 million years, you'd be just about
done watching these 200 billion movies.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.830
Or to store this much data,
it would require so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.120
many of the Apple's 32 gigabit iPads,
that if you stack them

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.470
up together, it would be 25
times higher than Mt Fiji.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.740
Pretty powerful these illustrations.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.590
And this is all the data from 2011 only.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.590
Clearly not every application
needs access to all of the data

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.290
that's generated that's
available in the world.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.820
But a lot of the applications for
scientific discovery,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.100
for improving social services, for

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.180
a number of other types of applications,
they do require a lot data.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.522
Looking at cloud computing
as a big data engine,

00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:48.830
there are a number of layers
that are necessary in order for

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.415
the cloud to provide that
kind of infrastructure and

00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:56.270
adopt those kinds of services that are
needed by these big data applications.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.230
Cloud platforms that offer as
a platform as a service stack for

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.930
big data processing.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.610
At the minimum have to have some
layer that enables the storage and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.610
access of the data from cross many,
many nodes.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.340
And also the ability to describe
applications in a certain

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.030
parallel fashion, and
ideally to do that easily, so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.810
that the data can be processed
across potentially many nodes.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.960
We talked earlier in this course
that access to memory and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.020
access to local memory is
faster than going to disk.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.530
And particularly if you
have to go to disk that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.460
need these nodes that's
attached to another node.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.910
So most of the cloud stacks also
incorporate some data caching

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.810
layer where the data can
be brought in memory, or

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.680
maybe even a cross multiple memories, in
the distributed system, big data system.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.901
I said a cloud platform for

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:55.400
big data must incorporate some
data processing framework.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.060
But commonly, when we talk
about small or smaller data,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.670
the way we are analyzing it is
using things like SQL queries or

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.460
some other type of querying mechanism.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.950
And so often cloud stack, big data
stacks, would incorporate some language

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.490
front end that would make this data
processing a little bit more easier.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.970
One common thing that people do with
big data, that they analyze it.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.370
They search for certain patterns, so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.290
they perform some data mining operations
that often involved common functions,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.720
such as some machine
learning algorithms.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.430
So just as it's common for

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.230
cloud big data platforms to support
popular language front-ends,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.220
it's also common for them to support
popular analytics libraries.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.290
And also, a lot of the types of
data that we're interested in

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.820
isn't just created once, and then
that's it, that's a complete data set.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.210
Instead, there's continuously
generated knowledge.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.870
And then potentially,
the answers from the analysis on that

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.380
knowledge are derived continuously and
updated over time.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.140
So therefore, a common service
that needs to be incorporated

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.110
in big data clouds would be something
that provides as streaming abilities,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.540
both as inputs and as outputs.
