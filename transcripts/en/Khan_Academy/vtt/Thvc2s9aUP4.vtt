00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.130
Let's now generalize what
we did in the last video.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:10.080
So if this is my y-axis and this
is-- that's not that straight.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.037
This right over
here is my x-axis.

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:15.495
And let's say I
have two functions.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.160
So I'm just going to
say it in general terms.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.700
So let's say I have a
function right over here.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.860
So let's say it looks
something like this.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.200
So that's one function.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.850
So this is y is equal to f of x.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.420
And then I have another function
that y is equal to g of x.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.090
So let's say it looks
something like this.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.484
So the blue one right over
here is y is equal to g of x.

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:42.900
And like we did
in the last video,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.480
I want to think about the volume
of the solid of revolution

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.380
we will get if we
essentially rotate

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.480
the area between
these two, and if we

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.470
were to rotate it
around the x-axis.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.224
So we're saying in
very general terms.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.390
This could be anything, But.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.390
In the way we've draw it
now, it would literally

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.970
be that same truffle shape.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.690
It would be a very
similar truffle shape,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.900
where on the outside it
looks like a truffle.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.040
On the outside, it looks
something like a truffle,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.720
and on the inside, we
have carved out a cone.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.500
Obviously, this visualization
is very specific to the way

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.520
I've drawn these
functions, but what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.840
we want to do is generalize at
least the mathematics of it.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.860
So how do we find a volume?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.606
Well, we could think of disks.

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:24.980
But instead of
thinking of disks,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.930
we're going to think
about washers now,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.780
which is essentially
the exact same thing we

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.321
did in the last
video mathematically,

00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.120
but it's a slightly different
way of conceptualizing it.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:43.910
So imagine taking a little chunk
between these two functions,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.070
just like that.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.750
What is going to be the
width of this chunk?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.110
Well, it's going
to be equal to dx.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.120
And let's rotate that whole
thing around the x-axis.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.260
So if we rotate this
thing around the x-axis,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.620
we end up with a washer.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.080
That's why we're going to
call this the washer method.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.500
And it's really just
kind of the disk method,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.610
where you're gutting out
the inside of a disk.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.830
So that's the inside
of our washer.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.690
And then this is the
outside of our washer.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.530
Outside of our washer
looks something like that.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.470
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.500
And so the surface of our washer
looks something like that.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.810
I know I could have drawn
this a little bit better,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.240
but hopefully it
serves the purpose

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.290
so that we understand it.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.870
So the surface of our washer
looks something like that.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.160
And it has depth of dx.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.270
So let me see how
well I can draw this.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.340
So depth dx.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.790
That's the side of this washer.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.730
So a washer, you can imagine,
is kind of a gutted out coin.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.410
So how do we find the volume?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.242
Well once again, if
we know the surface,

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.200
if we know the area of
the face of this washer,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.600
we can just multiply
that times the depth.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.440
So it's going to be the area
of the face of the washer.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.020
So the area of the
face of the washer--

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.610
well, it could be the area
if it wasn't gutted out.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.220
And what would that area be?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.440
Well, it would be pi
times the overall,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.360
the outside radius squared.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.680
It would be pi times the
outside radius squared.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.040
Well, what's the outside radius?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.170
The radius that goes to
the outside of the washer?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.260
Well, that's f of x.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.190
So it's going to be
f of x is the radius.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.060
And we're just going
to square that.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.050
So this expression
right over here

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.340
would give us the area
of the entire face

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.350
if it wasn't a washer,
if it was a coin.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.150
But now we have to
subtract out the inside.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.845
So what's the area
of the inside?

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.599
This part right over here?

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.140
Well, we're going
to subtract it out.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.500
It's going to be pi times the
radius of the inside squared.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.980
Well, what's the radius
of the inside squared?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.940
Well, the inside, in
this case, is g of x.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.590
It's going to be pi
times g of x squared.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.940
That's the inner function,
at least over the interval

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.980
that we care about.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.000
So the area of this washer, we
could just leave it like this,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.970
or we could factor out a pi.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.676
We could say the area is
equal to-- if we factor out

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:25.546
a pi-- pi times f of x
squared minus g of x squared.

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:27.640
I don't really have to
write a parentheses there.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.880
So we could write f of x
squared minus g of x squared.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.160
And then if we want the volume--
put that in the same yellow.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.890
If we want the
volume of this thing,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.500
we just multiply it times the
depth of each of those washers.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.680
So the volume of
each of these washers

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:54.060
are going to be pi times f of
x squared minus g of x squared.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.410
The outer function
squared over our interval,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.160
minus our inner function
squared over the interval,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.320
and then times our depth.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.990
That'd be the volume of
each of these washers.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.150
And that's going to be defined
at a given x in our interval,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.550
but for each x at
these interval,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.760
we can define a new washer.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.219
So there could be a washer out
here, and a washer out here.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.551
And so we're going to take
the sum of all those washers,

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:18.960
and take the limit as we have
smaller and smaller depths.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.290
And we have an infinite number
of infinitely thin washers.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.130
So we're going take the integral
over our interval from where

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.870
these two things intersect, the
interval that we care about.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.790
It doesn't have to be where they
intersect, but in this case,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.970
that's what we'll do.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.480
So let's say x equals
a to x equals b.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.709
Although this could have been
a, that could have been b.

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.000
But this is our interval
we're saying in general terms,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.710
from a to b.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.770
And this will give our volume.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.070
This right over here is
the volume of each washer.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.930
And then we're summing
up all of the washers

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.020
and taking the limit, as we
have an infinite number of them.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.990
So let's see if we apply this
to the example in the last video

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.380
whether we get the
exact same answer.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.800
Well, in the last
video, y equals

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.340
g of x was equal to
x, and y is equal to f

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.670
of x was equal to
the square root of x.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.340
So let's evaluate that
given what we just

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.180
were able to derive.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.070
So our volume-- do it up here.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.980
The volume is going to
be the integral-- what

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.825
are the two intersection points?

00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:21.900
Well, over here,
once again, we could

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.812
have defined the
interval someplace else,

00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:25.020
like between there and there.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.520
And we would have gotten
a different shape.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.000
But the points that we care
about the way we visualize

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.844
it is between x is equal
to 0 and x is equal to 1.

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:36.510
That's where these
two things intersect.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.870
We saw that in the last video.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.290
Of pi times-- what's f of
x squared? f of x squared,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:51.220
square root of x squared is
just x, minus g of x squared.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.560
g of x is x, that
squared is x squared.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.200
And then we multiply times dx.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.720
So this is going to be equal
to-- we can factor out the pi.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.550
0 to 1, x minus x squared dx,
which is equal to pi times--

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.005
let's see, the antiderivative
of x is x squared over 2.

00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:17.600
The antiderivative of x squared
is x squared over 3-- sorry, x

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.770
to the third over 3.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.290
And we're going to
evaluate this from 0 to 1.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.630
So this is going to be
equal to-- I'm running out

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.180
of my real estate a little bit.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.400
Let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.830
So this is going to be
equal to pi times-- well,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.880
when you evaluate
this whole thing at 1,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.510
you get-- let's see,
you get 1/2 minus 1/3.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.700
And then you subtract
it, evaluate it at 0,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.950
but that's just going to be 0.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.490
0 squared over 2 minus
0, 0 to the third power.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.000
That's just all going to be 0.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.890
So when you subtract
out 0, you're

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.200
just left with this
expression right over here.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.000
What's 1/2 minus 1/3?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.580
Well, that's 1/6.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.890
This is 1/6.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.310
And so we're left with
this is equal to pi over 6,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.810
which is the exact same thing
that we got in the last video.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.360
And that's because we
did the exact same thing

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.670
that we did in the last video.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.080
We just conceptualized it
a little bit differently.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.830
We generalized it in terms
of f of x and g of x.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:22.160
And we essentially
conceptualized it as a washer,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.530
as opposed to doing the disk
method for an outer shape

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.873
and an inner shape like
we did in the last video.
