Let's take a look at Muzei.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.720
Muzei, is a live wallpaper application
that displays a new work of

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.760
art as your background every day.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.080
If you go and check out the source code,
in addition to Roman,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.560
you'll see Ian Lake
listed a number of times.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.510
You might remember him from our advanced
Android App Development course with

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.362
Joanna and Dan.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:26.530
Muzei, is a good example, because it
makes extensive use of dimensions files

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.400
to make its UI work on
multiple form factors.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.440
So I went ahead and

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.030
downloaded the source code from the link
listed in the instructor's notes.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270
Now in this dimensions file, this is for

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.350
the tablet screen,
with the smallest width of 600 dips.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.180
And we can see that we have a number
of dimensions listed in here.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.190
We also have a general
dimensions file that lists many

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.960
of the same properties,
just with different dimensions.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.260
Now, if we go to our activity, we can
see how we use these dimensions, so

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.630
instead of specifying the dips
right here, we're using @dimen and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.480
then the name that was specified
in the dimension file.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.410
Now Android Studio does
a couple of things for you.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.170
So, sometimes you'll see
the dimensions like this,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.300
where they're listed in green.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.020
If you ever see a property that's
listing gray, that means that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.620
Android Studio is showing you
the value that it's pointing to.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.430
So if you hover over one of these,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.490
you can see the dimension value that
Android Studio is pulling from.
