00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.800
Are you having difficulty opening up in a relationship?

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.180
Life is about being courageous,

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:08.435
but this doesn't mean you don't fear.

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:11.335
It's natural to be doubtful or uncertain when you take a risk.

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:14.085
The same can be said of being in a relationship.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.845
You don't stop being afraid

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.885
just because you're romantically involved with the person.

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.725
Rather, it allows you to grow

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.925
even if it means failure or heartache.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:28.365
You have the benefit of building something worthwhile and

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:29.365
fulfilling.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:32.785
Here are 6 ways to be vulnerable in love.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.665
1. Admit and own up to your mistake.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.865
Our pride and ego can ruin our relationship with our

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.175
partner when we worry more about

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.415
being judged by them than admitting our flaws.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:48.855
Granted, it's not comfortable letting your guard down

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.925
and allowing someone else to see your not-so-good side

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:53.605
quirks and all.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:56.945
But being self-aware and viewing ourselves in a healthy

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.055
manner will help us grow and improve

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:03.535
personally contributing to a relationship.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:07.385
2. Listen to your partner's needs and difficulties without quickly trying to problem-solve.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:10.535
without quickly trying to problem-solve.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.715
Well, it's always good to quickly solve problems

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:16.065
so that they don't stress you out unnecessarily.

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:19.115
Sometimes, it's not always easy to think straight

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:21.475
when your emotions are all over the place.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.835
Being vulnerable means putting yourself

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.795
in your partner's shoes. It means not only

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.755
being in touch with your own emotions

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.165
but the emotions of your partner's ,too.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:35.965
You're essentially mindful of the pain or the stress that they're

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:38.905
going through. This will help you realize

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:42.075
that maybe all they really need is a shoulder

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:44.725
to cry on and not just the solution.

00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:48.440
3. Learn to let go of your control.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.085
 

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:52.335
If you have a strong leader personality,

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.515
it may be difficult for you to give up the reins

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.575
and allow your partners to take the initiative. In order to be

00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:01.605
vulnerable, you need to allow your partners to make

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.915
decisions for both of you at times.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:07.095
If you don't, you could seem dismissive or hard to

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:09.455
approach in times of disagreements.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:11.725
Vulnerability is a good thing

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.785
because it shows that you trust your partner so it's good to let

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.855
go every once in a while.

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.895
4. Hold onto who you are without allowing

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:24.315
shame or embarrassment stop you from being real.

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:27.595
Maintain a strong sense of self and never feel

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:30.675
as if you have to done yourself down

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:33.725
or worry about being to nice. If you are a bookworm

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.125
or a philanthropist, do  with wills

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:39.115
right and natural for you. It's perfectly OK

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:42.105
to have opinions and perspectives that are different

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:43.105
from your partners.

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.015
Never compromise who you are to be with someone.

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:50.165
You also shouldn't have to always rely on your partner

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.295
to make you feel better about yourself.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.525
because that would be codependency,

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.245
not vulnerability. It's important to know

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.835
when to assert yourself.

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.405
5. Check in with reality.

00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:12.825
writes: Rather than invalidating what you're feeling,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.115
it can help to have a different perspective on whether your emotions

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:18.005
and actuals that follow them

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:21.375
are in lying with the facts of what's actually happening.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:25.185
Insecurity can make you distort your reality.

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:28.545
It's important then to ask your partners to help you

00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:30.045
figure out what's real or not.

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.665
For example, if you think that your partner is cheating on you,

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.865
it could be that you're affected by your 
own personal

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:41.035
past experience. Make it a habit to check in with reality

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:44.395
so that you don't jump into conclusions without

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:45.395
concrete evidence.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:47.415
6.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.142
Help your partner feel safe.

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.605
Vulnerability is not

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.885
just about your needs, thoughts and emotions.

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:56.405
It's also about your partner's needs,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:59.565
thoughts and emotions. It's better to establish

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:02.675
communication that allows both you and your partner

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.335
the space to express yourselves freely

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.815
rather than bottling up your emotions.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.345
Show your partner you have their best interests at heart

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:14.355
by encouraging them to let you in at a pace that

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:16.805
they are comfortable with. Do so in a

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:19.705
non-pushy, non-aggressive manner.

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:22.175
Love can't be forced, nor rushed,

00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:24.985
but it can always be well.What is holding your heart back?
