00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.660
Welcome to my presentation
on return on capital.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.950
Let me write that down.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.060
I'm using the wrong color.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.260
Let me use a nicer color.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.510
Let me go to white.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.750
I want to do this presentation
first, because I think this is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.420
really going to give you the big
picture on how you should

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.100
think about what something
is worth.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.140
Whether you should invest
your money into it.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.890
And how you should weigh the
different options you have in

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.450
terms of what you actually have
to do with your money, in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.500
terms of where you
want to put it.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.310
Do you want to put
it in the bank?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.130
Do you want to buy a house?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.740
Do you want to pay off
your credit cards?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.900
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.860
So let's just define
return on capital.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.570
And just so you know, I'm not
necessarily going to be strict

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.270
on the accounting conventions,
or the GAP conventions --

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.840
that's the accounting
conventions in this country.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.290
I'm going to do it more on a
hands-on, how Joe Investors

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.470
should think about
their money.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.360
So in this scenario, I define
return on capital as just the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:17.470
cash you get per year divided by
the total cash you put in.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.730
And, well, I don't want
to just say, cash.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.010
There's other ways to
measure return.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.640
But actually, to keep it simple,
let's just say cash.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.750
So let's think about
how this works out.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.170
Let's say, I have an idea.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.630
I have a restaurant.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.530
And that restaurant, it'll
cost $1 million.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.835
It'll cost $1 million investment
in this restaurant.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.210
It's going to be a $1
million investment.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.500
And let's say that, per year,
after paying all the expenses,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.670
after paying the utility, after
paying the employees,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.690
after repairing, and
maintenance, and after paying

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.900
taxes, everything, let's
say this restaurant

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.790
makes $100,000 a year.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.170
And that's after taxes
and everything.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.400
That's what goes
into my pocket.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.470
So in this situation, my return
on capital, the way

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.885
I've defined it, is $100,000
divided by $1 million, or we

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:29.880
could just say a thousand
thousand dollars, equals 10%.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.560
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560
You're probably saying,
Sal, this is silly.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.610
Why are you wasting my time?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.230
Well, maybe it is.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.890
But I think you'll find that
this is going to lay a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.060
foundation that will eventually
blow your mind.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.590
So let's keep going.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.840
Let me do another.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.260
OK, so I said the restaurant
-- let's make it a pizza

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.140
restaurant -- let's just say,
the restaurant return on

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.110
capital is equal to 10%.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.570
Right?

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.540
I can put in $1 million and I'll
get in $100,000 per year.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.910
That's where I got 10%.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.990
Let me write that down.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:25.430
I get $100,000 per year off
of $1 million investment.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.720
Now, that's one project.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.140
I'm not going to factor in
things like risk and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.550
probabilities just yet.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.380
Let's just say, for sure, I know
that if I put my money

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.830
here, I'm going to get
10% on my money.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.810
And let's say the other
option with my

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.365
money is a beauty parlor.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.330
And let's say that that
also costs $1 million.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.269
And this beauty parlor gets
me $50,000 a year.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.050
I think it's very obvious to you
already which investment

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.279
you'd rather invest in.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.250
Because the return on capital on
this beauty parlor is only

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.020
50,000 divided by a
million, or 5%.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.910
So this is obvious.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.980
You'd rather do the restaurant
than a beauty parlor.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.870
And in general, after adjusting
for risk, you always

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.970
want to go with the project
that has the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.910
higher return on capital.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.670
And, later on, there will be
nuances in terms of when you

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.400
get that return.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.710
Maybe you would rather have a
slightly lower return if you

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.900
get the money faster.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.515
Or a slightly higher return if
you're taking on risks, et

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:53.100
cetera, et cetera.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.900
Or to compensate for risk.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.460
So we know we want to
do the restaurant.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.730
But do we definitely want
to do the restaurant?

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.990
We'd rather do the restaurant
than the beauty parlor, right?

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.490
But my question to you is, do
we definitely want to do the

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.280
restaurant?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.710
And this is where the return
on capital becomes

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.180
interesting.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.340
Because what matters, before
we put the money into the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.070
restaurant, is to think
about what the cost of

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.400
that money is to us.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.930
And this is what I think will
be a little bit of a new

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.830
concept to you.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.730
So I'm going to introduce you,
now, to the notion of a cost

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.431
of capital.

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.850
So let me erase this.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.470
OK.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.860
So the restaurant costs
$1 million.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.320
And it gives me $100,000
a year.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.190
And that's a 10% return
on capital.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.680
Now, let's say I have to
borrow all the money.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.360
And there's some bank that's
willing to give me all the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.980
money for this restaurant.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:11.280
And the interest rate on this
loan is, let's say, 15%.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.090
Is it still a good idea for me
to open up the restaurant?

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.170
Well, if I have a loan and I
have to borrow the whole

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.880
amount -- so I'm going to have
a loan for $1 million to buy

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.850
that same restaurant.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.830
And I'm going to be charged 15%
in interest every year .

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.690
And I'm not going to take taxes,
and the fact that you

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.470
could deduct taxes, et cetera,
et cetera , into

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.930
account just yet.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.580
Let's assume that my total
cost is 15% per year in

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.440
interest. So I'm going to have
to spend $150,000 per year in

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.640
interest.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.000
So my question to you is, does
it still make sense for me to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.450
open up this restaurant?

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.920
Every year, I'm going to be
making $100,000 from the

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.270
restaurant itself.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.740
But I'm going to be paying
$150,000 a year in interest.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.870
So you'll probably say, Sal,
once again, you have just

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.990
restated the obvious.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.890
No, you would not want to
do this restaurant.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.890
Because every year,
$50,000 will be

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.710
burning out of your pocket.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.830
Now, you might think that this
is obvious, but I'm going to

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.750
show you many, many examples of
where people are actively

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.210
doing this.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.720
People who you would otherwise
assume could do

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.660
this type of math.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.930
And it's especially happening
in the housing market.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.780
But anyway.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.090
So in this situation, you
wouldn't want to invest in it.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.140
And a very simple way of
thinking about this is you'd

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.410
only want to invest, you only
want to do a project, if your

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.430
return on capital is greater
than your cost of capital.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.925
This is the only time that you
want to invest in a project.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.770
With that said, I'm not
going to go back to

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.730
what we just did.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.930
I just showed you something that
we thought was obvious,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.250
but I'm going to re-ask
you a question.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.430
So we had the restaurant.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.725
And we have the beauty parlor.

00:08:06.725 --> 00:08:08.790
Let's call it BP for short.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.420
They both cost $1 million.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.630
Let me write ROC.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.490
The ROC of the restaurant,
we said, was 10%.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.100
And the ROC on the beauty
parlor, we said, was 5%.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.090
So right now, superficially, it
looks like the restaurant

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.020
is just a better project.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.640
But then we said the cost of
capital, so the interest rate.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.680
How much does it cost for us
to get that $1 million?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.530
The interest rate to borrow
money for a restaurant is 15%.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.210
And we said that this is
not a good investment.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.440
Because our cost of capital
is higher than

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.080
our return on capital.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.929
And you could do the math
and figure it out.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.070
But what if there was some kind
of government program?

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.390
They just felt that there
weren't enough beauty parlors

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.130
in the country.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.740
And they were willing to give
you a really cheap loan to buy

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.820
a beauty parlor.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.910
And the government program, they
said, we're going to give

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.560
you a low-interest loan of 2%.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.570
So my question to you is,
now, which project

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.790
would you rather do?

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.150
Superficially, it looks like
the restaurant was better.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.120
You get a 10% return,
as opposed to 5%.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.660
But your cost of capital, the
interest rate you would have

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.000
to pay on a loan for the beauty
parlor, all of a sudden

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.600
looks a little bit better.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.860
In fact, this is actually
a good investment.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.620
Because your cost of capital
is less than

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.700
your return on capital.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.830
We can even do the math.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.500
Every year the beauty parlor
will generate $50,000.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.260
And you'll be paying $20,000
in interest. So you'll be

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.280
netting $30,000 without having
to put any money for yourself.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.480
You'll be borrowing
all the money.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.510
So clearly this is a
good investment.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.910
So that's it, now, for the intro
on return on capital and

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:43.790
cost of capital.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.640
And in my next presentations,
I'll go into a little bit more

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.810
detail and do a few more
nuanced examples.
