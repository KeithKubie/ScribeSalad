00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.730
I think we're just about ready
to learn how to subtract pretty

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.130
much any number from
any other number.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.750
So let's just review a little
bit of what we know already.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.560
So if I were to ask you what
16 minus 4 is, I could draw

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.790
16 apples and then take
away 4 of the apples.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.340
Or I could actually draw a
number line, and actually let

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.740
me do it here just to start off
the video to get warmed up.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.140
I could draw the number
line and maybe that's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.210
16, maybe that's 17.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.160
It's 15, 14, 13, 12, let me
go down all the way to 11.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.590
I could keep going but
I've run out of space.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.720
Now, if I don't know in my head
what 16 minus 4 is, and it's a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.960
pretty good one to eventually
know in your head, you could

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.920
start in your number line or
you could imagine the number

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.730
line in your brain and you
could go down by 4's.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.350
16 minus 1 is 15 minus 2 is 14
minus 3 is 13 minus 4 is 12.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.560
And you would have the answer.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.120
16 minus 4 is 12.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.860
Now an even easier way to do
this problem is just to focus

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490
on the places of the digits.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.820
Now let me be clear what
I mean when I say that.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.580
Let me re-write it.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.680
16 minus 4, and I've gone
over this a little bit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.520
in the addition videos.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.340
This is the ones place.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.870
The 6 is in the ones place.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.900
The 4 is in the ones place.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.480
The 1, right here, this right
here, or there was something

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.880
down here, this column,
that is the tens place.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.450
Now what do we mean by that?

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.620
Well 16 is the same
thing as 10 plus 6.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.100
So when we write it, this
1 literally means one 10.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.170
If you think of it in money
it means one $10 bill.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.430
If I had a 2 there, if I had
26, that means two $10 bills.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.040
Two $10 bills would mean $20.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.730
So that's two $10 bills
and then six $1 bills.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.350
You can view this as a
$1 bill place, that's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.950
the $10 bill place.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:15.260
If I had 357, you could view
this as three $100 bills, five

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.880
$10 bills, and seven $1 bills,
and that's why this is called

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.510
the hundredths, that's the
hundredths place, this is the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.290
tens place, and this
is the ones place.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.030
And we'll dig a little bit
deeper into this as we explore

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.070
borrowing and regrouping more
in this video and in others.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.600
But I wanted to label these
places because what I want to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.030
show you is you don't even have
to think about 16 minus 4.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.600
You can actually just look at
just the ones place and think

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.945
about 6 minus 4, and say 6
minus 4 -- well you could draw

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:50.600
a number line or you could even
use your fingers if you have

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.340
to, but you probably
have that memorized.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.010
You could probably visualize it
in your head, 6 minus 4 is 2.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.780
And then 1, then we go to the
tens place, 1 minus nothing --

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.840
there's nothing over here.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.790
So 1 minus nothing is
1, and you get 12.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.300
Same answer, we were able
to simplify a little bit.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.010
Let's try another
problem like that.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.720
If I were to ask you
what 78 minus 37 is.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.440
So we start off in the ones
place and we say 8 minus 7 --

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.340
that's 8 ones minus seven
ones, or just 8 minus 7.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.675
8 minus 7 is equal to 1.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.550
Then we go to the tens place.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.370
7 minus 3 -- now remember, this
is seven 10s, or seven $10

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.490
bills, minus three $10 bills.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.210
If I had seven $10 bills and I
give away three of those $10

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.570
dollar bills, then I'll
have four $10 bills, or 7

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.800
minus 3 is equal to 4.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.880
And just like that we were
able to figure out that

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.490
78 minus 37 is 41.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.120
This would have been really
hard to do, it would take me

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.940
forever to draw 78 apples and
to cross out 37 of them.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.150
Or to draw a number line
all the way up to 78

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.450
then go back 37 spaces.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.270
That would have given you the
answer, but it would have

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.390
taken you forever to
solve it that way.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.310
Just by focusing on just
each column, you're able

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.080
to get the right answer.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.590
Well, you might say, hey Sal,
but what happens if I can't --

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.910
well, let me give you an
example where this will start

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.810
to become difficult
doing it this way.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.910
I'll do one more
example like this.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.890
So let's say I had 95 minus 31.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.590
Just like that, 5 minus 1 is 4.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
9 minus 3 is 6.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.700
95 minus 31 is 64.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.280
You're probably saying,
Sal, subtraction is easy.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.580
I can just look at each place,
the ones place and subtract,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.240
tens places and subtract.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.620
But I'm about to show you
that it's not always

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.560
at least that easy.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.450
With a little bit of practice
hopefully you'll realize

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.700
that it's also not too bad.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.510
So what if I were to ask
you what 22 minus 17 is.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.400
Now once again, I could draw 22
oranges or apples and take away

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.770
17 of them and you could count
what's left and you would get

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.730
the right answer, but that
would take you forever.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.140
Is there any way I could
do that maybe just on

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.890
the paper right here?

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.360
Now your reaction might
say let me just do what

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.780
you just did before.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.280
But if you look here, if I try
to subtract 7 from 2, if I have

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.130
two things, at least for the
mathematics that we know right

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.960
now, I can't give away 7.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.170
I only have 2 to give away.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.900
This would give me something
smaller than 0 which

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.960
we don't know about.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.640
That's a negative number.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.560
As far as we know right now,
we can't subtract 7 from 2.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.540
But we know that 17
is smaller than 22.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.870
So what can we do here
to actually do this

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.670
subtraction problem?

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.980
So what we do here, and you
might call it borrowing, you

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.090
might call it regrouping.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.250
This 2 right here, this 22 is
the same thing as 20 plus 2.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.200
That's the 22 right there.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.980
It's 20 plus 2.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.740
The 17 is 10 plus 7.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.640
That's just another
way to write 17.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.760
Now we have a 2 here.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.990
We want something larger
than a 7 to subtract from.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.240
So what we can do is we can
borrow from this 2 or from this

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.660
20, they're the same thing.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.230
Let me do that in
another color.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.020
This 2 right here is the
same thing as that 20.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.150
A 2 in the tens place
means two $10 bills.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.530
Two $10 bills is the
same thing as $20.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.280
That's what that 2 represents.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.500
So if I want to make this 2
into something larger, why

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.130
don't I take a $10
bill from here.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.710
If I take a $10 bill from here
and I turn it into ones -- I

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.580
go to the cashier and say
give me a bunch of ones.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.770
So if I take a $10 bill
from here, then this

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.500
will become $10.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.300
And then I cash into a bunch
of ones and put it here.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.020
So then this will become $12.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.690
If we look over here, what it
looks like I did is I took a 1

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.250
from this 2, so this 2 will
now become a 1, right?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.270
We went from two $10s to
one $10 and it became

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.240
just one $10 bill.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.760
Then I gave that 1 to this 2.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.260
This 2 then becomes a 12.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.650
And now we can
actually subtract.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.770
12 minus 7 is 5.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.220
12 minus 7 -- I'm just doing
the same problem just written

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.340
slightly different on this
right hand side -- is also 5.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.290
Then we have 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.250
I could write this as
05, but that's just

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.660
the same thing as 5.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.310
And here I'd have 10 minus 10
-- well, 10 minus 10 is just 0.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.480
So it's just 05.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.140
So 22 minus 17 is 5.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.020
Let's try to extend this to
an even harder problem.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.660
Hopefully you'll get the hang
of how this borrowing or

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.530
regrouping, depending and how
you want to view it,

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.990
actually works.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.225
So let's say that we
have 703 minus 67.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.160
So if I tried the technique
that we learned earlier in

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.040
this video, I immediately
hit a roadblock.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.050
I say 3 minus 7 -- well if
I have 3 apples, I can't

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.390
take away 7 from there.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.470
So I'm at an impasse.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.590
I don't know what to do next.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.430
And you say well,
maybe I can borrow.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.070
But I look to the left, well
gee, there's a 0 there,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.390
how can I borrow from a 0?

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.670
Then well, there's a 7 there,
but then how do I borrow

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.120
from the 7, all of that.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.370
And the best way to think about
it and the more practice you do

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:41.560
the better, remember this 703
is seven $100 bills plus zero

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.390
$10 bills plus three $1 bills.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.940
And 67 is six $10
bills or $60 plus 7.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.860
So if we can't borrow from here
because I have no $10 bills,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.270
what we want to do is break
one of the $100 bills.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.520
So what I do is I take $100
bill from here, so now

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.860
I'm left with $600.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.280
So this 7 becomes a 6, right?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.510
It's a 6 in the hundredths
place and it represents six

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.610
hundredths, six $100 bills.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.610
So, remember, I took
out a $100 bill.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.050
And then what I can do is I can
split that $100 bill, I can

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.950
give $10 to this guy -- or
sorry, I can give $90 to this

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.980
guy right here, and then I can
give $1 to this guy -- sorry, I

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.340
could give $90 to this guy and
I can give $10 to that

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:34.850
guy right there.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.280
I have $100 to
work with, right?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.350
So what happens?

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.470
If I do that, if I take that
$100 bill that I took out

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.520
from here, went to the
cash register, I got

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.620
nine 10s or $90.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.140
So now I have nine 10s here.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.960
And then I have ten 1s here, so
I add 10 plus 3, it becomes 13.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.800
And just like that, all my
numbers in each column, if I

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.640
were to draw columns like
this, divide them up.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.130
Everything on top is bigger
than everything on the bottom

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.090
so now I can subtract.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.960
So 13 minus 7 is 6.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.230
9 minus 6 is 3.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.840
6 minus nothing is 6.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.620
So 703 minus 67 is 636.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.570
Now you might be saying, OK
Sal, I kind of get what you

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.140
did, you took 100 from here,
you put 90 here, so that

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.540
became a 9, you gave 10 here.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.630
But how did you know to
do that or what's a more

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.480
systematic way of doing.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.660
This kind of is a conceptual
way, which is, in my

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.350
mind, the most important
way to understand it.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.080
But let me show you kind of a
mechanical way to do that.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.060
So let's say we have 700 --
I'll do the same problem

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.490
over again -- 703 minus 67.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.790
I look at all of the numbers on
the top and I say are they all

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.150
larger than the numbers
on the bottom?

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.190
I said well, 3 -- well, 7 is
larger than 3, that's not good.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.695
6 is larger than 0,
that's not good.

00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:53.200
So I need to do something.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.170
So what I do is I start with
this 3 right here, and I say

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.540
well, can I borrow from
this number to the left?

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.470
And I look to the number
to the left and I can

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.640
not borrow from 0.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.720
So then I look to the two
numbers to the left and

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.740
say can I borrow from 70?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.500
I say well gee, I can
definitely borrow from 70 --

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.330
we know this is actually 700.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.840
So if I borrow from
70 what happens?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:23.200
If I borrow one 10 from
70, 70 becomes 69, right?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.910
If I borrow one from
70, it becomes 69.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.970
And I take that 1 and it's
essentially a 10, right?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.850
So that 10 plus 3 is now 13.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.710
And now these are my columns.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.120
Just just like.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.950
You have 13 minus 7 is
6, 9 minus 6 is 3.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.800
And then 6 right down here.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.180
Now, another way you can
think about it, I'll do

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.050
the exact same problem.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.800
703 minus 67.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.210
You could start at the left.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.270
You could say look, 7
is, well, it's larger

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.860
than what's below it.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.100
Nothing is below it,
so I'm cool there.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.770
And then you go 1 right
to the right of it.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.040
And you say well, 0 -- well,
0 is not bigger than what's

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800
below it; it's not bigger
than the 6 below it.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.830
So I'm going to need to borrow.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.030
So what I can do is I can
borrow 1 from the 7 -- I'm

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.220
essentially borrowing
100, right?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.260
So if I borrow -- this is
700, let me make it 600.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.110
Now if I take 100 away
and I turn it to

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.090
tens, that's 10 tens.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.450
It looks like we took a 1 away
and we just put the 1 in front

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.390
of 0, but we essentially
added 10 tens to it.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.360
But if it helps your mind,
we took a 1 away from this,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.480
put it right in front of
the 0 just like that.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.130
This is the same 0 as
that 0 right there.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.220
And this 1 we took
from this guy.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.600
He became 6 and we
have a 1 there.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.720
And then we say OK, 10 is
definitely greater than

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.020
6, we're cool there.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.300
But all of a sudden here on
the 3 we're still not good.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.900
3 is smaller than 7.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.030
Still not cool.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.690
I won't be able to subtract,
so let me borrow again.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.490
Now I have something
to borrow from.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.560
Remember we went from the left
to right this time instead

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.660
of from the right to left.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.670
All of these are valid
ways of doing it.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.860
So we say let me
borrow 1 from the 10.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.680
So 10 minus 1 is 9, and let me
give that 1 to the 3 to go 13.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.050
Remember, it's not a 1.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.170
I added 10 to it.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.910
If I take 1 from the tens
place, that's like adding

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.570
10 to the ones place.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.480
Don't want to confuse you.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.110
Hopefully you see
the system here.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.610
I want you to be able to do the
problems before you have to get

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.960
the real deep understanding
of what's going on.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.620
So 13 minus 7 is 6, 9 minus
6 is 3, 6 minus 0 is 6.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.620
636.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.820
Let's do a couple more
problems, because the

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.060
subtraction sometimes with the
borrowing it can come a little

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.510
bit confusing on
what to do next.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:52.330
Let's say 953 minus 754.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.630
Maybe we'll do it in all of the
different ways that you can

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.190
actually do this
type of problem.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.990
First, one of the ways I talked
about is to start at the right.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.520
Let's see, is 3 larger than 4?

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.230
No, it's not.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.970
So we're going to have to
make it larger than 4.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.310
So let's borrow from
this 5 over here.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:16.960
So if I borrow from the 5, the
5 will become a 4, and I'd

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.210
borrowed 1, the 3 becomes a 13.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.130
Remember, if I borrow 1
from the tens place,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.540
that's actually a 10.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.020
This is 5 tens.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.350
I took one of the 10s away, so
I'm left with four 10s, and I

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.480
added that 10 to the
3, so I have 13.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.300
So this looks good.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.310
13 minus 4, I'll be able
to subtract there.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.880
But here I have a problem.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.560
4 is less than 5.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.090
It was cool before but now all
of a sudden it's messed up.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.920
So I'm going to have
to borrow again.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.590
I'm going to say well,
let me take a 1 from the

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.180
hundredths place, so
that will become an 8.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.940
And let me give that
100 to my tens place.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.800
100 is 10 tens.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.380
So I'm going to add a 10 here,
so it's going to become 14.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.950
I took the 1 from there
and I borrowed it, or

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.760
I rearranged that 100.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.850
I could re-write that 100 as
one 10, and so that's what

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.470
got us to that from 9
to 8 -- or sorry, 100.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.470
I took away 100 from
the 900 to get 800.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.440
And when I re-wrote the 100 in
the tens place, it's ten 10s.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.990
So that's why I added a 10
to the 4 that I had before.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.890
I could have just scratched it
out and put the 14 like that to

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.520
show that I had to
re-write the 4.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.820
But now all of a
sudden I'm cool.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.930
13 minus 4 is 9.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.490
14 minus 5 is 9.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.210
8 minus 7 is 1.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:40.220
953 minus 754 is 199.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.660
Now let's do it the
left to right way.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.470
953 -- let me use a different
color -- minus 754.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.990
Now this is will be a
little bit different

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.470
than I did last time.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.510
I say well 9 is definitely
larger than 7.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.240
5 is definitely larger -- well,
at least it's equal to 5, so

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.550
if I subtract maybe
I'll get a 0 there.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.980
And 3 is less than 4.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.100
So maybe I'll just
have to borrow here.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.795
If I borrow here than this is
going to become a 4 and I'm

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:11.630
going to have to borrow
from there and give me 14.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.100
It'll essentially boil down
to what we did on this

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.720
left hand side right here.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.710
Instead, one thing you can do
is say OK, 9 is larger than 7.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.590
That's cool.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.390
Or even better you could say
953 is larger than 754.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.030
You know that.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.160
You know that this is going
to be a positive number.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.920
That this number is
larger than that.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.340
Then you shift over
one to the left.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.090
Is 53 larger than 54?

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.410
Well no, 53 is not
larger than 54.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:42.250
And because 53 is not larger
than 54, let's borrow.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.000
Let's borrow from the
hundredths place.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.840
So this will become an 8, and
we have 100 to work with.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.290
So maybe we'll just throw
that 100 right here.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.960
So if we throw the 100 into
the tens place, it's ten 10s.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.170
So the 5 becomes 15.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.030
We're going from left to right.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.700
So now we say 8 is
larger than 7.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.930
Well, 8 is definitely larger
than 7, 15 is definitely

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.250
larger than 5.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.810
And then here, once again,
we see 3 is less than 4.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.120
But now we can
borrow from the 15.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.590
So if we borrow from the 15,
the 15 becomes a 14, and

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.450
then the 3 becomes a 13.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.500
Because you take 1 away from
the tens place, one $10

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.210
bill is equal to 10 ones.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.110
So that's why you added 10
to the 3 and you got 13.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.550
And notice, we ended up really
with the same thing no matter

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.390
how we did this problem.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.680
So just like that you
get 13 minus 4 is 9.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.820
14 minus 5 is 9.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.060
8 minus 7 is 1.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.550
Hopefully you found that
pretty straightforward.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.290
These are, frankly, as hard as
the borrowing problems get.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.350
The ones where you don't have
something to borrow from or

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.590
when you do borrow from it, all
of a sudden you get a number

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.790
that -- then you need to
borrow from something else.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.460
If you ever get really
confused about it, you should

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.760
always go back to this.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.620
You should always go back to
this notion of regrouping.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.170
This notion of OK, if these
things are all too small, let

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.470
me take $100 bill over here, so
I have six $100 bills left.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.760
And let me regroup that $100
bills into the other spaces.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.510
In this case, we took the $100
bill and we put 90 here or nine

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.620
10s, nine $10 bills, and then
$10 of it right there to make

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.060
everything in the numerator
larger than everything

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.740
in the denominator.
