00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.540
study of people ordering snacks that
snack-bot delivered and we varied the

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550
snack-bot delivered and we varied the
 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.880
snack-bot delivered and we varied the
design of the robot with social and

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890
design of the robot with social and
 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.520
design of the robot with social and
personalization behaviors in the social

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530
personalization behaviors in the social
 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.220
personalization behaviors in the social
behaviors the robot chatted with people

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230
behaviors the robot chatted with people
 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.020
behaviors the robot chatted with people
about things that the organization knew

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030
about things that the organization knew
 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.790
about things that the organization knew
about like carnival in the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800
about like carnival in the
 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.980
about like carnival in the
personalization condition it would do

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990
personalization condition it would do
 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.810
personalization condition it would do
things like remember what kind of snacks

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820
things like remember what kind of snacks
 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.030
things like remember what kind of snacks
who took offered to do a stretch with

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040
who took offered to do a stretch with
 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.250
who took offered to do a stretch with
you or bring you a special personalized

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260
you or bring you a special personalized
 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.590
you or bring you a special personalized
snack and we found that personalization

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600
snack and we found that personalization
 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.920
snack and we found that personalization
increased people's rapport and

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930
increased people's rapport and
 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.590
increased people's rapport and
engagement with the robot so this is a

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600
engagement with the robot so this is a
 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.220
engagement with the robot so this is a
robot that delivers snacks

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230
robot that delivers snacks
 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.640
robot that delivers snacks
okay there's more to it than this I mean

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650
okay there's more to it than this I mean
 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.790
okay there's more to it than this I mean
how is this robot able to deliver snacks

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800
how is this robot able to deliver snacks
 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.020
how is this robot able to deliver snacks
and what kind of snacks does it deliver

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030
and what kind of snacks does it deliver
 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.660
and what kind of snacks does it deliver
well one interesting thing is that the

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670
well one interesting thing is that the
 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.520
well one interesting thing is that the
robot brought fruit and healthy snacks

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530
robot brought fruit and healthy snacks
 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.370
robot brought fruit and healthy snacks
but also candy bars and cookies and we

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380
but also candy bars and cookies and we
 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.810
but also candy bars and cookies and we
found that people would maybe change

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820
found that people would maybe change
 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.900
found that people would maybe change
their behavior if a robot knew that they

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910
their behavior if a robot knew that they
 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.820
their behavior if a robot knew that they
had a cookie every Friday it might

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
had a cookie every Friday it might
 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.910
had a cookie every Friday it might
inspire them to make healthy choices we

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920
inspire them to make healthy choices we
 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.460
inspire them to make healthy choices we
also learned that the reality of robots

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
also learned that the reality of robots
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.260
also learned that the reality of robots
working in the real world as they break

like it when a robot apologizes they

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340
like it when a robot apologizes they
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.700
like it when a robot apologizes they
trust a robot more after it breaks down

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710
trust a robot more after it breaks down
 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.980

and apologizes that's another thing that

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990
and apologizes that's another thing that
 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.540
and apologizes that's another thing that
we learned well that that's gotten me

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550
we learned well that that's gotten me
 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.850
we learned well that that's gotten me
very far in life too especially with the

when robots apologize yes they do they

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520
when robots apologize yes they do they
 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.920
when robots apologize yes they do they
have to do anything wrong this is like

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930
have to do anything wrong this is like
 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.960
have to do anything wrong this is like
that old joke if a man speaks in the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970
that old joke if a man speaks in the
 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.730
that old joke if a man speaks in the
forest and there's no woman there to

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740
forest and there's no woman there to
 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.270
forest and there's no woman there to
hear him is he still wrong well the

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280
hear him is he still wrong well the
 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.780
hear him is he still wrong well the
answer to that is yes but by and large

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790
answer to that is yes but by and large
 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.790
answer to that is yes but by and large

say science fiction science faction I
 

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.160
say science fiction science faction I
mean as you're there writing and you

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.170
mean as you're there writing and you
 

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.870
mean as you're there writing and you
look at the world around us I mean we're

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880
look at the world around us I mean we're
 

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.600

from the 40s from the 50s I mean

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:24.830
from the 40s from the 50s I mean
 

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.260
from the 40s from the 50s I mean
what's the connection I mean how does

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.270
what's the connection I mean how does
 

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.460
what's the connection I mean how does
science-fiction become science faction

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.470
science-fiction become science faction
 

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.139
science-fiction become science faction
well I think first of all that all the

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:32.149
well I think first of all that all the
 

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:33.820
well I think first of all that all the
advances that have been happening in

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:33.830
advances that have been happening in
 

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.680
advances that have been happening in
robotics at Carnegie Mellon and other

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:35.690
robotics at Carnegie Mellon and other
 

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.810
robotics at Carnegie Mellon and other
places are making it really hard to

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:37.820
places are making it really hard to
 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.909
places are making it really hard to
write more science fiction because I

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919
write more science fiction because I
 

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.699
write more science fiction because I
mean it's just basically it used to be

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:42.709
mean it's just basically it used to be
 

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:44.319
mean it's just basically it used to be
that science fiction pretty much

00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:44.329
that science fiction pretty much
 

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:46.600
that science fiction pretty much
dominated the public perception of what

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:46.610
dominated the public perception of what
 

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.610
dominated the public perception of what
a robot was you know before the 1950s

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.620
a robot was you know before the 1950s
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.160
a robot was you know before the 1950s
there were no robots there was all these

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.170
there were no robots there was all these
 

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.840
there were no robots there was all these
guys in rubber suits you know and that

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:52.850
guys in rubber suits you know and that
 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.050
guys in rubber suits you know and that
was a robot in fact when the first robot

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.060
was a robot in fact when the first robot
 

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.150
was a robot in fact when the first robot
started showing up and then in the

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160
started showing up and then in the
 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.860
started showing up and then in the
mid-1950s there was the UNAM eight

00:08:59.860 --> 00:08:59.870
mid-1950s there was the UNAM eight
 

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.199
mid-1950s there was the UNAM eight
industrial robotic arm and they tried to

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:02.209
industrial robotic arm and they tried to
 

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.550
industrial robotic arm and they tried to
sell that to General Motors and General

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560
sell that to General Motors and General
 

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.069
sell that to General Motors and General
Motors was so scared of the public

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079
Motors was so scared of the public
 

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.870
Motors was so scared of the public
perception of robots that they only

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880
perception of robots that they only
 

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.360
perception of robots that they only
agreed to test it in a in secret in a

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.370
agreed to test it in a in secret in a
 

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.040
agreed to test it in a in secret in a
laboratory you know and then of course

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.050
laboratory you know and then of course
 

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.660
laboratory you know and then of course
they followed that up by not buying it

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.670
they followed that up by not buying it
 

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.060
they followed that up by not buying it
and I think that's because before you

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.070
and I think that's because before you
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.940
and I think that's because before you
had Wolfman and the mummy and then you

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:18.950
had Wolfman and the mummy and then you
 

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.910
had Wolfman and the mummy and then you
had robots from outer space and so you

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920
had robots from outer space and so you
 

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.180
had robots from outer space and so you
know even now I think that science

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.190
know even now I think that science
 

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.210
know even now I think that science
fiction really the term robotic for

fiction really the term robotic for
 

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.430
fiction really the term robotic for
instance means to move with a jerky

you've got a video to show if you look
at the big dog robot here it's moving

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:43.610
at the big dog robot here it's moving
 

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.850
at the big dog robot here it's moving
like an animal and this is kind of a

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:45.860
like an animal and this is kind of a
 

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.710
like an animal and this is kind of a
longer video so at some point someone's

so science fact is catching up and I

00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240
so science fact is catching up and I
 

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.060
so science fact is catching up and I
think it's starting to push science

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.070

first people were building tools we

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660
first people were building tools we
 

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.330
first people were building tools we
build tools people in the future are

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:44.340
build tools people in the future are
 

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.590
build tools people in the future are
going to build tools and there's this

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600
going to build tools and there's this
 

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.160
going to build tools and there's this
whole trajectory to humankind and it's

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
whole trajectory to humankind and it's
 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.470
whole trajectory to humankind and it's
really fun to actually build the future

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480
really fun to actually build the future
 

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.500
really fun to actually build the future
as some people do it's also a really fun

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:54.510
as some people do it's also a really fun
 

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.480
as some people do it's also a really fun
to try to figure out where we're going

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.490
to try to figure out where we're going
 

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.190
to try to figure out where we're going
and how we're gonna get there and what

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200
and how we're gonna get there and what
 

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.900
and how we're gonna get there and what
it's going to look like when we get

00:11:59.900 --> 00:11:59.910
it's going to look like when we get

do it in a couple of years and so the
 

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.830
do it in a couple of years and so the

operation and I should point out this is

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.110
operation and I should point out this is
 

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.660
operation and I should point out this is
on a human person this is a first in

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:04.670
on a human person this is a first in
 

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.660
on a human person this is a first in
human procedure so nowhere so in five

years from concept coming up the concept

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:10.550
years from concept coming up the concept
 

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.490
years from concept coming up the concept
of actually operation and what we're

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.500
of actually operation and what we're
 

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.750
of actually operation and what we're
doing is is what wrapping around a

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760
doing is is what wrapping around a
 

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.790
doing is is what wrapping around a
woman's heart doing an epicardial

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:15.800

in a long law exactly what sounds like

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.090
in a long law exactly what sounds like
 

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.100
in a long law exactly what sounds like
is happening action robopocalypse mmm

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.110
is happening action robopocalypse mmm

it's just a couple of boy and the robot

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:45.580
it's just a couple of boy and the robot
 

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.460
it's just a couple of boy and the robot
yeah ya know so it's it's a near-term

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:48.470
yeah ya know so it's it's a near-term
 

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.980
yeah ya know so it's it's a near-term
future and it's a it's a story of the

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:50.990
future and it's a it's a story of the
 

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.620
future and it's a it's a story of the
technology that we're familiar with

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:52.630
technology that we're familiar with
 

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.899
technology that we're familiar with
basically not working anymore and

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:55.909
basically not working anymore and
 

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:57.789
basically not working anymore and
deciding to try to kill us that's the

00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799
deciding to try to kill us that's the
 

00:18:57.799 --> 00:19:00.669
deciding to try to kill us that's the
quick version but it does follow in a

00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679
quick version but it does follow in a
 

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:02.740
quick version but it does follow in a
long line of stories that are similar i

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:02.750
long line of stories that are similar i
 

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.230
long line of stories that are similar i
I wanted people to know what was going

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240
I wanted people to know what was going
 

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.330
I wanted people to know what was going
on right from reading the cover and then

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:07.340
on right from reading the cover and then
 

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.010
on right from reading the cover and then
once I've got you in that's what I write

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.020
once I've got you in that's what I write
 

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.260
once I've got you in that's what I write
I start going in different directions

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.270
I start going in different directions
 

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.070
I start going in different directions
but you know what I really think this is

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080
but you know what I really think this is
 

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.200
but you know what I really think this is
about the reason that we have so many of

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.210
about the reason that we have so many of
 

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.090
about the reason that we have so many of
these types of stories where it's you

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.100
these types of stories where it's you
 

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.909
these types of stories where it's you
know a little bit maybe it you can think

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919
know a little bit maybe it you can think
 

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.860
know a little bit maybe it you can think
of as a negative portrayal of technology

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:23.870
of as a negative portrayal of technology
 

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.840
of as a negative portrayal of technology
is that I think that we have all got a

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:28.850
is that I think that we have all got a
 

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.680
is that I think that we have all got a
love-hate relationship with technology

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:30.690
love-hate relationship with technology
 

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.039
love-hate relationship with technology
I mean we get more of it every day we

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:34.049
I mean we get more of it every day we
 

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.749
I mean we get more of it every day we
depend on it more it does more and more

00:19:35.749 --> 00:19:35.759
depend on it more it does more and more
 

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.460
depend on it more it does more and more
amazing things for us and then we depend

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:37.470
amazing things for us and then we depend
 

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.769
amazing things for us and then we depend
on it more and then that's scary and

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:39.779
on it more and then that's scary and
 

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.509
on it more and then that's scary and
it's kind of terrifying and so kind of

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:41.519
it's kind of terrifying and so kind of
 

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:43.820
it's kind of terrifying and so kind of
the simplest thing to do with a story is

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:43.830
the simplest thing to do with a story is
 

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.889
the simplest thing to do with a story is
you just externalize that love-hate

00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:45.899
you just externalize that love-hate
 

00:19:45.899 --> 00:19:48.289
you just externalize that love-hate
relationship that you have into a form

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299
relationship that you have into a form
 

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:51.799
relationship that you have into a form
that's really easy to focus on and shoot

00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:51.809
that's really easy to focus on and shoot
 

00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:54.499
that's really easy to focus on and shoot
a gun at and run away from and I'm

00:19:54.499 --> 00:19:54.509
a gun at and run away from and I'm
 

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:56.060
a gun at and run away from and I'm
talking about the killer robot you know

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.070
talking about the killer robot you know
 

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.940
talking about the killer robot you know
that's why we've we've had killer robots

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:57.950
that's why we've we've had killer robots
 

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.799
that's why we've we've had killer robots
forever you know well I do think it's

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:00.809
forever you know well I do think it's
 

00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:02.539
forever you know well I do think it's
essential that we have that but going

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:02.549
essential that we have that but going
 

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:04.159
essential that we have that but going
back to like you know that my heart is

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:04.169
back to like you know that my heart is
 

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:06.109
back to like you know that my heart is
in the work my heart is in the robot I

00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:06.119
in the work my heart is in the robot I
 

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:08.180
in the work my heart is in the robot I
mean how we you were just talking about

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.190
mean how we you were just talking about
 

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.749
mean how we you were just talking about
the snake robot being miniaturized to

00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:11.759
the snake robot being miniaturized to
 

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:13.969
the snake robot being miniaturized to
the point where it has medical

00:20:13.969 --> 00:20:13.979
the point where it has medical
 

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:17.119
the point where it has medical
application which is extremely I mean

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:17.129
application which is extremely I mean
 

00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:18.830
application which is extremely I mean
I'd rather have the snake robot than the

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840
I'd rather have the snake robot than the
 

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.549
I'd rather have the snake robot than the

users you're talking about robots that

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559
users you're talking about robots that
 

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.919
users you're talking about robots that
become social companions that are that

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:27.929

Carnegie Mellon we we inject that the

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.210
Carnegie Mellon we we inject that the
 

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.289
Carnegie Mellon we we inject that the
human side into the robots as well yeah

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299
human side into the robots as well yeah
 

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.479

I joined the dark side basically and

00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:38.489
I joined the dark side basically and
 

00:20:38.489 --> 00:20:41.560
I joined the dark side basically and
broke but you know I could say that

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:41.570
broke but you know I could say that
 

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.359
broke but you know I could say that
dystopian scenarios are really great to

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:44.369
dystopian scenarios are really great to
 

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.399
dystopian scenarios are really great to
give us a fate that we'd like to avoid

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:46.409
give us a fate that we'd like to avoid
 

00:20:46.409 --> 00:20:48.259
give us a fate that we'd like to avoid
and you can say in utopian scenarios

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:48.269
and you can say in utopian scenarios
 

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:49.909

but what's happening especially with
 

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:33.949
but what's happening especially with
medical robots is that physicians who

00:23:33.949 --> 00:23:33.959
medical robots is that physicians who
 

00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:36.529
medical robots is that physicians who
don't have access to medical resources

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539
