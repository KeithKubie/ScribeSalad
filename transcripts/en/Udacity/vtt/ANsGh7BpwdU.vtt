00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.195
The @app.route('\') line
takes you to the same page as

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.552
visiting the @app.route('/hello').

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:09.307
If this is not present, then we get
a File Not Found error on our browser,

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:11.524
if we just visit localhost port 5000,

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:15.030
making it seem as if a website
didn't live at this address.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.020
Decorators in Python can be stacked
one on top of the other, so

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.230
the app.route('/') will call
the app.route('/hello'),

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050
which will call the HelloWorld function.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.370
This is useful for having different
URLs all route to the same place.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.858
Try visiting amazon.com and
amazon.com/index to see how

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:34.900
their server also handles routing
different URLs to the same home page
