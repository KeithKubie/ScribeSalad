00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.187
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:08.020
ISE LYFE: I'm a advocate
for social justice.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.880
I believe that all people
deserve adequate food, shelter,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.830
and clothing.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.510
And we are excited about this
play that we put together.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.679
And today I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.470
about the play, the
themes of the play, how

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.815
we got to the point,
and then bring up

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.940
some great folks to help
us keep moving through it.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.650
We have this cool way that
we get through the slides.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.850
It's very magical.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.570
I say, clap.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.010
You clap one time,
and the slides change.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.870
It's pretty amazing.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.578
So we'll test it.

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:32.200
I go, clap.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.530
[CLAP]

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.650
And just like that, it changes.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.390
It's very magical.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.850
One more time.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.349
Clap.

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.930
[CLAP]

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.220
Cool.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.845
Just like that.

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:39.070
So first thing is,
I want all of you--

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.630
I know it's midday--

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.374
but I want you to think of
any number between 1 and 10.

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:44.290
Don't say it out loud.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.020
Just think it in your head.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.940
Think of any number
between 1 and 10.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.590
Cool.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.380
Got it?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.880
OK.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.190
Now do something,
it doesn't matter.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.460
Add 3 to that number.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.020
Cool.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.130
Now do something crazy.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.230
It doesn't matter.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.650
Add 2.

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:04.190
Cool.

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:09.420
Now do something else crazy.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.340
It doesn't matter.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.881
Subtract the first
number you picked.

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.650
Subtract the first
number you picked.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.400
With me?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.900
Good.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.140
Good.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.690
OK.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.754
Now, do you want to
add or subtract next?

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:20.420
Cool.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.920
Add.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.740
So I want you to add 2.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.060
Cool.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.610
Think really hard, the
number you have leftover.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.741
Just think it.

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.240
Cool?

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.070
No.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.250
No.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.050
No.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.675
It makes it worse
when you clap for it.

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:44.549
[LAUGHS]

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.090
So raise your hand
if you have seven.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.230
You have seven left over.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.760
Look around the room.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.885
Everyone should have seven.

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:51.370
If you don't have
seven, it's OK.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.000
You should though.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.860
I'd like to share with
you how we did it.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.450
Is that cool?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.950
OK.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.450
Cool.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.670
Now, I also want to say this
is the first time in like five

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.760
years of me doing this that
anyone has ever said subtract,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.989
let alone a whole room,
which says something

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:08.280
interesting about where we are.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.770
It's a really great thing.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.150
So let's go to the next slide.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.650
That's you.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.680
This is a non-gender
specific stick figure.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.280
This is you.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.820
Cool.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.960
So this is you.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.282
And what did I ask you to do?

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:20.490
I asked you to pick a number.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.820
That's you.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.028
That's the number you picked.

00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:23.332
Then I told you to add three.

00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:24.040
And you did that.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.300
You said OK.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.080
You added three.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.950
And then I say, OK.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.080
Now do something crazy, add two.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.700
And then I said subtract
the first number you picked.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.630
Remove yourself
from the situation.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.330
Now I know the whole
room is holding five

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.152
because all you have
left is what I gave you.

00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:44.860
And then I start with
the illusion, well,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.510
do you want to add
or subtract next?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.260
And normally, people, they add.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.192
They say add because
adding is easier.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:52.900
So I say add two.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.290
Go ahead.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.280
And of course,
you all have this.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.889
Of course the next
slide, it's seven.

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:56.680
Seven is left over.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.138
This is a mathematical
poem that we

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:02.050
build to say that if I
remove you from an equation,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.520
I can make you whatever
I want to make.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.520
And Agnus begins to
address this thing.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.310
Our piece takes place
30 years in the future

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.960
and explores in 2047 what the
notion of being an individual

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.050
will look like, what is
the future of tech, what

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.530
is the future of
privacy, and politics,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.055
all around this high stakes
crime drama that we've built,

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.590
as I said set in the year 2047.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.037
Also, when we think about
different communities,

00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:38.370
we know what it's like in
different parts of the country

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.430
where a certain area is called,
oh that area, or those people

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.380
are at risk or under-privileged.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.187
Or the president talks
about the nations

00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:54.270
that people come from as
different types of holes,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.810
you know.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.190
And that's a way of taking
away who a people are

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.840
and then labeling them with
whatever you want to give them.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.330
So when we started building
out this piece, the first thing

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.062
that I did way back in 2012--

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:07.770
I started seeing all
these mass shootings

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.070
were occurring, more so and
hearing it in the news more

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.880
and more and more.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.716
And I began just
logging these things.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:15.840
I started logging all of
these different shootings.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.910
And it was like every
other week on the news,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.200
there was this mass shooting.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.279
And then as I looked
into them, there

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.510
were ones that were
happening that were not

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.200
happening on the news at all.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.760
And I began to really think
about one, how horrible

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.000
and how tragic this
was, but then I

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.750
started to see a
reoccurring theme in this

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.750
that I want to address.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.480
So at the end of
2012, there's a total

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.600
of 78 murders that were
connected with things that were

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.790
designated as mass shootings.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.404
Next slide.

00:04:42.404 --> 00:04:44.070
And then there was
this interesting kind

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.990
of framing that the kind of
pacing that kept going on

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.370
is that they would say, OK.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.320
We don't know what's happened.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.640
And then they'd go.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.140
OK.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.530
A shooting has
happened, and there

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.440
would be speculation around
why the shooting was happening.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.330
And immediately,
the conversation

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.810
went to a conversation about
the person's mental health.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.400
Are they crazy?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.190
Are they crazy?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.910
And what country they're from.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.230
And there also seems
to be this delineation

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.300
that the browner a person
was, the more likely

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.150
it started going towards leaning
towards are they a terrorist.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.700
The lighter or
whiter a person was,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.380
it went to is a person crazy.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.462
But what was nailing every time
right away was this othering.

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:28.920
There was this
immediate thing when

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.669
someone is committing
something like this,

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.480
like an impulse to
go, they're not us.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.580
They're someone else.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.610
They're some other thing.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.270
And then there was these
pictures and these photos

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.730
that I saw being commonplace.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.440
The one case that we
looked at and really spent

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.080
a lot of time breaking down
was the case of the Unabomber.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.562
The Unabomber went to Harvard.

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:54.020
In fact, he was
admitted to Harvard

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.677
when he was 15 years old.

00:05:56.677 --> 00:05:58.010
A lot of people don't know this.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.830
He went to UC
Berkeley in California

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.810
where he got his doctorate.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.155
And after becoming
disgruntled there,

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:09.200
he moves out into the
middle of nowhere in a cabin

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.780
and with no heat,
electricity, running water,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.540
he begins building
bombs and committing

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.565
terrorist acts for years.

00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:18.440
He's was one of the
first people that the FBI

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.400
considered to be uncatchable,
like verbalizing it.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.320
They didn't know how
they could catch him.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.970
He writes a manifesto
and he threatens

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.220
that if "The New York Times"
and "The Washington Post"

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.820
doesn't publish his
manifesto, that more people

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.260
are going to be hurt.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.870
And it was published.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.526
And in it, he starts
talking about--

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:43.440
and he has these crazy,
sick things that he's doing.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.560
And then he starts
talking about technology

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.230
and the threat of technology
and that if we don't stop,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.902
the environment is
going to be impacted

00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:51.860
and that people sitting
around tables, families

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.470
are not going to
talk to one another.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.800
He starts talking about these
things about how technology can

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.410
negatively impact the world.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.180
And of course, he's doing
these horrendous things

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.580
and committing these
horrendous crimes.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.350
His sister-in-law notices a
line in the published manifesto

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.060
of language that he
uses and goes, hmm.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.800
And his family makes
a hard decision,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.510
and they contact
the FBI and say.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.890
I think that my brother
may be the Unabomber.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.900
And he was caught.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.390
But before he was caught,
media and news outlets

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.294
and the Academy,
professors, researchers,

00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:28.460
were talking about this man.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.280
He's a terrorist,
but he's brilliant.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.880
And there's all this
intrigue around him.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.411
And then they pulled
him out of the cabin.

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.160
And when they pulled
him out of the cabin,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.640
he didn't look like this
kind of H&amp;M model ad

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.031
thing in the middle here.

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.450
He looked as we know him.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.805
And right away, he's crazy.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.160
His psych evaluation, after
terrorizing this country

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.560
for over a decade,
was five days long.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.030
He was labeled crazy.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.430
He didn't have a full
trial by his decision,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.860
and he was sentenced
to life in prison.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.600
Our piece deals with--

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.610
also, of course, and what he was
doing is crazy and horrendous.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.310
But it deals with
the physicality.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.270
I was asked to point
what's up with my hair.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.040
And you're going to
see pictures of Agnus

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.070
in a little bit that
will get into that.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.870
Next slide please.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.990
Recently, in Vegas
of course, tragically

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.700
less than a year
ago, I was in Vegas.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.680
I called the
co-writer right away

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.090
because I saw this
horrible shooting that

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.929
happened in Vegas.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.512
And because they
didn't know anything,

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:40.674
they pulled up an FBI
wanted ad from his father

00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:42.799
and started having a
conversation-- with his father

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.780
was said to be psychotic.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.700
And again, that was
really interesting.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.829
Not because we're like, oh.

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:49.370
Don't call these
people who are doing

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.780
these things crazy, crazy.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.320
Part of our concern is does
it prevent these things

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.190
from happening when our leading
action is to just call someone

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.930
crazy and lock them up.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.290
And we see this in different
areas of crime in this country.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.877
We've seen for years when
there's root causes to violence

00:09:06.877 --> 00:09:07.960
in inner city communities.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.780
They'll go, oh.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.090
Those folks-- it's not crazy.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.890
It's like, oh, they're gang
members, or oh, they're thugs.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.514
And we're going to lock them up,
and that's going to end crime.

00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:17.780
And of course, that
doesn't play out well.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.220
And now when we see this spike
in these mass shootings that

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.830
are predominantly
occurring by white males,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.990
the conversation is
like, oh, they're crazy.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.573
And there's no
conversation about what

00:09:31.573 --> 00:09:34.070
is the root cause of what's
going on with these young men

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.890
and men that lead
to an inability

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.320
to deal with their
frustrations and then lash out

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.440
in these horrendous ways.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.090
Next slide.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.110
So I was trying
to figure out how

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.870
I was going to build this
piece, what I was going to do,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.040
and I thought of
who I could contact

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.390
that had some type of insight
or was building in writing

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.030
about the future,
writing about technology,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.710
engaging in different
conversations.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.543
And we started building
about it right away.

00:09:59.543 --> 00:10:02.930
This happened over the
course of two years

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.090
that we built around
this play to figure out

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.820
how we could do something
that was compelling

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.370
and build out something
that was honest

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.080
and produce it here in New York.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.170
We went to every talk and
conversation and forum

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.260
about the way that technology
impacts the workplace,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.950
the way that technology impacts
our environment and the food

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.490
we eat.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.340
We saw amazing forums like the
Glass Room here in New York.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.280
I don't know if anyone saw that,
but it was a really incredible

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.150
exhibit here.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.990
So in building Agnus,
we knew that Agnus

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.240
had to look different.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.520
He had to not be on the grid.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.000
He had to have some
critique of government.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.387
We wanted to make sure that
he had a ferocious intellect.

00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.470
And in building of this
character, he was scarred,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.000
and he was also
accused of a crime.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.541
And that will create
all the elements

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:52.410
that we needed to
portray something

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.170
that will invoke in the
audience the feelings that we

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.860
have about wrongdoers in
this country and the biases.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.700
Next slide, please.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.600
And Agnus was
created in this way.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.740
And this is me after 2 and
1/2 hours of make-up tech.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.240
We're excited to show you some
other behind the scene photos

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.080
that just came in as we've
begun loading in the tech.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.790
Next slide.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.540
So we knew that we wanted to
pick where we might be headed

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.340
to inspire a vision for change.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.880
So I do a lot of work
inside of institutions,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.930
whether it's in the
Academy or in prisons.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.650
And it's really
interesting seeing the way

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.370
that prisons are being built,
the way that prisons are being

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.800
monetize, the streamlining of
building out and anticipating

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.130
budgets based on crime rates,
and the way that they're

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.725
privatizing prisons.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.350
And it's funny.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.808
When we started
building this set--

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:47.240
Kirn showed me a very
interesting thing this morning.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.375
Kirn, what is this?

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.540
KIRN KIM: It was the
original concept sketch of--

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.300
[LAUGHS]

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.740
ISE LYFE: Kirn does all
this great work with us,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.910
and Kirn was the
first person that

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.550
helped us kind of conceive
the project as far as what

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.900
it would look like visually.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.450
And to Kirn's credit, this
is our initial sketch.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.366
And all of you, I want
you to be inspired when

00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:06.690
you see what this turned into.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.850
Start to dream from
anywhere because it really

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.450
got somewhere.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.900
ISE LYFE: Next slide.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.450
Agnus, in the play, he's an
odd man in both appearance

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.470
and personality.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.190
He's volatile.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.250
He's being accused of killing
the governor of California

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.950
in the year 2047.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.201
Next slide.

00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:26.700
One thing that we're
really proud of

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.650
is that along with our
play engaging these issues

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.810
on the stage-- and we'll
talk about this a little more

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.520
with our moderator--
we're engaged in community

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.100
organizations here in New York
City that are actually doing

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.340
on the ground work to build a
better future for us and not

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.860
by giving them free tickets
to our play but by saying,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.360
hey, when we're not
in this theater,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.210
this theater is yours for
you to do specialized events.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.230
And we'll talk about
that a little bit more.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.850
So we wanted to share that.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.280
So these are taken
from our stage work,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.230
and we have an
incredible design team

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.689
that has helped out
with building out

00:12:57.689 --> 00:12:59.730
this futuristic prison
and what it can look like.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.938
And we wanted to share some
of these images with you.

00:13:01.938 --> 00:13:03.370
Next slide.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.081
We have an amazing
cast, an incredible cast

00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:08.830
that's helping us bring
the story forward.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.830
And as we roll into
the thing, I think

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.150
we have other slides of just--

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.400
what this is in lighting tech.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.689
So this isn't even the official
final makeup take on Agnus.

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:17.980
But one thing that's very
interesting about the process

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.250
is as we're having to test
lights and bring forward this

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.860
futuristic thing, working
with different paste and tones

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.800
to get the look really right--
but all of this was to address

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.600
that theme-- and the
next slide please--

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.830
of Agnus looking different.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.600
You can just roll
through these, Kirn.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.640
And our whole set is
projected live here.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.100
This is really great.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.800
Because as we move
past papers and pens

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.600
30 years into the
future, ways that on

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.790
stage that we can depict
the future of what

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.994
our devices will look like.

00:13:45.994 --> 00:13:47.660
And of course, this
is the type of stuff

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.201
that you are all
doing in this forum.

00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:51.280
And as we wrap up, go ahead.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.244
Let's see what's left.

00:13:52.244 --> 00:13:53.660
Khalil will be
joining us shortly.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.400
We just have the coolest
kind of vibe and team

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.660
bringing this story forward.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.934
Next slide.

00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:01.975
We want you to know, of
course we want all of you

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:02.650
to come see the play.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.691
Please come see the play.

00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:04.900
We're right off Broadway.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.850
We're just two blocks
from Times Square.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.385
And as we close out,
we're looking forward

00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:10.720
to the conversation that
we're going to have with you

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.620
and answering any questions.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.453
Thank you very much.

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:13.138
Thank you.

00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:14.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:17.818 --> 00:14:19.220
ISE LYFE: Cool.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.230
I would like to
invite up two people.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.762
First, I want to
invite up Elz Cuya.

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:24.470
This is Elz Cuya.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.340
Elz Cuya is a great
collaborated with us for Agnus

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.449
and responsible for helping
us bring the community

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:31.990
organization that
we're working with.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.430
She's deputy director at
North Star Foundation.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.920
We're really excited
that she's here with us.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.920
And Khalil Kain is an
actor in our piece.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.720
Please welcome Khalil
Kain and Elz Cuya.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.070
ELZ CUYA JONES: Hello, everyone.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.760
Thank you for having us.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.070
Hello, Khalil.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.280
Hello, Ise.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.390
I'm going to moderate
a brief conversation,

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.760
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.420
OK?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.640
Khalil, if he looks
familiar to you,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.010
it's because you've seen him
in the seminal work, "Juice,"

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.960
starring Tupak Shakur.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.370
And it's a very special day
because it opened 26 years ago

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.150
to the date.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.580
So we're really excited
to have him here.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.140
We just heard from Ise.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.110
I wanted to ask Khalil--

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:31.500
tell me why this work is
important to you personally?

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.200
KHALIL KAIN: I
got sent the play.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.190
I took a look at it.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.190
Right now, I don't know.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.980
From an artistic
standpoint, I feel

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.900
like if we're not
doing something that's

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:46.350
making some sort of impact
politically, societally,

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.420
what are we doing actually?

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.870
There's a responsibility
for imagery

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.040
for what we're putting forward.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.041
And as soon as I read the
play, I was like, wow.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:57.540
OK.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.584
This is really-- it
has a point of view.

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:01.500
You may agree with it.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.550
You may not.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.340
But it definitively
has a point of view.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.050
I was intrigued right away.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.900
So I met-- actually met here--

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.820
with Matt and Ise.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.970
And we discussed the project.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:15.930
I know what I read.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.930
I wanted to get a
sense of actually

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:24.750
what Ise and Matt had to say
concerning this position.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.500
I think the play
is really intimate.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.760
It's powerful.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.070
If you come see the
piece, the theater,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.720
you're going to feel like
you're in the room with Agnus.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.100
It's a little chilling.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.600
But I knew I was going to
be a part of something that

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.160
was making a
statement, and that's

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.993
kind of where I'm at
right now as an artist.

00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:47.730
So I decided to get to work.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.060
And we've been working hard.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.520
So I'm excited for
you all to come.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.289
Anybody who comes see the
play, please come join us.

00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:55.580
ELZ CUYA JONES: Opens tomorrow.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.329
KHALIL KAIN: Yeah.

00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:59.880
ISE LYFE: So, Ise, I
heard what you said

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.060
and what you said
about art that makes

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.010
a statement about something.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.540
You wanted to bring community
organizations to the piece.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.390
And something that you said
that really resonated with me--

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.390
I'm a fundraiser for
social justice movements

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.359
around affordable housing,
police accountability,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.980
LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights,
food justice, et cetera.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.800
Ise wanted to bring a
piece of art that was

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.849
accountable to the community.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.330
So with this piece that you
wrote along with Matt Werner,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.040
can you share with me--

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.080
just speak more on
that about being

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.920
accountable to the community.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.010
ISE LYFE: Well, I think that
part of what Agnus is about too

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.220
is that in that
whole othering thing

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.200
that we have
conversations around--

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.330
these communities and
those communities-- and I

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.720
think that in that, there
is an inadvertent kind

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.486
of sidestepping of
people, particularly

00:17:55.486 --> 00:17:57.360
who come from spaces
that we don't understand

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.250
or that we don't know about.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.780
And so we wanted to write
a play and a piece that

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.516
made the audience be
confronted with that.

00:18:06.516 --> 00:18:07.890
And our piece
doesn't really give

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.390
a way to escape from the fact
that we have ideas and notions

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.160
about people or that
we have comfort zones

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.170
that we rather kind of stay in.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.090
And so in the
writing of the piece,

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.370
we wanted to be
accountable to folks

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.316
who are othered for
various reasons,

00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:25.815
whether it's because they're
incarcerated the way that Agnus

00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:29.640
is, whether it's because
they look a certain way.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.270
And then in our
production of the piece

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.350
and inviting organizations
out, we felt like--

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.580
there's this common
thing in the arts,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.250
particularly in
theater arts, where

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.140
people kind of go and they
have an alternative experience.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.907
And then they go, this
is informing my work.

00:18:46.907 --> 00:18:48.740
And then they go, and
then they write a work

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.114
and they present
it to people who

00:18:50.114 --> 00:18:52.530
don't come from the
experience that inspired

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.060
the play in the first place.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.230
And doesn't even
really nod to them.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.740
And so by having people be
able to come into the theater,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.770
be invited into the theater, be
incorporated in our storyline,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.790
and our plot was our way of
being accountable to that.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.920
KHALIL KAIN: I have to
say, doing this work--

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.840
we've been in rehearsal
the last two weeks--

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.230
even before that, even
just digesting the play,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:19.340
being part of that
other can be painful.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.800
So a lot of times it's easier
to sort of lean away from it as

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.690
opposed to lean into it.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.880
And doing this work has
helped me sort of identify

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.780
and sort of hug my otherness--

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.080
being able to identify
with Agnus a little more

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.170
and understand that
this is happening now.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.880
It was happening before.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.740
And the way we frame
it in the play,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.320
it will be happening
in the future

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.972
if we don't change something.

00:19:50.972 --> 00:19:53.180
ELZ CUYA JONES: I just want
to share with you briefly

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.860
a few of the
organizations who will

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.030
be using the space that Ise
and Matt so generously offered

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.970
to the community organizations.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.170
Black Transmedia
is an organization

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.600
that is shifting
folks' image of what

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.850
it is to be black and trans.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.750
Black Lives Matter
Week of Action--

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.190
they're launching their
Week of Action at the space,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.410
and they're bringing the
values of Black Lives Matter

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.790
into the schools.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.810
And also Just Leadership will
have an event at the space.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.940
And Just Leadership,
their mission

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.350
is to decrease the amount of
incarcerated people by 50%

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.740
by 2030.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.230
And there are many more
organizations using the space,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.960
and those are just a few.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.360
So Ise, tell me when
you created this piece

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.470
with Matt, what is your
biggest hope and your biggest

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.989
vision for the work?

00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:47.030
ISE LYFE: My biggest hope
and vision for the work

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.720
is that people who are
responsible for building

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.250
the future, that are building
what the what the world will

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.230
look like in 30 years, are
doing it from a holistic space.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.760
My firm does this project with
the Science Center and NASA,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.800
and I was really
excited about that.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.740
In one of the talks from
one of the astronauts

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.540
who's been to the
Space Station twice--

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.050
he says, in 50 years, there
will be commercial mining

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.120
in outer space.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.320
And the room went, whoa.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.404
And then I went, whoa.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.280
And then I went, whoa.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.780
So that means that we're like,
oh, we're going to the stars.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.563
Let's get this money.

00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:26.063
You know?

00:21:26.063 --> 00:21:27.936
[LAUGHS] And I
smiled about that.

00:21:27.936 --> 00:21:29.810
I was like, well, it's
interesting, you know.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.900
And I think that
those of us that are--

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.630
whether we're building tech
or building political spheres

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.980
or building art--

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.830
that we're inspired to go--

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.240
in 30 years, I'll
be 65 years old.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.670
How old will you be in 30 years?

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.860
I'm asking you.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.360
No.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:45.900
You here with the glasses.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.930
Yes.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.904
Yeah.

00:21:47.904 --> 00:21:48.626
AUDIENCE: 56.

00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:49.250
ISE LYFE: Yeah.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.300
That's a wild thing
to think about.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.110
So we have this futuristic
play, and we'll be here.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.745
And I hope that we evoke
that thinking in people.

00:21:59.745 --> 00:22:01.120
ELZ CUYA JONES:
One of the things

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.060
that really intrigued
me about this piece

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.720
is hearing about how
Ise conceived of it.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.750
Can you tell the audience
about your experience sitting

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.750
in the LA courthouse watching
arraignment after arraignment

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.820
and how that impacted you?

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.120
ISE LYFE: One thing though
that was interesting

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.890
when I started building out
the piece and thinking about--

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.980
I said, I'm going
to go to courtrooms

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.375
and watch how it's done now so I
can think about what it's going

00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:29.500
to look like in the future.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.670
I live in downtown Los Angeles.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.211
I went to the
courthouse right there.

00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:34.540
People of all different
races and backgrounds

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.020
coming in and dealing with--

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.570
whether it's families
or people who--

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.400
and I started
seeing the families.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.090
But I noticed I
wasn't seeing any

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.670
of the people who were being
accused of crimes in person.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.500
They were doing live
feeds from a county

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.330
jail arraigning people.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.970
And so even a jury is looking
at people, not face-to-face,

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.110
not there, but
through a live feed.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.514
Of course, it takes
the human piece out--

00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:02.680
KHALIL KAIN: Dehumanization.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.250
ISE LYFE: There's
dehumanization,

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.722
and there's a disconnect in it.

00:23:04.722 --> 00:23:06.430
And I'm sitting here
thinking, like, wow.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.221
We're building this
piece about the future.

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.110
And I was like, whoa, this
is happening right now,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:16.390
like right now, where
the judge stands

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.320
and then a woman that's
being accused of a crime

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.550
and she's in a room.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.220
She stands in the room.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.330
I saw this, and I thought, whoa.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.162
And that was heavy to me.

00:23:28.162 --> 00:23:30.370
And the other thing that
was very interesting to me--

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.328
and this story should be
told a million times--

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:34.600
is how many people who are
not connected with the case

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.974
at all-- they're not interning,
they're not taking notes,

00:23:36.974 --> 00:23:38.890
you're not building a play--

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.860
concerned community members who
believe in democracy and peace

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.387
that just come and just
watch and are concerned.

00:23:47.387 --> 00:23:48.970
And that blew me
away too, that that's

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.940
an untold story, that
there's people who really go.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:58.374
I saw people who get
jury duty, and they want

00:23:58.374 --> 00:23:59.540
to be a part of the process.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.390
And when you talk to
them, it's not like, oh,

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.514
I want to lock somebody up.

00:24:01.514 --> 00:24:04.780
It was like, I want to make
sure somebody gets a fair shot.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.670
And I learned from
watching that.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.510
So I think that--

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.284
in wrapping up my
answer to you--

00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:12.700
I think another
thing is that when

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.462
we talk about the
future, whenever

00:24:14.462 --> 00:24:15.920
we talk about the
past, it's always

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.160
nostalgia for those days.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.560
In every book, play, and
movie about the future,

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.600
it's like donn.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.300
What is it about the
future that scares us

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.390
to that when we write
about it or think about it,

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.680
it's like whoa?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.850
And I think part of it is that
what we don't know is scary.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.430
And so our play is an
opportunity to talk about,

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.480
hey, you know, we might
be headed down this road,

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.770
but also there's glimpses in
our play around where it could

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.150
go in the right direction.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.070
And I feel good about that.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.820
KHALIL KAIN: Yeah.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.900
There are some of
the things that we

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.733
don't know that can be
scary, but then there

00:24:48.733 --> 00:24:53.170
are things that we do know
that are scary, very scary.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.440
I mean, honestly folks,
it's a legit fear of mine

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.090
to be incarcerated.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.240
The odds of me actually
getting locked up

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.550
are greater than
you might think.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.730
And this is like something
that me as a man,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.670
as a human being, when I
leave my house every day,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.950
it's something that
I remind myself of--

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.550
be careful.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.760
Don't get in trouble.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.530
Do not get arrested.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.370
Do not get locked up I
mean, my whole adult life--

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.840
this is something that I get
up, shower, have my coffee,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.290
get ready to walk out the
door, be careful today.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.820
I mean the chances of being
arrested in the United

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.840
States of America--

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.800
I mean we incarcerate
more people

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.760
than anybody on the planet.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.975
So it's something
that I've avoided.

00:25:44.975 --> 00:25:47.220
And it's funny because--

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.960
be careful what you ask
for or don't ask for.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.130
It's a legit fear of mine.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.240
So I got an opportunity to work
in the prison system mentoring

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.410
young felons.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.510
I said, no because I
didn't want to be--

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.860
he does this work.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.900
I didn't even want
to be in there.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.820
I didn't want to go near it.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.410
And of course, what do I do?

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.600
I get cast in this
play, and I have to--

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.430
I'm serious.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:16.080
And it's like experiencing this
every day during rehearsal--

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.700
again, I go home.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.290
I wake up.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.860
It becomes reinforced.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.650
Because through art,
it becomes real.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.950
Like this is happening.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.700
This is happening.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.658
We're writing about it.

00:26:25.658 --> 00:26:28.190
And then we're looking
30 years in the future.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.620
And it's--

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.370
ISE LYFE: It must
really be a trip for you

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.828
too because Khalil
plays the warden

00:26:33.828 --> 00:26:37.666
of the prison in the play,
which is a whole other thing.

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.670
KHALIL KAIN: It's a lot.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.490
ELZ CUYA JONES: Another way
that all of this dehumanization

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.460
is very real, particularly
here in New York City--

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.710
one of the organizations
that I fundraise for

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.750
is Communities United
for Police Reform,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.410
and in December, the City
Council voted on the Right

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.400
to Know Act.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.330
It was a bittersweet victory
because one half of the law

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.010
was passed, and the
other half was not.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.850
So the part that was a win
was now police officers

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.630
have to let the person know
that they have a right to not

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.440
consent to a search.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.070
And if they don't speak English,
if they need a translator,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.370
they have a right to know.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.000
And they have to know that
they understand that they have

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.250
a right to not be searched.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.230
The part that we
lost, which was so

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.990
disappointing to the
200 organizations who

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.190
fought for this--

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.380
the families of the
victims of people

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.940
who were shot by police--

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.110
was that police still don't
have to identify themselves.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.300
Can you imagine?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.460
My son is black and
a police officer

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.220
can be like, what are you
doing, and hold their gun,

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.530
and not say who they are.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.830
And about the
unknown being scary,

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.880
and then they're not even
being held accountable.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.700
So it's really real
in New York City.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.330
KHALIL KAIN: So what can we do
to get that sort of education

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.500
out to certain
marginalized youth,

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.430
that they know they have the
right to not be searched?

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.580
I mean these are things
that these kids don't know.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.980
They don't really know
what their rights are.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.620
I mean, I'm an adult. I don't
know what all my rights are.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.570
ELZ CUYA JONES: Many
community organizations

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.290
do trainings all the time
and get young people in there

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.540
to know their rights.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.940
Know Your Rights trainings
is what they're called.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.820
And organizations doing all
kinds of different things

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.370
from organizing street
vendors, to immigrant rights.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.700
It's not just organizations
that are working

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.200
on police accountability.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.150
They're working on
this so that everybody

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.770
knows what the deal is.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.830
It's really awesome.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.246
ISE LYFE: And I
know we were going

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:35.806
to open up for questions, yeah?

00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:37.680
ELZ CUYA JONES: Now is
the time if any of you

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.950
want to come up to the mic and
ask questions of the artists.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.149
ISE LYFE: No pressure.

00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.940
ELZ CUYA JONES: OK.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.565
While you're thinking
of your question,

00:28:47.565 --> 00:28:50.500
I want to bring something up.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.740
You have someone
on your team, Kirn

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.410
who is working on the
slides back there,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.580
who has a very unique
experience that has informed

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.800
much of the production.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800
Can you talk about that?

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.400
ISE LYFE: This is Kirn Kim.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:12.320
And Kirn is a great staff member
at my firm here in Los Angeles.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:21.580
And when Kirn was 16 years
old, Kirn was tried as an adult

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.360
and sentenced to life in
prison when he was 16.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:32.080
And part of what our work
has been about in the piece

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.144
and beyond that is
figuring out how

00:29:35.144 --> 00:29:37.060
do we address and make
sure that people really

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.640
know and understand
the gravity of what's

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.970
happening within our
justice system with children

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.780
and how children
are being treated.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.700
And I hope there is a space for
us to address that and speak

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.360
to that.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.820
KHALIL KAIN: There are a lot
of countries that just will not

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.170
try a child as an adult by
law because it's just not

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.180
morally correct.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.587
Here, we do.

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:08.170
And there's something
wrong with that.

00:30:10.894 --> 00:30:12.811
ISE LYFE: Any other
questions before we close?

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.768
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, and I look forward

00:30:14.768 --> 00:30:15.860
to seeing the play.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.260
So I have a comment
and also a question.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.865
So the comment you mentioned
about how the future scares us,

00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:21.770
and I wanted to--

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.970
as a longtime reader
of science fiction--

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.300
we used to write science
fiction that was hopeful.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.080
And somewhere in the 70s,
that got unfashionable.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.060
And so everything is
about scary and awful

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.240
and how bad it's going to be.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.770
And I think we actually
have a dire need

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.990
for hopeful imagination
of the future

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.220
so that we have
something to aim for.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.050
And the question I have--

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.980
I notice that your
title character, Agnus--

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.470
so that's traditionally
a female name,

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.260
the character
appears to be male,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.040
and his name is an
anagram for Angus,

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.520
but it's also agnus
as in agnus dei.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.660
So I'm wondering
which layers of those

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.490
are actually
relevant to the play?

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.940
ISE LYFE: The part about him
having a woman's name comes up

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.890
in the play.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.070
And there there's also
a Latin derivative

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.119
and a Greek
derivative of Agnus--

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:17.910
and it's a cool thing--
you can Google it--

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:24.340
being a reference
to lamb of God.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.930
Yeah.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:31.580
And in naming Agnus, I
thought of all these things

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.619
he'd be made fun of.

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:34.160
and he talks about
how he's tormented

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.460
about his looks, and then
his name and all of that.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:43.700
When his nature, as we believe
all of our nature to be,

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.050
is to be made of the
starstuff, to actually

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.310
you come from the universe.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.070
We look at babies, and
everyone loves babies.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.778
And then somewhere in
there, these things

00:31:55.778 --> 00:31:59.590
come up that shape the way we
name and make fun of people.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.360
And so I was hopeful
that in giving him

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.942
a peculiar name
that people would--

00:32:03.942 --> 00:32:06.400
this question has come up--
that people would search for it

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.390
and ask.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.567
But it's to be a lamb
of God or the universe.

00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:11.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.233
ISE LYFE: Thank you.

00:32:12.233 --> 00:32:13.400
Appreciate it.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.400
AUDIENCE: Questions, but
I'll ask the second one

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.440
after you answer the first one.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.650
Just based on the visuals,
I am taking that this

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.620
is more of a dystopian future.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.970
ISE LYFE: Mm-hmm.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.130
AUDIENCE: How has
your interaction

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.456
with Googlers shaped that
perspective of the future?

00:32:31.456 --> 00:32:32.080
ISE LYFE: Whoa.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.850
That's a great question.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.770
It is a dystopia that we
built with hints of like--

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.440
I used to read those "Hardy Boy"
books when I was a kid where

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.530
it's like, you can go this way.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:49.780
And in talking and
being around folks

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.540
that are Googlers and also folks
at some of the other really

00:32:52.540 --> 00:33:00.750
large tech spaces, what I find
is an untold story of people

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.460
who really, really,
really, really, really,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.540
really care about the
future and building things

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.090
in a way that is
provocative and concise.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.730
But I think the big secret is
the love in the room in all

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.980
of it and that people
are being thoughtful,

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.110
not just from
their Googler mind,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.715
but also from
their Google heart.

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:21.720
And that there's heart
in the conversation.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.730
So that that's changed
my perspective.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:29.760
And then I think it also has
revealed an opportunity though

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:37.660
to inform the mind minded
people in the world

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:43.240
and be reminding of the heart
and social aspects of the world

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.970
and humanity.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.670
And I think we
separate that, right?

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:50.470
We think about societal
humanitarian work,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.490
and then we think about
tech business work

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.550
as if they are these
two separate things.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.860
When of course, they must
be entirely integrated.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.111
If you think about the campuses
that train us and teach us,

00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:02.360
there's a divide there, right?

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.860
There's the social work
folks, and then there's

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.179
the tech business folks
as if this isn't really

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.710
a cross-pollinated world.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.630
And so those are the things that
I've taken from the experience.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.170
I appreciate your question.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.929
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious as a playwright

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:24.870
how did you decide
2047, 30 years,

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.420
being really specific about the
future and just saying, yup.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.170
I'm calling it.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.711
This is what it's
going to look like.

00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:32.860
Did you wrestle at all
with, well, I don't know.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.860
It might look like this.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.670
It might not.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.030
How did you decide just to--

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:43.230
ISE LYFE: The co-writer
and I thought through--

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.770
the whole line in
the beginning was

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.290
we don't want to start
dealing with like robots

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.750
walking around on the
streets and flying cars.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.000
And we also wanted to talk
about something that people

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.879
had to be accountable
to whether it's

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.590
you're being accountable
to it because this

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.470
is the world that you will
leave behind for your children

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.990
and grandchildren or you
have to be responsible for it

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.070
because you would be like,
well, I'm going to be here.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.570
We wanted to run that line.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.760
And then it also gives
a great opportunity

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.470
to speculate in some dark ways
but even in some humorous ways.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.570
At a point in the play,
there's a reference

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:28.640
to Attorney General Kardashian.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.070
And that's crazy but
could legit happen.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.030
A Kardashian could run for
office and have a shot.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.420
That's wild, but
that could happen.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.540
And so it was just to
kind of keep it up on us

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.990
and give it something that
people could be accountable to.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.910
It was fun.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.477
Thank you.

00:35:48.477 --> 00:35:49.560
KHALIL KAIN: I don't know.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:55.160
I think if you're 22, 30 years
from now seems like, whoa.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.710
A lot could happen.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.910
But if you're 52,
you realize that

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.850
in 30 years how much changes.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.640
There's not like
this seismic shift.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.280
And in reading the play,
the first time I read it,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.360
I was kind of intrigued.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.640
I was like, this
makes sense to me.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.650
It's not far-fetched,
and it's informed

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.370
by what has come before it.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.400
I know, for me, 30 years ago--

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.230
I'm kind of shocked.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.870
30 years ago where I
thought we would be now,

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:33.240
I'm really sort of shocked
at where we're at in reality.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.750
I had a completely
sort of different feel

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.180
as what we'd be doing
and where we'd be at.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.010
Question.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:41.850
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.280
Can you briefly describe
what type of set

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.649
you have to get
this message across?

00:36:46.649 --> 00:36:47.190
ISE LYFE: Oh.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.420
Cool.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:48.920
Yeah.

00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:54.480
The forefront of the
set and the set design

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.770
is around these projections.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.170
So we built a set
out of projection

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.700
that began on that
yellow pad there.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.020
But it's all projection.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.250
The set is projected.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:07.205
And there's these huge
frames that cover the stage,

00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:08.580
and I don't want
to give it away.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.990
But the frames do cool things.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:18.819
The set is minimal and also
very powerful and impactful,

00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:21.360
particularly with the way the
projection and the sound works.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.920
And one thing we learn in
this process and working

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.470
with the designers is all of
the different elements that

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.850
tell the story-- from the
costumes to the makeup

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.570
to the projections to
when someone said, hey,

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.030
we need a sound designer.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.781
I was like, someone
is designing sound?

00:37:34.781 --> 00:37:35.280
And yeah.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.329
They come in and really
design the sound environment.

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:42.870
And I think people are going to
be really impressed with what

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.040
we've done in this space.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.520
And then also, as Khalil
referenced and Matt touches on

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.940
often, is that you'll
notice that when

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.980
you're in our theater, you
feel like you're in this world.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.792
And it's a really cool thing.

00:37:57.792 --> 00:37:59.250
AUDIENCE: In social
justice reform,

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:05.161
are there any pieces of
technology today [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:07.410
ISE LYFE: The question was--
in social justice reform,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.760
is there any apps or
technology that we find

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.204
to be interesting or useful?

00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:15.870
ELZ CUYA JONES: One
thing that I've seen

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:22.410
is that day laborers
now have an app so

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.380
that when they're getting
picked up for construction work

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.670
or whatever, they can
register the license plate.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.430
And other workers,
they've built a database,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.230
and other workers
will let them know,

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.960
this person actually
pays you and this person

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.420
will leave you out on the
street without getting paid.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.410
Also, of course, with police
brutality, the fact that we all

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.150
have cameras on our phones.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.000
Now there's an ability
to immediately send it

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.700
to the ACLU or your local ACLU.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.800
And what community
organizations are

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.160
doing around the
illegal surveillance.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.240
Since Homeland Security folks
are surveilling Black Lives

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.720
Matter and people who are
doing social justice work,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.100
they're organizing themselves
to train themselves to amp up

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.130
their security because they're
small nonprofit organizations

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.850
with very little resources.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.440
So how do they do their work
and not be illegally watched?

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.440
ISE LYFE: And I've seen
a really great, cool app

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.750
that food justice
workers are using

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.960
that can evaluate the produce
that's in their local grocery

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.610
store and hold accountable
that grocery chains distribute

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.340
fairly and evenly the
quality of produce that

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.900
goes into the grocery stores.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.560
Because one thing that's
happening is certain stores get

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.170
the beat up fruit and
vegetables and other ones don't.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.920
So I appreciate that
question because we've all

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.970
seen the way that that's a
driving force [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.010
Thank you.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.040
ELZ CUYA JONES: I really want
to thank Matt for arranging this

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.320
and of course writing
the piece with Ise.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.220
Thank you, Ise.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.120
Thank you, Khalil.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.650
Thank you, Google.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.710
We'll see you next time.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.900
We'll see you at the
theater tomorrow.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.733
ISE LYFE: Thank you.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.850
[APPLAUSE]
