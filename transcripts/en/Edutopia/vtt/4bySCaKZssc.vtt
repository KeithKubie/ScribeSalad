00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:11.016
&gt;&gt;Student: How do we know there are
tiny things in a drop of pond water,

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:15.066
we can use a microscope
to view the pond water.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:19.886
Imagine you could shrink yourself
and walk into a tiny cell,

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:25.516
what is it like inside a cell,
it's a fantastic journey.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.026
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Fascinating, very close.

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:29.936
Thank you so much.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:31.586
&gt;&gt;Student: It feels
like you're playing

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:33.176
when you're actually learning.

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:35.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Like sometimes,
you could like play a game

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:37.076
and not even know that
you're learning.

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:40.676
&gt;&gt;Student: You're actually
having fun and you realize it,

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.516
and then you realize that you're
learning while you're doing it.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:49.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I have to ask that
question, what hat are the kids going

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.186
to wear in this mission
that they're going to be on?

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.296
And that's part of the
curriculum design process.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:57.866
I think most teachers do
curriculum design with, "Okay,

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.996
what do they need to learn?"

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.976
But at Quest, it's "What
do they need to learn,

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:02.446
how are we going to engage them?

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.296
And what role are the kids
going to be stepping into

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:08.486
and what story are the kids
going to be stepping into?"

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.936
So it's all a part of
creating this narrative.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:14.496
&gt;&gt;HTTP--

00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:15.696
&gt;&gt;Dot colon slash, slash.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.326
That's exactly what's
in front of the website.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:18.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Can I see?

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:19.446
&gt;&gt;Yeah, take it--

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:22.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Are you sure
that's what you see?

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:23.156
&gt;&gt;Yeah, HTTP.

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.476
&gt;&gt;That's the slide.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:25.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's really weird,

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:33.776
I totally thought your specimen
number was going to be a plant cell.

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:34.036
&gt;&gt;Wow.

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:34.796
&gt;&gt;That is ODO.

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:37.106
&gt;&gt;The light switch is bent.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:40.796
&gt;&gt;D-E, that second letter's an E.

00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:40.976
&gt;&gt;An E?

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:44.466
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Greetings, TWTW students.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:46.246
I'm Doctor Smalls.

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.636
I work for Shrinkly Labs.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.996
I am honored to say, you
are invited to compete

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:58.606
in the 2013 Shrinkly Labs
cell city design competition.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:02.806
&gt;&gt;The "Need To Know" is created
by this cast of characters.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.196
There's a teeny little
doctor, named Doctor Smalls,

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:10.116
and he has shrunken himself and put
himself inside of the body of one

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:12.526
of his patients, because
he was trying to find

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.646
out what this mystery disease was.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.186
And in shrinking himself, he lost
all of his medical vocabulary

00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:19.926
and he sends my students
a communique.

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:25.766
So the "Need To Know" has helped get
me out of this body, I'm trapped,

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:27.126
and help cure my patient.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:30.146
So it's actually like
completely ridiculous

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:32.426
and the kids know it's a game.

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:36.436
But it's so fun for them to
become a part of this narrative

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:40.976
that they do get right in and they
do get involved and start figuring

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:43.786
out the clues of, "Well,
where is Doctor Smalls now?

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:46.616
Well, we know he's in this hollow
space," and they start learning

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:50.896
about the body from basically these
clues of his location in the body.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.166
So they know that it's all made up

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.446
and they know it's all just
play, but it's fun for them.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:01.106
It's much more fun than just, you
know, PowerPoint after PowerPoint,

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:01.856
"And now we're going to learn

00:03:01.856 --> 00:03:04.146
about the respiratory
system, boys and girls."

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:05.936
&gt;&gt;Student: I think we play
games at Quest to learn

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:09.946
because it helps us incorporate
learning into having fun.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:12.786
&gt;&gt;Student: You could learn
from a game and be like, "Oh,

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:16.176
that was so fun," and
then like read like a book

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:17.806
and be like, "Oh, that was fun..."

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It leads some
kids to get sidetracked.

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:24.366
"Well, you know, this isn't real," or
"I don't care about Doctor Smalls."

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:29.026
But for ninety-nine percent of the
kids, it's like, they're totally in.
