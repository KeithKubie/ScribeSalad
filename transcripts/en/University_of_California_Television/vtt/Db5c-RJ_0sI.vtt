00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:04.327
(electronic bleeps)

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:14.052
- I'm gonna move right along to Dr. Rubin,

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:17.624
who's gonna talk about Social
and Cultural Determinants

00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:19.671
of Developmental Disabilities.

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:20.504
Dr. Rubin.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:22.514
- [Leslie] Thank you.

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:23.514
Hello again.

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:25.776
I'm back.

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.541
(audience laughing)

00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:28.374
All right.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:31.771
Thanks, Mark.

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:32.604
Mark and I

00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:35.626
have been friends for a long time.

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:38.300
You'll see a lot of overlap because

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.112
we have similar thoughts and approaches.

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:45.876
We shared our slides earlier
(laughing) this year but

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:47.770
couldn't help but

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.190
repeat some of the things.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.769
If you hear it again, it's good.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.034
It means it's important.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:53.951
Okay, good.

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:59.095
Disclaimer, same as Mark's, right?

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.413
Okay.

00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:03.717
What do we mean by the social
determinants of health?

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:04.884
What are they?

00:01:05.847 --> 00:01:08.715
Earlier on there was a
talk about a medical model.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.365
It's a concept that you're well.

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.441
Something happens to you.

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:13.405
You get sick.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.588
You get treated, you get better,

00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:16.284
you carry on with your life.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.018
That sounds like a very simple

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:20.435
kind of Newtonian

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.374
concept.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.423
The concept of social determinants

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.031
makes it so much more complex,

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:29.968
and Mark has given you some sense

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:33.055
of the environmental, the social,

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:33.888
and the

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.830
economic aspects.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.462
What the social determinants are

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:42.829
are those circumstances in which you live,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.329
your environment, your income,

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:49.085
the people around you

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.252
and what you do, how you
do it, with whom you do it.

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.151
Those factors,

00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:57.738
they don't exist in isolation.

00:01:57.738 --> 00:02:00.427
They exist within a larger context.

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:03.782
The larger context is the economic,

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:06.953
political, and social environment.

00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:10.580
We are sitting here in
San Francisco, California,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.689
in the good old US of A,

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.803
but there are many other people

00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:15.880
sitting in different parts of the world,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.501
perhaps talking about the same thing

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.525
under totally different political,

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:23.614
social, and economic circumstances.

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:25.773
Their health may well be affected

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:28.310
by the factors under which they live.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.159
The people here in this
state of California

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.893
who are living under circumstances

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:35.322
that are very different
from those that we live in,

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.044
that will affect their
health and well-being.

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:40.877
Those are the social determinants.

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:45.515
I'm going to tell you a personal story.

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.265
I'm a developmental pediatrician.

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:53.270
I did my medical training in South Africa.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.307
Then I went to Cleveland, Ohio,

00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:57.264
Case Western.

00:02:57.264 --> 00:02:59.506
Then I went to Children's
Hospital, Boston,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:01.247
the Harvard Medical School.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.559
Then I went to Atlanta, Georgia.

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.432
I knew a lot about
children and development

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:08.929
all very well.

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.429
When I landed up in Atlanta, I

00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.309
started a cerebral palsy clinic.

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:17.022
I started a cerebral palsy clinic

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:18.920
in downtown Atlanta.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.493
Downtown Atlanta,

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:24.259
as with many other major
cities in the 1990's,

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.340
80's and 90's,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.173
was really

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:31.126
just a place where they
were very poor people

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:33.866
who just had limited resources

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:36.116
and predominantly minority.

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:39.203
That was the environment in which I lived.

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:40.036
By the way,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:42.158
just over the 20 years
I've been in Atlanta,

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:44.325
the inner city has kind of

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:47.011
emerged like so many other

00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:49.693
cities that have become gentrified.

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:51.798
I will carry on with my story.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.916
This is just a picture within our clinic

00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:57.616
of the orthotist putting on a little brace

00:03:57.616 --> 00:03:59.803
on a little boy and you can see

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:02.956
the context in which
that clinic takes place,

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.895
a little bit of clutter around.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:07.403
It was really very Third World kind of

00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:09.669
clinic at the time.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.645
What happened was

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.525
we had collected data.

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:17.252
We took the CDC's criteria
on cerebral palsy,

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:20.297
and we entered the data
on every child we saw

00:04:20.297 --> 00:04:21.971
from the very beginning.

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.972
By the time we had the
clinic for about four years,

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:27.899
we had a couple of students
from School of Public Health

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.102
who came and reviewed our data.

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.961
They found, as we would have expected,

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:37.158
a complex set of medical and developmental

00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:38.690
complications.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.796
Okay.

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:42.214
I'd hoped to see that
and quantified and so on,

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:45.273
but really what happened was that

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:48.976
we found this set of demographic factors

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:52.239
which I'd totally not anticipated at all.

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:54.811
This set of factors said that

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.330
many of the mothers of the children

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.158
in our cerebral palsy clinic

00:04:59.158 --> 00:05:02.408
had been taking drugs during pregnancy.

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:05.859
Alcohol, tobacco, and

00:05:09.137 --> 00:05:13.056
cocaine was the street drug of the times.

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:13.973
There were many others,

00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:15.890
marijuana and the like.

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:21.024
They were born prematurely.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:24.599
When we surveyed them,

00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:28.577
they were not living
in two-parent families

00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:31.020
as you would have expected.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.546
The breakdown was quite,
quite significant,

00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:34.777
and I'll show you now.

00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:35.694
This is the

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:39.072
rate of prematurity.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:39.989
28 weeks is

00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:42.250
over here,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.472
and it was highly correlated

00:05:44.472 --> 00:05:45.908
with substance abuse.

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.392
The greater the likelihood
of substance abuse,

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:50.784
the greater the likelihood of prematurity.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.787
As they got closer to term,

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:55.747
less likelihood of substance abuse.

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:57.825
The greater likelihood of substance abuse,

00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.924
the greater likelihood of prematurity,

00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:02.963
the greater likelihood of cerebral palsy.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:05.811
Now, where were the children living?

00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.228
50, 60% were living with

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:14.019
single mothers, 60%.

00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:16.204
These are the premature infants.

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:18.578
I'm just going to talk about them in blue.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.411
The premature infants,

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:22.415
60% were living with single mothers.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:25.286
Almost 20% were living with grandparents,

00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:27.807
almost 10% living in foster care,

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:31.974
and only about 17% living
with both biological parents.

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:35.755
For me this was

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:38.501
a really dramatic turning point because

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.147
I had not appreciated the fact that

00:06:41.147 --> 00:06:43.267
these kinds of circumstances,

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:46.272
the social and economic
circumstances of poverty

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.456
that lead to substance abuse,

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:50.535
that lead to prematurity,

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.535
that lead to

00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:56.400
a family constellation that is
predominantly single mothers

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.483
or outside of the family,

00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:01.039
the traditional mother-father,

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.690
biological mother-father
family with grandparents

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.190
or in foster care.

00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:08.487
There was a remarkable paper.

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:09.404
It came out

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:12.639
just under a year ago, in April,

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.323
about child poverty,

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:15.958
Mediators of Child Poverty.

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.713
I strongly recommend it.

00:07:17.713 --> 00:07:20.393
I'm going to walk through some
of the statistics with you.

00:07:20.393 --> 00:07:23.144
They looked at child
poverty and found that

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.528
if you looked at poverty,

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:28.695
it was predominantly associated
with minority children,

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:34.287
that the

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.120
families

00:07:35.982 --> 00:07:37.315
tended to have a

00:07:39.273 --> 00:07:40.908
poorer education.

00:07:40.908 --> 00:07:42.797
If they had some college education,

00:07:42.797 --> 00:07:44.649
only 13% were poor.

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:46.483
If they had less than high school,

00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:49.066
then almost 60% were poor.

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:51.243
Employment.

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:52.990
If one parent worked full-time,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.622
only 9% were poor.

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:56.640
If no parents worked full-time,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.272
almost 50% were poor.

00:07:59.272 --> 00:08:00.885
What do we see as a result

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.718
of poor, less educated

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:04.742
mothers?

00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:07.099
This is from the CDC and

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:11.499
their Developmental Disabilities
Surveillance Project.

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:13.531
They correlated with age.

00:08:13.531 --> 00:08:14.715
These are the ages underneath,

00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:17.825
but the age was not
important to this purpose.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.011
It's the degree of

00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:22.571
the number of children with disabilities.

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:25.186
Percentage of children
with cognitive impairment

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:26.901
by mother's education.

00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:30.568
The darker one is that
mothers had less than

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.698
a B.A., and the

00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:37.159
lightly shaded one had a B.A. or higher.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.290
The lightly shaded ones
were more educated.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.166
As you can see, at every age level

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:44.367
mothers who had better education

00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:47.317
had less kids with cognitive disabilities.

00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:49.083
Mothers who had less education

00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.908
had more children with cognitive ability.

00:08:51.908 --> 00:08:56.153
It's not just the result
of some cognitive ability,

00:08:56.153 --> 00:08:57.311
the consequence on the mother,

00:08:57.311 --> 00:08:59.700
but the consequence on the children.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.744
Here's some more issues of disparities.

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.514
Absence of the fathers in the home

00:09:05.514 --> 00:09:09.377
is associated with a
fourfold risk for poverty.

00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:12.950
42% of single female-headed
families are poor

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.724
versus 12% of two-parent headed families.

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:19.396
You can see where my
demographic's coming in,

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:20.725
and here's another one.

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.084
Children of single mothers

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.529
are at greater risk for infant mortality.

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:25.679
They will die.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:29.028
Child maltreatment, child abuse,

00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:31.571
failure to graduate from high school,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.071
and incarceration.

00:09:36.273 --> 00:09:37.775
I won't even go into incarceration.

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.401
It is really quite a shameful

00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.490
part of our culture

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.950
but I will show you this,
which is also shameful.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.469
This is disparities in mortality,

00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:50.291
and this is the US of A.

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.291
This is infant mortality

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:55.054
by one year, the number of death

00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:56.534
per thousand live births one year.

00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:57.367
Bless you.

00:09:57.367 --> 00:09:58.926
Okay.

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:01.767
For wealthy mothers it's
about just over two.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.165
If you look at the whole world,

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.230
the statistics of the whole world,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.587
around two or just under
two is what you see in Japan

00:10:08.587 --> 00:10:10.173
and in Scandinavia.

00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:11.996
It's the best statistic.

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:14.329
The statistics for the US as a whole

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:16.755
is about six, which is pretty poor.

00:10:16.755 --> 00:10:18.051
It's somewhere around

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.750
the 30th or 40th in the world,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.188
but if you look at the kids who are poor

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:25.188
or disadvantaged mothers,

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:27.297
they're up there

00:10:27.297 --> 00:10:28.505
and really

00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:31.998
in some of the poorer
countries of the world.

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:34.396
We have this shameful situation

00:10:34.396 --> 00:10:38.396
of health disparities,
of mortality disparities.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.923
Also, the poorer kids tend to live in

00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:45.232
a concept called the built.

00:10:45.232 --> 00:10:47.807
We all live in built
environment, by the way.

00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:49.281
The built environment

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.939
is the environment we live in like this.

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:55.852
This auditorium is part
of our built environment.

00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.361
The street where you walked to come here,

00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:00.450
the environment of this university campus,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.663
all part of the built environment.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.622
Built environments are
different for different people.

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:09.466
If you look at the built
environments of poorer communities,

00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:12.067
then they're unsafe neighborhoods

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:15.068
because of traffic, crime, litter, trash,

00:11:15.068 --> 00:11:18.162
food desert, and limited green space.

00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:19.555
Because of all these issues,

00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:21.303
the kids can't go out and play

00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:23.520
or can't be safe in going out and playing.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.270
They could be attacked, assaulted

00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:28.681
and killed,

00:11:30.003 --> 00:11:31.453
and they can't even exercise

00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:34.256
so they stay home and watch TV and eat

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:37.327
fast foods because they don't have

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:40.457
Whole Foods or any of
these fancy grocery stores

00:11:40.457 --> 00:11:42.790
you have down the road here.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.942
They also live in older
houses with poor condition,

00:11:46.942 --> 00:11:48.910
and there's three and a
half times more likely

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.532
to have lead toxicity.

00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:54.379
Mark spoke to you about
lead toxicity a moment ago.

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:58.334
It's associated with
intellectual impairment.

00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:01.887
They go to older schools
in poor physical condition

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:06.054
with teachers that are
underpaid, underappreciated, and

00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.891
really not doing all that good a job

00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:16.877
because of a variety
of other circumstances.

00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:18.184
For poorer kids,

00:12:18.184 --> 00:12:22.149
they're 50% less likely to
graduate from high school

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:25.150
and twice more likely to be unemployed.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.430
You've got poor graduation, unemployment,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.597
and you've got

00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:32.047
lead and you got obesity

00:12:32.047 --> 00:12:33.655
and you got all these kinds of things.

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:34.649
What's happening?

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:36.187
This is a study,

00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:40.197
a report in Pediatrics 2003 by David Wood,

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:43.364
who was also an author in that poverty

00:12:44.382 --> 00:12:45.361
chapter,

00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:47.745
poverty paper I was telling
you about from last year.

00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:50.903
David's now at East
Tennessee State University.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:54.202
He's done a lot of work on poverty and

00:12:54.202 --> 00:12:55.342
this was what he showed,

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:58.935
that if you look at the kids in...

00:12:58.935 --> 00:13:00.666
I'm getting a stiff neck here.

00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:01.565
Better on this side.

00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:03.341
All right, if you look at the kids who

00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:05.379
are poorer versus those
who are not poorer,

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:06.929
you'll see

00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:11.096
they're more likely to have
developmental disability,

00:13:14.972 --> 00:13:18.305
twice as likely to have grade retention.

00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:22.791
Is it right?

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:23.770
I've gotta come up here.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.769
Okay, good.

00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:25.602
This is better.

00:13:25.602 --> 00:13:27.515
I was looking at it strangely.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.348
All right.

00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:31.411
There's more likely to
have developmental delay,

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:34.000
more likely to have learning disabilities,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.417
twice as likely to be retained in school,

00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:43.202
twice as likely to be
expelled or suspended,

00:13:43.202 --> 00:13:47.167
more than twice as likely to drop out, and

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:49.187
twice as likely to be unemployed.

00:13:49.187 --> 00:13:51.213
There's all the statistics for you.

00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:52.756
These are poor kids

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:55.040
that are landing up in poor schools

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.873
that are

00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:58.002
in disrepair

00:13:58.002 --> 00:14:00.032
and all sorts of bad things.

00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:01.229
Smoking prevalence.

00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:02.440
Let me just talk about smoking

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.480
and I think, Mark, you spoke about,

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.374
no, you didn't.

00:14:05.374 --> 00:14:07.144
Okay, I'll talk about smoking.

00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:09.455
Okay, smoking's not good for your health.

00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:12.729
(audience laughing)

00:14:12.729 --> 00:14:13.562
Yet,

00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:19.386
5.6% of people with
graduate degrees will smoke,

00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.569
9% of those with a college education

00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:27.640
that's not a graduate degree and

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.113
24% who do not graduate from high school.

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:32.030
Unemployed,

00:14:33.148 --> 00:14:34.500
didn't graduate,

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.897
smoking.

00:14:35.897 --> 00:14:40.198
Already Mark was referring
to cumulative factors.

00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:42.119
Let's move on.

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:44.134
This is one of my favorite slides

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.256
because of the message in it.

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:47.783
The mother who smokes

00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:51.141
has a problem herself with her lungs

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:54.508
and other organs, including the brain.

00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:57.665
The fetus gets affected, and we know that

00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:01.776
fetuses exposed to smoking
in utero are smaller.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.342
They have smaller head circumference

00:15:04.342 --> 00:15:08.667
and they don't function
as well cognitively

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:11.417
as their peers when compared, but

00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:15.078
what I didn't realize was that

00:15:15.078 --> 00:15:17.191
the toxins of the cigarettes

00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:18.775
get not just to the fetus

00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:21.525
but the fetus reproductive cells.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960
What happens

00:15:29.608 --> 00:15:30.441
is that

00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:36.806
longterm effects of the
offspring of mothers who smoke

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:39.581
have other diseases such as hypertension,

00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.048
type 2 diabetes, respiratory dysfunction,

00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:44.381
neurobehavioral defects, and

00:15:45.253 --> 00:15:46.836
impaired fertility.

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:50.073
The toxin doesn't just affect the mother.

00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:52.540
It affects the fetus not just in the

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.255
size of the fetus and the
neurological development,

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.449
which I'd known for a long time,

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:01.021
but by these other diseases

00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:03.939
and by impaired fertility.

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:07.616
If we look at the concept
of cumulative stress

00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:10.261
or cumulative problems that affect,

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.109
can you make it just a
little bit darker please

00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:15.873
so that you can see the picture clearer?

00:16:15.873 --> 00:16:16.706
All right.

00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:19.476
Can you see it?

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:20.309
(audience responding)

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:21.588
All right.

00:16:21.588 --> 00:16:23.416
Okay, poverty.

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:24.867
We spoke about lead

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:28.142
and Mark spoke about other toxins,

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:30.392
greater degree of exposure,

00:16:31.474 --> 00:16:33.317
air pollutants and so on.

00:16:33.317 --> 00:16:35.944
Exposure to tobacco
smoke, greater likelihood.

00:16:35.944 --> 00:16:37.749
Unsafe neighborhoods.

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:39.663
Stressed single mother.

00:16:39.663 --> 00:16:42.039
Experiencing violence in the area,

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.976
child abuse and other violence.

00:16:43.976 --> 00:16:45.809
Insecurity and anxiety

00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:49.432
and limited access to health care,

00:16:49.432 --> 00:16:51.153
because in the poorer areas

00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:53.435
you're not going to get the same access

00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:54.643
as good health care.

00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:56.923
You don't have the same kind of insurance.

00:16:56.923 --> 00:17:00.640
Your insurance is what
the state gives you,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.107
and you're lucky if you get
some good services on that.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:07.446
I don't know what it's like
in California but in Georgia,

00:17:07.446 --> 00:17:10.371
it's really tough and we have
to work with what we had.

00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:14.538
I spoke to you about early
intervention earlier on.

00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:17.451
That is our safety net.

00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:18.404
The early intervention,

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.969
the state programs are our safety net.

00:17:20.969 --> 00:17:22.131
The early intervention programs

00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:24.860
and the public schools are our safety net.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.266
The public schools are where
the kids get their lunches,

00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:28.851
where the kids get their therapies,

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:32.377
where the kids get their
education regardless.

00:17:32.377 --> 00:17:36.058
Okay, I'm going to refer
you to a Pediatrics article

00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:38.037
in January of 2012

00:17:38.037 --> 00:17:40.940
called The Lifelong Effects
of Early Childhood Adversity

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.449
and Toxic Stress.

00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:44.782
Toxic stress is a phenomenon

00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:47.784
where children experience

00:17:47.784 --> 00:17:50.743
strong, frequent, or prolonged activation

00:17:50.743 --> 00:17:52.920
of the body's stress response system.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.753
All their insecurity, child abuse,

00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:58.625
moving,

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:01.132
fear of

00:18:02.417 --> 00:18:03.667
getting injured

00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:06.713
without the buffering protection

00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:08.798
of a supportive, adult relationship.

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:10.533
Mark spoke about resilience

00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:13.558
and one of the most powerful,

00:18:13.558 --> 00:18:15.915
positive forces in a child's life

00:18:15.915 --> 00:18:19.165
is a strong, caring, protective parent.

00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:21.441
That's the bottom line.

00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:24.140
Whatever the stresses,
whatever stresses might occur,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.645
if there is a strong,
supportive, consistent,

00:18:27.645 --> 00:18:29.945
caring adult presence,

00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:33.322
that child will do so much better.

00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:36.739
If there is not that buffering protection

00:18:37.747 --> 00:18:39.783
of that adult relationship,

00:18:39.783 --> 00:18:42.635
that child will suffer with

00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:46.251
persistently elevated
levels of stress hormones,

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.120
Mark spoke about that as well,

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.718
which can disrupt developing
brain architecture.

00:18:51.718 --> 00:18:53.064
We had not realized

00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:56.486
that it can actively
disrupt brain architecture

00:18:56.486 --> 00:19:00.319
and result in this
collection of consequences.

00:19:03.034 --> 00:19:05.744
Problems with learning,
memory, and executive function,

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.533
impaired decision making,

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:10.689
behavioral self-regulation disorders,

00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:13.940
impulse control, and
risk-taking behaviors.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.107
What happens if you don't,

00:19:16.998 --> 00:19:18.307
if you can't learn as well,

00:19:18.307 --> 00:19:19.775
you take risks,

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:22.242
you have impulses and all
these kinds of things?

00:19:22.242 --> 00:19:26.654
This is the collection
of longterm outcomes.

00:19:26.654 --> 00:19:29.622
School failure, unemployment,
single parent-ness,

00:19:29.622 --> 00:19:32.513
homelessness, substance
abuse, gang membership,

00:19:32.513 --> 00:19:36.095
violent crime, incarceration, and poverty.

00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:38.591
The USA has the highest incarceration rate

00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:40.159
in the whole world.

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:43.492
It is 700 people per 100,000 population.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:46.822
The next country,

00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:48.846
good old friend of the USA,

00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:50.050
Russia.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.050
(audience laughing)

00:19:53.969 --> 00:19:55.761
- [Attendee] We're number one!

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:56.836
- Number one! (laughing)

00:19:56.836 --> 00:19:59.919
(audience laughing)

00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:04.318
In Russia, it's 400 per 100,000.

00:20:06.387 --> 00:20:10.220
In Europe, it's in the
two digits per 100,000.

00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:14.079
That's the story.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:15.806
In addition,

00:20:15.806 --> 00:20:19.554
the chronic stress has steroid hormones

00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:22.963
and these disrupt not just
the brain architecture

00:20:22.963 --> 00:20:25.907
but the whole neurohumoral mechanism

00:20:25.907 --> 00:20:29.088
resulting in obesity,
diabetes, hypertension,

00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:31.088
stroke, and early death.

00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:34.324
I created this

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:38.169
kind of image because

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.930
when I first realized

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:46.587
those social determinants of poverty

00:20:46.587 --> 00:20:48.254
and substance abuse,

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:51.033
I created this cycle.

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:53.667
It's called the cycle of
disadvantage, which is

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:57.331
social and economic, and disability.

00:20:57.331 --> 00:20:59.082
Poverty, poor community support,

00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:02.578
poor health services,
poor education result in

00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:05.499
feelings of despair and
self-worth in the teenagers.

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:08.175
What happens is these kids
have a poor education.

00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:10.174
They don't have much of a future.

00:21:10.174 --> 00:21:11.730
They can't see.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.046
When you were young, when
I was young, I would think,

00:21:14.046 --> 00:21:15.140
"I want to be a doctor.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.916
"I want to be something."

00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:17.873
You have role models.

00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:18.948
You have parents who support you.

00:21:18.948 --> 00:21:19.962
These kids don't,

00:21:19.962 --> 00:21:20.938
so they get then

00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:22.820
what are they gonna do in their lives?

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.540
The only thing to make them feel better

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.972
is self-medication.

00:21:25.972 --> 00:21:27.953
It's self-medication.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.025
They take drugs and sex,

00:21:30.025 --> 00:21:31.912
sex and drugs and

00:21:31.912 --> 00:21:33.322
rock and roll, right.

00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:35.221
(audience laughing)

00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:36.054
All right.

00:21:36.054 --> 00:21:38.080
What happens is they get pregnancy.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.748
They get pregnant

00:21:39.748 --> 00:21:41.926
and they don't take care of themselves

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.521
and they're taking all these drugs,

00:21:43.521 --> 00:21:46.901
risks of sexually transmitted
diseases like HIV.

00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.537
The babies are born prematurely,

00:21:48.537 --> 00:21:51.336
low birth weight, fetal alcohol syndrome.

00:21:51.336 --> 00:21:52.503
The babies are

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:56.513
irritable, have medical
needs, developmental needs.

00:21:56.513 --> 00:22:00.680
These mothers are still these
young women who still have

00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:04.900
lack of supports in substance
abuse and increased demands.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.158
These kids land up with neglect and abuse,

00:22:08.158 --> 00:22:10.096
foster care placement,

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:13.058
neurodevelopmental disabilities, and

00:22:13.058 --> 00:22:14.438
health concerns

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:16.035
and you have the cycle.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:18.058
That's the depressing part.

00:22:18.058 --> 00:22:19.391
The question is,

00:22:21.561 --> 00:22:23.644
can we make a difference?

00:22:24.728 --> 00:22:25.561
- [Audience Member] Yes.

00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:26.440
- Okay, good.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.451
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:29.667
(audience laughing)

00:22:29.667 --> 00:22:30.500
All righty.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.806
We can make a difference.

00:22:31.806 --> 00:22:33.466
We can make a wonderful difference.

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:36.191
All right, now I'm gonna
just end off by showing you

00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:40.889
just some examples of the
difference we can make.

00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:43.942
There's a big difference we can make.

00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:45.447
This is a rat mother

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.496
who loves her rat pup.

00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:49.642
(audience laughing)

00:22:49.642 --> 00:22:52.081
She's a mammal, and she
will feed her little pups

00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:53.975
and she will look after
them until they can

00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:55.642
fend for themselves.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.693
Okay.

00:23:01.653 --> 00:23:05.138
This is research that comes
out of McGill University

00:23:05.138 --> 00:23:07.550
where they found that they

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.417
could create these two strains of rats,

00:23:10.417 --> 00:23:13.610
one where the mother rats
fed their little rats

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.162
and they landed up having
low cortisol levels

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:18.277
with low anxiety.

00:23:18.277 --> 00:23:21.382
When they grew up, they in turn

00:23:21.382 --> 00:23:23.454
licked and groomed their offspring.

00:23:23.454 --> 00:23:24.702
Licking and grooming.

00:23:24.702 --> 00:23:25.833
That's what the mother does.

00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:27.478
She licks them, she grooms them.

00:23:27.478 --> 00:23:28.968
They feel the sensory stuff.

00:23:28.968 --> 00:23:30.886
She feeds them, she looks after them,

00:23:30.886 --> 00:23:33.562
and they in turn become good mothers.

00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:35.570
Just the licking and grooming, by the way,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.565
I had always thought
it was just the sensory

00:23:37.565 --> 00:23:42.134
but it's turning out there
may be some microbiomic

00:23:42.134 --> 00:23:44.195
phenomenon going on there as well.

00:23:44.195 --> 00:23:47.097
That's just emerging as we speak.

00:23:47.097 --> 00:23:50.447
On the other hand, these rat mothers

00:23:50.447 --> 00:23:52.907
don't have that same instinct to

00:23:52.907 --> 00:23:54.569
lick and groom their offspring,

00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:56.233
so these guys are neglected

00:23:56.233 --> 00:23:58.853
and they land up with
high cortisol levels,

00:23:58.853 --> 00:24:01.250
high anxiety, and they

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.561
don't lick and groom their offspring.

00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.250
You would think this is a genetic thing,

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.158
so what are you going to do about it?

00:24:07.158 --> 00:24:09.035
What these guys did, the researchers did,

00:24:09.035 --> 00:24:10.747
they took these little pups

00:24:10.747 --> 00:24:13.144
and they gave those
little pups to this mother

00:24:13.144 --> 00:24:15.437
and she licked and
groomed those little pups,

00:24:15.437 --> 00:24:16.937
and what happened?

00:24:19.123 --> 00:24:20.831
They went on to lick and groom.

00:24:20.831 --> 00:24:22.459
(audience laughing)

00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:24.581
Our message is that

00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:25.587
to mothers,

00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:27.679
lick and groom your babies (laughing).

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:30.679
(audience laughing)

00:24:33.696 --> 00:24:36.890
All righty, so that's the babies.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.725
This was an article in Pediatrics,

00:24:38.725 --> 00:24:40.119
April of last year.

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:42.260
Man, April of last year
was a good year for

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.043
good articles for me.

00:24:44.043 --> 00:24:47.951
Maybe it's the only journal
I read last year, but anyway.

00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:51.655
Anyway, this is a group who took...

00:24:51.655 --> 00:24:53.262
I like the language they used.

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.497
They used low-resource

00:24:55.497 --> 00:24:57.215
and high-resource family

00:24:57.215 --> 00:24:58.798
instead of poverty and wealth

00:24:58.798 --> 00:25:00.446
or affluence and poverty

00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:02.086
or any other markers.

00:25:02.086 --> 00:25:04.726
They just used low-resource
and high-resource.

00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:07.094
I think we heard that earlier today,

00:25:07.094 --> 00:25:10.536
low-resource countries,
high-resource countries and so on.

00:25:10.536 --> 00:25:12.214
What they did was

00:25:12.214 --> 00:25:14.732
they had a group who were control

00:25:14.732 --> 00:25:16.916
where they did not give
early intervention.

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:20.371
These were kids who had some problems

00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:22.204
in the newborn period.

00:25:23.169 --> 00:25:25.490
They gave others early intervention,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.051
which is the dotted line.

00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:28.933
For the high-resource families,

00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:31.017
you follow, these are the guys who did not

00:25:31.017 --> 00:25:34.576
get early intervention in
high-resource families.

00:25:34.576 --> 00:25:37.526
That's where they landed up.

00:25:37.526 --> 00:25:39.592
For the intervention group,

00:25:39.592 --> 00:25:41.752
they landed up actually
doing a little better

00:25:41.752 --> 00:25:44.018
than their counterparts who did not

00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:46.822
have any intervention in
the high-resource group.

00:25:46.822 --> 00:25:49.735
You can see the difference is minimal.

00:25:49.735 --> 00:25:51.733
For the low-resource families,

00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:53.972
this is the trajectory for the ones

00:25:53.972 --> 00:25:55.755
who did not have intervention

00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:57.828
and this is the trajectory for the ones

00:25:57.828 --> 00:26:00.218
who did have intervention which landed up

00:26:00.218 --> 00:26:03.968
in just where the
high-resource families are.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.424
Okay, they didn't lick
and groom their offspring

00:26:07.424 --> 00:26:09.273
but if you give them early intervention,

00:26:09.273 --> 00:26:10.687
what is early intervention?

00:26:10.687 --> 00:26:14.352
Stimulation, interaction, engagement,

00:26:14.352 --> 00:26:15.395
something,

00:26:15.395 --> 00:26:17.049
the positive support

00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:18.671
that will encourage them.

00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:21.398
It comes back to Mark's
point about resilience

00:26:21.398 --> 00:26:22.587
with that balance.

00:26:22.587 --> 00:26:24.722
This is where you have
the positive impact.

00:26:24.722 --> 00:26:26.230
We can have it in the newborn period.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.467
We can have it early intervention.

00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:30.777
This is the one Mark was
talking about as well

00:26:30.777 --> 00:26:32.739
which is the Perry Preschool Program.

00:26:32.739 --> 00:26:34.806
This was a program.

00:26:34.806 --> 00:26:37.002
Was it 50's or 60's?

00:26:37.002 --> 00:26:38.201
Somewhere around there

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:40.589
where this group of kids,

00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:41.836
poor kids,

00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:44.293
was it in Nashville or somewhere, Mark?

00:26:44.293 --> 00:26:45.355
- [Mark] I don't know where Perry is.

00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:46.238
- Yeah, I think it was--

00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:47.904
- [Mark] Illinois, I think.
- Illinois.

00:26:47.904 --> 00:26:48.737
All righty, Illinois.

00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:49.735
One of those states.

00:26:49.735 --> 00:26:51.344
(audience laughing)

00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:52.348
I'm a foreigner.

00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:53.886
What do I know?

00:26:53.886 --> 00:26:54.719
Anyway,

00:26:56.757 --> 00:26:57.590
they took

00:26:59.154 --> 00:27:01.071
little kids, age three,

00:27:02.394 --> 00:27:04.185
three to five.

00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:06.991
These are poor children with a low IQ.

00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.516
What they did was they gave
them two and a half hours

00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:12.243
of preschool program every day of the week

00:27:12.243 --> 00:27:13.516
during the school year

00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:15.118
and they supplemented it

00:27:15.118 --> 00:27:18.451
with weekly home visits by the teachers.

00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:23.808
They followed them up at
15, 19, 27, and 40 years.

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.867
That's a longterm follow-up for you.

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:29.688
What they found was the following.

00:27:29.688 --> 00:27:30.521
All right.

00:27:30.521 --> 00:27:33.923
The intervention is
the darkly shaded area,

00:27:33.923 --> 00:27:36.921
and the control is the
lightly shaded area.

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:39.417
Here's special education, and you can see

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:42.071
that the kids who did not have the benefit

00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:43.992
needed more special education.

00:27:43.992 --> 00:27:45.604
The kids who did have the benefit,

00:27:45.604 --> 00:27:48.131
less special education.

00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:49.721
For those who scored

00:27:49.721 --> 00:27:52.658
above the 10th percentile academically,

00:27:52.658 --> 00:27:55.028
you found many, many more

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:57.123
of the kids who had intervention

00:27:57.123 --> 00:27:59.404
than the kids who didn't
have intervention.

00:27:59.404 --> 00:28:00.837
High school graduation,

00:28:00.837 --> 00:28:02.705
more of the kids who had intervention

00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:04.443
than didn't have intervention.

00:28:04.443 --> 00:28:06.781
Earning more than $2,000 a month,

00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:09.575
much more of the intervention versus

00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:11.241
the non-intervention.

00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:12.824
Own their own home,

00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:15.779
much more with intervention

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:17.812
than not intervention.

00:28:17.812 --> 00:28:19.662
Never on welfare as an adult,

00:28:19.662 --> 00:28:21.783
much more on the intervention.

00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:23.658
You can see that intervention

00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:25.561
at two and three years of age

00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:27.193
also made a difference.

00:28:27.193 --> 00:28:30.275
Another group that I didn't

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.670
display here because of the lack of time

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.047
was a group of,

00:28:34.047 --> 00:28:35.927
I think, a couple of million kids

00:28:35.927 --> 00:28:37.882
in the New England area.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.215
Researchers from

00:28:40.182 --> 00:28:42.467
Columbia University and Harvard University

00:28:42.467 --> 00:28:43.664
studied the impact

00:28:43.664 --> 00:28:46.191
of a teacher in fourth grade.

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.793
If there was a teacher in fourth grade

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:48.993
that made a big difference,

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:51.910
it was called a high-value teacher.

00:28:53.115 --> 00:28:55.282
Those kids also went on to

00:28:56.336 --> 00:28:57.654
get to these levels

00:28:57.654 --> 00:28:58.765
and what's more,

00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:01.073
they saved money for the future.

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:02.706
Saving money for the future

00:29:02.706 --> 00:29:05.497
is looking into the future.

00:29:05.497 --> 00:29:07.087
The future is the children,

00:29:07.087 --> 00:29:09.539
so their children will benefit.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.919
Not only do they benefit individually,

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.980
but their children will benefit.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.912
They have a home.

00:29:14.912 --> 00:29:16.015
They earn more money.

00:29:16.015 --> 00:29:17.927
They can look after their kids better,

00:29:17.927 --> 00:29:20.615
and their kids will do better.

00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:21.532
In summary,

00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:24.589
infants and children who grow up

00:29:24.589 --> 00:29:27.829
under adverse social and
economic circumstances

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:31.957
have greater likelihood of
neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:29:31.957 --> 00:29:33.176
In addition,

00:29:33.176 --> 00:29:36.758
there's limited access
to appropriate education

00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:39.799
and health care that compound the problem.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:43.363
It is our responsibility to
identify at-risk children

00:29:43.363 --> 00:29:44.932
as early as possible

00:29:44.932 --> 00:29:47.269
and provide appropriate and intensive

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:49.769
early support and intervention

00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:54.251
to assure good access to good educational

00:29:56.517 --> 00:29:59.362
opportunities and quality
health care in life.

00:29:59.362 --> 00:30:01.695
My conclusion is as follows.

00:30:02.683 --> 00:30:04.579
Although these issues are

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:08.079
issues of public health and public policy,

00:30:09.748 --> 00:30:12.812
each of us individually
has a responsibility

00:30:12.812 --> 00:30:14.379
to improve the lives of the children

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.423
and families we come into contact with

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:19.686
or those within our environment.

00:30:19.686 --> 00:30:22.188
This is the message I
want to leave with you

00:30:22.188 --> 00:30:24.375
is that if we can make a difference

00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:26.714
in the life of a single child,

00:30:26.714 --> 00:30:29.534
that child can go on to make a difference

00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:30.714
in the whole world.

00:30:30.714 --> 00:30:32.438
This is a saying that if you

00:30:32.438 --> 00:30:33.947
save the life of a single child,

00:30:33.947 --> 00:30:36.909
it is as if you are
saving the whole world.

00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:37.913
All righty.

00:30:37.913 --> 00:30:38.798
Thank you.

00:30:38.798 --> 00:30:41.965
(audience applauding)
