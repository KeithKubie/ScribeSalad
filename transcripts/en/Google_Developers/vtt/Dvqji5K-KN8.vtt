&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm here today at Google IO with Mike
from E! Entertainment. Mike, you want to introduce

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.110
yourself and tell us a little bit about E!
Entertainment and what you've done or built

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.020
for Android.
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Sure. I'm Mike Waghalter. I'm

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.050
director of business development and digital
media for E! And E! is the world's largest

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.080
provider of entertainment information and
content through our cable network, which is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.679
available in over 95 million homes in the
U.S. And we pride great programming, like

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.179
E! News, topical entertainment content as
well as reality shows like Girls Next Door

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:50.469
and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kendra,
our new show, which is premiering June 7th,

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.269
and, you know, we also have great shows like
The Soup and Chelsea Lately, more comedy shows,

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.829
topical comedy shows. We also have a 24/7
source for entertainment news and content

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.020
online, eonline at eonline.com. And for Android,
we've basically taken our Web property, eonline,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.030
and taken all the great content, the rich
media content, everything from video clips

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.520
from our shows to original topical video content
property, hyper plug-in news now, which is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.910
really a 24/7, everything entertainment news
as it's happening. We produce professional

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.460
video segments about each story as it happens
throughout the day, tapping into the resources

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.500
of E! News to do so. So, we have all that
great content and including hundreds and hundreds

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.310
of the latest photos of your favorite celebrities
as well as the team move, an editorial team

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.710
that's writing, covering the world of entertainment
in Hollywood, writing stories throughout the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.100
day and updating to the site. We've taken
all that great content and made it into a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.280
mobile application for Android that takes
into account the unique and mobile environment,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.920
the smaller form factor, but also the fact
that it's always on your device so making

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.140
sure that as we're updating your real time
on our site, those updates are reflected on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.920
the mobile application as well.
&gt;&gt; So can you tell us maybe what led you to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.560
build something for Android, at particular,
the technical aspects of it, user interface

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.740
features?
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Sure. Actually, I can tell you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.450
we've been into the mobile space since 2002,
starting with a mobile WAP site or a mobile

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.810
web now, and one of the reasons, I think,
that we so readily embraced Android was because

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.380
of its ability to handle both the slick user
interface and the interaction so intuitive

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.080
for a user. I mean, it's really designed for
anyone, from a 7-year-old to 7-year-old can

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.600
easily figure it out without looking through
a complex manual, which really hindered a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.900
lot of application development and just any
kind of presentation of rich media on mobile

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.270
devices in the past. That was one of the first
things we liked about Android. We want, you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.160
know, we're very brand conscious today, so
we want to make sure that anything we put

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.340
the E! brand on represents the brand well,
and is slick and flashy. Obviously, the world

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.660
of entertainment in Hollywood is very flashy.
So we really wanted to put something together

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.900
that, for example, showed a high res full
screen photos that we have, you know, that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.280
has a very slick loading, fast loading video
player, which we have with our Android app,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.760
free online. And then the second big factor
was because it's an open source platform,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.040
really the growth potential of the platform
is limitless, and we're already seeing multiple

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.470
OEMs embracing it, building handsets. I think
we're going to see multiple U.S. carriers.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.270
It started to ring out on T-Mobile. I suspect--without
having any kind of inside information--I suspect

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.690
we're going to see more carriers embrace it
as well. So I think it provides a great opportunity

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.069
for us to get increased distribution for our
content and our brand.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:17.569
&gt;&gt; That's great.
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Yeah.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.419
&gt;&gt; Are there any particular features of the
platform? Because it's an open platform, because

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.230
you can maybe access in the line of hardware,
are there things you can do on Android that

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.310
you might not be able to do on other similar
mobile devices?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.850
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Sure. I mean, one of the things
that really makes the mobile environment from

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.240
the typical PC environment is that your connection
speed can vary depending on your location,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.900
depending on the number of other mobile customers
that are hitting a particular local tower

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.810
that, you know--so we want to be able to build
an app that can monitor network conditions,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.250
and particularly for video, for serving rich
media like video, be able to serve the cleanest

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.410
video possible based on both network availability
and the particular method of access at the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:11.100
moment. So whether or not you're using your
Android handset via WiFi, via 3G or 2.5G,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.900
we can serve up a different video that's a
seamless experience to the end user, but that

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.720
has the highest quality that the network allows
at that moment.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.790
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's great.
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Yeah.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.400
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for coming out and talking
to us.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.699
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Okay. Thanks for having us.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:24.960
&gt;&gt; WAGHALTER: Okay, thanks.
