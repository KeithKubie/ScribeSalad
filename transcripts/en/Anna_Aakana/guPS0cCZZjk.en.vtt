00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.150
So, this happened

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.030
[Classical music plays]

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.980
Well yeah, but no like show- show earlier

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Past Anna: [Sigh] I'm so horny

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.120
No after that nobody needs to see that Past Anna: Yo you want to fuck, homie?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.220
I mean in so many words, but that wasn't exactly how -- who the fuck is running these cutaways?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.309
Yeah
So basically I texted a co-worker that I know and asked him if you want to come over and have meaningless sex one time

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.440
So we did and of course the next morning.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.050
Matthew: It was great to see you.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.460
Anna: Yeah, thanks so much for having me or coming over, uh, the sex you get it. You get it.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.560
Matthew: Well, you're welcome. I'll see you soon.

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:38.459
Anna: See you soon. Bye.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.760
Anna:Now that I've obtained his dick

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.219
I must obtain his heart because of course I

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.360
Can't just have a one-night stand without my emotions and heart and head getting all confused

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.710
no, that would just make life way too easy, right? So I did what I do best

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.879
I was mega extra. Hey, want to hang? What are you doing? What are your thoughts about aliens? I felt like a total idiot

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.839
I mean here I was telling this guy I could be casual and do this thing one time

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
And it would be all fine, and then just immediately turning around and giving him the exact opposite signal

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460
I think the good news is even when you're a hypocrite as long as you're communicative, you're probably okay

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520
Matthew: I'm confused.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.839
Anna: I totally understand. I'm so sorry

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.589
Anna: It's just I'm used to being in a relationship and heavily relying on an emotional connection

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
Anna: ...and you're such a great person that when we got physically intimate I got really confused and thought you're the person I'm supposed to be with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.340
Anna: Now but I got all my feelings orders that we're good to go

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.740
Matthew:Wow, okay, that makes sense. I mean I am the first person you hooked up with since your breakup, right? Yeah, that's totally normal

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.640
Matthew:We're good. You're fine now

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
Matthew: I'm glad we had this talk.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.960
Anna: Thank you so much for understanding, and I'm really sorry again. Do you want to stay and have dinner?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.110
Matthew: No

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.260
Anna: Okay, sorry old habits die hard

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340
Matthew: Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.840
Anna:I really wanna get married and have kids at some point. So you know looking for a meaningful relationship

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.580
Matthew: Right, yeah.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.650
Anna:Yeah want to lock it down

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.540
Anna: Really want to get that half a baby!

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.780
Matthew:Half a baby?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.920
Anna: Baby, it's like a half-white, half-Asian, baby. They're really beautiful.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.440
Matthew: Like half Asian, half British, or...?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.120
Anna: It could be! If you're down

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.920
Matthew: Yeah, I mean, I'll think about it.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.300
Anna: Okay.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.340
Matthew: Should I?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.640
Anna: Yeah, sure.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.920
Matthew:I'll catch you soon.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.000
Anna:Okay, bye! Live and learn.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.080
Now I know that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.749
I am not built to have one-night stands because I crave

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.749
Emotional connection more than I do physical ones and trying to be sexually intimate with a caveat of it being casual is beyond the scope

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.179
Of my maturity levels so I guess my advice to you is to figure out what you want and be very upfront about it even

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.070
If you quickly realize-oh, no, I was wrong. I am not built for this- just own up to it.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.960
It'll be fine. I'm Anna Akana, see you soon.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.380

Anna: Yeah, thank you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.820
