00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270
let's see if we can find the product of

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
let's see if we can find the product of
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.700
let's see if we can find the product of
X minus 4 and I'll put that in

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710
X minus 4 and I'll put that in
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.059
X minus 4 and I'll put that in
parentheses the product of that and X

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
parentheses the product of that and X
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.209
parentheses the product of that and X
plus 7 and like always I encourage you

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
plus 7 and like always I encourage you
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.589
plus 7 and like always I encourage you
to pause the video and see if you can

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
to pause the video and see if you can
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.410
to pause the video and see if you can
figure it out on your own well there are

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
figure it out on your own well there are
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.120
figure it out on your own well there are
a bunch of different ways to tackle

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
a bunch of different ways to tackle
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.609
a bunch of different ways to tackle
multiplying two binomials like this but

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
multiplying two binomials like this but
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.109
multiplying two binomials like this but
the way that I like to tackle it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
the way that I like to tackle it
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.490
the way that I like to tackle it
especially if we're just learning how to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
especially if we're just learning how to
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380
especially if we're just learning how to
do this is to just realize that we can

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
do this is to just realize that we can
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.359
do this is to just realize that we can
apply the distributive property that we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
apply the distributive property that we
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849
apply the distributive property that we
all know and love and how do you do that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
all know and love and how do you do that
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.160
all know and love and how do you do that
well you could just think of this X

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
well you could just think of this X
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.280
well you could just think of this X
minus 4 we can distribute the entire

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
minus 4 we can distribute the entire
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.680
minus 4 we can distribute the entire
binomial we can multiply the X minus 4

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
binomial we can multiply the X minus 4
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619
binomial we can multiply the X minus 4
times the X and we can multiply it times

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
times the X and we can multiply it times
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.770
times the X and we can multiply it times
the 7 so let me rewrite this so we can

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
the 7 so let me rewrite this so we can
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.869
the 7 so let me rewrite this so we can
write rewrite this as if we distribute

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
write rewrite this as if we distribute
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.029
write rewrite this as if we distribute
it it would be X minus 4 times this x

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039
it it would be X minus 4 times this x
 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.209
it it would be X minus 4 times this x
times that blue X and then plus we're

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
times that blue X and then plus we're
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220
times that blue X and then plus we're
also distributing the X minus 4 we have

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
also distributing the X minus 4 we have
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630
also distributing the X minus 4 we have
to distribute on all every one of these

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
to distribute on all every one of these
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.979
to distribute on all every one of these
terms so it's also so plus X minus 4 X

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
terms so it's also so plus X minus 4 X
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.250
terms so it's also so plus X minus 4 X
minus 4 times this is 7 times the 7 now

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
minus 4 times this is 7 times the 7 now
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679
minus 4 times this is 7 times the 7 now
what is this going to be on the left

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
what is this going to be on the left
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.859
what is this going to be on the left
hand side well the x times the X is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
hand side well the x times the X is
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.800
hand side well the x times the X is
going to be x squared and then the x

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
going to be x squared and then the x
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.920
going to be x squared and then the x
times this is minus 4 or x times the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
times this is minus 4 or x times the
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.140
times this is minus 4 or x times the
negative 4 is negative 4x and then over

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
negative 4 is negative 4x and then over
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.160
negative 4 is negative 4x and then over
here I distribute the 7 7 times X is 7x

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
here I distribute the 7 7 times X is 7x
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.840
here I distribute the 7 7 times X is 7x
so plus 7x and then 7 times negative 4

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
so plus 7x and then 7 times negative 4
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.980
so plus 7x and then 7 times negative 4
is negative 28 and now we can simplify

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
is negative 28 and now we can simplify
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569
is negative 28 and now we can simplify
this a little bit we see that we have

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
this a little bit we see that we have
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.539
this a little bit we see that we have
two first-degree two terms two terms

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549
two first-degree two terms two terms
 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.249
two first-degree two terms two terms
where I have a certain number of X's and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
where I have a certain number of X's and
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219
where I have a certain number of X's and
so we can combine these so I have x

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
so we can combine these so I have x
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.359
so we can combine these so I have x
squared if I take these two middle terms

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369
squared if I take these two middle terms
 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.480
squared if I take these two middle terms
if I take negative 4 X and then add 7

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
if I take negative 4 X and then add 7
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240
if I take negative 4 X and then add 7
X's that's going to give me positive 3x

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
X's that's going to give me positive 3x
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.810
X's that's going to give me positive 3x
negative 4 plus 7 is positive 3 so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
negative 4 plus 7 is positive 3 so
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.760
negative 4 plus 7 is positive 3 so
positive 3x and of course we have the we

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
positive 3x and of course we have the we
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.119
positive 3x and of course we have the we
have the minus 28 and we're done we just

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
have the minus 28 and we're done we just
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.600
have the minus 28 and we're done we just
multiplied these two binomials just

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
multiplied these two binomials just
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400
multiplied these two binomials just
using the distributive property to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
using the distributive property to
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.070
using the distributive property to
ice first we distributed the entire X -4

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
ice first we distributed the entire X -4
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.560
ice first we distributed the entire X -4
on to the X plus 7 so you have X minus 4

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
on to the X plus 7 so you have X minus 4
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.800
on to the X plus 7 so you have X minus 4
times X plus X minus 4 times the 7 and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
times X plus X minus 4 times the 7 and
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.170
times X plus X minus 4 times the 7 and
then we distributed the X onto the X

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
then we distributed the X onto the X
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.510
then we distributed the X onto the X
minus 4 to get what we see in yellow

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
minus 4 to get what we see in yellow
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640
minus 4 to get what we see in yellow
here and we distribute to the 7 on to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
here and we distribute to the 7 on to
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.560
here and we distribute to the 7 on to
the X minus 4 it is to get what we got

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570
the X minus 4 it is to get what we got
 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.930
the X minus 4 it is to get what we got
in green here and then we just simplify

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
in green here and then we just simplify
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.210
in green here and then we just simplify
it a bit
