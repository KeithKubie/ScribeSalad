innovation is when an individual has an

innovation is when an individual has an
 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.589
innovation is when an individual has an
idea from reading a book or having in a

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599
idea from reading a book or having in a
 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.380
idea from reading a book or having in a
problematic experience and then takes

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390
problematic experience and then takes
 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.330
problematic experience and then takes
that idea and shares it with somebody

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340
that idea and shares it with somebody
 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.890
that idea and shares it with somebody
and that person builds and the idea and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
and that person builds and the idea and
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.320
and that person builds and the idea and
shares it back and it's a going back and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330
shares it back and it's a going back and
 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.150
shares it back and it's a going back and
forth it comes from that that building
