00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.428
At its simplest texturing works as follows, you take some location on a

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:07.666
surface. Given that location use some function to change the surface attributes

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.343
at that location. For example you could change the color, shininess,

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:16.097
transparency, normal, or even the surface height or shape. That's all there is

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:19.466
to it. What the lessons ahead will cover is what sorts of functions used, and

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.950
some of the popular ways to modify the surface. Let's take a concrete example.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.550
Well maybe not concrete, let's make it wood. In fact, let's make it the most

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.535
popular object in video gaming, the crate. I looked it up. One site claims

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:36.391
there are 740-odd video games with crates in them, and counting. You have some

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.459
object, such as a box. You'd like to make it look like a crate. The most common

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:43.039
way to apply a texture to a surface is to use an image and glue it on, sort of

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.210
like wallpaper. What you'd like to get out is this, the crate texture applied

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.204
to the box. In 3JS this is amazingly simple. Here's the code snippet that does

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:55.738
it. The first line loads the texture, the second line applies this texture to a

00:00:55.738 --> 00:01:00.650
material. Done. Maybe I should just wrap-up this unit with that. For the simple

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.407
case, everything just worked. 3JS has a reasonable default for applying a

00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:08.672
square texture to square box sides. That said, I should give you fair warning

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:13.340
about loading textures. There are security concerns enforced with Web GL. The

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.900
short version is that you can't normally load some texture from another site

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640
into your program. Your program and the texture need to be in the same local

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.612
space in order to run. See the additional course materials for more

00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:24.576
information.
