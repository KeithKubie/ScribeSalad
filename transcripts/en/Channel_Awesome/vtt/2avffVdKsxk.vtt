00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
"Three Caballeros" is probably much better-known than "Saludos Amigos."

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.580
But to be fair, they're not that much different.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.860
True, in comparing the two, there does seem to be a lot more passion thrown into this one.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.760
It's longer, there's more energy, and as far as their basic cartoon animation goes?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.380
This is some of their best.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.540
I mean, the motion and the line-work just leaps off the screen sometimes. Look at how fast they're going!

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.300
[yelling, whistling excitedly]

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
"Ohhhhhh!"
-"Through fair or stormy weather!"

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
-But much like "Saludos Amigos," there isn't really a story.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.320
Er, well...in about as much as, it's just Donald opening some presents.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.520
Yeah, that's the story. Isn't that riveting?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.940
He gets a package on his birthday, which it turns out is Friday the thirteenth, bet you didn't know that...

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.400
and each present, it turns out, is a presentation on some place he's never been to before.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.480
And like the last film, there's shorts, there's songs. There's Donald Duck acting like Donald Duck.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.500
And at first, I was kind of getting into it.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.940
I was kind of enjoying all the randomness mixed in with the music, and like I said, that really fast-paced animation.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.260
And the stories were a lot more memorable, too.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.540
There's one about a penguin tryin' to get to a warmer climate.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.700
Another one about about a burro who can fly.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.900
But then the stories sort of stop, and we get that green parrot again.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.380
Him and Donald look around Brazil a bit, they dance, they sing, they...have fun, I guess.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.680
And then he opens the last package, and we have that...wood--pecker...thing? I'm not sure what he is.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.620
But he comes out to sing about Mexico.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.080
And literally, the last third of this movie is just Donald tryin' to get laid.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.480
Every time you see him, he's fawning over a woman, or... woMEN, and just tryin' to get somebody to tickle his tailfeathers.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.580
Two-thirds of the movie is pretty much like just being at a party.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.580
Which at first, sounds awesome, but at some point, you kinda want to leave that party, and find something else.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.020
Or...talk to somebody, or take a breather, or--I don't know, but there's only so long you can do it.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.980
And that's the problem with this film.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.360
After a while, it gets tiring.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.660
The animation continues to impress, as well as some really good live-action mixing.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.000
But you're just sort of watching people dance most of the time.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
And for a few minutes, it's fine, but for a whole second half of a movie?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.320
It gets pretty old pretty fast.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.180
Then we just cut to the three of them acting goofy in abstract-land again.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.700
They jump around, shoot some guns, fire off some fireworks...and that's it. That's the movie.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.560
Um...fun?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.540
There's a lot of things I really like about this film.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.540
I like a lot of the scenes, I like a lot of the animations and the short stories--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.700
which is why I hate it so much when I see it all together, because it suddenly becomes boring.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.380
This is one of those movies where on the Disney Channel, they would chop it up and they would just show it as little shorts on their cartoon shows.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.100
And that's really where it belongs. I can't see this really functioning as a film.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.420
Maybe if they went for more of a Cirque du Soleil thing, or kept a little bit more focus, or even lack of focus, just something that went all the way.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.820
Here, it seems like they kind of want to do short stories, and now they kinda want to do it as one long party,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.360
and now they kinda want to make it educational, but now they kinda want to make it silly.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.240
The only thing that's consistently good, as I said before, is the animation, which is really stylized and fun.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960
But for me, I don't think that holds the film.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.660
If you want to see it just for the motion and the cool drawings, I'd say maybe check it out.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.400
But even then, that's a big maybe.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.100
There's other Disney films that do animation better, and they have good story and characters to go along with it.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.400
So I'd probably just recommend those.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.800
But, if you're curious enough, it does have some good moments.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.900
Take that for what it's worth.
