00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:10.660
The 
real name of the “Birdman” was Robert

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.870
Franklin Stroud. Seattle born Stroud ran away
from home at the age of 13 and was first arrested

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.481
in 1909 at the age of 19 after turning himself
in for murder. He shot and killed a bartender,

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:25.929
F. K. Von Dahmer, who had allegedly failed
to pay a prostitute for whom Stroud was pimping

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.470
for in Alaska. He was then sentenced to 12
years in a federal prison, though not in Alaska

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.040
as it wasn’t yet a state.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.649
Stroud was first sent to serve his sentence
in a federal penitentiary on Puget Sound’s

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.079
McNeil Island in Washington, in 1911. He got
into even more trouble in prison where he

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.670
assaulted a hospital orderly. He also stabbed
a fellow inmate. (Unlike Burt Lancaster’s

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.059
mild mannered portrayal of Stroud in the 1962
Birdman of Alcatraz, Stroud was known to be

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.050
an extraordinarily violent, hot tempered man
and by all accounts didn’t change much through

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.609
his life in that respect.)

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.739
After these two incidents, an additional 6
months was added to his sentence and Stroud

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.770
was shipped off to a different federal penitentiary
in Leavenworth, Kansas. It would be here that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.910
he earned the nickname “Birdman”.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.880
He continued to be a difficult inmate to handle
in Leavenworth and frequently threatening

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.160
other inmates. In 1916, about half way through
his original sentence, Stroud got in trouble

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.550
over a minor incident, and thus, was going
to be denied a visit with his younger brother

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.330
who he hadn’t seen in 8 years. Needless
to say, he was furious over this and in a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.610
fit of rage, he stabbed the guard responsible
for reprimanding him and killed him in front

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.350
of about eleven hundred inmates in the Mess
hall.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.750
Needless to say, the fact that it was his
second murder and that there were so many

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.260
witnesses, Stroud didn’t receive such a
light sentence as the first time- this time

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.050
being sentenced to death by hanging. During
this time, he was put in solitary confinement.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.600
However, a series of court battles ensued,
twice involving the Supreme Court, and his

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.760
proposed execution was postponed all the way
until 1920. At this point, a handwritten desperate

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.410
plea by Stroud’s mother to President Woodrow
Wilson earned Stroud a commuted sentence of

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.790
life in prison; but because he was viewed
as such a violent inmate, it was recommended

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.000
by the warden that he continue to serve out
that sentence as he had done since killing

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.360
the guard, in solitary confinement. This was
instituted and he was put in permanent solitary

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.400
confinement.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.980
Over the next 30 years in the Leavenworth
penitentiary, he came to be known as “Birdman”

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.670
as he started taking a keen interest in canaries
and other birds after he found an injured

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.110
bird in the recreation yard and nursed it
back to health. After that, he started breeding

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.420
birds and studying them in his cell, an activity
the guards allowed him as it was a hobby they

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.470
thought to be a productive use of his time.
He also earned money by selling the birds

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.160
and used it to help support his mother, as
well as to purchase various supplies for himself

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.440
to support his bird hobby.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.380
He checked out every book available on the
subject of birds that the prison library offered.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.680
It wasn’t long after this that Stroud became
a genuine world class expert on the subject

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.280
(ornithology) and redirected his energies
to writing about them. Having raised hundreds

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.080
of birds (mostly canaries) in his cells, studying
their behavior, habitat and physiology, he

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.370
managed to author two books titled Diseases
of Canaries and Stroud’s Digest on the Diseases

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.710
of Birds, where he even outlined cures for
certain diseases that he himself had discovered.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.040
He was also in regular correspondence with
some of the world’s leading ornithologists.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.850
In fact, he wrote and received so many letters
that the prison had to hire a full time secretary

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.580
to read and copy all of them, as it was prison
policy that every piece of mail in or out

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.750
had to be read and copied, to make sure there
was nothing illicit about the correspondents

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.420
and keep a record of them.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.430
Needless to say, his amazing number of letters
that had to be screened and the filth from

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.620
all the birds in his cell resulted in the
prison administration trying to shut down

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.360
his business. Thanks to a bird researcher
from Indiana, Della Mae Jones, his story made

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.870
newspaper and magazine headlines and the President
even received a 50,000+ signature petition

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.290
from people all over requesting that Stroud
be allowed to keep the birds. Thus, rather

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.349
than be able to force him to get rid of the
birds, this resulted in the prison administration

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.880
begrudgingly giving him a second cell to house
his birds in.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.740
They then switched strategies and simply set
about trying to get him transferred to a different

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.960
prison. They were at first unsuccessful, because
when he got wind of this, he married Della

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.220
Mae Jones. Why? Because there was a Kansas
state law prohibiting any prisoner married

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.820
in Kansas from being transferred.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.520
After several years, the prison administration
was finally able to get him transferred and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.530
his birds and equipment taken away when it
was discovered he was using some of his equipment

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.470
to distill alcohol. They then shipped him
off to Alcatraz, where he was given his famous

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.410
moniker “The Birdman of Alcatraz”, even
though he was never allowed to keep any birds

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.410
while there.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.960
In his 17 years in Alcatraz, still in solitary
confinement, among other things, he studied

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.340
law with an aim at securing his release; his
argument being that being kept in solitary

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.850
confinement for so long constituted cruel
and unusual punishment. He also wrote two

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.440
more manuscripts, an autobiography titled
“Bobbie” and one called “Looking Outward:

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.160
A History of the U.S. Prison System from Colonial
Times to the Formation of the Bureau of Prisons“.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.040
In 1959, the famous Birdman of Alcatraz, who
never actually had any birds there, was finally

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.430
released from solitary confinement for the
first time since 1916 due to his poor health.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.320
He was ultimately transferred to the Medical
Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.600
Missouri where he died at the age of 73, having
spent the last 54 years of his life in prison,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:39.630
of which 42 were in solitary confinement.
