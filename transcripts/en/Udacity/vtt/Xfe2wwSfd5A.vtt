00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we have a sad Galileo.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You can tell because well he's dropped his object and now he wants to get it back.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Unfortunately, the leaning tower is very high and he doesn't want to walk all the way down.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Luckily, Galileo has a friend--this makes him slightly happier but he still wants this thing back up here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He's going to repeat his experiment--that's how you get good data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Good thing that Galileo also has a rope, and let's say his friend ties this rope to the object.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, we're talking. Now, Galileo's feeling pretty weak today.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He can only pull upwards with the force of 25N.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Can you tell me what would be the acceleration of the apple?

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I highly recommend you draw a force diagram, and when you do, once you get an answer--enter here.
