1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.540
What I did yesterday or Monday.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.760
Westers describe the first law of thermodynamics is that led me to my and do

3
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:13.150
what the context was.

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.260
They're going to study a system that's sober thermodynamic system and for all

5
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:24.391
our purposes you can imagine that to be someone more the ideal gas trapped

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.300
inside this

7
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.320
Visteon and cylinder combination.
We poured some weights,

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.640
I'd maybe some sand on top to keep the Piston we had.

9
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:44.641
We wanted the gas has a certain pressure and a certain volume and we represent

10
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.290
that by a point in this diagram

11
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.830
that defines the state.

12
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.710
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.690
<v 0>that's called the state of the gas.
I'd have microscopic level.</v>

14
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.340
The state is very complicated,
right?

15
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:06.970
That are 10 to the 23 atoms or molecules zipping around.

16
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.660
We're not interested in such detailed properties,

17
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.720
be wanting to look at bulk macroscopic properties of its pressure and volume is

18
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:18.400
a complete tear.
That's all you need.

19
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.290
I think I reminded you that you don't need a third axis for temperature because

20
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:27.670
we have this equation,
PV equals NRT,

21
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.430
so if you know p and V,
you don't need temperature as another variable.

22
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.610
That's called the equation of state.

23
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.420
You can use this all the time.

24
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.290
Whenever over the gas has got a pressure and volume,

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.650
feel free to use PV equals NRT.

26
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.380
All right,

27
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:51.250
so here's the gas and then I want to change its state.

28
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.090
And I explained to you that unlike particles who stayed can change as fast as

29
00:01:58.091 --> 00:01:58.924
you like.

30
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.010
You cannot change the state of a gas abruptly because if you take half the

31
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:06.090
weight off,
the top of the piston will fly off.
That'll be PD.

32
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.840
And when the gas is not in equilibrium,

33
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.050
different parts of it will have different density,
different pressure.

34
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.310
You cannot represent that complicated state as a point in this plane.

35
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.920
So what we want to do is to make changes which are slow enough for us to follow.

36
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.070
So one way to do that is to take one grain of sand,
one grain of sand,

37
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.410
then you lower the pressure a little bit,

38
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:33.190
the piston will move up a little bit more.
What means what bigger volume?

39
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.150
Lower pressure.
The gas don't come there.

40
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.310
And then you can take off another grain.

41
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.770
And by making the grain smaller and smaller,

42
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:45.940
you can make this dots closer and closer.
It's going to take you a long time,

43
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:50.941
but in principle you can make the guests move on some path that is a

44
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.410
thermodynamic process.

45
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.670
This process is always near equilibrium.

46
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.770
You never disturb it too from equilibrium and it's called a quasi static.

47
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.930
That means not quite static

48
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.360
but as slow as you like and it is called reversible.

49
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.570
Reversible means that you can also go right back to bed.
Ukraine.

50
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.670
If you look at grain out piston expanse,

51
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.090
you put the grain back listing contracts so you can go down this way or you can

52
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.720
go up this way.
I have just chosen to,
let's say go down like this.

53
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.540
When that happens,

54
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.330
we want to say the following thing about the state of the gas before and after

55
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.320
every point in the PV diagram,

56
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.530
the gas has something called the internal energy.

57
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.710
<v 2>Okay,</v>

58
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.670
<v 0>and the characteristic of the internal energy is it's called a state variable.</v>

59
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.230
That's a very important concept.

60
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
<v 2>Yes.</v>

61
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.460
<v 0>A state variable depends on where you are,
the Pv Diagram,
what your status.</v>

62
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.680
It does not depend on the history,

63
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.430
does not depend on all the things that gas has gone through in his life.

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.050
If you're telling me you are here,

65
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.520
then we may associate with that point and energy that doesn't look into the

66
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.660
history of that gas.

67
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.040
That energy is nothing other than the Kennedy Energy.

68
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
You remember that is three halves,
Katie Porter,

69
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.820
Adam and Adam's.
That's the internal energy.

70
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850
You can also write this three halves and our T.

71
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.110
Hey,
did they count the molecules and news?
Boltzmann constant rd.

72
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.560
Count the number of moles and use the gas constitute the same thing.

73
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.020
But our t NRT is PV.
So if you like,

74
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.760
you can also write it this week
that shows you very clearly.

75
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.680
The internal energy is uniquely determined by PV and PMV determine the product

76
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.130
PV.
So it eats point in this diagram,

77
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.750
the gas is a certain energy.

78
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.990
That energy is simply the one half MV squared for each molecule.

79
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.360
You add it all up.
That's the total energy.
Okay,

80
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:14.260
so you can write it in many different ways.
Now,

81
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.530
the first law of thermodynamics asked the following question,

82
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.660
if I wanted to change the energy of this gas,
how can I do it?

83
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.160
That are two ways to change the energy of the gas and the total change in you,

84
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.760
meaning you at the end,
minus you at the beginning.

85
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.390
But these are to nearby points is either the heat input

86
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.560
minus the work done by the gas.
Uh,

87
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.750
let me write it as capital p DB.

88
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.910
Sometimes you write it as Delta Q minus Delta w

89
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.833
<v 2>yeah,</v>

90
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 0>that's the first law.
So you have to take some time.
Understand what it says.</v>

91
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.400
Notice from this formula here,

92
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.190
the energy of an ideal gas and only an ideal gases.

93
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.870
That's the only thing we are going to talk about is a function only of

94
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:15.230
temperature.
If you know what the temperature of the gas,
you know the candidate,

95
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.410
the molecules,
and if the number is constant,

96
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.760
the NTDs determined energy depends only on the temperature for an ideal gas.

97
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:24.910
So basically when I say how can it change the energy of the gas,

98
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.890
I'm asking how can I raise the temperature?
One obvious way is this,

99
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.700
put it on a hot plate with a slightly hotter than the gas.

100
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.230
Then the heat will flow from the hot plate to the gas that's called heating up

101
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.270
the gas they had.

102
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:44.440
You don't see anything happening right occurring at a molecular level.

103
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.030
The molecules in the hot plate or on average moving faster than the molecules

104
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.390
and the gas and during the collision Kennedy going to do will be transferred

105
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.500
from the hot plate to the gas.

106
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:57.670
That invisible flow people used to think of as the calorie fluid but now we know

107
00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:02.260
is just molecular candidate energy transferred from the molecules and the plate,

108
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.990
the molecules and the guests that this guy,

109
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.220
this delta w the plus with a plus sign at the w is the work done by the guests

110
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.860
and minus of that is the work done on the gas

111
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.870
and that means if you want to increase the temperature of the gas you're also

112
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:22.630
totally,
you can do the following push down on the piston.

113
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.070
If you push down on the piston,
you're reducing the volume.

114
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.030
Delta v is negative minus beetle is positive.

115
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.690
That law also increased the energy of the gas art.

116
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.660
If you take a grain of sand out and the piston moves upwards,

117
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.880
the gas works against the environment and it pays for it through its internal

118
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.740
energy because then p Delta t will be positive and this thing will be a negative

119
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:49.060
contribution to the internal energy.

120
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.970
So there are two ways to change the energy of the gas.

121
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.430
One is a way you can actually see by moving up and down the piston.

122
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.720
You can see somebody moving it.

123
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.680
It's a macroscopic motion of something you can see that's called a work.

124
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:03.580
Then on the gas,

125
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.870
other one is energy transfer at a molecular microscopic level,

126
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.670
which is what we call heat.

127
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.570
And the first law says the total change in the internal energy is the summer of

128
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:17.410
two numbers.

129
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.680
First one is the heat input and the second one is the work done.

130
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.033
<v 2>Okay,</v>

131
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.720
<v 0>so what I did for you last name was the practice calculation in with I took a</v>

132
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:40.240
gas here,
went along and ISO therapy,

133
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.360
that means temperatures are constant.

134
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.070
That's the meaning of the isotherm.

135
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.920
And I want to go from some initial point to some final points.

136
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.520
So this is volume be and pressure p one this is p two and p two and I want to

137
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:04.320
find the work done by the gas during this expansion.

138
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.100
Well Pete Times Delta v you can see it's really that shaded area here because

139
00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:18.251
it's a rectangle of p and with Delta v P Delta v is just the area under the

140
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:20.720
graph that you follow.

141
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.240
So the work then the sum of all the infinite decimal works.
Yes,

142
00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:31.241
the pressure as a function of volume times DV from the starting volume for the

143
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:33.314
ending volume.

144
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.510
What is p as a function of be at constant temperatures and our tea over v

145
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.840
now I'm using the fact that at every point PBS and r t p is NRT over v and this

146
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:56.120
is a logarithm and we all know how to do the integral is log of the upper limit

147
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.910
minus log of the lower lip.

148
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.300
So that's though the first successful calculation of work done.

149
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.380
You can take the gas on any path you like.

150
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.640
You know as long as you knew the pressure at each volume,

151
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.820
you integrate the function from the left limit to the right limit.

152
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:18.821
That's the word that what isothermal process is particularly easy because the

153
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:22.490
pressure is inversely proportional to volume and you do that integral.

154
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.440
This is the work that for example,

155
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.910
the gas expense or double the value a temperature 300 Kelvin.

156
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.540
The work done is number of malls,
gas constant,

157
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.770
300 log have to multiply all those things.
That's the work done by the guests.

158
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.890
If that is a work done by the gas,
we can also say the following,

159
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.300
the internal energy change is zero,
right?

160
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:49.580
That the trick question I told you to watch out for,

161
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.230
if you're going at a constant temperature,

162
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.950
you don't change the internal energy that the change,

163
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:58.730
that internal energy is zero.
It follows at every step.

164
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.060
Delta Q is equal to Delta w this quantity we call the belt at w.

165
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.470
That for the work done by the gas is also equal to the total heat input to the

166
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:13.304
gas.

167
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:19.430
We indicate that by drawing a little arrow like this,
you just,

168
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:21.650
the way we like to show the heat flows into the gas.

169
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.933
<v 1>Okay?</v>

170
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.110
<v 0>Did you guys understand physically what's happening?
You take this gas,</v>

171
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.170
you keep it on a reservoir at temperature t one it stuck at that temperature.

172
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.820
If you take a grain of sand,
gas is expanding.
Normally when the gas expands,

173
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.030
it does work and it's energy will go down.
It'll cool down.

174
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.780
What do you not letting it cool down because you're pumping in heat from below,

175
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.580
maintaining it at the temperature.

176
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.480
So this process you should visualize as the piston,

177
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.520
which some waves sipping on a plate,

178
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.730
a temperature t one you take off a grain of sand,
it moves up a little bit,

179
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.500
but you don't let it cool down because you send in heat from below maintaining

180
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:07.210
it at that temperature.
For example,
you've got this computer ad,
right?

181
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:09.580
You blow air on your keyboard to blow off the dust.

182
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.940
You know when you blow the air out,
the canned cools down.

183
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.310
It cools sound because the compressed air is working against the atmosphere as

184
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.030
it comes out.
And therefore it loses internal energy and it cools down.

185
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.530
That's because you're not giving it enough time to absorb the heat from the
room.

186
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.181
If you like.

187
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:32.260
They erode slow enough so that in the process of expansion in your tries to cool

188
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.190
down,
but the room pumps more,

189
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.170
some more heat than of course there can will not cooler.

190
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.310
But you know that's not the purpose of buying candy.

191
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.230
You don't want to buy canned there so you can really sit at room temperature.

192
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.070
You don't care if it cools down.
We just want the gas to come out really fast.

193
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.970
So if you don't know,
I love what heat to come in and expand the guests,

194
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:51.804
we'll call them.

195
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.180
Cause that's also where the universe Coldstone prostate expansion.
All right,

196
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:02.200
so here's a simple problem where you can do many things.

197
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.780
You can find the change in energy from start to finish.
Zero work done.

198
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:11.560
You find by integrating PDB and the heat input is equal.

199
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.450
The work done because there is no change in energy.

200
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.150
This is all the stuff I did last time.
I also did a couple of other topics.

201
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:20.500
I'll just remind you of what they are.

202
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.180
I said we can define a specific heat for a gas.

203
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.140
Now normally a specific heat is the number of calories to raise one gram or one

204
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:35.350
kilogram,
but one degree.
But for gas,

205
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.920
what matters is not the number of grams,
but number of moles.

206
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.180
You have already seen it here.

207
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.790
The energy of the gas is not proportional to the grams of gas you have,

208
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.220
but the number of atoms you have or the number of moles you have.

209
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.940
So we defined specific heat to be the heat needed to produce a certain

210
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:57.220
temperature change.
For one mole,

211
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.800
you take a mole of gas and you,

212
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.570
you hit the guy and you see how many calories do I need to get an increase at

213
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:11.320
one degree,
but that turns out to be insufficient.

214
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.070
This data with the,
that's not have a unique value

215
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.290
than someone telling me why it's not sufficient information.

216
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.390
Do you remember from last time?
Yes.

217
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.420
In other words,

218
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.860
when I take a solid and I say find the specific key,

219
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.110
take one gram of solid pumping some heater,

220
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:36.640
the temperature goes up by one degree.

221
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.850
Keep track of the calories you're done for a gas.

222
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.890
It turns out if you took this gas in the cylinder and you pump in some calories,

223
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.210
it's going to try to heat up and when it tries to heat a bit,
we also expand.

224
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.360
Yeah.
When the expanding

225
00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.480
than some of the energy that you pump in the form of heat.

226
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.510
Some of it's turning into work to push the piston out.

227
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.770
The part that goes to the internal energy,
the part that really hits it,

228
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.280
the gas is now less because you put in some heat from below.

229
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.390
You lose them here to the expansion.
So what goes into 10 the internal energy,

230
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.300
which is what controls the temperature is less than the heat you put in.

231
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.830
So if the gas expands during the heating process,

232
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.670
that's a certain energy loss due to work you have to take into account.

233
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.510
On the other hand,
another other person can do the same experiment or the gas,

234
00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.610
but put a pin here is the piston cannot move.

235
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.230
Then of course it cannot do any work and all the heat you put in goes into

236
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.170
internal energy.
That gas will heat up more readily
for a solid,

237
00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:42.040
we don't worry about it because the expansion of a solid is such a tiny fraction

238
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.350
of its volume when the temperature changes,

239
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.310
but the fact that a chunk of copper when you heat is also expanding I Guess

240
00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:52.690
Universe,
I guess the atmospheric pressure is a negligible effect.

241
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.160
The Delta v is so small for a solid B,
ignore it.
For the gas,
it's very important.

242
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.360
Therefore for the gas that are two kinds of specific heat,

243
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.930
you'd in fact you can define many definitions.
The two common ones are,

244
00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:05.890
one is CV,

245
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.900
which is Delta Q or Delta t at constant volume.

246
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.820
That's the beauty that in calculus.

247
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.490
The other one is p with a delta Q over Delta t at constant pressure.

248
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.480
So let me,

249
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.560
did I one more time these two specific keys because it's worth going over this

250
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.813
again and again.

251
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.370
The key to all of this is the first law,

252
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.350
the first law written after transposition.
It looks like this.

253
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.330
Let's put Delta Q on one side and the other stuff on the right hand side.

254
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.570
In the first case at constant volume,

255
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.680
that is no p Delta B term because Delta v zero that for Delta Q over Delta t is

256
00:16:57.811 --> 00:16:58.621
equal to Delta.

257
00:16:58.621 --> 00:17:03.621
You over Delta t and for one mole you remember you is three over two and r d but

258
00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:10.251
in this one but one more so do you d t is a simple bit of it to have this

259
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:13.860
function with respect to eat which just three over two r.

260
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.650
What do you notice about this formula?

261
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.270
Is the specific heat of a one mole of a gas best independent on what the gases

262
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.250
as long as they'd say monoatomic gas.
It doesn't matter what the motto Adam is.

263
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.860
It could be hybrid,
it could be helium,
it doesn't matter.

264
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.750
That's why we like to think about the smaller specific heater specific heat per

265
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:39.150
mole.
You got an answer that's universal.

266
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.770
If it looks specifically at for gram than one gram of hydrogen and one gram of

267
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.470
helium won't have the same specific heat because they don't have the same number

268
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:48.750
of Adams.
Would if you count in malls.

269
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.180
The beauty of the formula is this number is true for all ideal gases.

270
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.240
Whereas if you look specifically the copper or silver that iron,

271
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.320
it varies from material to material.
That's figurative,
ideal gases.

272
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.570
It's very simple.
You don't need to look at a table.

273
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.860
He understands that for all ideal guests it's very important.

274
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:09.240
It's a monotonic gas,

275
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.250
which is the point like Adam with only moves but doesn't have any internal

276
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:17.970
structures so it can spin and rotate and vibrate.
If it can do that,

277
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.090
that other contribution to energy,
we're not going there.

278
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.540
Now let's calculate CP.

279
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.670
CP is Delta Q over Delta t at constant pressure,

280
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.420
so now you cannot ignore this term,
so delta you

281
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.570
from what I did before,

282
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.060
we'll be CV times delta t plus.

283
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:42.990
That is a new term.

284
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.910
P Delta t is Delta FPV because these constant,

285
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.600
if pizza constant,
the change in Pv,

286
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.310
the same as p times change in vi but PV equals Rt.

287
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.450
So CV,
Delta t plus our Delta t

288
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.020
to divide every site by Delta t and take Delta Q over Delta t than CP will be CV

289
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.470
plus are and that's a very famous formula

290
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.200
and you should understand why specifically that constant pressure is more than

291
00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:25.170
specific either constant volume.
Think about that.

292
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.020
If the gas is stuck at a given volume,

293
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.100
it's easier to heat it up because all the heat goes into internal energy.

294
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.140
If there's a constant pressure,

295
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.470
you're letting the piston move up and some of the heat is being paid to move the

296
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:42.390
piston,
only the rest is going to change the internal energy.

297
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.880
That's why CP is always bigger than CV,

298
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.990
but an ideal gas CPCV plus r and this number,

299
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:52.860
Gamma is defined as CP oversee

300
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.930
for an ideal get.
This is always the definition of gamma,

301
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.230
whether it's an ideal gas or not.
What an ideal gas.

302
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:06.231
We can calculate CPO over CV which is three over two are blessed and other that

303
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.380
are divided by three over two r which is five over three

304
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.640
so gamma is not always five over three.
You should be aware of that,

305
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.220
but for ideal gas,
Gamma is fire over three.

306
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.000
So this is a view of what I did last time,

307
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.770
but I'm very eager that you guys should be on top of this and it's worth doing

308
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:28.604
it one more time.

309
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:35.350
But now I'm going to consider some more processes where I want to find the work

310
00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:37.244
done.

311
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.440
So maybe I'll start fresh here.

312
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.330
Let's take the following
process.
I start here,

313
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.000
I go on an ice up there among here.

314
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.740
Then I go backwards at constant pressure.
Glen,

315
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.090
right below this point.
Then I go straight up.

316
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.790
You can ask what does the work done in this process?

317
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.590
The word done in the curvy part of it is all of this

318
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.220
that's in the park aid a B
in the part B c

319
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.470
we're done is the area of this rectangle,

320
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.780
but it's counted as negative because the gas is being compressed are if you like

321
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.100
it said some constant pressure,

322
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:37.470
but the change in volume is negative for every step.

323
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.040
So even though the Word Ben is said to be the area,

324
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:45.030
you got to keep track of sign.
If you're compressing the gas,
PW is negative.

325
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.580
Therefore in the pot BC we mistake away the shaded region

326
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.590
and ca no work is done because volume is not changing.

327
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.260
Eddie out of the vertical line is zero,
so you can see that in this full cycle.

328
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.250
When I go from a,
from a to B to c back to a,

329
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.060
the work done is the area enclosed by the loop in the PD plan.

330
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.360
That's the videos for this.

331
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.650
Now we say the work done in a cycle.

332
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.560
This is a symbol we like to use.

333
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.930
This curly thing on integrated means taking that only close loop.

334
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.960
What do you guys have to be a little careful when you write this because

335
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:40.470
somebody else can do the following thing to the gas.
Exactly the opposite.

336
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.180
Come down like this,
go down like this and go down like that.
Go up like that.

337
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:50.290
The opposite way.
In this case,

338
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.630
the work done is considered positive because the the part of it,

339
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:59.830
a B is taller than the BC it point wise,
so the network is positive.

340
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.220
Here it's the same.
I want to work but no network is negative.

341
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.950
You've got to be careful that you describe the sense in which you do the loop.

342
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.440
So the same loop as a geometrical figure as the same area,

343
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:18.910
but the work done by the gas is positive in this case and they get them in this

344
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:21.970
case,
and you can use common sense to find out if it's positive or negative.

345
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.700
But here's another very interesting result.
Let's go to the full cycle

346
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.150
and ask what's the change in you?

347
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.243
<v 2>Yes.</v>

348
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.530
PV In the beginning and the end of the theme [inaudible] right.

349
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.100
His answer

350
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.810
<v 0>was Pv is the same.
And what generally,
even if there's not an ideal gas,</v>

351
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.200
it's a gas made up of whatever you like is any system.

352
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.680
If you were to turn the system back to the same state,

353
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.920
the internal energy returns to that value.

354
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.320
That's what I meant by internal energy.

355
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.050
It doesn't depend on the history of the guests.
For example,

356
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:09.560
you can take the cylinder,
you leave it alone.
I measured the energy.

357
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:12.800
I go outside the room and come back.
In the meantime,

358
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.170
you took it on a loop and brought it back.

359
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.150
I will not know and I don't care because as far as I'm concerned,

360
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.300
if p and g are back to where they are,
the gases back to editors,

361
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.530
energies back to where it is.
So the change in the internal energy is zero.

362
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.370
That means the work done and the heat input are the same.

363
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.510
So let's be very clear.
If you guys do problems,

364
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:38.090
I don't want you to lose points for sign mistake.

365
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.340
W is also always the word done and Q is always the heat into the gas.

366
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.250
So this is a gas here which has done some work and some heat that's being pulled

367
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:58.411
into the gas and the two have to be equal because the energy doesn't change in

368
00:24:59.411 --> 00:25:04.300
the end.
No,
that leads to a very,
very subtle and interesting point.

369
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.520
That is a very clear notion of what does the energy in the gas.

370
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.840
That's a unique answer.
There is no notion of what does the heat and the gas.

371
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.080
You look at a gas and you cannot do this is the heat and the gas.

372
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:18.160
That makes no sense.

373
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:24.130
Trying to understand why because if you say that some amount of heat and the
gas,

374
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.380
okay,
whatever you want some number.

375
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.410
I do the cycle and the come back to exactly where I am.

376
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.350
I've put in some amount of heat Q which is non zero,

377
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.700
so if there is anything called the heat and the gas,

378
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.200
it has changed by an I'm on cue.

379
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.820
That's where there is no notion of heat in the gas or to work in the gas.

380
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.530
There's only energy in the gas,
a state variable return,

381
00:25:47.531 --> 00:25:51.400
Sue's original value and when you go on a close loop the change should add up to

382
00:25:51.401 --> 00:25:54.580
zero.
That's not true for work.
That's not true for heat,

383
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.570
but it's true for the difference that defines an internal state video.

384
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:02.371
Okay.

385
00:26:02.371 --> 00:26:07.371
Now I'm going to consider a new process which is a special importance to the

386
00:26:07.801 --> 00:26:12.801
processes I've considered so far or isothermal at constant pressure is called

387
00:26:13.711 --> 00:26:18.540
ISO Barteck
and I don't know the name for constant volume,

388
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.760
but no work is done a constant volume.

389
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.160
I'm going to consider it the last process,
very,
very important.

390
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.690
It's called Eddie A.
Backtick

391
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.370
did process is in which the gas changes his volume,

392
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.140
but it's completely thermally isolated belt.
That Q is zero.

393
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.500
You wrapped this guy in a blanket and you do do it.

394
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.830
No heat can flow into the gas or odor.
The gas,

395
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.390
that's called an 80 robotic process.
Isothermal is quite different.

396
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.500
Isothermal you keep it on a hot plate at a given temperature and as the volume

397
00:26:55.501 --> 00:27:00.420
changes,
say as the volume increases,
he'd comes in from below.
Odd.

398
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:03.570
When you compress it and you don't want it to heat up,
heat is rejected below.

399
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.170
But this is not the case here in the adiabatic process.

400
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.590
If you let the gas expand,
you thermally isolated from everything.

401
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.600
So you should think about what will happen to a gas.
If I start here,

402
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.990
that's what isothermal is.
What do you think will happen?

403
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.990
So let's draw a few ice up.
Terminus.
This is temperature safety fall to 300

404
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.930
this is Steve equal.
Do One more than 300 or less than 300

405
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.220
can you guys?
Yes.
Less.
And why do I say less?

406
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:39.570
You take any point here.

407
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.640
It's got the same volume but lower pressure.
So p Times v is less.

408
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.500
So this may be the equal to 200 if I start here,

409
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.830
no way.
Let the gas expand Eddie a badly.

410
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.560
That means it pull out the grains of sand,

411
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.420
the gas expense that gives you atmosphere,
but no heat is allowed to come in.

412
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.050
Think about what that means.
Gas is pushing the piston,

413
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.940
gas is doing some work and pay for it through its own internal energy.

414
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.700
Internal Energy will go down.

415
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.690
That means temperature will go down.

416
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.340
So what you will be doing is you'll be cascading down from one ice attempt to

417
00:28:22.431 --> 00:28:27.270
another plummeting down in temperature till you come and stop somewhere at a

418
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:28.104
lower temperature.

419
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.930
So an Eddie about Dick Process will cross from one ice up there and to the next,

420
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:36.300
to the next,
to the next changing temperature.

421
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.710
Another way to say this is that the drop in pressure,

422
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.940
but given drop an increase in volume,
it would be more precipice.

423
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.890
But I Padick because it's expanding,

424
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.840
but there's no energy coming into the form of pizza.

425
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.660
Pressure drops more precipitants so it won't be PV equals the constant.

426
00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.370
And the question is what is it?
What is the equation for an idea biotic process,

427
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.890
what is p as the function of B?

428
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.760
That's what we want to ask now.

429
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.903
<v 2>Okay,</v>

430
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:17.240
<v 0>so whenever you have any such question in thermodynamics up to this point,</v>

431
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.060
the only law we know is the first law of thermodynamics.

432
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:22.940
So you have to go back to that.
So so far

433
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.500
I've driven home the point that every question I and mechanics can be traced

434
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:32.690
back to Newton's law that are no new laws.

435
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.020
But when you come to terms or dynamics and you study heat and temperature,

436
00:29:36.021 --> 00:29:39.800
that is new stuff in the first law of thermodynamics is called the law because

437
00:29:39.801 --> 00:29:43.990
there is no way you can derive it from Newtonian laws.
It's a new concept.

438
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.890
So let's ask what is p as a function of B given that Delta Q is zero.

439
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.720
So what?
What's our strategy going to be?
How would you even begin this?

440
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.850
Do you have some idea what you might do?
This is a tough question.

441
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.680
So even if you give a wrong answer,
that's fine.

442
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.410
How do I calculate the relation of P to B given the Delta Q is zero.

443
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.273
Yes.

444
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:20.830
<v 1>[inaudible] Delta</v>

445
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:29.770
pressure.
Right side.

446
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.130
<v 0>Okay,
so let me,
let me write down everything he said.</v>

447
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.350
When I say Delta Q is zero,

448
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.980
your first reaction has to go back to the first law and write Delta Q as Delta,

449
00:30:46.531 --> 00:30:47.880
you plus p Delta v

450
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.960
and set that equal to zero

451
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.920
but Delta you his CV times Delta t

452
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.600
less p Delta v is zero.

453
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:08.770
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

454
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.480
<v 0>by the Bay Delta use CB Delta t four one more.</v>

455
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.510
I'm going to consider one mole of gas.

456
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.530
Now this is another thing you people turn.

457
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.070
Understand the way in which pressure falls with temperature is going to be the

458
00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:24.740
same or that I consider one more or two malls at 10 moles

459
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.680
rated with two changes will not be dependent on how many moles I took.

460
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.650
So if you want,
you can take and malts and put an n here,

461
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.140
you'll find everywhere in and will come and cancel out.

462
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:43.460
No,
P N R T B.

463
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:49.320
So maybe I'll do it this way for you guys if you want to put an end back there,

464
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.140
but you will find end camps and so does the equation cause NCV,

465
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:58.310
Delta t blessing n r t Delta v Over v equals zero.

466
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.690
So the answer doesn't depend on how many moles you took.

467
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.060
So I will take one mole for my calculation.

468
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.100
Think about what this says.
Divide everything by,

469
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.260
let's see,

470
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.260
you weight everything by t good CV over our Delta t over t plus Delta v over B

471
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.073
is zero.

472
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.360
This is telling you that as you change your volume and you're coming down this

473
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:41.750
graph of ID,
a backtick expansion,
when you go from there to there,

474
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.430
that's the change in temperature such that the change in temperature by the

475
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:50.510
temperature plus the change in volume divided by the volume should add up to

476
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:52.910
zero.
That is a condition of no heat flow.

477
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.260
So it relates to change in t change in v.

478
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.530
What I would have ideally liked is a change in p due to change in B,

479
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.340
but what comes more naturally,
it's a change in t over change in B.

480
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.530
But let's worry about that later because we got PB,
what's rt?

481
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.440
We can always swap the temperature for pressure in the end.

482
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.720
So let's just take this definition
so every change,

483
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.930
remember now you understand you go from one point to the neighboring point,

484
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.490
that's the plant in temperature.

485
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:29.510
That's where Delta t will be negative and Delta will be positive and these

486
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:33.620
numbers will of course cancel.
No,
let's add all the changes.

487
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.170
That's call it doing the integral to the integral of that from start to finish

488
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:43.350
through the integral of that from start to finish and that integral of zero is

489
00:33:43.351 --> 00:33:44.184
still zero.

490
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.843
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.930
<v 0>This tells me CV over our flames log of t two over t one less logs of veto over</v>

492
00:33:56.871 --> 00:33:59.150
B one zero

493
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.540
no,

494
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.190
you got to go back and think of Bodie logarithms and realized that I can write

495
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:15.191
it as a log of t two over t one raised to the power CVO.

496
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.100
What are times to be two over V one

497
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.440
is equal to zero.

498
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.830
You just come by and all the logarithms and realize the log of x to the power

499
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.220
and his end log x.

500
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.060
So that is the same as this no log of something.

501
00:34:34.061 --> 00:34:37.490
A zero means that something is one because log of one is zero.

502
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.480
So we rewrite the final expression I got up there by saying t two

503
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:52.810
over t one they used to see the old r Times v two over v one is equal to one

504
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.560
and we usually write it as follows.

505
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.460
We say t to race to the CD over our v two to the power of one is t one race to

506
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:16.380
the CV?
I'm sorry,

507
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.400
can you one race to see the over r Times v one

508
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.640
so this is the relation between the temperature and the volume.

509
00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:27.923
Yes.

510
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.700
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

511
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.570
<v 0>you could do that.
That's correct.
You could write down three halves if you like.</v>

512
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.650
At the moment,
I'm trying to keep it general.

513
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.360
If it was a gas for which a CV was not,
rehabs are,

514
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.940
all of this would still be true,
but he's quite right.

515
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.200
What an ideal monoatomic gas CVO rod would be just to be over too.

516
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.540
So what it's telling you is that when the gas expands,
the temperature falls.

517
00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.170
I already told you that.
It's telling you exactly how it falls.

518
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.270
It tells you the tea to some Strange Power Times v is constant during the

519
00:36:05.271 --> 00:36:09.080
process.
Now if you want to know what happens to the pressure,

520
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.610
you can do the following.

521
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:15.770
You remember PV equals Rt.

522
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.340
Therefore you can rate this t o s okay,

523
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:26.930
that are many ways to write this.

524
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.780
I'm going to write it in another way and you guys see if we can follow this.

525
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:35.870
T Two d two to the power r oversee be physical.

526
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.100
Just t one.
You wonder the polar odd oversee me.

527
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.740
You believe that that just a mathematical trick.
If I,

528
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.670
if that is true.
This is true.
You know how they went from here to here.

529
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.120
How did they go from here to here?
You have an idea.
Um,
you take the,

530
00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.940
you take our overseas power exec take raise both sites.

531
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:08.050
The power odd oversee V it's cooked up so that CVO overall goes away.

532
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:10.200
And the auto where CV falls on V two.

533
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.570
So here's another way to write it if you like.

534
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.740
I'll tell you why I rated this way because t two is just Pete to meet to the,

535
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.540
let me combine that one,
beat two with this right and one plus odd over CB.

536
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.260
Then I can show you just p one do you want the flower one plus odd over CV show

537
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:41.470
you owe me a brick.
That PV is not tea but it's rt but art will cancel.

538
00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:42.600
So I didn't bother with that

539
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.550
and this don't draw the box around this yet.

540
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.890
I will write it in a way that's very,
very standard.

541
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.870
And if you remember your high school days,

542
00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:56.871
you may remember it's written as p Two v two to the gamma is equal to p one the

543
00:37:58.741 --> 00:37:59.574
wonder the gamma,

544
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.910
but gamma is just one plus r Oversee v which you can see is equal to CB plus our

545
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.910
oversee v and that is CP over CV.

546
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.050
So there's gamma is really CPO oversea

547
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.850
for an ID biotic process,

548
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.020
p Two v two the gamma speed when we wanted the gamma.
That's one way to write it,

549
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.220
but I will also expect you to know that you can also write it in terms of

550
00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:34.221
temperature as temperature times volume raise to a strange power is equal to

551
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.520
constant before and after.

552
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

553
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.780
<v 0>Any questions?</v>

554
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.740
So what we have done is found pressure as a function of volume on an idea Batek

555
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.873
curve.

556
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.840
So I'm now going to do one last ingredient for the rest of the stuff,

557
00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.620
which is the following.

558
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.550
I'm going to calculate the work done in an aerobatic process from here to here.

559
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.740
This is one,
this is true.

560
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.310
This is not a nice determine which books like that or it's an antiemetic
process.

561
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.620
What's the work done in adiabatic price?

562
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:20.610
Let's calculate that work done is equal to integral PDV

563
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.320
pdf to be DV.

564
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.550
But remember PB the gamma is a constant.

565
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.690
Do you guys understand the relation of writing PV to the gamma?

566
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:39.360
Equal to constant is the same as saying be when we went to the gamma speed to

567
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.880
through the gamma.
That means you can pick any point on that path.

568
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.660
And with Pete at that point,
times be at that point,

569
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:51.640
the power gamma will be a fixed number.
That number is c.
In other words,

570
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.870
this c can be,
can you want to be wanted the gamma,
if you like,

571
00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.770
odd p Two v two to the gamma,
if you like p three B through the gamma.

572
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.840
If three is another point on the trajectory,

573
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.020
it's convenient to call that invariant product of p res Pv.

574
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.370
We raised the cameras,
see,

575
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:15.510
because then we can do the integral as DV over overreach.

576
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.250
The gamma constancy here

577
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.420
from v one to v two

578
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.043
<v 1>okay,</v>

579
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.240
<v 0>and this is a pretty simple integral.
You guys know that the extra,</v>

580
00:40:29.241 --> 00:40:33.060
the end integral is actually the n plus one over n plus one so to the,

581
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:38.061
to the gamma minus one over gamma minus ones

582
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:50.040
because this is really beat at the minus gamma.
Did I get it wrong here?

583
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.220
I think I got it wrong.
Sorry.
All right.

584
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.040
One minus gamma one minus gamma over one minor scale

585
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.190
because we do the minus gamma,

586
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.560
the V is equal to v two the minus gamma plus one or minus gamma plus one.

587
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:16.490
Right x to the n integral is extra the n plus one over n plus one and happens to

588
00:41:16.591 --> 00:41:21.180
be minus gamma here.
Okay,
now watch this.

589
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:27.090
This constant I said can be written as any of these numbers,

590
00:41:27.091 --> 00:41:31.920
but let me write Ben and multiplies.
This limited is p Two v two to the gamma.

591
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.040
Can you see happens if I do that?

592
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:37.850
Try to do this in your head when the seat see multiplies all of this.

593
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.190
When see multiplies this guy,

594
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.220
let me write the concept of speed to be two to the gamma.

595
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.560
That gives me a p two B two to the gamma combines with be two to the one minus

596
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:50.390
gamma to give me just a bit too.

597
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.230
Likewise,
see multiplying this one when the same,
see multiplies this.

598
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.550
Let's write CSP one.
We wanted the gamma and we'll finders that

599
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:10.870
and people like to rewrite this by changing the sign everywhere as p One v one

600
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:16.470
minus p Two v two over gamma minus one because gamma minus one is the positive

601
00:42:17.171 --> 00:42:21.490
quantity.
So this is the work done in an anti biotic process.

602
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.710
So what?
What's been going on?
Let's think about what I've been doing.

603
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.490
I told you that there is a new process called aerobatic.

604
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.500
Very important process in which the system is not allowed to exchange heat with

605
00:42:41.501 --> 00:42:42.370
the outside world.

606
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:47.560
Delta Q equals to zero is a condition relating Delta u and P,

607
00:42:47.561 --> 00:42:52.561
Delta t and the changes are correlated and the effect of adding up all the

608
00:42:53.411 --> 00:42:58.390
changes,
namely doing the integral is this one,
namely temperature.

609
00:42:58.391 --> 00:43:02.230
The CD overall times B two does not change along the path.

610
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.640
So if you take any two points,

611
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.610
that combination of temperature and volume doesn't change.

612
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.510
Then since PBX will do essentially tea,

613
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.530
you can also write it as pressure times volume to the power gamma doesn't
change.

614
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.910
So I'm saying you can call all of that equal some constant sea.

615
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:23.230
The sea is not a universal constantly like velocity of light for the given gas

616
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.040
on a given experiment.
It does not change.

617
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.050
Acid goes through Eddie about expansion,

618
00:43:29.051 --> 00:43:33.040
so don't think of it as a universal constant on that trajectory,

619
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.840
on their id badge,
the curve.
It's a constant.

620
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.520
It's like saying kinetic energy plus potential energy is a constant.

621
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.950
It's not a constant,
you can look up in a book.

622
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.630
It depends on what your particular is doing.

623
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.240
But for that particle in those conditions,

624
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.500
candidate was potential ads to a particular constant.
We call the total energy.

625
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.580
Likewise Pv,
the gamma is a constant for this particular gas.

626
00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:57.641
Okay,

627
00:43:57.641 --> 00:44:02.641
so all this was actually a preparation for something else

628
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.460
and that's what we are going to discuss now.

629
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.710
So between now and the end of this course,
we're going to discuss

630
00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.550
the second law of thermodynamics.

631
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.050
So we have done all we want to do with the first law.

632
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.100
So you guys should be able to be given various graphs in the PD plan,

633
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.950
find the work done and going from here to there,

634
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.290
find the change in internal energy,
find the change in,

635
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.260
find the heat added and so on.
I hope you can do such problems,

636
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.990
but they're all going to be one of these formulas.
Hey,

637
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:43.740
there's going to be idea Barrick or constant pressure,
constant temperature.

638
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:48.240
So you just plug the numbers in,
keep track of the science by using common sense.

639
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.920
All right,
so now we come to the last part of thermodynamics,

640
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.550
which is to me the one of the most beautiful parts of them are dynamics,

641
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.500
which starts out with asking the following question.

642
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.650
There are certain things in this world that are perfectly allowed but don't seem

643
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:11.850
to happen.
Let's take many examples.

644
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.440
Take the jewel experiment.

645
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.240
You take a cylinder of water with a paddle that can spin and you put some weight

646
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.160
around the pulley and the way it goes down paddled,
spins,
the water heats up.

647
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.570
You take a movie of that and the movie is so fine,

648
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:29.580
it can even cat individual molecules.

649
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.880
Now you play the movie backwards.

650
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.450
So you watched the movie being played back and what do you find?

651
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.990
Suddenly the weight starts moving up and spins the other way and the water cools

652
00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:45.524
down.

653
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.490
This is not in violation of any of the laws you have learned,

654
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:52.290
including the first law of thermodynamics.

655
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.420
Because when the weight went down and the water heated up,

656
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:02.930
some amount of work was done on the gas and the on the water and the energy of

657
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:06.030
the water went up in the reverse process.

658
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.390
The energy of the water went down and instead the weight went up.

659
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:11.490
So work was done by the system.

660
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:13.743
<v 3>But that</v>

661
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.070
<v 0>doesn't seem to happen.
If the weight comes down,
you can wait all day.</v>

662
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.840
Or let me give you another example.
Take a chunk of wood.
The slider there,

663
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:29.190
sorry.
It was not a piece of work and it didn't stop.
See,

664
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:33.700
this is why I don't do demonstrations because even the simplest demonstration I

665
00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:35.290
have done a doesn't work.

666
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:38.020
So that's where some of us become theoretical physicist.

667
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.940
I did a demonstration where some trolley supposed to shoot a little marble.

668
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.110
All the marvel had to do was come down and even that didn't work.

669
00:46:47.111 --> 00:46:50.470
So I don't do demonstration.
Well let's try.
This incident is there.

670
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.070
I give it a push and it stops.
Take the movie of that,

671
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.730
play it backwards.
You will find suddenly,

672
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.250
you know the table heats up a little bit due to friction.

673
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.720
The table can cool down and the is that it can move backwards.
Speaking of speed,

674
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.600
right to why did they laugh?

675
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.840
You have no reason to laugh right now because it doesn't violate anything you

676
00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:15.310
have learned other than your daily experience because in the reverse process,

677
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.410
every atom,

678
00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.150
every atomic thing in the desk that started moving is made to stop,

679
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:27.130
turn around and moving backwards direction and every coalition between atoms on

680
00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:30.820
the desk and atoms on the razor will obey all the laws of mechanics.

681
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.680
For example,
if you have a planet going around the sun,

682
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.960
if you stop the planet and Universe,
the velocity,

683
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.510
we'll go the opposite way and the opposite motion is incomplete.

684
00:47:45.511 --> 00:47:46.900
Our Card with Newton's laws,

685
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.740
in fact that maybe some of the solar system where the planet actually goes the

686
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:51.161
other way,

687
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:56.161
it doesn't violate any and all the movies which are played backwards at the very

688
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:57.610
microscopic level,

689
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:02.110
there's nothing that says it cannot happen and yet it does not happen.

690
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.380
Here's another thing that does not happen.
I take a

691
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.070
box and I put some gas molecules on one side and there's a partition holding

692
00:48:12.071 --> 00:48:12.904
them in that side.

693
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:17.210
Then I remove this partition and the way the little bitch,

694
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.660
then I know the gas fields up.

695
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.810
Now take,
that's like perfume leaking out of the bottle.

696
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:31.410
Now take a movie of these molecules when they go from here to here and play the

697
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:36.340
movie backwards.
What happened when you play the movie backwards?

698
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.550
Let's say this guy was moving like this.
The instant you play the movie back,

699
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.750
well in the backwards moving and start going the other way and slowly the whole

700
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:46.120
thing will untangle itself and end up here.

701
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:49.720
That also will not happen.

702
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.990
We all know that if you go to the room and they released some gas from one site,

703
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.041
it can fill the room,

704
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:58.990
but it's not ever going to come back and yet it doesn't violate any laws because

705
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:04.050
if I made a movie and played it backwards in every microscopic interactions

706
00:49:04.831 --> 00:49:08.170
between molecules,
there'll be no violation of any of the laws of nature.

707
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.760
That doesn't happen.
Here's another thing that doesn't happen.

708
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.350
I take a chunk of some heart copper and they take a chunk of some coal,
copper,

709
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.980
hot,
cold.
I just put them on top of each other.

710
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.760
Come back in an hour.
It's becomes a Luke warm.

711
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.540
That's fine,
but now maybe if I wait long enough,

712
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.760
the lukewarm will automatically spontaneously separated.
The hot and cold.

713
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.070
That doesn't seem to happen.
The heap simply seems to flow from heart to call,

714
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.810
but never back from cold to hot,

715
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.250
but flowing from Coulter heart will not violate the law of conservation of

716
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:51.130
energy.
As long as the same number of calories go from cold to hot,

717
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.190
it doesn't violate anything.
That doesn't seem to happen.

718
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.650
So this can go on and on and on.

719
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:59.950
There's a large number of things that are allowed but don't happen.

720
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.570
So we cannot explain them with any known laws of physics.

721
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:09.100
So we elevate that to a new law.
The new law will say,
these things cannot happen,

722
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.000
but you don't have a law that says these things cannot happen.
Right?

723
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.760
That's not a good enough law.
You got to say what things cannot happen.

724
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.380
I got a list of my lung,

725
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
the hot and cold when mixed will never separate back into hot and cold aghast.

726
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:25.780
That genie that got out of the bottle won't go back.

727
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:27.590
This gas that came on won't back.

728
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.440
There's a whole lot of processes which you call irreversible.

729
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.570
They never seemed to happen backwards.

730
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.560
They only happen forwards and we cannot list all of them.

731
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.800
So you wonder if there is any law.

732
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:42.260
See Anytime you cannot explain something from prior things,

733
00:50:42.261 --> 00:50:44.860
you elevate that to a law but you like an economic law,

734
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:48.440
you would not like a law that says the following million things cannot happen.

735
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:50.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.140
<v 0>And it's really amazing that that is one law,</v>

737
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.800
single law that not only is qualitative but it's quantitative that tells you

738
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:03.950
exactly when somethings can happen and when some things cannot happen and

739
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.370
according to the one single law,
all the things that we say don't happen.

740
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:11.300
One happen will be forbidden by the law and that's the second law of

741
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:16.010
thermodynamics.
But what form does it take?
Well,

742
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.390
we will see it introduces certain quantity called entropy about which let's say

743
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:24.380
right now we don't know anything in the law will simply say the entropy of the

744
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.810
universe will always increase.
You don't have to write it down.

745
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:28.820
Now I'm going to define the concept.

746
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.540
It'll arise naturally from more thinking that one law,

747
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.460
the entropy will always increase.

748
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:40.060
The university as a whole is enough to forbid any of these forbidden processes.

749
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.810
In other words,

750
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.410
if the paddle spun the other way and the weight went up in the water cooled
down,

751
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:47.960
you can show the entropy of the universe would have actually gone down.

752
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:51.650
That's where that's not allowed.
If you drop a piece of egg an egg,

753
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.510
it comes since splatters all over the floor.

754
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:56.720
If it rejoined and rose back to your hand,

755
00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:01.100
it won't violate any other principal other than the law of entropy because the

756
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:04.490
shattered egg has more than repeat and the egg that comes back to your hand

757
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.720
and have hot and cold mix to become lukewarm.

758
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.470
You can show the entropy goes up this way,
but if you went the other way,

759
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:14.120
entropy will go down and that's not allowed.

760
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.080
So one great law will take care of all these things.

761
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.160
So you've got to ask yourself,
what is the one grade law?
How do we get to it?

762
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.061
Well,

763
00:52:24.061 --> 00:52:29.061
it turns out this great law were discovered by an engineer called carnal.

764
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.560
Here's another thing,
people don't wake up and say,

765
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.620
I'm going to discover a great law.
Uh,

766
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:41.130
people just go out and do the business and all you need is to have enough sense

767
00:52:41.131 --> 00:52:44.570
to realize when you stumbled on something really great,
it's a car.

768
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.990
And I had a very practical question.

769
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.220
Cardinal was working on engines at the time.

770
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:54.390
They were working on something like the steam engine.
So steam engine,

771
00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:59.070
you know what happens in the steam engine.
You take some coal,
you set fire to it,

772
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.510
then you boil some water,

773
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:04.830
it turns into steam and the steam pushes the Pistons and the wheels turn and the

774
00:53:04.831 --> 00:53:07.200
train goes forward.
And that's your steam engine.

775
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.150
What happens in a steam engine,
we can show schematically as follows.

776
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:17.010
There is a heart reservoir t one that the furnace of your steam engine

777
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.250
did.
You have an engine in which you got some steam,

778
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.730
you got some water that's going to be boiled and it's going to boil because you

779
00:53:25.731 --> 00:53:29.180
taken some heat.
Here's my engine.
It's got some stuff.

780
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.570
Substance inside it could be a gasoline and didn't have the steam engine.

781
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.670
We don't care what happens.
Someone want the feet.

782
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:38.160
Q one is taken from a hot reservoir

783
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.540
and some of them are,
the work is delivered.

784
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.740
Now here is an engine with as drawn here doesn't violate any of the laws of

785
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:54.741
physics provided Q one is equal to w than low energy is conserved in practice.

786
00:53:56.971 --> 00:54:00.870
You find that's not have engines work.
The Indian also rejects.

787
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.660
Some of them aren't that he'd Q tube to a lower temperature t to

788
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.170
the lower temperature.
If you look at the steam engine,
if you gone,

789
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.860
have you guys seen a steam engine?
Okay,
if you really go see a steam engine,

790
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:17.160
you will find this a lot of hot steam coming out of the back or in a car.

791
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.200
You've got exhaust gases coming up.
That's the hot gas emitter.

792
00:54:21.201 --> 00:54:25.770
That atmospheric temperature inside the engine is a very hot place.

793
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.630
So the car emits some heat at the lower temperature,

794
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.000
the steam and didn't image some steam at a lower temperature.

795
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.720
So the work that you can get is really Q one minus Q two is what you can get.

796
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:47.070
At least in this engine you get Q one minus Q two so we defined a quantity

797
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:49.040
called efficiency Ada.

798
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:54.540
Just call the efficiency is what you get divided or what you pay for.

799
00:54:55.830 --> 00:55:00.240
You pay for burning the coal and you get the workout.
The workers of course,

800
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:04.560
the thing that makes the engine move forward turns into Kennedy energy of the

801
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:05.394
local model.

802
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:11.180
That then we can see is Q one minus Q two what you get,

803
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.800
they will get what you pay for.

804
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.060
You can write it as one minus Q two over Q one

805
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.010
so in every engine some heat is taken in,

806
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.720
some of it is converted to work and some of it has rejected

807
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:36.660
the extent heaters rejected.

808
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:40.710
The efficiency is less than one because Q two minus over Q and subtract it from

809
00:55:40.711 --> 00:55:42.900
one.
You can ask yourself,

810
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:48.960
why not build an engine in what you just don't reject any heat downstairs?

811
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.750
Why not take all the heat and convert it to work?

812
00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.080
So carnal gave a great argument on the most efficient engine you can build other

813
00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:06.450
words that is an upper limit to the efficiency and there's not one.

814
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.280
So what is it and how are we going to find out?
Well,

815
00:56:11.281 --> 00:56:14.520
he's going to find out what it is,
but he also needs a postulate.

816
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.430
Cartoners postulate is the old version of the second law of thermodynamics.

817
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.040
He didn't talk about entropy.
You can show in the end they are all equivalent,

818
00:56:24.041 --> 00:56:26.740
but car knows law,

819
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:31.600
which is his own version of the second law,
which says the following.

820
00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.960
So a lot too.
According the car.
No.

821
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:36.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

822
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.330
<v 0>let me just drive figure then.</v>

823
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.230
That's right.
We we to safety one,
there's not allowed

824
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.240
and says you cannot build an engine.

825
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

826
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:56.660
<v 0>Whose sole effect at the end of the day is to transfer some heat from a quarter</v>

827
00:56:56.761 --> 00:57:01.760
body too.
Hot Body
whose sole effect?

828
00:57:01.761 --> 00:57:02.780
That's very,
very important.

829
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.400
You cannot have a process.

830
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:13.020
Who sole ethic

831
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.770
is this.
I mean,
I don't feel like writing what this is.

832
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.030
It's what the picture says.
All right?

833
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.490
It doesn't take a genius to have the heat flow the other way you understand if

834
00:57:28.491 --> 00:57:31.730
you want to hit the flow from hot body,
the core body that's trivial,

835
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.340
just connect them with a metal rod and the heat will flow.

836
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.420
The sole effect of that is transfer of heat from the hot to cold.

837
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:41.600
That's the way the natural order of things,

838
00:57:41.601 --> 00:57:46.601
but cardio is saying you can never build a set of gears and wheels and t

839
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:49.280
whatever you like so that at the end of the day,

840
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:53.000
all that has happened is he does flown from cold to hot.

841
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:57.800
That is going to be taken as a postulate and people are willing to take that as

842
00:57:57.801 --> 00:58:01.520
a reasonable postulate and we want to see what we can get out of the positive.

843
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:07.570
It turns out it is that postulate that going to control the efficiency of heat

844
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:09.810
engines put a bound on the efficiency if he vendors,

845
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:16.730
so dawn did use this,
this is a law.
Now you might say,

846
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.200
well this is how the law it began in the last lawsuit,

847
00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.860
modern more sophisticated forms.

848
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:25.010
Sukarno was not thinking entropy that came later,
but his postulate was,

849
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:30.350
please grant me this,
which seems to be a fact in nature.
Then from that,

850
00:58:30.351 --> 00:58:35.150
let me talk about heat engines and show you that that is an upper limit to the

851
00:58:35.151 --> 00:58:38.960
efficiency of an engine in particular.
The upper limit is not one.

852
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.640
It's clear to everybody that the limit cannot be more than one.

853
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:44.841
There's more than one.

854
00:58:44.841 --> 00:58:48.500
You are taking someone more defeat and giving even more amount of work delivered

855
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.680
that violates the first law of thermodynamics,
conservation of energy.

856
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:56.780
But the fact that you must necessarily reject some heat which you cannot use in

857
00:58:56.781 --> 00:59:00.010
this experiment is the content of car notice result.

858
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:06.350
So here is the engine.
That car no built,

859
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.270
this is called the car.
No engine

860
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.500
incarnated.
By the way,
look,
don't rely on my graphics.

861
00:59:16.501 --> 00:59:20.020
I mean you have to go look at just about any book you can find in the market.

862
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:21.200
We will talk about Carnegie engine.

863
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:24.290
So I'm hitting the mainly tell you the words are not the pictures.

864
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:28.100
So Cardinal Indian is like this take to

865
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:34.750
isothermals p one and p two you remember the idea about the curves that are much

866
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:38.600
steeper draw to Eddie Batek curves like that

867
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:45.970
than take a gas from a to B to c

868
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.930
to d and back to a that is a carnal engine.

869
00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.310
The,
let's see what we are doing in the process.
A,
B,

870
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:07.270
take the piston with a gas in it slowly lift the grains of sand so it expands to

871
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:11.150
a volume,
be at the same temperature.

872
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.710
Then having reached B,
you terminally isolate.

873
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.980
The gas is not on top of her as a water temperature.

874
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.850
T one is completely isolated.
Take on even more grains of sand.

875
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.640
Now it's expanding without any energy coming in.

876
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:29.000
It cools down to t two this is the point.
See

877
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.270
now you put the grains of sand back,
but it's still on a hot reservoir.

878
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.760
T two I met on the cold reservoir t to put the grains of sand back.

879
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.190
Temperature is locked in a teetotal.
You come here,

880
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:49.370
then you isolate the gas and put more grains of sand bag.
Really come back to a

881
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:55.130
obviously such a path exists because of the way I saw terminals and I the

882
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.210
barracks in the PV plane.
That's the current cycle.

883
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.180
An important part of the carbon cycle is that it's reversible.

884
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.210
It's reversible because at every stage when it took a grain of sand out,

885
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.860
you can put it back and you can run it backwards so it can also run backwards.

886
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.440
The carnal in gym looks like this.
It is the engine.

887
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.980
It takes them hit Q one from a reservoir.
T one delivers somewhere.

888
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.800
W IRIDEX some heat you to a temperature t two

889
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:35.300
this is the model of a steam engine
supports you run the car.

890
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:38.210
No engine backwards.
By the way,

891
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:42.590
the work done by the carnival engine is this shaded region here and it absorbs

892
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:44.060
heat in the stage.

893
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:47.600
Ab doesn't have any heat absorption in the state.

894
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:50.540
Busy because I diabetic in CD.

895
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.810
It rejects them heat and dia gainers.
No heat transfer,

896
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:58.910
so he comes in here.
He Won.
He just rejected here.

897
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:04.280
Q two
if you're on the car,
no engine backwards.

898
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:09.080
Let me show you what it looks like.
Everything is backwards in the car.
No engine.

899
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:13.790
If you run it the other way,
some workers put in here some heat.

900
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.950
Q two is taken from the lower reservoir and the heat.

901
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:21.420
You want to deliver the upper reservoir.
You know what that gadget is?

902
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.450
That's the refrigerator,
so in a refrigerator that's what happens.

903
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.360
You might say,
Hey,
you violated the second law.

904
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.640
You have transferred heat from a cold to hot body,

905
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:37.290
but it was not the only thing that happened because some compressors somewhere

906
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.960
did some work.
That certainly allowed.

907
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:44.520
What is not allowed is to have it flow from cold to hot with nothing in
involved.

908
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.011
The second,

909
01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:52.011
second thing to notice is the gas after doing its thing comes back to the

910
01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.034
starting point.

911
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:57.870
That means you can do it over and over and over again in one cycle.

912
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.100
The gas has some heat coming in.
Q one heat rejected Q2,

913
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.870
some work done w and it comes back to where it is and you can go on doing it

914
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:10.110
many,
many times.
That's where it's useful engine.

915
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.630
If the substance returns to the starting point,

916
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.940
having done some work in return for some heat,

917
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.610
you can do it over and over again and cartons.

918
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.130
Question was what's the efficiency of this engine?

919
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.840
We're going to calculate that now

920
01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:28.380
the efficiency of the engine is Ada is Cuban minus Q two

921
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.380
over Q one

922
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.560
r one minus Q two over Q one

923
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:47.140
well Q one and Q two are pretty easy to calculate.

924
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:51.080
Let me tell you why in the process a B,

925
01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.200
remember isothermal expansion,
the heat input is the work done

926
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.650
because changing internal energy zero and the work done.

927
01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.860
You remember this and our t log the B over the VA?

928
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:12.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

929
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.290
<v 0>Similarly acute to asset positive number.</v>

930
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:21.710
It's an r t two log VC over bebe.

931
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.200
You remember Q two here is defined as a positive number even though it's the

932
01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:39.020
heat rejected.
If you want to get a positive number,

933
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:44.230
I read the log of the initial overview final so I get a sorry VC or will be d.

934
01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

935
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:51.470
<v 0>so the efficiency now becomes</v>

936
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:58.210
one minus Q two over Q one you come to one minus t two over t one the log VC or

937
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:05.240
VB divided by a log.

938
01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:12.420
I'm sorry if VC or be divided by log VB over VA.

939
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.280
Again,
if you cannot follow my script here,

940
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:25.840
you may have to go back and get the subscript right but don't worry too much

941
01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:26.890
about all the details.

942
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.980
What I want you to know is that the heat input here and the heat rejected here

943
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.470
are all familiar quantities from what I did earlier,

944
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.650
but now here is the punchline.
Ada.

945
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.990
A claim is one minus t two over t one

946
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.690
in other words I'm saying forget this ratio logarithms.
It is just one.

947
01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.940
I would show that you of course it's not going to be written without proof,
but

948
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:59.370
the final answer for efficiency of this engine is one minus t two over t one so

949
01:05:59.371 --> 01:06:03.150
we need to show why VCO would vd is the same as VB Oba.

950
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.480
Well I will.

951
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.450
Did I have that here then for a couple of minutes I'll talk about it then we'll

952
01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:12.760
come back at is you have the discussion

953
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:22.410
we are trying to show,
I'm going to show you that we see over vd

954
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.260
is the same as VB over VA.

955
01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.080
I'm going to show that to you then.
You agree.
If I take the logs and the logs,

956
01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:38.050
we'll cancel.
How do I know this?

957
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:41.200
Well go back and use the fact that that's an eddy.

958
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.760
That's a nice of thermal process.

959
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.240
That's a nice to tell them at the price of that is an eddy a betting process.

960
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.130
That's an idea about process.

961
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

962
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.230
<v 0>This is temporary.
51 this is temperature t two this is a,
B,</v>

963
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:00.320
c,
d.
No,

964
01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:05.321
somewhere in your notes is the formula that in an eddy robotic process

965
01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.690
volume a times temperature,

966
01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:16.130
one to some strange power.
I don't care what the power is,
not going to matter.

967
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:22.070
It's the same.
Sorry.
Uh,
volume be

968
01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:28.670
times temperature to some power is the same as volume.
See the same,

969
01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.610
uh,
temperature t two to some power

970
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:40.690
because when the process id a we have seen PV to the gamma is constant,

971
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.640
but I told you,
you can also rate it as volume,

972
01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:47.470
times temperature to some power is a constant,
so BMC are correlated this way.

973
01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.630
Likewise,
a and D are connected by an antibiotic process,

974
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:58.870
so you can be sure that the a t that happens to be c one they used to some power

975
01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.340
is the same as v The p two raised to some power.

976
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.880
We don't care what the poverty is,
it's probably CV over our outerwear.
CB.

977
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:16.610
I'm not interested in that.
In fact,
if you go to this top right hand corner,

978
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.240
you can see this volume times t to the power of seaview overwrought,

979
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.670
but it's not important.
The fact that BMC,

980
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:26.640
Leanna idea baddie curve means that the volume would be and the temperature it'd

981
01:08:26.641 --> 01:08:30.680
be metabolized happens to be t one and the volume at sea and the temperature and

982
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:33.410
see what happens with the two are connected by this result.

983
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:37.360
Once I write it down for this idea of adding this idea of Adtech,
know,

984
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:42.370
divide that by that and that by that and the point is the t one two whatever

985
01:08:42.441 --> 01:08:43.550
poverty it is canceled,

986
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:48.551
stop and bottom up and bought them and I get the result I wanted which BB over

987
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.680
be a BC over bed.

988
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:54.230
Once you put that in,

989
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:59.470
you'll get the final result is one minus t two over t one s

990
01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:04.750
<v 2>yeah,</v>

991
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.660
<v 0>no,
there are some things you should know all the times and something you should</v>

992
01:09:07.661 --> 01:09:11.350
know some of the time in something you should have seen at least once the

993
01:09:11.351 --> 01:09:12.520
derivation of the result.

994
01:09:12.521 --> 01:09:16.300
You should have seen at least once in your life whether you can eat and your

995
01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:19.870
head or not.
I'm not interested in but what have I really done?

996
01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:26.190
I've taken an ideal gas and taking it over the cycle and I found out that in

997
01:09:26.351 --> 01:09:31.351
that cycle the ideal gas does function like a very primitive heat engine because

998
01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:32.141
it takes them heat.

999
01:09:32.141 --> 01:09:37.141
Q one rejects them heat cute too and does some work given by the shaded area and

1000
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:42.520
the ratio of work done to heat absorbed in the end happens to be one minus t two

1001
01:09:42.521 --> 01:09:45.880
over t one it does not depend on the gas.

1002
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:49.360
It depends only on the upper temperature in the lower temperature.

1003
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:55.450
Another question you can ask is why are you computing the efficiency of this

1004
01:09:55.451 --> 01:09:59.740
really primitive and stupid engine winners verus we are interested in real

1005
01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:04.150
Indian at GM is going to make or some steam ship is going to make or some Indian

1006
01:10:04.151 --> 01:10:04.984
is going to make.

1007
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.440
We will show next time that this efficiency is a theoretical maximum.

1008
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.380
I will show you the next time that no engine can beat the car,
no engine,

1009
01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:20.050
no engine can be as good.

1010
01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.370
It can be as good but cannot be better than the car engine and that's what makes

1011
01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:25.360
the dissolved important.

1012
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:31.090
It's a lot like a relativity example that to show you why time slows down and a

1013
01:10:31.091 --> 01:10:31.924
moving frame.

1014
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:35.890
I took a very stupid clock where the clock ticks because light beam goes up and

1015
01:10:35.891 --> 01:10:39.820
down.
That's not your idea for clock,
but in that clock,

1016
01:10:39.821 --> 01:10:41.350
if you can see why it slows down,

1017
01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:45.010
you know that every clock has to slow down because all plugs in a moving rocket

1018
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:47.320
must run at the same rate.
Otherwise,

1019
01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:50.590
you can compare the two clocks and find out you're moving.
Likewise,

1020
01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:55.930
if you take a very primitive engine or you can show that that engine is the most

1021
01:10:55.931 --> 01:10:58.090
efficient engine you are done,

1022
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.310
because that's going to put an upper limit on efficiency.

1023
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:05.290
So I'll come back and I'll tell you next time why no Indian can be this engine

1024
01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.200
and why hidden in this result is the notion of entropy.
