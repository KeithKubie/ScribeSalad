00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.780
If you like well-written animated films with heart,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.480
humor,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.720
and great action...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.940
Actually, scratch that.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.800
If you are currently or have ever been alive,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.320
then you probably love...

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.420
Experience a film that's got a little bit of everything,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.300
from Silver Age comic book heroes

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.220
to a dark snapshot of a dying marriage,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
slick, retro James Bond style

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.880
to a portrait of a mid-life crisis,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.020
the warm glow of familial love

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.840
to the soul crushing modern day workplace.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.920
Once again, you'll pay Pixar to yank your heart around like an emotional yo-yo.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.040
[Sobbing]

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.300
I love this!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.900
Meet the Parrs,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.320
an Incredible-y dysfunctional family.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.740
Violet is neglected,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.680
Dash is hurting people for fun,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.560
Bob is sneaking around behind his wife's back,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.360
and Helen's in denial about his obvious lies.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.700
"Have a great trip."

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.500
"Thanks, sweetie."

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.600
They've got more issues than a comic book shop,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.120
and the only way to resolve them...

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.380
is to put on spandex and beat the crap out of some robots together.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.180
"Ah, I love you."

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.540
Enter a world where the government has banned superheroes for fairly obvious reasons.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.200
"You knocked down a building?!"

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, Bob will have to adjust to not being able to punch people for a living

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.540
until he leaves in an opportunity to work for a killer robot company with a volcano lair.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.200
"I'm in."

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.740
Dude, you were a hero for like decades!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.420
You didn't see any red flags here?!

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.880
I'm starting to think this guy just wants to hurt people with no consequences!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.360
Hey, heroes don't do that!

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.360
Unless you're Batman.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.820
Batman totally does that.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.200
Cower before one of the best supervillains of all time:

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.240
Syndrome,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.240
a perfect prediction of today's entitled fanculture.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.280
He's a nerd who loves something so much

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.180
that when it didn't live up to his expectations,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.560
"You're not affiliated with me!"

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.940
he declared war on it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.880
And now, only the Incredibles can stop him from...

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.580
uh...

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.320
letting me buy rocket boots?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.060
"I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes."

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.360
Well, that's just great! Now how am I supposed to become a hero?!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.460
Toxic waste covered reptiles aren't cheap, you know!

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.100
"Radical, radical, radical!"

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.460
Enjoy the best Fantastic 4 movie never made

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.620
that fixes all the flaws from those awful, awful films:

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.200
having its 4 heroes feel like a real family,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.060
not treating their powers like a joke,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.880
and making it so Mr. Fantastic is married to The Thing,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.200
which is way hotter.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.260
I mean, better.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.940
I mean-

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.460
Dammit!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.500
They're just both so T H I C C.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.280
So cheer up, Logan,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.200
and turn that frown upside-down, Rorschach,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.720
'cause The Incredibles proves you don't have to be R-rated to be a violent, angsty superhero movie.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.480
With a super high body count,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.360
attempted suicide,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.520
heroes threatening to murder innocent people,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.480
"It'll be easy, like breaking a toothpick."

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.540
grown men shooting at little kids,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.580
and little kids killing grown men,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.680
you'll wonder what made Brad Bird fly into a homicidal rage between The Iron Giant and this movie.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.100
Uh, probably box office.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.420
"Money, money, money, money, money."

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.820
So, that whole cape rant that Edna goes on?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.560
"No capes!"

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.200
Were those her designs that got all those heroes killed before she learned her lesson?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.440
Because, uh, hoo, that's dark.
