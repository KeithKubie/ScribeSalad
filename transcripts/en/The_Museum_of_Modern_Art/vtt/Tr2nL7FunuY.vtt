Welcome back to "Fashion As Design."

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.480
This week we're gonna talk about heroes.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.370
Who is your fashion hero, Paola?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.600
Well mine is... Cate Blanchett.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Good choice.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
And Steph?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
Mine is Gloria Steinem.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Nice choice also.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.840
I would say mine is probably Claire McCardell,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.520
a designer from the mid-century that Stephanie

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.170
told me about and I now love.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.470
Well, what do we mean when we say fashion
hero, first of all?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
It's a good question.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.980
Well, I meant very simply what I want to look
like and also what I want to project.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.320
So, hey, that's it.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.210
And I think that could apply to a variety
of different types of people, be it a sports

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.260
hero, a pop cultural hero, an intellectual
hero even or a designer who's spearheading

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
what clothes look like.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Or all of the above.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Yeah.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.429
So what are we going to get to look at in
this module?

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.059
So this week we have pulled together many
different types of heroes.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.709
We're gonna look first and foremost at Bruce
Lee's original tracksuit which we had remade

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.170
by Bruce's daughter and by the Bruce Lee Foundation.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.200
We started out with sports heroes and we talk
about sub-cultural heroes, about military

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.090
and political heroes, not to mention celebrities
and pop stars.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.500
And then we ended up thinking, not even of
the present but of the future, landing on

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Mars.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.219
So when we talk about heroes, we mean the
wearer themselves imbues the garment or the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.930
item with something and then it ultimately
allows other wearers to, perhaps aspire and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.189
just admire that person.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.909
And in so doing, try to wear the garment as
well and feel a little, a small sense of that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.909
heroism.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.369
Yeah, so is this really universal sense to
the idea of a hero or a fashion hero, the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.869
idea that maybe we all know the Air Force
1 sneakers, for example, or we all at least

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.400
know that basketball and sneakers go hand
in hand.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.899
But there's also this very personal sense
of aspiration, of emotion, of ways in which

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.549
we can be, by wearing something, [00:03:00]
maybe just a little bit closer to someone

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.609
that we all really admire.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:13.400
Paola: And the idea is also that certain garments
can make you stand up taller even feel bigger

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.730
if you're small.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.700
I'm always thinking of some of the smallest
heroes in history and I'm thinking of Prince

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.580
and I'm thinking of Bruce Lee who was actually...how
tall was he?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.140
He was 5'7" or 5'8," I think.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.210
He was quite a petite man and yet you wouldn't
be messing with him in a dark alley

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.210
at night.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.320
No, and also seeing him...I mean, we know
that so many movie stars are smaller than

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.120
we think but he was really a giant in the
movies, right?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120
Yeah.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.230
So I think that people will be amazed when
they will see the tracksuit but also they

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.290
will understand the power of the personalities
that fill the garments.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.980
We're very happy that you spent another week
with us and we hope to see you next week again

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.760
for the course, "Fashion As Design."
