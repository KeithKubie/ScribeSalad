00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.280
- [Instructor] In other videos,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.960
we've discussed the causes and effects

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.910
of westward expansion in the 19th century,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.590
focusing on the period that
began with the discovery

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.200
of gold in California in 1849

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.490
and ending shortly after the Civil War.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.370
But westward expansion was a long process.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.510
Eight new states entered the Union

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.790
between 1876 and 1896.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.730
And not until nearly the
turn of the 20th century

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.550
did the superintendent of the US Census

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.680
declare that the frontier was now closed.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.260
US territories stretched all
the way to the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.780
We've talked a bit about what
caused people to move west

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.920
and what effects the
immigration of millions

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.980
of non-native people
west of the Mississippi

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.090
had on that region and on
the United States as a whole

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090
before and during the Civil War.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.130
In this video, I want to pick up the story

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.640
after the Civil War and
discuss how westward expansion

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.980
affected the society
and culture of the West

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.910
at the end of the 19th century.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.920
Let's quickly review some of the causes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.710
of westward expansion that
were already established

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.270
by the end of the Civil War.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.830
Starting in the 1840s,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.250
Americans and European
immigrants began moving west

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.550
looking for farmland.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.740
And the California Gold Rush of 1849

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530
brought people from all over the world

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.980
into the region to either pan for gold

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.720
or to make some money off the people

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.150
who were panning for gold.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390
The construction of the
transcontinental railroad

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.960
also provided many jobs for
those who didn't strike it rich.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.830
The US government facilitated
this westward expansion

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.930
by granting millions of
acres to railroad companies,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.730
making it easier to get west

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.310
and to get goods from the West back East.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.270
The government also encouraged settlement

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.550
through grants of 160 acres of free land

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.320
to anyone willing to improve it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.450
over the course of five years.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.650
Lastly, many American
migrants were convinced

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.690
through cultural messaging
that American civilization

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.130
was divinely ordained
to occupy North America

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.380
from Atlantic to Pacific in an ideology

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.360
known as Manifest Destiny.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.550
All of these things continued
to motivate westward expansion

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.230
in the years after the Civil War,

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.370
but there were a few unique aspects

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.030
in this era that intensified the changes

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.800
wrought by westward expansion.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.070
First, the US government
began to take a new approach

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.620
towards its interactions
with Native Americans.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.680
Instead of treating Native American tribes

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100
as independent nations,
the government began

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.680
to cast them as wards of the state,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.940
relics of an earlier time that had to take

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.450
up American ways or face extinction.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.510
They began to confine Native Americans

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.530
to reservations and
classify any individual

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.300
or group that refused as hostile.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.750
Another related thing that changed

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.550
was that after the Civil War,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.640
the US Army could apply its full might

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.520
to subduing the West through
a series of conflicts

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.610
with Native Americans
called the Indian Wars.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.740
One thing I find fascinating
about these conflicts

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.470
was that many of the
generals who led campaigns

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.330
in the Indian Wars were
former Union generals

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.740
who had fought to end slavery in the South

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.870
during the Civil War,
including Oliver O. Howard,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.610
the commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.140
What do you think their
approach to Native Americans

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.670
versus African Americans
says about how they conceived

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.090
of American citizenship
in this time period?

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.850
The effects of westward
expansion also intensified

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.000
after the Civil War.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.300
As we've already mentioned,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.580
one effect of Americans' westward push

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.710
was violence against Native Americans

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.130
and other minorities.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.570
The US Army forced Native
Americans onto reservations

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.370
or hunted them down when Native Americans

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.670
attempted to prevent white settlers

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.860
from encroaching on those reservations,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.100
like when gold was discovered
on the Sioux reservation

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.140
in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.830
The US Army also
prevented Native Americans

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.020
from engaging in rituals
like The Ghost Dance,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.360
which they feared would kindle resistance

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.890
among Native Americans.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.620
In 1890, an Army regiment disarmed

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.010
a Lakota Sioux encampment
near Wounded Knee Creek.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.430
And while the Lakotas were
giving up their weapons,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.610
one rifle accidentally discharged.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.500
The US Army then massacred somewhere

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.570
between 200 and 300 men,
women, and children.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.940
Other minorities in the West

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.990
were also subject to racial violence

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.970
including Mexican Americans,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.250
who were driven off their lands by force,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.180
and Chinese immigrants, who were targeted

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.230
in race riots throughout California.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.360
Minorities also faced
the loss of their land

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.330
and their cultures in the West.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.850
The most significant land
loss came as a result

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.320
of the Dawes Act of 1887.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.930
The Dawes Act sought to
force Native Americans

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.510
to stop living communally
and take up American culture

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.920
and farming by splitting up reservations

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.780
and awarding 160 acres of land
to each head of household,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.430
sort of like the Homestead Act.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.090
But unlike the Homestead Act,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.270
Native Americans had to improve the land

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.590
and behave like whites for 25 years

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.880
to get title and American
citizenship, not just five.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.100
And due to corruption in
administering this policy,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.300
Native Americans were placed

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.070
on the worst land for farming,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.060
or their land allotments were given

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.590
to white settlers instead.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.960
All in all, the Dawes
Act resulted in the loss

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.950
of over 80 million acres
of Native American land.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.730
Similarly, government
agents turned a deaf ear

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.160
towards the claims of Mexican Americans

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.660
whose land was claimed by white settlers

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.500
even though Mexican Americans
had been US citizens

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.550
since the end of the Mexican War.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.740
The same impulse to force Native Americans

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.720
to assimilate into
American living patterns

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.380
also drove the creation

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.840
of Indian boarding schools in this era.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.070
Native children were
removed from their homes

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.460
and sent to boarding schools

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.260
like the Carlisle Indian Industrial School

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.720
in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.500
There they would be forced
to cut off their long hair,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.630
change into American-style clothing,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.270
and take up new American-sounding names.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.100
These schools lasted until the 1970s.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.010
Chinese immigrants, by contrast,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.700
were judged incapable of assimilation.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.720
In 1882, Congress passed
the Chinese Exclusion Act,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.450
the first immigration restriction

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.080
to prevent all members of an ethnic group

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.740
from entering the United States.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.630
Restrictions on Chinese immigration

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.330
would not be completely
abolished until 1965.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.230
There were also some

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.867
far-reaching environmental transformations

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:21.170
resulting from westward expansion.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.110
One of these was the near
extinction of the American bison,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.500
also known as the buffalo.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.340
Huge herds of buffalo
roamed the American West

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.110
for all of recorded history in the area.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.200
Plains Indians had over-hunted them

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.580
in the years before large-scale
immigration to the West,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.870
but the coming of the railroad

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.820
signed the buffalos' death warrant.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.710
There were about 15
million buffalo in the West

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.070
at the end of the Civil War,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.220
but less than 20 years later

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.960
there were fewer than
1,000 buffalo remaining

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.690
due to whites hunting them for sport

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.100
or clearing them from rail lines.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.590
This left Plains Indians,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.490
who depended on the buffalo
for meat and clothing,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.410
in a state of near-starvation,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.170
making it even more difficult for them

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.920
to resist being forced onto reservations.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.670
Plains Indians were also affected

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.610
by the development of
barbed wire in this era,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.870
which white settlers used to fence off

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.440
what had been communal grazing lands.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.860
This was also a hardship for cowboys,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.640
who once had driven herds
of cattle to railroad depots

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.110
over long stretches of open range.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.700
By the end of the 19th century,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.940
there was little to no
open range left at all.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.240
Lastly, the spread of settlers

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.890
into the arid western
part of the Great Plains

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.200
led to massive irrigation projects

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.660
in order to supply lands

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.840
that weren't really naturally
suited to farming with water.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.550
This meant damming and diverting rivers

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.160
and the use of farming techniques

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.600
that would later contribute to the ravages

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.890
of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.090
Who has access to water
and for what purposes

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.180
is still a major source of conflict

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.540
in the American West.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.310
So as we look forward
into the 20th century

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.710
from our vantage point here at the edge

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.180
of the American Frontier,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.340
let's take some time to think

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.080
about what the story of westward expansion

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.760
tells us about how Americans
thought about citizenship

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.730
and access to resources
in this time period.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.110
How will those ideas
influence the United States

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.660
once it begins to step on the world stage

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.753
and look for new frontiers
outside of North America?
