00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.620
In the last video, I talked
about how Bitcoin transactions

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.950
are really incorporated
into a global and a publicly

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.631
accessible ledger of sorts that
we call the transaction block

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:12.130
chain.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.060
And this work is
actually carried out

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.100
by nodes in the
Bitcoin network that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.300
are known as Bitcoin miners.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.100
And as a reward for
all that effort,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.870
especially since some of the
computational heavy lifting

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.050
is done by these
Bitcoin miners, they're

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.230
basically awarded a
certain number of Bitcoins

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.500
for their efforts.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.250
And this happens by
the miners effectively

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.000
constructing what's called
a coinbase transaction,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.820
and then basically assigning
themselves Bitcoins

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.175
within that transaction.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.550
So in a sense,
then-- and this is

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.280
kind of intriguing--
Bitcoins are effectively

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.414
generated almost out of thin
air during this process.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.330
And of course, if you
see something like that,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.250
that might raise in
your mind the question

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.720
of whether there is ever an
upper limit to the Bitcoin

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.320
money supply.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.570
And fortunately, the
answer-- or maybe not

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.850
so fortunately, depending
on your viewpoint--

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.274
the answer to that
question is actually yes.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:04.690
And the Bitcoin
system is actually

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.950
designed so that there can be
at most 21 million Bitcoins ever

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.450
generated.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.090
OK, so that's the maximum
number of Bitcoins

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.950
that can ever come
up in the system.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.797
Beyond that point,
no more new Bitcoins

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:22.255
will ever be accepted
or generated,

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.310
or allowed to be generated.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.145
And so as a result, nodes at
that point-- from that point

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.940
onward, once 21 million
Bitcoins have been generated--

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.240
nodes will no longer get
a reward for augmenting

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.100
the transaction block chain.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.490
The Bitcoin miners
who do all this effort

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.480
are not going to
get a guaranteed

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.435
award for doing that effort.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.435
And keep in mind that,
because every transaction

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:47.910
in the Bitcoin system is public,
and the nodes in the system

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.290
actually know how many
coins have been generated,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.800
it's possible to really
enforce these limits

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.075
on the total number
of Bitcoins created.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.450
Now there are
actually two points

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.408
I want to make regarding
this particular limit.

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.569
So first of all, even
after it's reached,

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.110
we're still going
to need nodes to do

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.350
what Bitcoin mining
nodes do today.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.530
So that involves things like
incorporating transactions

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.390
into transaction blocks, and
incorporating these transaction

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620
blocks into transaction block
chains, and so on and so forth.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.380
But if you think about it for
a moment, once the 21 million

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.190
coin limit is
reached, these nodes

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.520
don't get that automatic
reward of Bitcoins

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.369
for performing
this extra effort.

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.910
And now you might
be wondering, well,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.110
what incentive is
there for these nodes

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.635
to engage in this
additional effort?

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.510
I mean, why are they
doing this sort of thing

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.780
if they're not going to
get Bitcoins as a guarantee

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.200
for doing that work?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.640
And really at this
point, the hope

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.410
is that, when we reach the
21 million Bitcoin limit--

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.310
or as we get closer and
closer to it-- that actually

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.180
transaction fees will play a
more prominent role in a node's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.930
decision to be a
Bitcoin mining node.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.007
And in particular,
the idea here is

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:00.590
that we hope the
transaction fees will

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.150
be enough of an incentive,
and more and more people

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.877
will-- in general,
I think, hopefully,

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:07.460
by this point-- will
be using Bitcoin.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.172
And so as a result, I think
there is an expectation--

00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:13.630
or it's not
unreasonable to think--

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.210
that as more and more
people use Bitcoins,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.940
there will be more
and more transactions,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.690
and as a result, more
and more opportunity

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.100
to make money off
of transaction fees.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.544
And it turns out that in the
context of Bitcoin mining,

00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:26.960
a lot of the heavy lifting is
in this proof-of-work piece,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.480
not in being able to incorporate
all these transactions

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.015
into a transaction block.

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:33.850
So even if there's a lot of
transactions in the transaction

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.252
block, it's not that much
more effort for the miners

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:39.210
to really incorporate
those extra transactions.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.450
But if they're getting all
these extra transaction fees,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.230
then that might be an
incentive for them.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.100
It's also worth noting that
transaction fees are actually

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.810
set by the payer in Bitcoin.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.700
The payer, then,
is going to have

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.440
the onus of setting
the fee appropriately,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.210
so that the nodes in
the Bitcoin network

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.310
are incentivized
to add that payer's

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.900
transactions to their
transaction blocks.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.700
So hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.710
The second point I want to
make, regarding this limit

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.870
of 21 million Bitcoins,
is that really Bitcoin

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.939
does allow for fractional coins.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.730
And I haven't really
talked much about that

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.605
in this video series.

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:24.540
I've really implicitly talked
only about the idea of coins

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.680
being these whole entities,
like Alice transferring

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.195
10 coins to Bob, or 25
coins to Bob, and so on.

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:31.570
But it turns out
you can actually

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.670
have coins that are fractional.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.620
And in fact, the smallest
possible unit in Bitcoin--

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:48.940
it's a very small number--
it's 0.00000001 Bitcoins.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.730
And this is 1/100-million
of a Bitcoin.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.670
And this actual--
this unit, by the way,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.720
just as an FYI-- is
known as a Satoshi.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.510
And this name actually comes
from the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.485
And Satoshi Nakamoto
is the pseudonym

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:09.330
of the inventor of Bitcoin.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.320
Nobody actually is sure that
there is somebody actually

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.775
named Satoshi Nakamoto, but
as far as anybody can tell,

00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:16.400
the only person who's
ever taken credit

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.120
for the invention of Bitcoin
is this Satoshi Nakamoto name.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.140
And it's unlikely
there's actually

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.150
a person behind that
name, but it's more likely

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.594
maybe some type of a group,
or something of that nature.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.260
Now, aside from that,
there are actually

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.310
a couple of other
additional controls

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.660
that I want to mention, that are
built into Bitcoin for keeping

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.930
the growth of that
money supply in check.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.120
So first of all, the reward
provided to Bitcoin miners

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.350
actually decreases over time.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.440
And if you were
aware-- when Bitcoin

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.450
began, which was around
January of 2009-- at that time,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.340
the reward for a Bitcoin
miner to do their effort

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.420
was 50 Bitcoins.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.640
Now, the way that the reward
structure is set up is that

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.010
every 210,000 blocks-- so when
you get to a 210,000-block

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.470
period, every time 210,000
new blocks are generated--

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.520
the reward size actually
gets cut in half.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.800
And so what that means is
that once 210,000 blocks are

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.560
generated, the reward goes from
50 Bitcoins to 25 Bitcoins,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.450
and from 25 to 12 and 1/2,
and so on and so forth.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.550
Now, it does take
approximately 4 years

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.010
to generate 210,000 blocks,
and I'll talk a little bit

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.120
later about where this 4
years numbers come from.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.850
But as of right now, I'm
recording this video--

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.410
it's May 2013-- the current
reward is actually no longer 50

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.910
Bitcoins.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.260
The current reward
now is actually

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.500
25 Bitcoins per
mining operation,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.430
and it's going to go down
half in approximately 4 years.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.860
And that's just going
to keep happening,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.450
until-- the estimate is
around the year 2140.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:14.730
So in the year 2140, we will
expect that the entire Bitcoin

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.299
supply will have been generated.

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:18.090
So we're not going to--
it's unlikely we'll

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.590
be generating
Bitcoins after 2140.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.789
2140 is the point at
which all Bitcoins

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:25.830
will have been generated.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.100
Now, the last way to limit
the generation of Bitcoins

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.780
is to actually
calibrate the difficulty

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.309
of solving that proof-of-work
protocol at a global level.

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:43.725
And so I also want to point
out that another functionality

00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:45.460
that Bitcoin has
built into it is

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.740
that for every 2016
blocks that are generated,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.910
the network basically
estimates the time that it

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.640
took to generate those blocks.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.670
It looks at how long
did it take to generate

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.252
the first of these blocks,
and how long did it

00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:02.001
take to generate the
last of these blocks,

00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:04.400
and it measures
that amount of time.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.660
And if that amount
of time is-- let's

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:15.600
say it's something that's
significantly bigger than 2

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.740
weeks.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.860
So if it's significantly
bigger than 2 weeks,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.304
then the proof-of-work
protocol will be simplified.

00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:24.220
But we're going to
calibrate it so it's easier

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.950
to generate blocks.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.480
On the flip side, let's say it
took a lot less than 2 weeks

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.260
to generate these 2016 blocks.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.929
In that case, the proof of
work will be again calibrated

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.980
to be made more difficult.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.120
And the goal is that
we want it to be

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.700
the case that, of
2016 blocks, we

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.600
want it to be the case that it
takes about 2 weeks to generate

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.280
these blocks-- about 14 days
to generate 2016 blocks.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.460
And to get a better sense
for why that number is

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.470
the way it is, you could
see that-- let's say

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.345
it takes about 2 weeks
to generate 2016 blocks.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:08.810
What that actually will imply is
that it takes about 10 minutes

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.110
before the proof of
work is actually solved,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.685
and a new transaction is--
or a new transaction block,

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:18.100
rather-- is folded into the
overall transaction block

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.770
chain.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.650
And you can actually
work out that if you--

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.740
if it took 10 minutes to
validate, or to come up

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.930
with one new block in the
system at a global level,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.130
and you multiply that by 6
to get the number of blocks

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.620
generated per hour-- so
you'd get 6 blocks per hour,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.910
or really 6 new proofs of work
per hour, which in turn would

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.460
lead to 6 new transaction
blocks per hour--

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.520
you multiply that
by 24 hours per day.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.090
And then you multiply
that by 14 days,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.950
and you'll actually find that
when you multiply these things

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:55.270
together, you will
get the number 2016.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.900
And so you can get a sense for
where this number comes from.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.920
And I want to make one last,
final clarifying remark

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.200
regarding this proof of work.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.813
Since solving the
proof of work actually

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.750
requires a Bitcoin
mining node to come up

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.500
with the proof string--
which it currently

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.880
does through some type
of exhaustive search--

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.590
as you increase the number
of Bitcoin mining nodes

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.790
on the network, then really,
all else being equal,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.289
the proof of work
will be solved faster.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.205
But I don't mean faster
for a particular node.

00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:26.510
I mean faster at the level
of the entire network.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.490
In other words,
it'll take less time

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.207
before at least one node
comes up with a solution,

00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:33.540
because these nodes are all
working on that same problem

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.579
concurrently.

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:36.120
And actually, on
that note, I do also

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.180
want to mention quickly maybe
a more subtle point, which

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.610
is that-- even though the
different Bitcoin mining nodes

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.740
are all validating either the
exact same set of transactions,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.190
or maybe a largely overlapping
set of transactions--

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.170
they actually are
all solving entirely

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.580
different
proof-of-work protocols

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.163
when they're doing
this sort of thing.

00:10:56.163 --> 00:10:58.500
And the reason for that is
that each node, remember,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.630
inserts its own coinbase,
or generational transaction,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.750
into the block that it's working
on to award itself coins.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.340
And this generational
or coinbase transaction

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.460
is actually unique to each node.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.710
So as a result, the challenge
string for which, let's say,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.659
each Bitcoin mining node is
seeking a corresponding proof

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:19.950
of work-- well, that challenge
string will be different

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.860
for each Bitcoin-- each
Bitcoin mining node, rather.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.235
And so essentially,
what you have

00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:27.151
is that, because you
have a cryptographic hash

00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:28.970
function that's being
used in the process,

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.950
just this one
difference-- the fact

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.190
that just this one piece is
different-- that actually

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.390
completely randomizes the
proof-of-work problem that

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.440
results.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.870
And that makes it likely that
across the entire network,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.480
the solutions are likely
to be widely distributed,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.680
and we can expect that
if we have enough nodes,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.259
one node will come up with a
solution in about 10 minutes.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:50.550
At least one of the nodes will.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.930
They won't all do
it, but at least one

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.100
will, and once one node
comes up with a solution,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.390
everyone else can proceed
from that point onward

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.060
with the new chain.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.580
So as you can see,
the Bitcoin protocol

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.080
takes a number of
measures-- implements

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.790
a number of mechanisms--
to both limit

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.330
the total number of
Bitcoins, as well

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.880
as the rate at which these
Bitcoins are ultimately

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.430
generated.
