[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.460
SACHA JENKINS: Hello,
everyone at Google and people

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.540
who are googling in the
world somewhere vast.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.550
My name is Sacha
Jenkins, and I am here

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.160
with this gentleman
here who is from Queens.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.150
Went to the same--

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.370
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.000
We went to the same lackluster
junior high school in Queens.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.950
And for me it's really
powerful to see him

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.380
and the success he has.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.230
And I told him recently--I had
the good fortune of seeing him

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.970
perform at the Kennedy Center,
which I'll talk about later.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.546
But when he was on stage in
front of a 80-piece orchestra

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:50.420
performing these songs
that you guys are here

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.510
to celebrate and
learn about, it was--

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.155
I had flashbacks of my
junior high school stage

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.200
that he attended.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.290
And to see him at
the Kennedy Center

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.180
really says a lot not only
about where hip-hop has come,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.200
but where Nas has come
from, and where he is,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.490
and it's a real testament
to why we're all here today.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.192
So give the brother
another round of applause.

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:22.740
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.270
Who let the dogs out?

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.072
So I was joking
with him backstage.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:31.280
I mean, I'm looking down now.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.070
My man has Timbos.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.230
And I said to him, it
feels like in '94, he

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.120
did an amazing front flip
and landed on his feet.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.020
And here we are in 2014 and
it's like he did a back flip

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870
and landed on his feet.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.680
And I've been sort of
loosely in the music

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.650
business for some years writing
about it, producing things

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.140
relative to music.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.920
And I've never seen an album
that is 20 years old still have

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.935
such a frenzied interest coming
from so many different people.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.990
I was saying to him
how does it feel?

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.956
It's almost like this "Illmatic"
is a brand new record in 2014.

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:19.940
NAS: Well, I'm happy
that you are here.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.620
And today feels like
1994, and what I mean

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.810
is it feels like a whole
new beginning for me.That's

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.930
just my little way of
looking at things today

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.220
because of reissue
of the record.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.479
So it takes me back.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.020
SACHA JENKINS: It
takes you back how?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.280
NAS: Like just
the people who was

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.855
around me making this record--
I think about them-- the people

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:07.660
who were in the studio with
me, hanging out with me,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.020
listening to the record,
the works in progress,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.910
and telling me their opinions
while I'm working on the songs.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.800
It takes me back
to riding around

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.700
with no license in Harlem,
and Brooklyn, and the Bronx

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.810
in my first car-- Lexus
GS300, and no license.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.435
And excited it had
a Nakamichi system,

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:45.450
and it came with the car.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.160
And it was just like
going in from hanging

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.580
in my boys' cars listening to
the songs as I was making them.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.100
And then when it was done, and
then getting my own first car,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.680
and then riding in
that with my boys,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.380
and just going all the
way around New York.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.460
And it just brings me
back to those fun times.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.000
SACHA JENKINS: Eating Chinese
food, Harry's chicken wings--

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.990
NAS: When I got my first car,
I still had the Chinese food,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.750
but I ate better Chinese food.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.414
SACHA JENKINS: Nice.

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:23.350
NAS: Yeah.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.560
SACHA JENKINS: I've been
thinking about it a bit.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.220
And, again, having this
conversation about front

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.070
flips and back flips--
and we have microphones.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.830
At some point, people can
weigh in, specifically

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.340
on "Illmatic"-related
questions--

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.040
but it feels like because the
climate in hip-hop has changed

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.560
so much and that intelligence
is actually valued,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.040
it feels like that's why
Nas' work, why "Illmatic"

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.810
is still uber-relevant
today because of the level

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.120
of intelligence and
thoughtfulness that he put

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.600
into his lyrics,
and his delivery,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.370
and the music that supported it.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.730
To me, it feels like
hip-hop, in general, now,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.580
and the people who
create hip-hop,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.080
and the culture around
hip-hop, and the culture

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.640
that hip-hop fuels,
intelligence is

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.360
something that's really valued.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.020
Where when you came out,
you were a real jewel,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.870
and you still are,
but now it feels

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.880
like we're encouraging more
young people to be intelligent.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.380
NAS: Yeah.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.400
I get with that.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.050
If you think about
Kendrick Lamar, where

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.510
he's at with his lyrics-- and
you know that this kid's got

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.080
some sense.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.780
You know he's got
something to say.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.370
You know he knows how
to tell his story.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.580
He's clear about
his perspective,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.080
and he still flows
like an animal.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.970
So same as SchoolBoy Q,
and the rest of the guys

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.030
you guys have on the
film-- Tech N9ne, Jay Rock.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.750
You can tell
they're street guys,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.850
but these are the guys
that got some sense.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.000
And I love it because the guys
before me had a lot to give.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.270
You know what I mean?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.530
And so I took from that,
and then I give it out,

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.057
and then it just keeps going.

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:11.640
SACHA JENKINS: Well,
talk a little bit

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.706
about some of the guys
who had a lot to give.

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:17.500
Personally, I'm from Astoria.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.570
I take pride in Super
Lover Cee and Casanova Rud.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.700
And I threw that
out at you because I

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.770
hear a little bit of
that influence in there.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.540
Can you talk about
some of the people

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.910
who have helped create this
miraculous flow that you have?

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.410
NAS: Man, I mean it's just like
you're listening to these guys,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.920
and you're thinking to
yourself it's magic.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.920
These guys have this magical
gift to do what they're doing.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.930
And you want to do it.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.060
The guys you just mentioned,
Super Lover Cee, Casanova Rud,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:54.210
MC Shan, Chuck D, Rakim,
Kool G Rap, Kane--

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.480
there's so many guys
that opened my head up

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.150
about a lot of things.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.880
So I knew that if
I got into rap,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.710
I wouldn't be accepted unless
my presentation, my first record

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.250
was accepted by those guys.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.485
So I had that in mind
when I made the record

00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:19.560
that Kool G Rap had to
love it, or else I failed.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.200
SACHA JENKINS: Well, talk
about that because you

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.240
are from Queensbridge,
which many people think

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.180
is an actual town when it's
an actual housing project.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.930
And it is a town
in itself in that

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.490
its own community
center, and supermarket,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.670
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.150
But it was also home to so
many really important MCs.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.945
It was the home of Marley Marl.

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:45.180
So when you say stuff like "Kool
G Rap really had to like it,"

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.060
you could have run
into him at the bodega.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.050
Talk about that sort of
legacy of where you came from,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.330
and how that really
pushed you or inspired

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.110
you to do what you
wound up doing.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.860
NAS: Yeah, so I had my heroes.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:08.048
I'd go to the record store
when they had record stores

00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:12.010
and buy these guys' 12"
singles and buy their albums.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.630
And then I would see them
because, like Sacha said,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.540
DJ Marley Marl, who's
a hip-hop pioneer

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.870
producer from my
neighborhood, was

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.430
the guy behind the
production from Biz Markie

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.830
to Big Daddy Kane, Roxanne
Shante, the Juice Crew.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.365
And I would see Kool G
Rap signing autographs,

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:33.650
or MC Shan shooting a video
on the hill on the projects,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.980
or just see MC Shan
washing his Audi.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.101
And it made me feel
like, I'm in the place.

00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.059
I'm in the right place.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.540
I'm around this
energy right here

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.480
that is going to
pass through me.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.420
And at some point, it's going
to be my turn at the stage.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.980
And when I get there,
I've got to do it right.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.090
You know what I mean?

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.480
So I saw a lot of
good in those guys.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.370
And I saw their mistakes--
the chinks in the armor.

00:09:05.415 --> 00:09:07.980
Their mistakes
were lessons for me

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.275
when I saw their careers
start to decline,

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:17.380
or I saw an artist messing
with drugs too much.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.250
And anything that was
not good for his career,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.160
I saw it mess them up.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.970
So, for me, I said
I don't want that.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.074
I don't want to be a
rap star where they're

00:09:31.074 --> 00:09:32.490
going to watch
you, and judge you,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.730
and the slightest thing
you do, you fell off.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.490
I said the way I want
to approach music

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.506
is going to be
just the way I am.

00:09:39.506 --> 00:09:40.880
It's going to be
the Timberlands.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.180
It's going to be the Army
jackets, just the way

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.260
we are outside.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.560
I wanted to put that into
the record from the package

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.060
into the songs.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.500
So that was how I was different
from the guys before me.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.910
They were great, amazing guys.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.090
So I had to tell a
story that was my own.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.800
I couldn't be Kool
G Rap, and Eric B,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.250
and Rakim, and Big Daddy
Kane because these guys were

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.280
superstars with the big
chains and the Rolls-Royces.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.440
And that didn't come
until later for me.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.400
But, yeah, my
approach was to talk

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.910
about that kid on the corner.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.290
I wanted that kid
who wasn't on stage.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.634
I wanted the stage to
come to him on the block.

00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:31.800
SACHA JENKINS: But before
you became famous, before,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.510
like today, he's like the
number one trending topic

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:40.760
on Twitter and all that, you
had infamy in the projects.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.070
That was probably your
first taste of yo,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.520
little man is nice.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.210
Like is there a poignant
moment you remember

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.950
where you were at the bodega, at
the laundromat, whatever, just

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.120
walking around, and just hearing
like people buzzing about you?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.540
Because this is before records.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.200
This is when there's [INAUDIBLE]
on 12th Street or whatever.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.230
And people just
knew you were nice.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.410
NAS: It was a small group
that really knew I rhymed.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.830
I never really let
everybody know.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.070
I wasn't the outgoing guy.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.010
I wasn't yelling.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.700
I wasn't looking for attention.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.535
I used to watch all of
the other guys do it,

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.660
and I didn't know where
they were headed with that.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.490
And I'm like OK, it's
going to burn out.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.450
It's like I was more to myself.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:36.490
So when it did get out there
that I rapped-- when it really

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.030
got out there was like 1991
when "Live at the Barbeque"

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.580
came out with Main Source.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.601
That's when the neighborhood
knew that I rapped.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.600
SACHA JENKINS: So do you
remember the first time

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.960
hearing it on the radio?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.600
Or what was a
poignant moment when

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.710
you felt "Live at the
Barbeque" is popping,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.320
like, I might have a chance?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.790
Things are starting to move.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.800
NAS: Yeah, I was walking
through my neighborhood.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.020
And I couldn't find none
of my friends one night.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.880
So I just went walking
up the hill and down.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.020
I seen a bunch of the older guys
together, hanging out, talking.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.565
There was a car, music
blasting from the car.

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:15.720
It was a radio-- late.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.700
And they were older than me, but
I didn't know where else to go

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.330
hang out.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.030
I was bored, so I just kind of
hung out where they were at.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.104
And then the song came on,
"Live at the Barbeque."

00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:26.520
At first I thought
I was tripping.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.740
And then I'm like
it's really coming on.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.720
The song really came on.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.170
And these guys are
having a good time.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.480
They're talking
amongst themselves.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.290
Well, they're loud.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.020
And I'm trying to
get one of them

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.950
to notice this is
me on the radio.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.650
And they didn't even
listen to me, man.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.870
They were so caught up, so
I just blocked them out.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.270
And then I'm just there sitting
and hearing myself, just

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.700
smiling to myself,
and I walked away.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.260
And I probably got home
and made some phone calls.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.720
SACHA JENKINS: Did you have
a beeper at that point?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.220
NAS: Yeah.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.261
SACHA JENKINS: All right.

00:13:12.261 --> 00:13:13.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.210
So you'd call people, you missed
them, and then they beeped you.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.650
You said all right,
son, I'll try

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.800
answering machines
and stuff like that?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.520
NAS: Something like that.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.910
SACHA JENKINS: The album
is such a rich portrait

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.033
of what your life
was in the projects.

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:32.420
And people in Australia,
people in New Zealand,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.730
people in Switzerland now
know what Queensbridge

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.750
is, or know what
your experience was.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.620
But while there's this great
fascination with projects

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.679
and project life,
sometimes it feels

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:45.220
like people who were
from the outside

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.840
have like a one-dimensional
kind of perspective

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.160
on what project life is.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.330
Can you just tell
us the full scope

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.230
of the people who
live in the projects?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.130
It's not just crackheads, and
crack dealers, and rappers.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.630
NAS: Right.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.130
Right.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.770
Right.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.391
There's other people, too.

00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:03.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.590
Especially, coming out of
the '80s into the '90s,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:14.950
the '80s was so much fun
for me and the '90s, too.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.950
I mean, as a neighborhood,
as a community,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.730
you learned to
protect your community

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.030
by the older people that were
out there when you were a kid.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.890
If you were coming
from a neighborhood,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.717
you were a little bit too far
away from your neighborhood,

00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:33.800
it'd get a little sketchy.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.420
And people notice you're
not from out there.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.340
Next day you know,
you're getting chased.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.320
So it felt good to
get closer and closer

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.900
back to your neighborhood.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.470
Then you see somebody
that can go call somebody.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.970
Yo!

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.870
Somebody's after
my man over there.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.655
So-- man, where was I?

00:14:53.655 --> 00:14:55.280
SACHA JENKINS: Talking
about community.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.230
NAS: Community,
community, community.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.297
So that sense of
community is so important

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:00.880
because you've got
all these families,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.364
and you grew up
around each other.

00:15:02.364 --> 00:15:03.530
We played football together.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.140
We played basketball together.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.040
We'd joke on each other.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.170
Holidays, whatever-- it's
just this great community,

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.160
and we spent a lot of
time with each other,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.683
and it becomes like a family.

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:20.730
And that was a real
good side of it.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.280
You always hear-- I
remember I did VH1.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.740
I didn't want to do
it "Behind the Music"

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.830
because I said please
don't narrow it down

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.979
to just me talking
like hood stuff.

00:15:31.979 --> 00:15:33.020
You know what I'm saying?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.530
Because then it makes it
the typical rap story,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.510
crack dealing.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.550
I walked outside, and it
was this, and it was that.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.990
But it's hard not
to tell that story

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.270
because people need
to hear those truths.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.010
They need to hear what was
going on across the bridge

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.370
from Madison Avenue.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.550
They need to hear the truth.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.560
They need to hear the
ugly side because that's

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.190
how we fix the future.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.040
You can't ignore it.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:04.760
You can't sweep it under the rug
and let this injustice happen

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.990
in this great city right here.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.200
So I became a voice.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.030
Yeah, there's nice
things going on,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.920
but I had to let you know what
I was going through as a kid.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.610
So it was a balance.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.870
It was, I guess survival.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.580
It was survival.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.820
I walked outside one morning,
and I heard some shots

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.630
and seen some guys running and
pointing guns at each other.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.205
And a young girl was
coming out of her building.

00:16:31.205 --> 00:16:33.330
And I must have been
about 15 years old.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.550
She was probably 13, and she
had got shot in her stomach.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.620
And it just missed me.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.230
And she was the nicest girl.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.190
She went to my
elementary school before.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.936
I knew her brother.

00:16:45.936 --> 00:16:47.671
If they're listening
somewhere out there.

00:16:47.671 --> 00:16:48.170
Hi.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.300
She's all right now.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:49.950
Hi.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.750
But I remember that
as clear as day

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.500
like it was yesterday because
it could have been me.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.410
And that would have changed my
life so much as that young kid.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.660
And so here it is.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.310
You're walking on this
thing's parallel-- there's

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.839
like nice people, nice
lives, nice jobs--

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.520
but yet, then
there's another side.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.648
So I tried to mix that up.

00:17:14.648 --> 00:17:16.770
I know you said talk
about project people.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.486
I'm not an expert
on project people.

00:17:18.486 --> 00:17:19.569
SACHA JENKINS: No, no, no.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.702
But the diversity, you know.

00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:22.660
There are grandmothers.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.160
There are people
who drive the bus.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.660
NAS: Right.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.540
Right.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.492
SACHA JENKINS:
Hardworking, real people.

00:17:27.492 --> 00:17:28.200
NAS: Good people.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.330
Yeah.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.830
They helped shape me, too.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.550
Absolutely.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.110
SACHA JENKINS: So a
classic "Illmatic" line

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:41.620
is "The rap game reminds
me of the crack game."

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:50.470
So 20 years later with all this
experience, as a new artist

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.360
coming in at that
point, coming out

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.110
of this very heavy
experience, and now you're

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.690
brand new saying this
on your first record.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.260
What was it that
made you feel that?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.370
Because that was like
a very-- you felt that.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.070
And I think that's why that line
resonates with so many people.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.565
What was it?

00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:12.480
NAS: It was because
as I was getting off

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.760
into the rap game,
the sheistiness,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:30.670
the shrewd business, the
unloyal stuff, the fake stuff,

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:38.650
the snake stuff, the money
chase, it was really similar.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.360
It was really similar.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.722
So I never really
trusted anybody.

00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:51.970
I never really trusted anybody
because I didn't trust me.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:57.190
If I didn't know what I
was able to do to somebody

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.560
at any moment, then
what are they thinking?

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.030
So I knew that someone--
lawyers, whoever they was-- I

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.900
knew they was ice
me in a minute.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:16.080
And I didn't trust any of them,
so I made that comparison.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.300
SACHA JENKINS: In
hindsight in all that

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.860
you've learned 20 years
later, would you still

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.800
equate it to that?

00:19:25.614 --> 00:19:27.190
NAS: No, it's not.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.600
I don't even know what
the crack game is no more.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.220
It's a whole
different thing today.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.160
I mean, back then
it was really almost

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.290
like concentrated
areas were coming out

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.700
talking about [INAUDIBLE],
Queensbridge, [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.905
It's a global thing.

00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:55.210
It's a global thing that where
everybody has their voice,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.700
and you could be heard.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.799
It's about expressing yourself.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.840
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.330
If you're from Detroit, you've
got your story for Detroit

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.660
that we all need to hear.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.680
So it's open now.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.460
It's an open game.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.220
Yeah.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.190
SACHA JENKINS: So, speaking
of global and travel,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.130
you were this kid
from Queensbridge.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.235
"Rap game is like
the crack game."

00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:18.860
You're going through
these experiences,

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.151
and eventually, you're touring.

00:20:20.151 --> 00:20:21.750
You're seeing the world.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.200
And you're seeing the effect
that the stuff that we

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.080
did as kids, that was just
a part of our communication

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.700
as young people
in New York City,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.570
is now something that people
around the world have embraced.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.210
Can you relate any stories of
being in Istanbul or somewhere

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.020
really far away and really
feeling like wow, this thing

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.650
that we did as kids has such
a profound effect on people

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.835
so far away, in your travels?

00:20:45.835 --> 00:20:47.210
NAS: In the
beginning or overall?

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.820
SACHA JENKINS: Overall.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.270
NAS: Yeah, hip-hop took
me all over the world,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.211
places I never wanted to go.

00:20:57.211 --> 00:21:00.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.190
Places I dreamed about going.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.620
It took me all over.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:11.000
And people love it.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.570
It doesn't matter
where you're from.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.110
They relate.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.500
They know it's theirs.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.620
They know that that
music represents them.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.180
It's honest, for the most part.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.820
Its origins, where
it comes from.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.140
The foundation of
hip-hop is honest.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:25.850
They know that.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.280
They know it speaks for them.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.810
It sounds like them no matter
what language or whatever.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.230
It's our music.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.250
It's the music of young
people-- people my age, too--

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.430
but young people,
they claimed it.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.440
And I've been to New Zealand.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.080
I've been to Nigeria.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:55.120
I've been to Australia, Tokyo.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.940
And everywhere there's
that same love.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.830
It's that same-- they're
like purists, too.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.980
It's like a family.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.850
It's a big rap community.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.700
And they're serious, and
they'll look you up and down

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.960
and try to look through you to
see if it's honest with you.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.510
I've been to Tokyo
and seen fans look

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.090
at me like are you the truth?

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.160
Or are you over
here playing games?

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.980
I've been places where they
have that pure heart for it.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.386
So it's everywhere.

00:22:28.386 --> 00:22:30.260
SACHA JENKINS: One thing
Nas hasn't mentioned

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.634
in terms of his
business ventures

00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:35.060
is he's marketing
this bottle that's

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.066
essentially a fountain of youth.

00:22:37.066 --> 00:22:38.539
[CHUCKLING]

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:40.830
Because so many people have
been asking for the product

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.663
now that he's been out
promoting the record.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.380
And front flips--
he looks the same.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.220
Is it really him?

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.120
I'm the guy in Japan.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.864
Are you real?

00:22:51.864 --> 00:22:52.905
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:54.660
The guy looks the same.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.060
What is your beauty regimen?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.950
The streets want to know because
there are a lot of other guys

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.680
who are 40 with Timberlands
who look 48, 53.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.257
You know what I'm talking about.

00:23:07.257 --> 00:23:09.090
NAS: I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:13.347
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.347 --> 00:23:15.536
SACHA JENKINS: All right.

00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:19.550
Well, you can purchase
this very soon.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.650
He doesn't want to give
out the ingredients.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.327
It's all good.

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:23.410
That's how he makes money.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.485
Colonel Sanders had
his chicken recipe.

00:23:25.485 --> 00:23:26.655
He's got his beauty recipe.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.955
So lyrics.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.730
One of my favorite
lyrics, and it's

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:45.540
hard to even-- it's simple, yet
complex and almost like a math

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.410
puzzle that you can never solve.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.070
Or it's the math puzzle
that you want to solve.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.600
And you'll spend time-- I
spend time actually thinking

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.750
about the weight of this line.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.400
And it is "I need a new
nigger for this black cloud

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.685
to follow."

00:24:00.685 --> 00:24:03.060
NAS: "While it's over me, it's
too dark to see tomorrow."

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.851
SACHA JENKINS: Yes.

00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:04.500
NAS: Mmm.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.410
SACHA JENKINS: I mean, you
think about the weight of-- how

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.820
old were you when
you wrote that?

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.430
NAS: Oh, somewhere around 18.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.460
SACHA JENKINS: I mean, that's
a very heavy-- you know,

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.560
people have different
feelings about the N-word.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.440
Personally, I'm not
necessarily a fan of it,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.970
but in the context of
where we come from,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.990
and how we express ourselves,
it has its place and its value.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.830
It's not for
everyone, as we know.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:36.790
But the personification
of how you described

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.900
what you described,
to me, is heavy.

00:24:42.227 --> 00:24:43.810
It's almost, on one
level, it's saying

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.890
that society has labeled
you a nigger, on one hand.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.200
And you have this
black cloud over you

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.800
that makes it so hard for you
to see what the future is.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.650
NAS: Right, and "I need a new
nigger for this black cloud

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:03.370
to follow" is almost
like a blues man

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.730
singing a song about
his life, and he's

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.590
older, a lot older than 18.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.280
That's what strikes me
about lines like that.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.540
Like why was I feeling like
that at such a young age?

00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:26.980
Life hits you in different
ways, and you deal with it

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.290
in different ways.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.260
I felt like I was speaking
for a lot of people

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.450
when I wrote that.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:39.337
SACHA JENKINS: And now
that you look back on it,

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.420
do you have a better
understanding of why you were

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.086
in that place, or why
you felt that way?

00:25:49.976 --> 00:25:59.960
NAS: I think I was born
with sort of a fast life

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.000
thing in my genes
because I felt like it

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.870
could be over any minute.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.090
So go after it now.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.760
There are no rules.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.440
There's no rules because the
guys with the rules were slain.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.220
The guys who played by
the rules got dealt with,

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.260
so there's no one to trust.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.770
I lived in Queens.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:33.200
I lived in-- it was getting hot.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.340
So that's how I
felt like talking.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.260
SACHA JENKINS: So speaking
of language and the N-word,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.970
you performed at
the Kennedy Center.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:51.180
And he's got this line,
"Kidnap the president's wife

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.600
without a plan."

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.530
I notice you didn't
kick that one in DC.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.020
I guess that's smart.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.110
You could've got
hemmed up behind that.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.312
NAS: Right.

00:26:59.312 --> 00:26:59.812
Right.

00:27:02.227 --> 00:27:04.560
SACHA JENKINS: But it was
interesting to me, you sitting

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.340
back listening to you and
taking in the whole experience.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.730
Like first of all, there
was an elder white woman

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.840
who was a [INAUDIBLE] who
was ushering people in.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.580
And she was dancing
in the aisles.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.140
And then there was one
kid in the front row who

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.310
stood up and was
pointing at this guy

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.220
and going line
for line with him.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.280
And there were people who were
just into classical music.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:34.250
It was such a broad range
of experiences in that room.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.950
NAS: Yeah.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.334
It was like--

00:27:37.334 --> 00:27:39.250
SACHA JENKINS: Oh, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:39.980
NAS: OK.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.850
SACHA JENKINS: So bringing
it back to-- I thought it was

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.620
interesting in that you let
the N-word rock in certain

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.560
instances, but
others you didn't.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.240
Is that an extension of growth
from being a dad or an-- talk

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.800
about that.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.710
NAS: Yeah, I mean I had
to say the records the way

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.640
I said them back
then, but because

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.940
of the orchestra
and the strings,

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.020
the music is real softer.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.260
So now you hear me
1,000 times more

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:17.180
stronger because these
soft violins are playing.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.110
And my language is harsh.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.740
And in part of the show, I
said something about that.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.580
I said back then, we were
more rebellious in our music.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.580
Rebel music was the thing.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.525
It was Public Enemy.

00:28:32.525 --> 00:28:35.390
It was Ice Cube.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.730
It was rage.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.410
It was America's youth and rage.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:46.345
And that was the most
talked-about rap.

00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:51.580
It was these guys
with their outcries

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.240
about their conditions.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.140
So that inspired me.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:02.050
So my lyrics back
then were like that.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.360
They were rebellious.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.180
They were enraged.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.990
They were lit.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.370
The were lit on fire.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:15.880
So I told the audience that's
why I'm cursing y'all out

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.140
to violins.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.810
But musically, it took
me somewhere else.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.985
It was really classy.

00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:29.510
It was a beautiful
audience, very diverse.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.580
And I couldn't imagine
what they were thinking

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:37.630
watching me play with this
mostly all-white orchestra who

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.180
probably doesn't listen to rap.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.020
Turns out they
did listen to rap.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.420
Turns out they were really cool
people, the National Symphony

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:46.950
Orchestra.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.380
They were really
professional, really amazing.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.700
And it kind of took me to
another place with music,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.280
and what I can do with music.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.350
SACHA JENKINS: Well,
the energy was great

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.308
because you can tell they
had never experienced

00:30:01.308 --> 00:30:07.330
that kind of energy
in a live performance.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.909
Another lyric--
these are the things

00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:11.950
that just randomly pop in
my head during the day.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.600
I'll be walking down the
street, and I'll say to myself,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.390
"Understandable smooth shit
that murderers move with."

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.840
What are they moving with?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.209
NAS: This music.

00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:25.250
I said that "The thief's
theme-- play me a night,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.370
they won't act right.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.100
The fiend of
hip-hop got me stuck

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.990
like a crack pipe"
in those same lyrics.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.635
So everything is
woven into the lyrics.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:44.670
Everything I saw, everything I
was around became the material.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.199
So yeah.

00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:49.490
SACHA JENKINS: And the
producers on the album-- I mean,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.850
that was another really
radical departure from what

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.910
was going on in hip-hop.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.590
You had all these
amazing guys teaming up

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.150
to give you the best
to create something

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.700
that was so stand-out.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.384
Tell the audience a bit
about how that came to be.

00:31:07.384 --> 00:31:13.860
NAS: Well, mentioning Chuck
D, Public Enemy and Ice Cube,

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.140
they had their producers.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.330
The Bomb Squad did Public Enemy.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.510
Dr. Dre did NWA.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.560
Sir Jinx then started
doing Ice Cube.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.040
Everybody had their producer.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.360
De La Soul was
produced by De La Soul.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.680
A Tribe Called Quest was
produced by A Tribe Called

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.960
Quest.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.490
Who was going to
produce me, right?

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.950
So I knew one producer,
Large Professor,

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.110
and he had relationships
with the rest of them.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.660
I didn't want my record
that have one sound.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.270
I was a big fan of all
these amazing guys.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:52.500
So I needed them to
give me the music,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.060
so I could say what
I needed to say.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.850
And at first people
thought it wouldn't

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.780
happen because that wasn't
happening, especially

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.240
for new artists.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.650
But I was lucky.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.980
They were into
doing this record.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.120
And I would tell people-- yeah,
so who's doing your record?

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.340
Oh, Pete Rock,
Q-Tip, DJ Premier.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.910
And they'd look at me
like yeah, all right.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.180
And I'm like nah, that's
who's doing the record.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.540
So after a while,
that became the buzz.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.370
Oh, you know who's
doing this man's record?

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.780
And the anticipation started
to grow because people couldn't

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.860
imagine what would this--
never heard a album by me--

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:39.110
what could this guy be
doing with these guys?

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.680
What is he doing?

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.610
And I knew I had them
because from that point, that

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.760
was already a thing
going around the music

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.820
industry is like, he's
working with these guys.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.250
So I had the focus on
me from that point.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.430
So very lucky, man--
don't underestimate luck.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.150
I was lucky.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.040
SACHA JENKINS: Humble
gentleman right here.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.582
So are there beats that
these guys offered up

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:07.040
that you look back now like
damn, I should've spit on that.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.750
That wound up getting farmed
out to other people, or--

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.420
NAS: No because every
track was specifically

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.600
for me, every track they did.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.525
There was some beats
that Pete Rock gave me

00:33:19.525 --> 00:33:23.750
that wound up on him and
CL Smooth's album later.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.680
He just gave them to me
to see if I liked them

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.430
before they finished
their record.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.790
And I don't even
know if he remembers.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.380
But I remember when
his album came out

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.671
I was like oh, I had this beat.

00:33:33.671 --> 00:33:36.150
I had that beat.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.110
Nah, they made all
the beats for me.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.720
The only thing is
when once I was done,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.560
and Biggie went to
work with Premier.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.040
And I went to see Premier.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.190
And Premier played me
"Unbelievable" by Biggie.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.710
I was so mad at Premier.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:59.655
I was so mad, Bro-- yeah.

00:34:03.412 --> 00:34:04.620
So, no, they took care of me.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.420
SACHA JENKINS: After the
cycle of "Illmatic" happened,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.850
you had done the
record, you had toured,

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.139
you had done everything.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.670
And you were on the verge of
creating your next album that

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.060
was written, what was
running through your mind?

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.100
Like how did you feel
about where you were?

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.239
Were you still hungry?

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.820
Did you feel like
there are things

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.470
that you hadn't achieved
with the record?

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:34.990
What was your mind state before
getting into your next album?

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.750
NAS: Yeah, I felt there was
things I didn't achieve.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.350
There was a lot of
new guys coming out

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.520
that was making a lot of
noise and made it real for me.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.190
And then BIG went platinum, and
my record didn't even go gold.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.070
Everyone talked about it,
but it didn't go gold.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.460
BIG went platinum.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.690
I saw a way to get to platinum.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.730
I saw a way to beat
all the naysayers.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.212
All of them said he
can't do it again.

00:35:09.212 --> 00:35:12.390
He can't make a big record.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.820
He can't make a top-40 record.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.690
He can't get to that stage.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:22.190
He can't get to MTV awards
or whatever was the place

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.870
to be when you were
supposed to make it.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.650
They had doubts.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.560
He's in the hood.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.740
He's not thinking like that.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.190
He can't do that.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:34.550
So if I was to come
back, now there's

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.510
a Notorious BIG on the
scene, so you can't just

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.990
come back just OK.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.220
You can't just come back,
and make your little record,

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.116
and that be it.

00:35:45.116 --> 00:35:49.140
No, you had to come where
BIG was at, or go higher,

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.740
or you failed.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.670
It wasn't like today.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.920
If I didn't come out and
get a platinum record,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.470
get a big record, get
MTV-- do those things--

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.720
I don't care what the rest
of the world would've said.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.840
Biggie would've been
like you're done.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.670
And I would've have
had to let it go.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.370
That's how it was.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.870
I would've been written in
history as the guy who failed.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.540
And so those guys motivated me.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.820
That's one thing I
miss about Biggie.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.400
He was a class act,
but he pushed you.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.830
And he wanted that top spot.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.180
That was his spot.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.900
So if you were
going for the top,

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.740
you were walking
in his territory.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.130
Even though I was
out before him,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.530
he came and took everything.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.414
So--

00:36:36.414 --> 00:36:38.080
SACHA JENKINS: Well,
you influenced him.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.165
I mean, he had a baby
on his record as well.

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:41.910
NAS: Sure.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.670
But he killed it.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.211
He killed it.

00:36:43.211 --> 00:36:45.970
So now forget what I did.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.290
It's Biggie's world, so I
had to come back and show

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.779
the people who were watching
I'm still in the game.

00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:54.820
SACHA JENKINS: So what
was the conversation like?

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.260
You run into Biggie, you guys
both have turkey sandwiches,

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.390
you're talking like
yo, this is nice.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.140
I'm feeling it, but you know
I'm going to take you out, son.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.265
What gave you that sort
of playful intensity?

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:10.620
You said he was a class act,
but was it things that he said

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.690
or he did?

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.440
I'm trying to put people
in that era of you guys.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.360
NAS: It was little
subtle things like there

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.510
was Biggie without diamond
bracelets and pinkie rings,

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.910
and then there was Biggie with
the diamond bracelet and pinkie

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.070
ring, number one record.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.280
Everyone's playing the
music out of their car.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.310
Everybody loves him.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.290
Everybody knows
the music outside

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.620
of a club, night
time, New York City.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.380
I walk up there in between
second and first album,

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.470
and Biggie sees
me, and throws up

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.306
his hand with the boom diamond
bracelet, and goes like this.

00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:52.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.772
And he goes "Survival of the
fit, only the strong survive."

00:37:58.772 --> 00:38:00.892
That's all he had to say to me.

00:38:00.892 --> 00:38:02.867
That's all he had to say.

00:38:02.867 --> 00:38:04.450
Everybody that was
with me didn't even

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.130
hear it, just me and him.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.010
That's all he had to say,
and I knew what to do.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.090
SACHA JENKINS: Did he
say it with a smile,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.310
with a serious look?

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.290
Did he blink?

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.270
How did Biggie do it?

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.615
NAS: All of that.

00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:22.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.400
Smile, serious, everything.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.233
SACHA JENKINS: Nice.

00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:25.920
NAS: Yeah.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.630
SACHA JENKINS: So we
have mics on both sides

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:36.540
if you guys want to throw out
some Illmatic-esque relevant

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.335
kinds of questions.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.446
This is very Phil Donahue.

00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:47.200
[CHUCKLING]

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:47.989
Bringing it back.

00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:50.030
NAS: Yeah, you're taking
me back right here, man.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.984
This is crazy.

00:38:51.984 --> 00:38:53.400
SACHA JENKINS:
This guy thought he

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.941
was going to be in
a conference room.

00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:56.770
He's like oh, this is
where it's happening?

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.974
Where is everybody at?

00:38:59.974 --> 00:39:01.390
AUDIENCE: Hey Nas,
how's it going?

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.212
NAS: What's up?

00:39:02.212 --> 00:39:03.170
AUDIENCE: Not too much.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.650
Just, first off,
want to start out

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.550
and say thank you
for coming to Google.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.042
You're one of my--

00:39:08.042 --> 00:39:14.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:19.090
To me, "Illmatic" is one
of my top three rap albums

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.810
of all time, so
thank you for making

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.110
something that's so important.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.250
NAS: Thank you, man.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.960
AUDIENCE: So my
question is actually

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.940
off of one of your lines.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.171
So say "I sip the Dom
P, watching Gandhi

00:39:30.171 --> 00:39:32.170
until I'm charged, writing
in my book of rhymes,

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.550
all the words past the margin."

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.727
Then kind of
fast-forwarding, you also

00:39:37.727 --> 00:39:39.310
had this song called
"Book of Rhymes."

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.770
I'm curious what's your
creative style been

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.540
like over the last 20 years?

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.786
"Street's Disciple"
came out 10 years ago.

00:39:45.786 --> 00:39:47.910
Do you still carry around
a book of rhymes with you

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.410
everywhere that you go?

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.140
What is your outlook like now?

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.010
NAS: And you wanted
to say because I later

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.720
said about Gandhi--
you know what I mean?

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.350
On the "Book of
Rhymes," "Gandhi was

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.937
a fool, fight to the death--"

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.270
AUDIENCE: "Plights of conquest."

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.769
NAS: Yeah.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.150
"Sip the Dom P, watching
Gandhi" is trippy, right?

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.750
Like I'm drinking
champagne watching

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.330
the guy who was
opposite of that, right,

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.301
who was totally against what the
champagne represents in a way,

00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:22.800
right?

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.290
Capitalism, imperialism, right?

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.381
I'd be thinking
about some shit, man.

00:40:30.381 --> 00:40:32.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.912 --> 00:40:35.112
I tell you, I tell
you, I tell you.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.850
No, I don't have book
of rhymes no more.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:41.735
I don't, man.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:55.040
I write down notes in
iPhone, and no books no more.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.290
I wish I did.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.780
That's a thing
that I really wish

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:05.060
I could have the patience for
is to keep books of rhymes,

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.860
but I feel like I'm cheating.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.110
I feel like I'm preparing.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.960
I don't like to prepare.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.020
I don't want to think
about it anymore.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.450
I take down my notes,
and I leave it there.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.460
I don't touch it until
I get to the studio,

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.850
and then I go through it.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.140
But I don't want to
prepare too much for songs.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.010
That may hurt me.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.968
That may be hurting me.

00:41:23.968 --> 00:41:25.765
I'm not saying
that's good advice.

00:41:25.765 --> 00:41:28.080
It's just how I do it.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.030
Just what I do.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.336
AUDIENCE: So when "The
Lost Tapes 2" comes out,

00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:33.960
are you going to just take out
a bunch of notes from your phone

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.920
and just start reading
off different things?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.630
NAS: If I do, you
gave me that idea.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.110
SACHA JENKINS: He'll text
Gandhi and send him some stuff.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.550
AUDIENCE: Once again, thank
you so much for coming here.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.700
I wanted to sort of
ask about-- "Illmatic,"

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.640
I feel like there's a
lot of jazz influence.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.750
And I know your father was
a jazz musician as well.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.800
It's just a big
part of your music.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.220
Could you talk about jazz
and other genres of music,

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.740
and how that influenced--

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.330
NAS: I used to hate jazz.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.250
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.080
NAS: When I was a kid, I hated
it because-- no, no, no, no,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.580
no.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.160
That's too strong of a word.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.850
I knew it was
older people music.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.880
I knew that I'd get to it later,
like I didn't like squash.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.380
I knew--

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:23.196 --> 00:42:26.970
I knew later I would like it,
but what made me like jazz

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.670
sooner than I probably
normally would have, my pop.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:35.480
He brought me to hang around
jazz guys, and hear them talk,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.340
and just watch these dudes,
and him playing the music,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.200
and him playing
the radio station.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.310
I'd hear this old guy Wolfman
Jack come on the radio station

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.900
with his wild voice.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.930
And another station is
just rock and everything.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:52.860
And saw him absorb the
stuff that was on radio.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.570
He didn't really rock with disco
and all the other stuff that

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:56.550
was happening.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.720
He was really into
the other stuff.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.900
So I appreciate
jazz now, love jazz.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.040
I'm big on Miles
Davis, "Kind of Blue,"

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:11.202
John Coltrane, "A Love
Supreme," Art Blakey, Herbie.

00:43:11.202 --> 00:43:12.250
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.140
So I'm big on jazz
now, and I'm glad I

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.504
had the early experience now.

00:43:17.504 --> 00:43:18.170
I appreciate it.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.038
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:19.038 --> 00:43:19.949
NAS: Thanks.

00:43:19.949 --> 00:43:21.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming in.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.899
I have a two-part question.

00:43:22.899 --> 00:43:25.190
The first part-- I thought
it was very interesting what

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.390
you were saying about Pete
Rock [INAUDIBLE] and so forth.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.973
So I was wondering if you could
talk a bit about your workflow

00:43:29.973 --> 00:43:30.826
with them.

00:43:30.826 --> 00:43:32.700
Would Pete Rock basically
come up with a beat

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.690
and then-- I'm just
asking because "Illmatic"

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:40.710
is 40 minutes of incredibly
tight lyrics to beats.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.620
And I'm just curious
how you managed

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.320
to make that work so damn well.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.170
And the second question
is about your 2006 album,

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.960
"Hip Hop is Dead."

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.650
And basically looking
at "Illmatic" today,

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.060
and seeing how it's such
an important album when

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.026
we look back on the
contemporary history of hip-hop,

00:44:00.026 --> 00:44:01.400
I was wondering
if you could just

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.020
talk about that 2006 album a
bit, and sampling techniques,

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.170
and so on and so forth.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.140
NAS: Well, going
to Pete Rock-- man,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.420
I was a lucky guy
at a lucky time

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:16.986
because I was at that point
where the next generation was

00:44:16.986 --> 00:44:18.110
about to come on the scene.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.406
So a lot of people
like "Illmatic,"

00:44:20.406 --> 00:44:22.407
and a lot of
younger people might

00:44:22.407 --> 00:44:24.490
want to know what's the
big deal about "Illmatic"?

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:26.770
It was a number of things.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:33.510
It was one of the
first of its kind

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:37.950
to talk about life
and that matter

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:44.575
from hands-on letters
about guys in jail.

00:44:44.575 --> 00:44:46.450
Your friends, you're
writing letters to them,

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.290
and them writing you back.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.820
And, for that moment, there
wasn't a lot of that out.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.970
You know what I'm saying?

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.450
Afterwards, a lot
of it happened.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:02.180
And the direction of rap
music flowed in that era

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.700
in what Wu Tang was doing
and what BIG was doing.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.450
And then everyone became focused
on representing that street

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:15.120
thing where you're
naming the street corner,

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.470
you're naming the lady that
lives upstairs, the real lady's

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.367
name.

00:45:21.367 --> 00:45:23.450
You're putting your
daughter's name in the record.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:27.210
You're putting real-life
experiences in the record,

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:31.910
not just talking about a
subject matter and nailing it,

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:33.940
but you're really
putting your life in it.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.360
I came in with that.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.974
Wu Tang came with that.

00:45:36.974 --> 00:45:37.890
Biggie came with that.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.410
So I was just a
part of that time.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.345
That's one of the things
that makes it special.

00:45:43.345 --> 00:45:50.760
Pete Rock was the newest
out of Q-Tip and Premier.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.082
Gangsta had already been there.

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.290
Tribe had already been there.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.480
Pete Rock and CL
Smooth-- he was producing

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.280
for Heavy D. He was the
guy behind the scenes,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.582
but you knew he was good.

00:45:59.582 --> 00:46:01.540
Now he was at the forefront
with his own group.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.472
His records were out of here.

00:46:03.472 --> 00:46:06.250
They were blowing up everywhere.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:10.560
And to get him was not easy.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.280
So the fact I got him--

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
tell him how

00:46:16.646 --> 00:46:19.710
you made [INAUDIBLE] go back
and redo all those other songs.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:22.360
NAS: I don't know.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.580
I don't know.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.740
But they believed in me.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.560
They believed in hip-hop.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.600
They believed in a new young
guy coming on the scene,

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.160
and they wanted to help me.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:39.380
And I remember Pete Rock
put out "Down With the King"

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.290
with Run DMC, the remix for that
and then the "Shut 'em Down"

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.620
remix for Public Enemy.

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.870
I was like he's going
to give me a beat.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.980
You know?

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.770
So I went after it,
and I had to nail it.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.310
I couldn't play with his time.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.650
I couldn't play with none
of those guys' times.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.910
AUDIENCE: But they gave
you incredible beats.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.080
And was there a back and
forth like hey, Pete Rock,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.615
I'm looking for this vibe.

00:47:02.615 --> 00:47:04.220
Can you do that for me?

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.230
NAS: I think in the
beginning I wanted something

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.040
like what he was
doing on his own,

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.470
but he didn't listen to me.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.530
And he didn't have to.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.450
He knew what I needed.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.890
And he gave me "The
World Is Yours."

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.810
AUDIENCE: It surprises
me because the album

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.400
is so coherent in
terms of the vibe.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.951
So I guess congratulations to
you for tying it all together.

00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:24.576
NAS: All right.

00:47:24.576 --> 00:47:25.076
Thanks, man.

00:47:25.076 --> 00:47:27.080
I appreciate it.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.900
AUDIENCE: Nas, a
big fan, and I think

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.440
that you guys spoke
about "Illmatic"

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.809
is timeless music,
whether it's 1994 or 2014.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:36.100
And one of the things you
touched upon, it seemed like,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.360
was that healthy competition.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.320
So you spoke about
you and Biggie.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.790
And I know on some
of your other albums

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:43.860
you had addressed
certain situations.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.550
It didn't necessarily sound
like eating turkey sandwiches

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.480
together.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.270
But I think my question is--
and just looking, again,

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.545
from '94 through today-- that
there were certain times where

00:47:54.545 --> 00:47:56.420
there would be that
healthy competition, even

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.480
just within New York, even just
within Queensbridge, and where

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.636
certain people, you
would engage with.

00:48:01.636 --> 00:48:03.010
And there would
be that, again, I

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.590
think bringing everybody's
game up a notch.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.650
And then there would
be certain times

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:10.181
where there wouldn't
be that engagement.

00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:12.180
And people might say
something you would ignore.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.100
And I would love if you can
just shed any light into what

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.020
would say OK, this person,
I'm going to engage with them.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.010
And then somebody like Cam'Ron
where there was that back

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:25.510
and forth from the
Power 105 interview.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.390
And he had said "on
freestyles and songs,"

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.580
and it seemed you
had ignored that one.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.790
So any insights into
the competition,

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.438
the healthy competition?

00:48:35.438 --> 00:48:35.938
NAS: Yeah.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.270
I had said something about
Cam that came out of nowhere.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.240
I was just really
in a place where

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.660
I was trying to start
something with everybody.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.692
I was upset at that point, a lot
of things in my personal life.

00:48:54.692 --> 00:48:57.200
And I wasn't looking
for a response.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.060
I knew there would
be responses, but I

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.720
was looking for what I
was going to do next.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.120
I wasn't thinking about a
response to anybody else.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.460
It was more like what was
I building myself up to do.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.640
I was building myself up to
do something that was not me.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.660
And so I didn't really
hear the responses.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.100
The things I do respond
on were the things

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:28.200
that seemed like they
were supposed to happen,

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.570
not me calling somebody out
because I'm mad that day.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:34.750
And it didn't come from any
place that was any good.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.980
So any other thing
I would respond to

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.905
would be something that was
a lot heavier, a lot more

00:49:41.905 --> 00:49:42.405
serious.

00:49:42.405 --> 00:49:47.233
AUDIENCE: You got
them with "Ether."

00:49:47.233 --> 00:49:48.730
SACHA JENKINS: OK.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:51.860
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you again for coming.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.210
A couple of us at lunch were
talking about your visit today.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.170
And we kind of started
talking about how

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:00.520
it seemed like more
hip-hop and rap artists

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.800
than any other musicians seemed
to be more entrepreneurial

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.110
and do things like
mentor other musicians.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.510
Do you think that that's true?

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.340
And, if it is, why
do you think that is?

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.010
NAS: You said artists
today mentor other artists?

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.010
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.301
We were talking about how it
seems like hip-hop and rap

00:50:18.301 --> 00:50:21.810
artists were more
entrepreneurial and mentor

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:25.304
other artists and musicians
more than like other--

00:50:25.304 --> 00:50:26.110
NAS: What's that?

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.360
SACHA JENKINS: Your man Boldy.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.060
NAS: Oh, Boldy James
in the house, yeah.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.420
Well--

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.700
AUDIENCE: We were kind
of trying to theorize

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.450
on why that seemed
to be the case.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.800
Do you do think it is?

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.770
NAS: Rock stars don't
have to build businesses.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.300
Rock stars are supposed
to be anti-establishment.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.390
They're rebellious.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.966
Their parents are usually white.

00:50:50.966 --> 00:50:52.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.176
It seems like they
didn't have it too hard.

00:50:56.176 --> 00:50:57.347
It's not always the case.

00:50:57.347 --> 00:50:58.180
I'm not saying that.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:02.140
I'm just saying it seems
like-- so it's cool

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:07.072
when the rock star
says fuck the system.

00:51:07.072 --> 00:51:08.155
I'm not going to sell out.

00:51:08.155 --> 00:51:09.960
I'm not going to do this.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.035
They have the opportunity
to say yes or no

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:14.160
because they can just cut
their hair, put on a tie,

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.310
and walk in, and get a job.

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:21.680
Us, on the other end, we
know we're not walking in

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:29.930
to be CEOs, and that this time
frame-- when hip-hop first

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:32.790
started, it's talking
about unemployment.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.210
It's talking about no education.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.725
It's talking about drugs
and police brutality

00:51:37.725 --> 00:51:40.180
with Melle Mel on the message.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:51.940
So the full achievement of
somebody from that condition

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:57.530
to make it in America-- that
story of that kid who came up

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.340
single-parent household,
housing projects,

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.200
drops out of school maybe,
carries a gun maybe,

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.680
maybe breaks the law
here and there-- that guy

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.820
is doing that because
he feels like he's not

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.146
accepted in corporate America,
even if he has the credentials.

00:52:14.146 --> 00:52:15.520
There's going to
be some bullshit

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.630
on his way up the ladder.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:27.880
So it's so amazing to see
that guy with $100 million

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.230
because it's the proof
that America works.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:47.120
It's the child of the slave
ancestry thing coming back

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.180
into the American dream.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:53:06.360
And that story is scary,
triumphant, beautiful,

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.990
and scary again.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:09.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.210
So while the rocker--
he says no, Mom.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.800
I don't want the
meatloaf tonight.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:20.645
I'm going to go rock out with my
guitar and shit, and fuck that.

00:53:20.645 --> 00:53:26.560
You know, slapping the base,
man, slapping the base.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.280
It's cool for him
to do that while we

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.380
do, oh, he don't want the job?

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.555
OK, let him play
the guitar, and I'm

00:53:35.555 --> 00:53:38.320
going to sell him the guitars.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.980
So it's the rap
game, crack game.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.660
It's the hustle.

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.540
It's the hustle spirit
that once I get a foot in,

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.890
I've got to take it all.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:56.600
We have more of a reason to
want to start businesses, make

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.600
our mommies proud and our
grandmas proud and show them

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.660
nothing could stop us.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.870
America offered it to us.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:12.660
It seemed like we was going off
course, derogatory language,

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.440
messed up words toward
women and stuff like that,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.170
but then it made a right
turn right up the right way.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.674
And that's how
beautiful America is.

00:54:24.674 --> 00:54:26.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:34.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.520
SACHA JENKINS: Speaking of rap
game, I guess it's a wrap here,

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:45.690
but we have an amazing contest,
Nas, you're familiar with.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:46.190
NAS: Yes.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:49.760
SACHA JENKINS: And we're
running on massappeal.com

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.600
NAS: Massappeal.com for sure.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.680
SACHA JENKINS: Wherein
folks have the opportunity

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.080
to submit their ideas
for videos that they'd

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:00.410
want to make for songs
off of "Illmatic,"

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.941
and people are making
submissions encouraging people

00:55:03.941 --> 00:55:04.440
to do that.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.850
NAS: That's incredible.

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:07.270
Who's idea was that?

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:08.700
SACHA JENKINS: Was it yours?

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.420
Somebody's.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.736
NAS: Can't remember.

00:55:10.736 --> 00:55:12.650
SACHA JENKINS: Someone
in Mass Appeal.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.120
So are we showing that clip?

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.380
We're going to show a
clip of actually something

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.090
that Nas thought
was interesting.

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:21.890
NAS: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:22.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.360
-"Represent" is the
soundtrack to a movie,

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.150
but not just any movie,
a very specific movie.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.730
[INAUDIBLE] was perhaps
the most obscure sample

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.015
in hip-hop history.

00:55:32.015 --> 00:55:36.430
It's using a 1924 soundtrack
to the silent film,

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.450
"The Thief of Baghdad."

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.510
Now the movie is based on
"1,001 Arabian Nights,"

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:42.820
a classic fairytale.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.115
It tells the story of a thief
who takes what he wants.

00:55:46.115 --> 00:55:48.240
That is, until one night
he comes across a sleeping

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.800
princess.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.590
The story basically
revolves around him

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.010
trying to win the respect
of the [INAUDIBLE],

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.580
who is the princess's father.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.680
And in the end, he liberates
the city and becomes a prince.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.990
My idea for the
video for "Represent"

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:04.990
is to have a collaboration with
both Nas and Jason Goldwatch

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.630
where we take elements
of this 1924 silent film,

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.190
which is now fallen
into the public domain

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.240
and flip them visually
the way [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.610
did with the beat and kind
of retell the story of Nas'

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.310
experience in Queensbridge
through the lens

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.150
of "The Thief of Baghdad."

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.300
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.550
SACHA JENKINS: So that's
an example of someone

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:30.490
who is making a submission
at massappeal.com for the Nas

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.800
Represent Illmatic
Contest, and you

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.482
encourage all of your friends
in the world to participate.

00:56:35.482 --> 00:56:36.720
NAS: Yep.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.360
SACHA JENKINS: Yes.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.169
NAS: So that what his
idea for Represent.

00:56:40.169 --> 00:56:41.710
SACHA JENKINS: That's
his idea, yeah.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:47.040
NAS: For a 20-year-old song,
and the sample is to a movie--

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.010
SACHA JENKINS: Yeah, the film
is so old, it's public domain.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.700
So his idea was to sort
of incorporate the imagery

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.490
from this movie that you could
just jack all the images from.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.710
And as you were saying,
that's reminiscent of what

00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:00.260
we do with hip-hop.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.052
You don't have to
clear those samples.

00:57:02.052 --> 00:57:02.760
NAS: I like that.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.370
SACHA JENKINS: Yeah.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.167
Anyway, thank you all
for coming out and--

00:57:06.167 --> 00:57:07.000
NAS: Thank you, man.
