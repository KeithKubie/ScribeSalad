00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
So let's take a look at the types of partners.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.930
One of the most interesting concepts is strategic alliances.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the concepts in start-ups that is important to remember

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.310
is this idea of the whole product.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.520
It turns out there is no possible way on day 1

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.670
that your start-up could provide a mainstream customer

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.240
with a complete solution; you just can't.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.050
You don't have enough time or money or resources

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.000
to fill out every possible thing someone in a Fortune-1000 company

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is going to put on a checklist or an RFP for you to provide.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.660
So the idea is to use strategic alliances

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.450
to complement your core product with other products or services.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.390
It could be training, could be installation, could be service,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.610
that is to surround your product with a cloud of other resources

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.900
to address mainstream customers.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.690
For example, in 1996 Starbucks® partnered with Pepsi™

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.890
to bottle, distribute, and sell Frappuccino®,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.760
which gave them access to Pepsi's™ enormous distribution channel.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.940
Now, one word of caution.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.940
You understand that the phrase I used was to develop the whole product,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.300
to deliver a complete solution to mainstream customers.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.470
The mistake start-ups often make is thinking

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.531
that they're selling to mainstream customers the day they first ship.

00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:28.090
It turns out that for most start-ups not in an existing market,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.380
you're not selling to mainstream customers,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.410
you're selling to crazy people just like you.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.190
It turns out that those people, which we called earlyvangelists,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.010
are more than happy to assemble the complete solution themselves,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.460
so all the bus-dev activities that start-ups scramble to get ready

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
by first customer ship actually could be deferred in most ventures

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.630
to actually after you got those first earlyvangelist customers

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.630
because it's the earlyvangelists who will, once they build the product themselves,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.410
actually tell you what the complete feature set is.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.820
So, think about strategic alliances.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.110
Don't just checklist "I need a head of bus-dev

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.430
and all these solutions on day 1."

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.560
Think about what order they come in.
