00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:13.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:17.310
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.790
And thank you for
having me back.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.050
I gave a lecture yesterday
to a 12-plus audience

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.269
forward focused on the
Cold Atom Laboratory.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.310
So you can ask me some
questions during the break

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.640
if you'd like to at the
very end of the talk.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.056
But the talk today
will be focused

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.560
on the future of
green transportation,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290
specifically focused
on the Hyperloop,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.040
which is a technology
development that I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860
working on now as
part of my day job

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.880
as senior vice president
of systems engineering

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.800
at Virgin's Hyperloop One.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240
And then I am here
in my capacity

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520
as a professor or research
professor at the University

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.890
of Southern California, where
I work in the Astronautics

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.630
and Space Technology department.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.892
I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:51.600
I participated in the
Christmas Lectures,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.850
I think, about three
years ago with Kevin Fong

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.147
on space exploration.

00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:56.730
And then I gave a
lecture in, I think,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.990
2016 on the exploration of Mars.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.110
So this is my third time
here, and it's always

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.510
a pleasure to be able to come
and visit London and Great

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.010
Britain.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.635
And I'm actually born
in Great Britain.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:07.594
I was born in Scotland.

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:09.343
And my mum actually
lives up in Southport.

00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:11.010
So it's always a fun
time to come here.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.468
Although I have an
American accent,

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.250
I do also still have
a British passport.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.830
But just to give you a little
bit of a background about me,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.770
my degrees are all in aerospace
engineering, bachelors,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.210
masters, and PhD.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.760
And my passion has always
been space exploration.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.460
And ironically there's British
connection there as well.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.250
When I was six years of
age on public television,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.860
they had reruns of this very
odd science fiction programme

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.330
called Doctor Who.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.060
And at the time, it
was Tom Baker episodes

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.020
that were airing.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.850
And it was actually
my inspiration

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.190
from watching science fiction
and watching the doctor

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.140
sort of explore
alien worlds and be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.420
very intelligent on
everything from zoology

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.210
to engineering to medicine that
made me think that I would like

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.399
to be like that person
one day, and that's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.690
what made me become an engineer

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.677
So people are motivated
by different things

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:54.510
to become engineers.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.850
Some people were motivated
by science fiction.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.740
Some people are motivated purely
by the space programme or try

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.115
to make the world
a better place.

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:03.630
And that's essentially what I
like to do with the technology

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.324
that I develop.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.240
And the reason why that's
relevant and germane

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.479
here is that all of that
passion is for space exploration

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.000
and exploring Mars and exploring
deep space with propulsion

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940
technologies and rovers
that lands on other worlds.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.670
As an engineer and
as a leader, I also

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.920
have a desire to help society.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.570
And so when I was
given the opportunity

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.840
to help work on developing a
green transportation technology

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.310
solution, which
is the Hyperloop,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.480
I couldn't turn that down.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.490
Because if you can
use your engineering

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.080
skills and your
leadership skills

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.900
to help solve the problem
which is climate change, which

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.920
is global warming, by taking a
traditional internal combustion

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.230
engine type technology,
whether that be related to cars

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.584
or airplanes, and shift it over
to something which is green,

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:45.000
relying off the
grid power, that's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.250
one way that you can make a
difference as an engineer.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.530
So I worked about 16 years
of my career working for NASA

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.530
on the developments of
spacecraft and spacecraft

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.034
technology.

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:54.450
And so for the
past year I've been

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.283
focused on the development
of the Hyperloop,

00:02:56.283 --> 00:02:59.100
which is the bulk of the
talk that we have here today.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.992
And that does kind of
couple to this graphic,

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:04.200
which is obviously more
related to planetary science.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.240
But these three
planets are actually

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.460
known as the
terrestrial planets.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.312
The one on the left is Venus.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:13.020
The one in the middle
obviously is Earth.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.790
And the one on
the right is Mars.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.760
And the reason why this
image is very telling

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.574
is in it the formation
of the solar system,

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.490
these three planets were
actually very similar

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.750
to each other in terms
of having an atmosphere

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.230
and in terms of having water
on the surface of the planet.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.194
But right now only we are in
the Goldilocks zone in the sense

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:30.360
that we still have appreciable
water on the surface,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.190
and we have a comfortable
temperature on the surface,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.630
and we have a thick atmosphere.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.310
Mars, on the other
hand, is essentially

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.140
a desert planet with
no appreciable water

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.780
on the surface and atmospheric
pressure of about 1%

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.160
of what we have here on Earth.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.770
And Venus, on the other hand,
has a surface temperature

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.850
of 475 degrees centigrade and
an atmospheric pressure of 100

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.670
atmospheres.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.960
And so something happened during
the course of these planets'

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.930
evolution which caused them
to deviate very much from what

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.050
they were to begin with.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.900
And what that means
is that climate change

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.720
is a planetary phenomena and can
happen for different reasons.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.450
The theory for Mars is that
it experienced an impact

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.490
with some kind of
asteroidal body, which

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.370
disrupted its magnetic field
because the core was impacted

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.180
and shattered.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.730
And then in-space radiation
ripped off the atmosphere.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.804
That's a hypothesis.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:14.970
And for Venus, we don't
actually know what happened,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.386
but we do know
that it experienced

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:19.050
a runaway greenhouse gas effect,
which then boiled the oceans,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.720
created this thick atmosphere,
and created the incredibly

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.490
difficult conditions
for any type of life

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.380
to exist on the surface today.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.640
And so as engineers, we can help
scientists make measurements

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.820
to test hypotheses to understand
how climate change happens.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.580
But also, as engineers, we
can create new technologies

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.520
to solve climate change here
on Earth by reducing our carbon

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.610
footprint.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.900
And so this is what leads,
then, to science fiction,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.680
the Hyperloop.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.540
And so the Hyperloop
is a concept

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.350
that came to a lot of notoriety
in around the 2011 to 2013

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.020
time frame because
Elon Musk proposed

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.810
with a white paper back
in 2008, as an alternative

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.115
to a high-speed rail
system in California,

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.740
that you could use
a Hyperloop instead,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.450
which would be new
technology, more efficient,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.620
more cost effective.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.940
But the Hyperloop has existed
in the minds and visionaries

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.230
of the science fiction world
for many, many decades.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.010
And so as early,
in my experience,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.490
as watching reruns
of the Jetsons,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.070
you see people travelling
through tubes at high speeds.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.320
And some of the images that
you see here are also from

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.325
the science fiction literature,
showing you basically aircraft,

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:23.450
or not aircraft, but craft
travelling through tubes

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.050
at high speed.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.380
So science fiction does
serve as an impetus,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.020
does serve as an innovation
for many of the technologies

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.800
that we have.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.510
Great example would
be the cell phone.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.310
The Motorola flip
phone originally

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.030
was shown by Spock and Kirk
in Star Trek in the 1960s.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.829
And then in the 1980s
and 1990s, the tablets

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:42.620
that were used in Star
Trek Next Generation

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.267
are now the technology
that we use today.

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:46.850
So even though science
fiction may not

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.490
provide the technological
blueprint for how

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.940
to make these devices, it does
provide the vision of ways

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.606
that these technologies
can benefit society.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.230
And so the Hyperloop
is another example

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.470
of that, of ways that you can
solve a mass transportation

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.480
solution using a
new technology set.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.280
And of course, it's
the job of the engineer

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.990
to figure out how to do that.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.974
And sometimes in life
you do get things,

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:09.890
which is people say,
well, that can't be done.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.970
Perfect example of that
is back in the late 1800s,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.710
it was said that
heavier-than-air flying

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.906
machines are impossible.

00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.530
And Lord Kelvin
actually was the person

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.670
who came out and said that.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.670
And low and behold, you
have the Wright brothers

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.410
showing the demonstration
of heavier-than-air flying

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.760
machines, right?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.150
Our travel today is basically
aircraft travel, transatlantic,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.240
transpacific over
continents, all facilitated

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.940
by the work of
engineering geniuses

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.020
over the course of time.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.340
And it does impact our society
in very important ways.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.410
And of course, for
any new technology,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.970
by a show of hands, who here
has seen the movie The Martian?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.570
I'd say about 50% of you.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.392
And so The Martian
is a great movie

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:50.600
if you're an engineering fan.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.190
It actually goes
to great lengths

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.720
to describe the
calculations which

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.424
are done to show
how he could survive

00:06:55.424 --> 00:06:57.590
on the surface of the planet
in many different ways.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.174
But kind of the emphasis here
is that you can use science,

00:07:00.174 --> 00:07:02.090
and you can use engineering
to get herself out

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.140
of a difficult situation.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.640
So I think it's
kind of motivational

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.060
from that perspective.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.210
And then my favourite
quote, I would say,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.970
of all time is from
Theodore von Karman,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.922
who's the father
of modern rocketry,

00:07:12.922 --> 00:07:14.630
describing the difference
between science

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.300
and engineering, which science
is the study of what is.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.674
And engineering
builds what will be.

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.590
And the scientists
explorers, and the engineer

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.390
creates the world which
has never existed before.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.850
And so I think
this is showing you

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.910
how you can use the tools of
science, the tools of math,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.880
to create these new technologies
to perhaps make money, but,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.850
hopefully, perhaps to make
the world a better place

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.040
and a cleaner place
and a greener place.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.530
And I think that is
motivational for many people.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.990
So how does that tie
into the Hyperloop?

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.350
Well, just downstairs in the
Royal Institution basement

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.060
are a whole series
of laboratories

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.610
which cover the discoveries
of electromagnetics

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.550
and condensed metaphysics going
on for the past several hundred

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.290
years.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.460
It's our fundamental
physics understanding

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.490
of electronic magnetism
which actually facilitates

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.860
the technologies that
go into the Hyperloop,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.284
whether it be vacuum
technology in order to get down

00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:04.700
to low pressures,
or whether it is

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.200
a linear electric
motor, which makes

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.290
use of the principles
of electromagnetism

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.410
to be able to levitate the
system and propel it forward.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.630
So it is these fundamental
physics principles

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.730
which have enabled the
engineering solutions

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.430
that you see all across
the economic sectors,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.070
and specifically in the
case of a Hyperloop system,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.360
or a maglev
transportation system,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.260
such as the maglev train,
are the core behind how

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.340
that's done.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.820
And with any new
technology challenge,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.580
you do need to have a customer.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.039
You do need to have a reason.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.919
And so transportation has been
revolutionary in our society.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.760
And so looking at that
from a historical context,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.000
go back 3,000 BC
is the first time

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.380
that the wheel was invented.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.810
In 3,500 BC, the wheel was
invented for the purpose

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.860
of making pottery.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.110
A couple of hundred years
later, it was decided, well,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.240
we can actually use the
wheel to move objects

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.320
or to move chariots.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.290
And so one can only imagine
how much it changed society

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.260
to be able to move goods
and services on the backs

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.650
of chariots using wheels
as opposed to not having

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.480
wheeled surface.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.980
And so that was the first
transportation evolution

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.630
of our modern society.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.280
Move forward many hundreds
years of years later,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.710
the Industrial Revolution.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.620
The Industrial Revolution
was facilitated largely due

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.320
to rail service, the ability
to once again transport

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.620
goods and services and
across large distances, which

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.190
allowed society to expand
over large land masses.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.010
Move forward another
100 years or so,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.830
personal mobility with the
internal combustion engine,

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.680
actually having individual cars
that could be driven around,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.330
giving you
point-to-point service,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.590
never has existed before.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.900
All of a sudden, you
can get from point A

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.762
to point B. You can
connect villages.

00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:41.720
You can connect cities.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.800
You can connect states.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.680
You can connect large
land masses across Europe

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.470
with the means of personal
mobility services.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.240
And of course, the
most revolutionary one

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.490
which has happened in
the past 100 years or so

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.470
is the global
connectivity, which

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.490
is enabled by airplane transit,
which, once again, goes back

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.450
to the Wright brothers.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.991
And so the interesting
thing, though,

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.830
is that we have not had a
transportation revolution

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.330
in over 100 years, right?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.920
Flight was over 100 years ago.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.550
And so nothing has
happened since then.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.590
So now the time
is right for that.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.950
But the other thing
about transportation

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.940
is that transportation networks
can also lead to waste.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.480
So if you have congestion,
that will lead to delays.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.750
And those delays can actually be
translated into lots of money,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.250
right?

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.875
So if you're trying to transport
goods from point A to point B,

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.510
and you have to sit at the dock,
you have to sit at the port,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.830
you have to sit at
the airport, you

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.121
can't get your goods transited.

00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:32.470
You're actually losing money.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.200
And so because money is what
makes the world go round,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.060
being able to come up with a
way to facilitate transportation

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.570
so you can reduce those
delays is really important.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.640
And then congestion, similarly,
in ports, in airports,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.590
and on docks is a
problem in terms

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.840
of being able to get
goods to be transferred.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.400
And all of these things, once
again, translate into money.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.880
So if you can come up with a
new technology solution which

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.850
solves somebody else's
distribution problem,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.600
all of a sudden you
have a group of people

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.670
who would be willing to
pay for this new service

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.230
to facilitate this new
mode of transportation.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.980
And so you do need a
reason, a business case,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.220
to be able to generate these
technologies in other cases.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.200
And if we look at this in
a little bit more detail,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.141
we can actually look at
some hard-core numbers which

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.390
tell us why there's a problem.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.490
There's an expected
two-times increase

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.040
in port volume over the
course of the next 10,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.060
20 years or so, right?

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.080
So how are we going
to solve that?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.650
We're already at
congestion the ports.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.566
And we're going to have
even more goods trying

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:27.290
to push through.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.956
Therefore, we have a
congestion problem.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:32.361
There's an expected 80% increase
in passenger miles to be

00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:32.860
travelled.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.450
And that's going to be more
congestion on the roads.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.170
That's also going to
be more pollution.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.530
So we need another way of
getting people from point A

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.630
to point B which
doesn't rely on cars.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.580
And as more of the
developing world

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.539
wants to have a better
transportation solution,

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:47.038
hopefully we don't want to put
more cars on the road, which,

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.630
once, again, can lead to more
congestion, more pollution.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.390
And then there's also an
expected and anticipated 88%

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.971
increase in freight over the
course of the next 20 years

00:11:55.971 --> 00:11:56.470
or so.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.030
Once again, this
has to be mitigated

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.660
to be able to solve the problems
of a growing global economy.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.790
So what is the solution?

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.140
You could make a bigger airport.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.140
But that usually doesn't address
the overall interoperability

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.600
solution in order to
make it efficient.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.860
You could add more rail lines.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.444
But if you're using
old technology,

00:12:13.444 --> 00:12:15.610
you're probably going to
be consuming more land, not

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.290
really moving things
at much faster speed.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.540
You could make wider highways.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.147
That's usually quite difficult
because land availability

00:12:22.147 --> 00:12:22.980
is somewhat limited.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.938
So if you can come up
with something else which

00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:27.430
disrupts this way of doing
transportation solutions,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.820
that could be a good thing.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.200
And then if you look at
the wider economic sector,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.300
you can take a look at
other technologies which

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.300
have been developed, which could
facilitate a new transportation

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.060
solution.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.660
And so the obvious one there
is the information technology

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.050
revolution, being
able to transmit

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.210
large quantities of
data over the internet,

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.877
for example, over
Wi-Fi, over RF.

00:12:48.877 --> 00:12:50.710
So if you have a
transportation system which

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.990
could be facilitated
by the IT revolution,

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.390
then you can have two things
working synergistically

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.390
together to improve that
transportation bottleneck

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.390
that we see today.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.840
So because of that, you
can make the argument that

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.510
now is the time for a
transportation revolution

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.030
which utilises new
technologies, such as autonomy

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.700
and the ability to transfer
large packets of information

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.410
and coupling that to a
transportation system.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.130
And that's where we believe
the Hyperloop can come in.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.710
And how that translates
is that you want something

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.570
that can operate
at a faster speed.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.520
Because the way
that you eliminate

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.020
the time associated
with a distance

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.280
is to move at a faster speed.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.060
And of course, we're not talking
about the speed of light.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.280
But we're talking
about something

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.446
which is on the order of
faster than airline travel,

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:30.680
for example.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.500
And then you have to
come back and think

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.630
about what it is that your
customers would actually

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.560
want from you.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.200
And what everybody wants
from a customer perspective

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.510
is they want something which
is cost effective, right?

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.130
You're not going to want to
have to pay an arm and a leg

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.580
for something.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.079
It has to be
affordable, which means

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:47.740
it has to be in the range of
airline travel or rail travel.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.790
It has to be safe.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.190
Any new transportation
system which is proposed

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.890
should, by definition, if
reliant on new technology,

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.440
should be safer than prior
modes of transportation.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.330
It should have a lower
environmental impact

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.160
because everybody
around the world today

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.500
sees the importance
and the need for this.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.630
And it should support
larger capacities

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.300
than are currently handled
by current transportation

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.840
solutions in order to address
the congestion for both goods

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.900
and for people.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.840
And so any system
which is proposed

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.610
has to facilitate that.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.880
And so what I'll talk about now
is specifically the Hyperloop

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.960
transportation system.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.150
And so in this video here you
can see an artist's conception

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.950
of what a Hyperloop
passenger vehicle looks

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.366
like, which is
what we call a pod,

00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:27.760
holds about 20
people per vehicle.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.220
Inside of it, it has a
linear electric motor.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.410
That linear electric motor
is its propulsion system,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.050
which allows it to go
forward at fast speeds,

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.365
operating off of
grid-based power.

00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:38.740
And using a linear
electric motor

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.802
is no different from a
rotation electric motor

00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:42.510
that you would have
an electric vehicles.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.080
You simply spread
out the platform,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.330
and you still have the same
interaction of the Lorentz

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.040
force to give you
acceleration, using

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.280
the interaction of electric
current with magnetic fields.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.900
The true key concept
of the Hyperloop,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.670
though, is that
it operates inside

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.320
of a vacuum tube,
which means that you

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.090
reduce the ambient pressure.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.340
And so instead of
operating at 1 atmosphere,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.840
you're operating
at an equivalent

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.860
of 120,000 feet in
altitude, or about 0.1%

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.030
of atmospheric pressure.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.400
All that is done inside
of a vacuum structure,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.860
in which the air is removed
with a series of pumps.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.450
And then finally,
the element which

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.030
is also of critical importance
for operational efficiency

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.560
is the use of a
levitation engine.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.200
So you use electromagnetic
forces to levitate the vehicle

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.160
off of the track.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.590
So you don't get frictional
wear and tear on wheels,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.450
as you would with
traditional rolling stock

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.130
for rail-based systems.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.590
And because you're operating
at such fast speeds,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.310
up to 1,000 kilometres per hour,
roughly 700 miles per hour,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.800
the system has to be autonomous
because there is no way

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.890
that a human being in the loop
could operate accelerate-- not

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.950
acceleration, but to be able
to ensure that you get rid

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.330
of any bad safety scenarios.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.580
You have to have autonomous
operation of the pods

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.980
relative to each other once,
which, once again, relies

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.899
on new technology.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:50.440
That's an artist's
conception of what

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.590
this system could look like.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.923
And I'll show you the video
of the system we've actually

00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:56.350
built so you can see how we
turned that into reality.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.870
But using new technology
to improve efficiency

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.100
is actually nothing new.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.370
So autonomy is being coupled
to the automotive industry

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.189
as we speak.

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:05.980
And so many cars that
people purchase today

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.230
already have trial runs
of autonomous systems,

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.120
where they have
lidars on board which

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.930
allow you to detect whether
it be some kind of obstacle

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.180
in your path, or
vehicles next to you.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.040
Or if you haven't
braked in time in front

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.120
of the vehicle in
front of you, the car

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.440
will do the braking for you.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.862
So car-based autonomous
systems, using hazard avoidance,

00:16:23.862 --> 00:16:25.570
are actually very
complicated because you

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.880
have many unknowns which
are coming into your path.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.864
Even in this graphic, you can
see you can have a bicycle.

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:32.530
You can have a person
crossing the road.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.510
You can have an object
which falls in front of you.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.120
Your car has to be able to react
to that with its autonomous

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.692
system for hazard avoidance.

00:16:38.692 --> 00:16:40.150
For a Hyperloop-type
system, you're

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.530
in a controlled environment.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.165
You're, by definition,
in a micro climate.

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:45.760
That controlled
environment actually

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.790
allows you to only have
one directional control.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.664
And basically your
hazard avoidance problem

00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:53.080
becomes easier because there
can't be any people in there.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.538
There can't be any
objects in there

00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:56.620
because it is that
controlled environment.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.590
And then because you're
operating at such fast speeds,

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.600
you're enabling
on-demand departure

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.880
for people within the
vehicle's going from point A

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.510
to point B and direct
to destination.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.380
But the basic concept of a
Hyperloop pod is a pressurised

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.069
cabin.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.770
And so you can think of a
Hyperloop pod as an aircraft

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.819
without wings.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.400
And so it is a pressurised cabin
because on the exterior you

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.150
have a lower
pressure environment.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.720
And so the pressure in
the vacuum structure

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.300
is about 0.1% to 1% of
atmospheric pressure.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.369
And the pressure inside
the passenger vehicle

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.550
is about 1 atmosphere.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.370
So it has a larger
delta pressure across it

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.380
than a traditional
aircraft cabin would have.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.180
But it's actually within
the realm of possibility

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.230
and easily designed using
typical aircraft structures.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.536
So the way that
you have to do this

00:17:40.536 --> 00:17:42.910
in a way which is cost efficient
is you have to innovate.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.550
And sometimes-- I work for the
government for about 16 years--

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.750
it can be more
expensive when you

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.660
have the government innovate.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.260
So if you can use the startup
methodology or the startup

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.320
mentality of being very
driven and very focused

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.570
using an open office,
collaborative environment,

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.162
you can actually
implement a new technology

00:17:58.162 --> 00:17:59.370
solution a little bit easier.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.590
And so there's been a lot of
emphasis in media culture,

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.180
at least in the
United States, where

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.763
you use startup environment to
be able to push things forward.

00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:09.380
Whether you think about an
Uber or a Google or a Facebook,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.379
those are very similar
to a startup environment.

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:13.540
So our company is
very much that.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.670
We use the
entrepreneurial mindset.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.740
We have a team of
about 300 engineers

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.351
and business strategists
working in downtown Los Angeles.

00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:22.600
And we've come up with a new
technology solution which

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.220
focuses on the
business case, which

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.020
I talked about briefly,
and, of course,

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.480
on the technology development
and the implementation

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.670
of new technologies
to facilitate

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.400
this mass transportation
solution at high speeds

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.030
and reasonable affordable cost.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.810
This is a graphic you may not
get since you're in the UK.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.610
But one of the
difficulties associated

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.170
with any mass
transportation system

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.230
is the cost of infrastructure,
literally, the cost of laying

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.950
bridges, of putting up columns.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.950
And that represents a
large portion of the cost,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.020
regardless of what your
transportation system is.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.194
So you also have to
disrupt the infrastructure

00:18:55.194 --> 00:18:56.860
cost, which is very
difficult. So here's

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.752
my joke on The Village People.

00:18:58.752 --> 00:19:00.170
Not everybody gets it.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.220
But how do you do that?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.220
You do a little bit of
a vertical integration

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.678
model, which means that you
come up with all the prototypes

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:08.200
yourself and the preliminary
design for all those prototypes

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.770
yourself.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.478
And so for our company,
what we did is we

00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:13.360
created a Hyperloop
factory, where we actually

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.490
fabricate and test
out welding techniques

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.301
of the middle tubes, which are
required to create that vacuum

00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:18.800
structure.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.250
And so here you can see a
portion of the steel tube

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.862
that we created for a Hyperloop
test facility in Las Vegas.

00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:26.320
And so when you do
the fabrication,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.910
when you do the
design work yourself,

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.102
when you do the installation
assembly, the testing,

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.560
you actually learn how to put
one of these systems together

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.177
in the most cost-effective,
time-efficient way possible.

00:19:35.177 --> 00:19:37.510
And then you implement that
in the field for the project

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.230
specifics that you want to do.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.020
And so we also created a
Hyperloop test facility,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.050
and so we were able
to get a site out

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.360
in Northeast Las Vegas,
just about 45 minutes

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.260
from the strip.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.700
This was in 2016.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.800
We started to lay the
column structures in place

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.820
for the elevated hyper structure
which is going to go above it.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.950
Over the course of
a period of a year,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.380
we actually built a
full Hyperloop system

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.360
of a length of half a kilometre.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.250
And so I'll show you
a short video which

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.780
covers some of the work there.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.540
But we basically started off
by levelling ground, putting

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.330
in the columns, then installing
the vacuum structure tubes,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.580
and then installing the
vacuum pumping station.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.110
And I'll walk you through
that video for the next one.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.440
So here you can see
a segment of tube.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.110
Here you can see the
columns that are in place.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.416
You can see a rapid timeline
of the columns going up.

00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:25.790
We have a mission
control centre,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.170
where the tubes are tested.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.660
You can see a portion of
our vehicle being built up,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.160
once again, where
the tube in place,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.100
and Richard Branson,
our chairman.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.050
And then finally, you
can see our passenger

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.480
pod, which is being built up.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.670
And then you'll see
the final system

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.180
being installed into the
vacuum tube into the site

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.060
off to the side.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.160
So this is the full
facility that was built.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.530
What you see here is a half
kilometre section of tube

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.460
open at the very end.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.200
The pod travels
through this tube.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.810
It has a total length
of half a kilometre.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.840
It spends half the portion
of the tube accelerating up

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.286
to speed, coasts
for a little bit,

00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:02.910
and then decelerates
on the other side.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.451
So you can do our
speed demonstration

00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:05.764
and operational demonstration.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.180
What you also see in this image
here is a pumping station.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.763
So we use commercially
available pumps

00:21:09.763 --> 00:21:12.230
to get the pressure
down to about 0.1%

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.500
of atmospheric pressure.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.990
And the reason
for that is having

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.060
a lot lower
aerodynamic drag allows

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.310
you to go to very high
speeds at a lower energy

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.770
cost, which is the prior
premise of the Hyperloop.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.330
And so that single
pumping station

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.277
can actually pump out
a tube about four times

00:21:25.277 --> 00:21:26.610
the length of what you see here.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.360
So we built the facility so
that it can evolve and grow

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.770
over time.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.930
This is a pod that we developed
for our test facility.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.512
So this represents
probably about 80%

00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:37.970
of full scale of
what we would have

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.890
for our commercial
production system.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.406
The unique features of
the pod that we developed

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:44.030
is we made it out of
a composite, which

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.030
allows it to be very lightweight
but also very strong.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.580
We also used 3D printing
for the structure,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.746
which, once again, allows it to
be lightweight but very strong.

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:54.620
And so these passenger
pods you can think of,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.170
as I said before, as an airplane
without wings because they

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.376
have a levitation engine.

00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:00.000
And they have a
limiter electric motor,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.180
which allows them to move
forward and efficiently

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.142
along the track.

00:22:03.142 --> 00:22:04.850
So this particular
test programme we did,

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.350
we weren't testing
the pressurised pod.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.960
But the next stage of the design
that we go to, we will also

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.227
test a pressurised pod.

00:22:10.227 --> 00:22:11.810
But these panels are
designed to carry

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.480
roughly 20 people in total.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.370
And the architecture
that we're using

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.730
is many smaller vehicles just
basically going continuously

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.924
through the tubes
basically along a highway.

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:23.840
So it's slightly different
from a rail system,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.130
where you would have
stopping and starting

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.210
along the main line.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.440
Here you would have a main
line going each direction.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.189
And people getting off
for a given station

00:22:30.189 --> 00:22:32.664
would exit the main line and
go to their final destination,

00:22:32.664 --> 00:22:34.580
which allows you to have
a constant high speed

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.740
and no deceleration in
the main line, which

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.590
allows you to be more efficient
in terms of your energy

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.400
consumption.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.040
So right here what you see
is the pod being installed

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.060
into the vacuum system.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.490
And so once the pod is installed
and the door is closed,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.282
the tube is pumped down to the
0.1% of atmospheric pressure.

00:22:50.282 --> 00:22:51.990
And then we use the
linear electric motor

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.270
and the levitation engine
to accelerate it, allow it

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.619
to coast, and decelerate
it to do our demonstration.

00:22:56.619 --> 00:22:59.160
And whenever you do these kinds
of technology demonstrations,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.790
they're done primarily for
the purpose of testing out

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.424
all of your models, testing
out all of your designs

00:23:05.424 --> 00:23:07.840
and all of your prototyping
so that you can implement that

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.080
in the next phase of the
design, as you shift over

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.950
to production.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.470
And so with all modern
aerospace systems,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.360
the use of computational
fluid dynamics

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.719
and the use of
structural modelling

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:19.260
to be able to capture
the interaction

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.750
of the electromagnetic forces,
the aerodynamic forces,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.190
and the electromagnetic forces.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.260
So this very last video
I'm going to show you

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.394
is an operational
Hyperloop system

00:23:28.394 --> 00:23:31.060
that we have in Las Vegas, which
is for technology demonstration

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.870
purposes.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.450
So you can see the pod
moving inside the tube.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.861
Is accelerating right now.

00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:36.360
Oops.

00:23:38.777 --> 00:23:40.860
You can see the other side
for the nose cone view.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.320
So our architecture
here is that we

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.380
go to a much higher acceleration
profile for this technology

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.547
demonstration than we would
use in an actual system.

00:23:53.547 --> 00:23:55.546
And the reason for that
is so that we can get up

00:23:55.546 --> 00:23:57.020
to peak speed in
a shorter distance

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.520
than you would for an
operational system.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.790
So it allows us to do a
higher speed demonstration

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.850
in a shorter track.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.830
And to date, our maximum
speed demonstration

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.300
has been 387
kilometres per hour,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.030
which is not our
peak speed that we

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.330
intend to go to in operation.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.413
But it's the maximum speed
that we can demonstrate

00:24:11.413 --> 00:24:12.500
in this length of track.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.720
And this gives
you a view of what

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.620
the entire track looks like in
our Northeast Las Vegas test

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.050
facility.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.800
And so the other
interesting thing to note

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.060
is that because
we're out testing

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.830
in the desert, in the
desert, you actually

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.290
experience extreme
temperature swings, right?

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.120
So during the daytime,
you can get up

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.459
to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:24:30.459 --> 00:24:32.000
And in the evening
in the wintertime,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.250
you can get to below freezing.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.270
And so that large
temperature differential

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.630
happens to be a external
environmental condition that is

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.950
taxing on a system like this.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.720
So this technology
development facility

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.910
allows us to look at
environmental effects as well.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.000
So the other unique
aspect of a Hyperloop

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.500
is the passenger experience.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.510
So if you are to travel
in a rail system,

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.450
you experience basically
bumping along the tracks.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.520
You experience if there's
any kind of, maybe,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.644
small debris on the tracks.

00:24:56.644 --> 00:24:58.790
You would feel that as
you're going along at speed.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.310
Similarly in an aircraft, when
you're going down the runway,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.185
you will experience
bumping along the runway.

00:25:03.185 --> 00:25:04.620
When you do your
initial takeoff,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.460
you'll experience higher
acceleration forces.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.150
When you're in
cruise an aircraft,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.490
you'll experience
turbulence because you

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.590
can't control the environment
that you find yourself in.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.270
The unique aspect of
a Hyperloop system

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.370
is that you control the
environment yourself.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.130
And because the environment
essentially around the pod

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.880
is a vacuum, have
turbulence interactions.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.004
You don't have any kind of
aerodynamic interaction.

00:25:23.004 --> 00:25:24.890
So the ride is
actually quite smooth.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.170
We plan to operate this
system at roughly a quarter G

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.200
for a maximum acceleration and
maximum deceleration, which,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.706
once again, is within the
realm of any people mover

00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:34.080
that you might
take in an airport

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.810
or in the realm of
any metro system

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.154
that you might ride in
any metropolitan area.

00:25:38.154 --> 00:25:40.820
So the system itself is designed
to actually be very comfortable

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.212
for passengers within it.

00:25:42.212 --> 00:25:44.420
So even though you're
travelling over long distances,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.956
between 40 kilometres all the
way up to 1,000 kilometres,

00:25:46.956 --> 00:25:49.580
you don't experience any of the
traditional discomfort that you

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.250
would experience in a
rail system or even with

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.630
an aircraft, for example.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.370
And this gives you
sort of a mock-up view

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.179
of the facility that we
built for the Middle East

00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:00.470
so that you get an idea of
what the passenger layout is

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.386
in terms of the seats.

00:26:03.642 --> 00:26:05.350
So the most important
thing, I would say,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.630
for developing a mass
transportation system

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.079
is to make it reliable,
to make it resilient,

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:11.620
and to make it
automated because this

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.440
allows it to be more cost
effective from an operational

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.010
sense.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.980
It also allows it to have a
smaller environmental impact

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.380
wherever you plan to
implement it around the world.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.420
And the other way
of looking at this

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.350
is basically shifting from a
linear to a circular economy.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.970
And so a linear
economy is basically

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.760
where you don't have any
reuse of your raw materials.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.990
You expend the raw material.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.900
It goes into waste.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.725
And you have to
re-initiate that cycle.

00:26:34.725 --> 00:26:36.850
And that doesn't allow you
to be as environmentally

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:38.000
friendly as you could be.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.810
So being able to shift over
to a circular economy, where

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.090
your raw materials, whether
it be steel, whether it

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.720
be composite structures, or
even whether it be batteries

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.320
or the materials
associated batteries,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.870
if you can choose to
implement that supply

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.660
chain in a circular
sense, you can actually

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.550
have a smaller carbon footprint
over your entire supply chain.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.452
And so that is also
the goal of what

00:26:57.452 --> 00:26:58.660
we're doing at the Hyperloop.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.770
And it's the goal
of many companies

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.302
that are actually
operating today.

00:27:01.302 --> 00:27:03.760
So that's a way of thinking
about how your supply chain can

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.860
tie into other supply
chains so you can minimise

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.110
your environmental footprint.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.720
And then I think if you think
about how the system is going

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.430
to be implemented because
the speeds are so fast,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.940
you can actually connect
people and connect cities

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.440
over a period of time which
has been unheard of before.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.310
That at a peak speed of
roughly up to 700 miles an hour

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.330
and up to 1,000
kilometres per hour,

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.300
you can connect
major urban regions

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.480
in less than 30 minutes.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.320
So from the US side of things,
a very important corridor

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.120
for rail transit,
for example, is

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.860
between Washington,
DC, Boston, and New

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.140
York, which typically takes
many, many hours to go

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.100
between these cities.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.110
With a Hyperloop system,
that new urban radius

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.770
would be around 30 minutes just
because of the incredibly fast

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.870
cruise speed that you
operate with a Hyperloop.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.090
And similarly, if
a Hyperloop system

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.091
were to be implemented
in England between London

00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.631
and the north of England, you're
looking at 30-minute transit

00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:52.120
times between those locations.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.100
And so it's kind
of amazing to think

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.070
about how this speed
simply does facilitate

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.500
a different way of thinking
about how you can connect

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.360
mega regions across
the world, whether it's

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.200
in Europe or in the Middle
East, in India, or in America.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.780
And then for comparison,
we can take a look

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.600
at a system which could be
implemented in the United

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.960
States, where you could connect
80% of the United States

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.346
in five hours or less.

00:28:15.346 --> 00:28:16.720
That's pretty
significant, right,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.910
being able to reach all
of these urban centres

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.297
in a short period of time.

00:28:20.297 --> 00:28:22.630
And even though I am not a
business person by training--

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.510
I'm an engineer-- you can think
of the induced demand which

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.790
will result in all of the
areas which are now serviced

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.248
by the Hyperloop because now
you can have people live there

00:28:30.248 --> 00:28:32.799
and not have to worry about the
traditional delays of traffic

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:34.840
of being able to get from
their suburban location

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.072
into the urban centres where
their companies may be.

00:28:37.072 --> 00:28:39.280
So how this system could be
implemented in the United

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.020
States is very
similar to the way

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.600
could be implemented across
Europe or across India

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.210
or across Asia or
the Middle East.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.600
And although Hyperloop does not
address transatlantic travel

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.210
or transpacific travel,
it does address travel

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.734
over land masses,
and it does allow

00:28:53.734 --> 00:28:55.900
you to do it in a much more
green way than you could

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.960
do with current aircraft systems
and with current rail type

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.690
systems because of the
lower energy cost associated

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.450
with operating in this drag-free
environment and, of course,

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.270
this low-friction environment,
as you're levitating the pod.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.790
So it does have the ability to
connect the planet in a very

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.630
different way.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.340
And every project
which gets implemented

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.380
will have an international
consortium of partners.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.755
And those partners
could actually

00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:17.530
implement those projects
around the world.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.420
And they'll learn from
each implementation

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.700
and allow it to even go
off more cost effectively

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.950
in the second or
third implementations.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.400
And so it is definitely a
future transportation mode

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.200
which is going to
happen probably

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.560
within the next 5 to 10
years or so around the world.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.030
So to wrap up the talk, though--

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.530
I think I'm a little
bit over time--

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.946
I want to talk about two new
modes of transportation which

00:29:38.946 --> 00:29:39.890
are up and coming.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.860
And one is flying cars.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.110
And so in my capacity
as a research professor,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.740
I do research in areas
of urban mobility.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.990
And so one of those is
an autonomous air taxis.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.448
And so there is a
system that we're

00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:53.380
looking at developing
specifically focused

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.600
on the autonomy aspect.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.350
And so I'd like to go
back to The Jetsons,

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.766
because this is the first time
that The Jetsons was showed

00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:01.870
in the context of flying
cars, and show you

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.690
the concept of a flying
car, which essentially

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.320
is an autonomous helicopter with
automated takeoff and landing.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:15.760
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:06.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.560
So that is a concept.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.480
And they're developing
many concepts

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.340
around the world with
different companies.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.460
And the goal here is
aerial urban transport.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.740
So for some cases,
a Hyperloop system

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.140
is actually only valuable
for longer distances

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.000
because you have to be
able to accelerate up

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.920
to peak speed, coast for
a bit, and decelerate

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.750
to make the energy
efficiency worthwhile.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.499
So when you're looking
at shorter distance

00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:29.430
travel within urban locations,
for example, or urban centres,

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.390
you want to have
something which is

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.500
more like a metro-based system.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.916
But you could have
something which

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:36.180
is also above the ground,
which is an aerial transport

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.560
urban system.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.650
And because of the advances
in battery technology, all

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.870
of a sudden the energy
densities are becoming such

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.930
that you could have
electrified aircraft certainly

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.559
over short distance trips,
which a helicopter would need

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.100
to take from a
endurance perspective,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.680
but even over travel
over long land masses.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.324
So by being able to
electrify aircraft,

00:31:55.324 --> 00:31:57.240
you can actually have a
lower carbon footprint

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.680
for aircraft travel,
whether it be

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.612
a rotor craft or traditional
higher speed craft.

00:32:02.612 --> 00:32:04.320
And so that's a way
that you can actually

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.690
address urban transport in a
lower carbon footprint sense.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.690
Now, the other challenge,
of course, with flying

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.150
is that if you have too
many airplanes in the air,

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.680
you can have an air
traffic control nightmare,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.055
and you could have
safety issues.

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:16.440
So what you have
to shift over to

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.350
for aerial airborne transport
is an autonomously controlled

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.364
and scheduled system.

00:32:20.364 --> 00:32:21.780
And so that's what
will facilitate

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.700
being able to get more people
in the pipeline in terms

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.283
of whatever flight path they'd
need to be on and then get back

00:32:26.283 --> 00:32:27.490
to their final destination.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.198
And so there is a huge
amount of research

00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:32.100
going on in that area in terms
of the autonomy and scheduling.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.380
And then finally,
what you can do

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.049
to eliminate
ground-based congestion

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:37.590
by getting cars off
the road, because

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.360
of these urban aerial
transport systems,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.880
can actually address a lot of
the safety risks associated

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.540
with automotive systems
and autonomy used in cars.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.800
So the very final part of
the future of transportation

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.990
is supersonic air travel.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.990
And supersonic air travel
has existed obviously

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.770
for fighter jets.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.210
It did exist for the Concorde.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.749
But it was not a cost-efficient
way of operating, I guess,

00:33:00.749 --> 00:33:02.040
back when the Concorde existed.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.540
And so that has to be improved.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.164
And then the other challenge is
that all the technologies which

00:33:06.164 --> 00:33:09.150
are being developed do still
have associated with them

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.700
a sonic boom or the acoustic
disturbance associated

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.030
with supersonic flight.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.930
And so basically, the
regulations for the FAA

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.230
and the regulations for
any aviation authority

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.730
all over the world
is that you can't

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.309
have that kind of acoustic
disturbance over land

00:33:23.309 --> 00:33:25.350
masses, which means that
supersonic flight, which

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.260
is being proposed, is
limited to basically

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.450
over-the-water travel,
which doesn't represent

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.190
the bulk of long
distance travel and also

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.800
requires you to go subsonic
before you actually approach

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.180
areas where people are living.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.060
So that happens to be
a technology limitation

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.400
associated with supersonic
air travel because

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.490
of the restrictions associated
with people not wanting

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.490
to be disturbed by a sonic
boom, which makes sense.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.010
And so that basically
prevents supersonic flight

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.752
over 70% of air travel,
right, because of the fact

00:33:52.752 --> 00:33:54.210
that you can be
limited over water.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.340
So it's only good for
transatlantic, transpacific,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.080
for a portion of it.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.170
And you have to
have a system really

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.880
to be able to be
autonomously controlled,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.517
same thing for Hyperloops, which
have to operate at high speeds.

00:34:06.517 --> 00:34:09.100
You also have to have aircraft
operate these high speeds, also

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.260
autonomously controlled.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.929
You can still have
a pilot in the loop.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.590
But you probably don't want
to have two or three pilots

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.260
in the loop.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.010
And if you take a look at the
projections of how many pilots

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.199
there exist today, there
aren't enough pilots now

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:22.050
to support the amount of air
traffic which is planned.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.110
So being able to shift
airplanes over to autonomy

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.346
also makes a lot of sense.

00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:28.679
And so that's where we're
headed with supersonic travel.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.053
And so one of the research
projects I'm working on at USC

00:34:31.053 --> 00:34:33.630
is actually the design
of a new aircraft, which

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.170
does have a technology
solution to reduce

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.600
the intensity of the
acoustic disturbance that

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.120
comes about as a result of the
sonic boom which is generated

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.659
by the supersonic environment.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.320
And although it
is IP restricted,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.989
the goal is you can come up
with a wing geometry, a wing

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.449
curvature, which interacts
with the exhaust plumes

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.750
of the engines, which are
providing you with your thrust,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.030
in order to mitigate
that disturbance.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.240
And the interesting thing is
there is analogy from the Mars

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.416
programme, where the Mars
landing systems actually have

00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:05.040
engines which point
towards the ground.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.780
They have supersonic
exhaust plumes.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.405
And depending on how you design
the curvature of the nozzle

00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:11.280
and how it interacts
with the ground beneath,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.960
you can actually dissipate
a lot of the energy

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.100
in those exhaust plumes.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.690
So there is a large
area of research

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.610
possible between the
aerodynamics of the wings

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.724
and the interaction of the
aerodynamics coming out

00:35:19.724 --> 00:35:21.390
of the exhaust plumes
where you can help

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.060
to mitigate that
sonic boom, reduce

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.650
the overall acoustic
disturbance,

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.810
and get it to levels which
then allows you to fly

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.240
within limits the FAA
imposes or whatever

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.250
the British authorities
or European authorities

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.640
would impose on people.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.250
And so that actually
would facilitate

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.282
the use of supersonic
air travel in that case.

00:35:37.282 --> 00:35:39.490
And so that's one final
aspect that we're working on.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.190
And we did a 3D
print of the vehicle.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.650
Now, the good news
is that you don't

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.770
have to build the
aircraft and fly

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.020
it to make sure that it works.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.840
You can use computational
fluid dynamics.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.180
And so when you're operating
a supersonic regime,

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.370
it is a little bit more
of a difficult regime

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.260
to be able to capture
the interactions in.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.130
But modern-day techniques
looking at turbulence

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.960
and having good
models for turbulence

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.670
enables you to get the
performance that you need out

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.830
of the wing and show ahead
of time that it works.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.630
You then make a model like
this for a wind tunnel.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.720
You wouldn't make
it out of plastic.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.180
You would make it
probably out of metallic.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.721
And then you would validate your
computational fluid dynamics

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:16.250
simulations by testing the
model in that environment

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.410
to show that it works.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.600
So this, I would say,
is going to happen

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.940
in the next 15 to 20 years.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.020
But the far future is
slightly different.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.020
So the far future,
I do believe, is

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.000
going to take us
off of planet Earth

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.710
and send us to other locations.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.570
And so I believe what's
in the far future

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.337
is for humans to
travel in space.

00:36:34.337 --> 00:36:36.170
And I think what you've
seen over the course

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.630
of the past five to seven
years or so with the advent

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.110
of SpaceX, Blue
Origin, Sierra Nevada

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.230
are companies who are developing
lower cost access to space

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.730
and then developing
vehicles to be

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.654
able to get you
from Earth to Mars

00:36:48.654 --> 00:36:50.820
and then eventually land
you on the surface of Mars.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.986
So this particular vehicle,
which is being developed

00:36:52.986 --> 00:36:55.970
by NASA, the Orion programme
or the Orion capsule,

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.967
is intended to take human
beings into deep space,

00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:01.550
whether that's to land them on
the surface of the moon or send

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.633
them all the way up to an
asteroid or to land them

00:37:03.633 --> 00:37:04.340
on Mars.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.044
And so whether you agree
or like space travel,

00:37:07.044 --> 00:37:08.960
there are many people
who are interested in it

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.960
for commercial purposes,
for space tourism purposes.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.420
And so there's a huge shift
in the transportation sector

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.000
to develop space-based
technologies to enable

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.470
people to live on other worlds.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:19.580
There's a whole
set of challenges

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.699
associated with that.

00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:22.490
A lot of them is
associated with the energy

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.914
cost of being able to
defeat Earth's gravity well.

00:37:24.914 --> 00:37:26.330
But the other, of
course, is being

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.520
able to slow down
and land safely

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.590
on the surface of another world.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.050
And then after you get
to the other world,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.850
the next important
thing is to be

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.030
able to survive there and set
up colonies on other planets.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.860
And so there is
work being done now

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.522
at NASA and in space
agencies around the world

00:37:42.522 --> 00:37:44.480
to understand what kind
of life support systems

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.105
are necessary to put yourself on
the surface of another planet.

00:37:47.105 --> 00:37:49.120
And this is an example
of a habitation module

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.620
which is being tested to show
that human beings can actually

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.434
live safely on the
surface of Mars

00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:56.600
not from the perspective
of looking at the radiation

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.433
environment, but from
the perspective of how

00:37:58.433 --> 00:38:01.040
are you able to regulate how
much water you consume, how are

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.380
you able to grow your own
food, how are you able

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.550
to provide that sort
of closed loop system

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.750
so that you can survive
for periods of nine months

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.440
to two years on the
surface of another planet.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.190
And so all the technologies--

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.780
we have to do a much better
job how we're doing it here

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.113
actually [INAUDIBLE] that point.

00:38:16.113 --> 00:38:18.860
And that leads to the very
final point, which is basically

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.930
in-situ resource utilisation.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.260
And so we've all thought
about recycling, right?

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.230
If we compost, we're able
to return our plant matter

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.560
and make it into soil.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.060
If we recycle our metals,
if we recycle our plastics,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.010
we're able to put it
back into that pipeline.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.560
But ultimately, if you're going
to travel to another world,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.720
you actually have to use the
resources on that other world.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.130
You can't bring
everything with you .

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.020
And we kind of have to
do that here at home.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.853
And so one of the ways
that you can tie this

00:38:43.853 --> 00:38:46.520
in to a rail-type system
or a Hyperloop-type system

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.260
is to utilise solar
panels, right,

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.470
on the exterior of the tube or
on the exterior of the track

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.100
where the system is going.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.880
And so there is a desire
to be able to implement

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.180
that type of closed-loop powered
system for a Hyperloop system

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.180
in the near future.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.702
And if you can somehow
couple that to,

00:39:02.702 --> 00:39:04.160
in some cases,
where you don't have

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.020
solar panels, the
use of trees to shade

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.954
to have more regulated
thermal environment,

00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:09.870
that's something that
we should also consider.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.870
But in-situ resource utilisation
for going to the moon,

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.050
for example, even the
Apollo astronauts used that.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.030
They actually filled
bags with sand,

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.670
put it over where they were to
provide additional radiation

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.180
protection.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.100
The same thing could
be done on Mars.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.141
But that's something that
we have to think about.

00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:25.790
Our mindset essentially
has to change

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:30.350
as we get to the fact that we're
hitting the edge of what we can

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.384
handle in terms of
fossil fuels and in terms

00:39:32.384 --> 00:39:34.050
of what the impact
is on climate change.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.600
So all the
technologies that we're

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.430
looking at today, whether
it be a Hyperloop which

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.440
is using grid-based power,
which hopefully is coming

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.840
from renewables, whether we're
looking at autonomous air

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.990
taxis which are using
electrified batteries, which

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.420
get their power from
grid-based power which can come

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.940
from renewables, or for
supersonic planes which

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.020
eventually could be
sort of a hybrid system

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.020
and having electrification
for some of the power

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.270
but still a backup of an
internal combustion engine,

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.120
are ways that we can have a
greener, more efficient future

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.950
for transporting ourselves
around the planet.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.610
And so the very last thing I
wanted to talked about today

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.770
is women in STEM.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:10.160
And so I was able to work on
a book with Libby Jackson.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.690
It's called Galaxy of Her Own.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.767
She's from the
European Space agency.

00:40:13.767 --> 00:40:16.100
She's an engineer there who
works on mission operations.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.084
And in 2017, she released a
book here on the UK and Europe.

00:40:19.084 --> 00:40:21.500
And then she released it in
the US under s different name,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.556
which is Galaxy Girls, which
is the story of 15 women

00:40:24.556 --> 00:40:26.180
and their roles in
the space programme.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.397
And for any of you who have
daughters or young women

00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:31.730
in your life who might be
interested in studying science

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.813
or engineering, this is a
very inspirational book.

00:40:33.813 --> 00:40:35.690
And it has basically
the stories of 15 women,

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:41.930
from Sally Ride to
Mae Jamison to all

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.120
of the most recent astronauts
are all in this book.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.890
And I do encourage
you to consider

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.692
getting a copy for your local
school or your local library

00:40:48.692 --> 00:40:50.900
or the women and the girls
that you have in your life

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.640
because it can be
quite inspirational.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.612
And that is something
which is important to me.

00:40:55.612 --> 00:40:57.320
And as I go around
giving public lectures

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.030
on the topic of a the
Hyperloop, on the topic of space

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.654
exploration, I always
like to encourage

00:41:00.654 --> 00:41:02.960
people to think about how
they can take what they've

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.610
learned these
lectures and spread it

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.650
to other people in their lives.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.930
But for the last, I,
guess 15 minutes or so,

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.745
I can take questions
from the audience.

00:41:10.745 --> 00:41:12.620
And I will actually try
and find that graphic

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.828
that was missing before, too.

00:41:13.828 --> 00:41:14.480
So thank you.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:21.430
[APPLAUSE]
