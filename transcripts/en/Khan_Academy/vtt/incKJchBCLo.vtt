00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's review a little bit
about what we know so

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.820
far about subtraction.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.210
So if I say 5 minus 3,
what does that mean?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.804
I could have 5-- let's
say I had to 5 berries.

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:21.930
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.520
So I could have 5 berries, and
when I say minus 3 you're

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.220
subtracting 3 from it.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.360
I can view that as saying
I'm going to take away

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.740
3 of these berries.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.220
So if I take away that berry,
that berry, and that berry.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.110
So I took away 1, 2, 3 berries.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.220
How many berries
do I have left?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.130
Well the only berries I have
left are right here-- 1, 2.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.750
So I have 2 berries
left just like that.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.060
Now the other way, the other
way that I could visualize or

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.710
think about 5 minus 3,
I'll do it over here.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.250
5 minus 3-- is to think
about what the difference

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.670
between 5 and 3 is.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.610
So let me draw this.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.280
So let's say I have 5 berries.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.560
And let's say that
you have 3 berries.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.600
Here's a slightly
different color.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960
You have 3 berries.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.110
So another way to think about
5 minus 3 is how many more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980
berries do I have
than you have?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.500
And if you look right here,
well, you see, this berry

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.110
is another-- you have
also one berry there.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.040
We both have one berry there,
we both have one berry there.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.970
But I've got 1, 2 berries
that you don't have.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.200
So once again, I have 2 more
berries than you have.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.220
Now we can also think of
this from the number

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.070
line point of view.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.300
So let me draw a number
line just like that.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.270
It's my number line.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.850
We've learned on the
addition videos we can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.620
keep going off forever.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.220
And actually, we could even go
to the left of 0 and go into

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.160
negative numbers, which
we'll see in future videos.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.720
But I'll start at 0.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.500
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--
I'll just go up to 7.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.330
So if we do 5 minus 3, if we
view 3 as being taken away from

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.890
5, 5 minus 3 means start at 5.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.890
If I did 5 plus 3 I would jump
3 spots to the right because

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.940
that's increasing the
number of things I have.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
But since I'm subtracting 3,
I want to decrease by 3.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.010
So I decrease by 1, 2, 3 and
I get to 2 just like that.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.770
Now if we visualize it from
this point of view, let me

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.160
draw another number line.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.820
I want to show you.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.280
I mean this is, I'm taking away
3 and here I'm saying, how

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.910
many more is 5 than 3?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.690
Even though they're the exact
same answer, but there are two

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.940
different ways to
think about it.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.480
Let me draw a number
line here again.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.830
Let me draw the
same number line.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.630
I have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.330
So if I were to plot where 5
is on this number line, so

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.770
this is the 5 right there.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.750
I'll put a little pink
square around it.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.490
5 is right there.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.720
Now 3, let me do 3 in
this yellow color.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110
3 is right here on
the number line.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.830
So in this way of thinking
about 5 minus 3 you're saying,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.630
what is the difference--
let me write that down.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.840
Here we're saying, what is the
difference between 5 and 3?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930
And to figure out the
difference you actually have to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.130
say, how much do you have to
add to 3 to get to 5?

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.200
So the difference here, how
different is 5 than 3?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.380
Well you have to go up 1
and then up 2 to get to 5.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.430
So the difference between 5,
which is all the way over here,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:04.520
and 3, which is just that
far, is 2, just like that.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.880
That right there is 2.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.250
Let me draw that
in another box.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.270
So that's 2 right here.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.770
I want to make this difference
between subtraction and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.060
difference-- I want to make it
at least reasonably clear to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.600
you because these are two
different ways of viewing

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.340
subtraction, but it ends up
being the exact same operation.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.650
You're going to get the same
answer regardless of which

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.530
way you think about it.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.760
Now, I could view-- let me
do different numbers now.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.550
Let me do 7 minus 4.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
So I could view this as,
maybe I have a 7 foot

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.240
long piece of wood.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.760
It's 7 feet long.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.710
If I put a ruler up against
it I would have 0,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.690
So I have a 7 foot
long piece of wood.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.930
And then I could saw
off 4 of those feet.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.985
So if I were to saw off
4 of these feet-- so

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.750
I saw off 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.170
How much wood do I have left?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.040
So all of this stuff right
here, I'm eliminating.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.660
I'm sawing it off.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.160
I'm sawing it off of the wood.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.820
Maybe I should do that in
a darker color to show

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.250
that I'm sawing it off.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.240
So all of this stuff is
going to disappear.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.720
I'm grinding it away.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.870
I'm sawing that off.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.890
So I'm just left with-- after I
saw the 4 inches or feet or

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.880
whatever of the wood, I'm left
with 1, 2, 3 inches of wood.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.600
So this is 3.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.700
So 7 minus 4 is equal to 3.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.410
This is viewing subtraction
as literally taking away.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.380
I sawed off the wood,
so I took away wood.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.070
Now I could think of it in a
slightly different way of

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.930
thinking about it, but give
you the exact same answer.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.610
We could say 7 minus 4.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.500
So once again, I could have
the 7 inch long piece

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.150
of wood like that.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:05.280
So if I put a ruler here
that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.940
So once again, a 7 inch
long piece of wood.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.080
And now instead of taking 4
away of it I'm comparing it--

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.740
so that's a 7-- I'm comparing
it to a 4 inch long

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.280
piece of wood.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.830
So I have another 4 inch long
piece of wood right there.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.750
That's my 4 inch long piece of
wood. that's 7, this is 4.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.770
You could view 7 minus 4 as
taking 4 inches away from

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.580
the long piece of wood.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.610
Or you could view seven minus 4
as the difference between the 4

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.530
inch piece of wood and the
7 inch piece of wood.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.060
So in this case, what's
the difference?

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.310
To go from the 4 inch piece of
wood to the 7 inch piece of

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.030
wood I would have to grow by 3
inches, or I would have to add

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.370
a 3 inch piece of wood somehow.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.600
Or the wood would somehow
have to grow by 3 inches in

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.170
order to become 7 inches.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.480
So these are 2 completely
equivalent ways to

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.430
view subtraction.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.370
That's all a little bit of a
review from the last video.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.290
Now what I also want to do in
this video is start tackling

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.380
slightly larger problems.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.170
But you'll see that really,
the number line applies just

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.070
equally as well as to kind
of the simpler problems

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.260
that we've done before.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.380
Let's do 17 minus 9.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.280
So just like everything
else, there's two ways

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.990
we could've done it.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.280
You know, the more slow way is
you could draw 17 objects.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.740
Let's say I have 17 chips.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:35.790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.750
And I'm going to take
away 9 of them.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.890
So I'm going to take away
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.810
How many am I left with?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.450
I'm left with 1, 2,
3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.300
So 17 minus 9 is equal to 8.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.390
But that took a long time and
you could imagine, if this

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.510
number was a lot bigger it
would've taken me forever to

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.570
draw all of these circles and
then scratch out things.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.750
And it would've wasted
paper and time.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.160
And we have other things to do.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.050
So another way you could do it,
and maybe this would be easier

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.930
for you to visualize, is
to draw the number line.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.260
You always don't
have to start at 0.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:20.480
So if we draw the number line,
if we say that's 18, 17, 16,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:32.210
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
7-- you could imagine, I could

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.550
keep going to the left
all the way to 0.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.790
But I start at 17.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.460
I could start at 17 and
take away 9 from it.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:49.460
So I go 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.370
And once again, we
are left at 8.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.660
Now this was, at least in my
head, a little bit cleaner

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.110
and faster than this one.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.190
But in either case, you don't
want to do this every time you

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.160
have to subtract 9 from 17 or
want to find the difference

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.990
between 17 and 9.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.000
And then to realize that's 8.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.910
So this is something that
eventually you want

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.080
to internalize.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.720
You'll want to know by heart
that, oh, 17 minus 9?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.200
I know that is 8.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.320
And by the way, 17 minus 8?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.270
What's 17 minus 8?

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.710
Well, that is 9.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.820
And now why does all
of this make sense?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.270
Because 8 plus 9
is equal to 17.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.860
So 17 minus 9 is 8.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.330
Or 17 minus 8 is 9.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.110
When I say 17 minus 8, I'm
essentially saying that is

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.550
equal to some number that if I
were to add to 8 will equal 17.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.580
Well, that's 9.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.720
When I say 17 minus 9 that's
saying, there's some number,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.250
that if I were to add
it to 9, I'll get 17.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.170
And that's 8.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.620
So all of these, all of these
statements, are kind of

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.760
saying the same thing.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.500
That 8 plus 9 are 17.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.660
Or the difference
between 17 and 9 is 8.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.120
Or the difference
between 17 and 8 is 9.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.560
Hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.660
So for most of these
subtraction problems where the

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.620
answer is a one-digit answer,
you should eventually have them

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.980
memorized, but in your head
it's good to be imagining

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.640
this number line.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.890
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.470
And then, once we have these
memorized or at least be able

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.880
to do a number line if we
forget, I'll show you have to

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.460
do any subtraction problem,
arbitrarily for super

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.860
large numbers.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:37.050
So let's say we're going
to do 13 minus 5.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.660
So once again, I'm not going
to do the whole circles

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.540
or the berries this time.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.460
I'm just going to draw
the number line.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.720
Just draw the number
line like that.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:58.450
Let's start at 14, 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5-- and you

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.460
just can keep going
lower and lower.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.510
You can go to 0 or you
can even go past 0.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.830
We'll talk about
that in the future.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.810
But we start at 13.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.960
We're starting at 13.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.620
And we're going to
take 5 away from it.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.920
So this is the subtraction
view of subtraction;

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.200
we're taking away.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.340
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and we land at 8.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.010
So 13 minus 5-- let me
do this in a new color.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.810
13 minus 5 is equal to 8.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.580
Now another way we could
have thought about that,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.980
I plotted where 13 is.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.060
I can plot where 5 is.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.850
I could say look, this is 5.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.760
5 is right here on
my number line.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.736
What do I have to add
to 5 to get to 13?

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:43.280
So let's see.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.250
I would have to go 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.180
I have to add 8 to
5 to get to 13.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.790
5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.940
So that tells me that 13
minus 5 is equal to 8.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.210
This also tells me that 13
minus 8 is equal to 5.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.690
All of these, are on some
level, telling me the

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.650
exact same thing.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.635
But the difference
between 13 and 5 is 8.

00:12:11.635 --> 00:12:14.410
The difference between
13 and 8 is 5.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.080
5 plus 8 is 13.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.780
So hopefully you have the hang
of that and if you haven't done

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.940
so already, it'll be good
to practice all of these.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.240
Taking a teen number and then
subtracting any of the

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.470
one-digit numbers from
those teen numbers.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.110
That's in general, very,
very good practice for you.
