talk called a moving experience is the
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.599
talk called a moving experience is the
idea that motion in our real world is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
idea that motion in our real world is
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.230

not linear so if you want a UI to feel

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
not linear so if you want a UI to feel
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.450
not linear so if you want a UI to feel
more natural to the user more organic

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
more natural to the user more organic
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.640
more natural to the user more organic
more like it's a real-world application

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
more like it's a real-world application
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.380
more like it's a real-world application
then maybe the motion in your

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
then maybe the motion in your
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.780
then maybe the motion in your
application shouldn't be linearly now we

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
application shouldn't be linearly now we
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780

motion overshooting we have by default
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020
motion overshooting we have by default
you accelerate into and out of any

animation so the time aspect is already
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250
animation so the time aspect is already
handled so that feels a little bit more

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
handled so that feels a little bit more
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.979

that using the existing animation API is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
that using the existing animation API is
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420
that using the existing animation API is
that we already offer in the platform so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
that we already offer in the platform so
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.560
that we already offer in the platform so
we can take a look at the following demo

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
we can take a look at the following demo
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.899
we can take a look at the following demo
very simple we have a boring button on

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
very simple we have a boring button on
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940
very simple we have a boring button on
the upper left side of the screen and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
the upper left side of the screen and
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429
the upper left side of the screen and
now it's a boring button on the lower

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
now it's a boring button on the lower
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380
now it's a boring button on the lower
right side of the screen so these are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
right side of the screen so these are
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330
right side of the screen so these are
two different layouts where we determine

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
two different layouts where we determine
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850
two different layouts where we determine
where the button needs to be in the two

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
where the button needs to be in the two
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499
where the button needs to be in the two
positions and we basically just toggle

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
positions and we basically just toggle
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420
positions and we basically just toggle
between them but as we toggle between

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
between them but as we toggle between
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370
between them but as we toggle between
them we animate the position change

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
them we animate the position change
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679
them we animate the position change
using the approach that I'll go over in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
using the approach that I'll go over in
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.880
using the approach that I'll go over in
the code starting now okay so in our

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
the code starting now okay so in our
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429
the code starting now okay so in our
click listener we call this method

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
click listener we call this method
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469
click listener we call this method
called move button here this simply sets

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
called move button here this simply sets
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.959
called move button here this simply sets
the layout parameters to tell the button

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
the layout parameters to tell the button
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789
the layout parameters to tell the button
to be either at the upper left or lower

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
to be either at the upper left or lower
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.180
to be either at the upper left or lower
right

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
right
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.390
right
very straightforward then we add an on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
very straightforward then we add an on
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.920
very straightforward then we add an on
pre-draw listener which is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
pre-draw listener which is
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.369
pre-draw listener which is
Niq that I use a lot in animation demos

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379
Niq that I use a lot in animation demos
 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.559
Niq that I use a lot in animation demos
which basically allows layout to run

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
which basically allows layout to run
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.479
which basically allows layout to run
from the previous change in this case we

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
from the previous change in this case we
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.849
from the previous change in this case we
set the layout parameters on the view

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859
set the layout parameters on the view
 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.610
set the layout parameters on the view
layout is going to run and then it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
layout is going to run and then it's
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.750
layout is going to run and then it's
going to change the position of the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
going to change the position of the
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.759
going to change the position of the
button but before we draw that change on

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769
button but before we draw that change on
 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.379
button but before we draw that change on
the screen we're going to figure out

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389
the screen we're going to figure out
 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.449
the screen we're going to figure out
where the button is now we know where it

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459
where the button is now we know where it
 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.459
where the button is now we know where it
was before because we track that in

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469
was before because we track that in
 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.679
was before because we track that in
these old left and old top properties up

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689
these old left and old top properties up
 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.559
these old left and old top properties up
here and now we can figure out the Delta

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
here and now we can figure out the Delta
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.449
here and now we can figure out the Delta
between those between the X and the y

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
between those between the X and the y
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.910
between those between the X and the y
values and animate the change now if all

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
values and animate the change now if all
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.319
values and animate the change now if all
we did was set up an animation to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329
we did was set up an animation to
 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.110
we did was set up an animation to
animate X and animate y very easy to set

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
animate X and animate y very easy to set
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.429
animate X and animate y very easy to set
up but it's going to give you the linear

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439
up but it's going to give you the linear
 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.960
up but it's going to give you the linear
motion that simply moves the button

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
motion that simply moves the button
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.789
motion that simply moves the button
linearly from the upper left to the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
linearly from the upper left to the
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.530
linearly from the upper left to the
lower right and we really wanted the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
lower right and we really wanted the
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.479
lower right and we really wanted the
curved motion instead so we're going to

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
curved motion instead so we're going to
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.159
curved motion instead so we're going to
use some helper classes in here

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169
use some helper classes in here
 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.020
use some helper classes in here
we're going to use this animator path

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
we're going to use this animator path
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.750
we're going to use this animator path
class that I've defined that's similar

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
class that I've defined that's similar
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.909
class that I've defined that's similar
to but you much simpler than the path

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919
to but you much simpler than the path
 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.830
to but you much simpler than the path
object that we provide in the framework

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
object that we provide in the framework
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.080
object that we provide in the framework
it also has a query capability that will

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
it also has a query capability that will
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.119
it also has a query capability that will
return this array of points which is

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129
return this array of points which is
 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.740
return this array of points which is
sort of important for the interpolation

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
sort of important for the interpolation
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.020
sort of important for the interpolation
that I needed to do with it so in the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
that I needed to do with it so in the
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.479
that I needed to do with it so in the
animator path you can basically use one

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489
animator path you can basically use one
 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.099
animator path you can basically use one
of three methods to set up your path you

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109
of three methods to set up your path you
 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.960
of three methods to set up your path you
can do a move to a line too and a curve

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
can do a move to a line too and a curve
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.119
can do a move to a line too and a curve
too so I'm going to tell the path to

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129
too so I'm going to tell the path to
 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.729
too so I'm going to tell the path to
move to the old position of the button

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
move to the old position of the button
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.979
move to the old position of the button
and then curve to the new position of

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
and then curve to the new position of
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.659
and then curve to the new position of
the button and the arguments to the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669
the button and the arguments to the
 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.939
the button and the arguments to the
curve 2 are both the end position as

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949
curve 2 are both the end position as
 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.069
curve 2 are both the end position as
well as a couple of control points in

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079
well as a couple of control points in
 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.210
well as a couple of control points in
the middle and this is basically

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
the middle and this is basically
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.059
the middle and this is basically
defining a cubic Bezier spline between

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069
defining a cubic Bezier spline between
 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.589
defining a cubic Bezier spline between
the two points we have anchor points at

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599
the two points we have anchor points at
 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.539
the two points we have anchor points at
the end and control points in the middle

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
the end and control points in the middle
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.569
the end and control points in the middle
that determine the motion of that object

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
that determine the motion of that object
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.670
that determine the motion of that object
along this curve in this case is a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
along this curve in this case is a
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.520
along this curve in this case is a
simple curve that's just going to go in

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
simple curve that's just going to go in
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.670
simple curve that's just going to go in
a simple arc down to the lower right and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680
a simple arc down to the lower right and
 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.460
a simple arc down to the lower right and
then back to the upper left we create an

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
then back to the upper left we create an
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.379
then back to the upper left we create an
object animator on our objects and we're

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389
object animator on our objects and we're
 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.089
object animator on our objects and we're
going to animate this property called

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099
going to animate this property called
 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.830
going to animate this property called
button look which I've defined a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
button look which I've defined a
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.689
button look which I've defined a
property setter for which we'll see

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699
property setter for which we'll see
 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.369
property setter for which we'll see
below we're going to use this path

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379
below we're going to use this path
 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.349
below we're going to use this path
evaluator which is a class I defined to

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359
evaluator which is a class I defined to
 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.330
evaluator which is a class I defined to
evaluate between these different types

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340
evaluate between these different types
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.309
evaluate between these different types
of objects one of the nice things about

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319
of objects one of the nice things about
 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.170
of objects one of the nice things about
the property animation system is sure

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
the property animation system is sure
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.060
the property animation system is sure
you can animate floats and ends but

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
you can animate floats and ends but
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.920
you can animate floats and ends but
sometimes you have a more complex data

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
sometimes you have a more complex data
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.890
sometimes you have a more complex data
structure like a rect or a point or in

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900
structure like a rect or a point or in
 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.200
structure like a rect or a point or in
this case the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210
this case the
 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.689
this case the
path objects these path points along the

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699
path objects these path points along the
 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.820
path objects these path points along the
curve then how would you interpolate

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
curve then how would you interpolate
 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.290
curve then how would you interpolate
along those well the system doesn't know

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300
along those well the system doesn't know
 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.450
along those well the system doesn't know
how to but you can tell it how to by

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460
how to but you can tell it how to by
 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.580
how to but you can tell it how to by
providing one of these type evaluators

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590
providing one of these type evaluators
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.490
providing one of these type evaluators
to get a callback on every frame and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500
to get a callback on every frame and
 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.170
to get a callback on every frame and
then you simply do the interpolation for

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180
then you simply do the interpolation for
 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.730
then you simply do the interpolation for
the system and pass back the appropriate

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740
the system and pass back the appropriate
 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.370
the system and pass back the appropriate
values and then finally for the points

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380
values and then finally for the points
 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.689
values and then finally for the points
that are going to animate between we do

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699
that are going to animate between we do
 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.370
that are going to animate between we do
a query into our animator path and

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380
a query into our animator path and
 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.779
a query into our animator path and
that's going to return this array of

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789
that's going to return this array of
 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.900
that's going to return this array of
points that define the animation we set

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910
points that define the animation we set
 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.370
points that define the animation we set
an interpolator on this thing and we

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
an interpolator on this thing and we
 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.559
an interpolator on this thing and we
start and we're all good to go so we can

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569
start and we're all good to go so we can
 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.939
start and we're all good to go so we can
take a look at the bottom we have this

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949
take a look at the bottom we have this
 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.230
take a look at the bottom we have this
property setter that would be defined

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240
property setter that would be defined
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.420
property setter that would be defined
called set button Lok this is going to

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430
called set button Lok this is going to
 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.600
called set button Lok this is going to
get this object called path point which

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610
get this object called path point which
 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.920
get this object called path point which
is a data structure that holds the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930
is a data structure that holds the
 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.870
is a data structure that holds the
information and then we simply set the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880
information and then we simply set the
 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.999
information and then we simply set the
translation X and translation Y property

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009
translation X and translation Y property
 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.129
translation X and translation Y property
of the view according to what was in

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139
of the view according to what was in
 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.710
of the view according to what was in
that path point object we can take a

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720
that path point object we can take a
 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.710
that path point object we can take a
look at the path points this is simply a

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720
look at the path points this is simply a
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.390
look at the path points this is simply a
data structure that says what kind of

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400
data structure that says what kind of
 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.310
data structure that says what kind of
point is this it's a move or a line or a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320
point is this it's a move or a line or a
 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.320
point is this it's a move or a line or a
curve and then has information about

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330
curve and then has information about
 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.140
curve and then has information about
those points internally the animator

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150
those points internally the animator
 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.540
those points internally the animator
path that we saw before allows you to

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550
path that we saw before allows you to
 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.460
path that we saw before allows you to
build up this path of successive points

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470
build up this path of successive points
 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.730
build up this path of successive points
and then query the points once you're

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740
and then query the points once you're
 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.020
and then query the points once you're
done so we can actually set up the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030
done so we can actually set up the
 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.060
done so we can actually set up the
animation on it and then finally we have

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070
animation on it and then finally we have
 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.950
animation on it and then finally we have
the type evaluator and the one that we

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960
the type evaluator and the one that we
 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.409
the type evaluator and the one that we
defined is called path eval your

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419
defined is called path eval your
 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.550
defined is called path eval your
evaluator and it just uses this

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560
evaluator and it just uses this
 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.040
evaluator and it just uses this
straightforward calculation so it looks

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050
straightforward calculation so it looks
 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.360
straightforward calculation so it looks
like a lot of garbage going on in here

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370
like a lot of garbage going on in here
 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.379
like a lot of garbage going on in here
this is actually a really simple

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389
this is actually a really simple
 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.260
this is actually a really simple
calculation it's a standard spline

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270
calculation it's a standard spline
 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.689
calculation it's a standard spline
calculation so given a value T the time

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699
calculation so given a value T the time
 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.939
calculation so given a value T the time
in this animation we can calculate the x

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949
in this animation we can calculate the x
 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.219
in this animation we can calculate the x
and y values on the curve one caveat

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229
and y values on the curve one caveat
 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.779
and y values on the curve one caveat
that I mentioned in the article as well

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789
that I mentioned in the article as well
 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.879
that I mentioned in the article as well
is this is not necessarily the motion

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889
is this is not necessarily the motion
 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.070
is this is not necessarily the motion
all along the curve that you want what

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080
all along the curve that you want what
 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.159
all along the curve that you want what
you really want is in general to take

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169
you really want is in general to take
 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.529
you really want is in general to take
the T value of how far along the curve

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539
the T value of how far along the curve
 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.600
the T value of how far along the curve
is and use that to extract your x and y

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610
is and use that to extract your x and y
 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.339
is and use that to extract your x and y
values that requires a little bit more

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349
values that requires a little bit more
 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:10.570
values that requires a little bit more
code I didn't want to get into it in

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580
code I didn't want to get into it in
 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.089
code I didn't want to get into it in
this simple example the effect that

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099
this simple example the effect that
 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.409
this simple example the effect that
you'd get by using this simplistic

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419
you'd get by using this simplistic
 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.180
you'd get by using this simplistic
approach here is on a hairpin turns

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190
approach here is on a hairpin turns
 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.999
approach here is on a hairpin turns
you'd go a lot faster so you really want

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009
you'd go a lot faster so you really want
 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.740
you'd go a lot faster so you really want
to spread out that motion evenly along

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750
to spread out that motion evenly along
 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.080
to spread out that motion evenly along
the curve kind of a detail maybe it'll

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090
the curve kind of a detail maybe it'll
 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.700
the curve kind of a detail maybe it'll
matter in some of your curves so you

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710
matter in some of your curves so you
 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.620
matter in some of your curves so you
should know about it but if you want a

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630
should know about it but if you want a
 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.930
should know about it but if you want a
simple approach here's one

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940
simple approach here's one
 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.820
simple approach here's one
so curved motion in general if you're

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830
so curved motion in general if you're
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.980
