00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Congratulations, you have done an amazing thing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You've calculated the circumference of the earth.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You've learned trigonometry.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And you've analyzed error and uncertainty.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is amazing. Good work.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Next time, we're going to go to Pisa, Italy, where Galileo Galilei was born

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to redo some of his famous experiments on motion

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and answer the question how do objects move?

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See you in class.
