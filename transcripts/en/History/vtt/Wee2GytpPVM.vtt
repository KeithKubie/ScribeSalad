00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.970
NARRATOR: In the
remote Ozark mountains,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.570
homesteader Jason Hawk is
pushing deeper than ever

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.000
into the wilderness--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.970
If you're not hunting,
you're buying more.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.700
NARRATOR: --to put an
end to a dry spell--

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.830
But it just hasn't been
a good year for hunting.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.900
NARRATOR: --that's left him
without a new supply of meat

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.500
for more than six weeks.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
I keep moving further
and further out,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.770
trying to look for, you know,
where the game's hiding at.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.400
It's just continually
pushing into new territory.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.570
And sometimes, that's
what you've got to do.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.700
But it's just kind of quiet.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.130
NARRATOR: But it's
deep into winter,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.130
and the pickings are slim.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.570
What the hell is that?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
Metal, maybe?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.070
Old grain hopper or something.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.400
[suspenseful music]

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.770
Oh.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.000
It's a damn plane.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.070
You don't find a
plane every day.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.170
This is neat.
I'll be damned.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.070
The seat, flaps, pedal controls.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.400
She's stable.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.230
This whole area back here
used to be farm country.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.900
It's got to be some kind of
old crop duster or something.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.330
That's not aged aluminum that's
melted all in through here.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.430
You can see where it's
melted onto different pieces

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.430
of the frame.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.270
And this thing
either caught on fire

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
and crashed, or crashed
and caught on fire.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.500
I'm not seeing any remains.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.770
Hopefully, they walked
or hobbled out of here.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.830
Man, I wonder what its
story is and how long

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.430
this thing's been sitting here.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.570
I see some fiberglass in here.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.270
So my guess, roughly, is
probably that the plane came

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.670
out of somewhere in the '60s.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.670
In a piece like this,
there's higher carbon

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030
steel, lower carbon steel.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.330
Instead of harvesting
meat, I think it's time

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.200
to harvest some metal.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
NARRATOR: A salvage
job of this size

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.230
could yield thousands of
dollars of raw material

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.800
if it's the right kind of steel.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.830
I'm going to go back to
the shop, get my goods,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.800
and then, hopefully, turn
this plane into some money.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.700
NARRATOR: On the back country
trails of the Ozark mountains,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.130
Jason heads back to the site
of a long abandoned plane crash

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.330
to salvage what he hopes is
a jackpot of forgeable steel.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.000
One of the first
things I'm going to do

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.870
is pull out the grinder and
take all the small stuff.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.970
If there's anything with enough
carbon in it to make good edge,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.400
it's going to be the cable.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.230
So I'm going to start there.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.600
NARRATOR: Steel is
one of the strongest

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.970
alloys on earth,
created by mixing

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.500
iron ore with pure carbon.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.700
The higher the carbon
content, the harder the steel.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.070
I like that piece.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.370
NARRATOR: But Jason won't know
what he's got until he tests

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.670
the samples back at his shop.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.970
I've done just about
what I can on the grinder.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.430
Now it's time to get in,
get the cutting torch,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.970
and take out some chunks.
Oh.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.500
That's a pretty good
piece of steel--

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.670
make something interesting.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.730
Out of gas.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.370
Looks like this is
what I'm taking today.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.000
I've got a bunch
harvested at this point.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.730
Torch is dead.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.870
It's time to pack it
up and head on home.
