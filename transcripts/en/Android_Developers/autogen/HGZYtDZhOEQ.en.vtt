hi everyone my name's Nate and I'm here
from the web you team and I'd like to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
from the web you team and I'd like to
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.289
from the web you team and I'd like to
talk about some modern webview best

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
talk about some modern webview best
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.529
talk about some modern webview best
practices or as I like to call it using

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
practices or as I like to call it using
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.750
practices or as I like to call it using
webview like it's 2018 because it is so

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
webview like it's 2018 because it is so
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060
webview like it's 2018 because it is so
before I dive into what's modern with

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
before I dive into what's modern with
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650
before I dive into what's modern with
webview let's talk a little bit about

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
webview let's talk a little bit about
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.839
webview let's talk a little bit about
what's old

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849
what's old
 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.700
what's old
so web views been around since the very

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
so web views been around since the very
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130
so web views been around since the very
beginning it was added back in API level

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
beginning it was added back in API level
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590
beginning it was added back in API level
1 and it changed in a significant way

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
1 and it changed in a significant way
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
1 and it changed in a significant way
starting with lollipop it became

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
starting with lollipop it became
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209
starting with lollipop it became
updatable the implementation was and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
updatable the implementation was and
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280
updatable the implementation was and
this is great because it meant that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
this is great because it meant that
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.229
this is great because it meant that
users could benefit from security fixes

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
users could benefit from security fixes
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.810
users could benefit from security fixes
and bug fixes in an update every six

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
and bug fixes in an update every six
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.389
and bug fixes in an update every six
weeks just like your browser but a lot

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
weeks just like your browser but a lot
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.560
weeks just like your browser but a lot
has changed since then too

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
has changed since then too
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.880
has changed since then too
we've added 40 new api's just to make it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
we've added 40 new api's just to make it
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590
we've added 40 new api's just to make it
easier to work with webview to help

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
easier to work with webview to help
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.790
easier to work with webview to help
developers okay but what's really

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
developers okay but what's really
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280
developers okay but what's really
changed well when we look out at the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
changed well when we look out at the
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080
changed well when we look out at the
ecosystem it seems like apps are kind of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
ecosystem it seems like apps are kind of
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.789
ecosystem it seems like apps are kind of
using webview the same way they've

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
using webview the same way they've
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.359
using webview the same way they've
always used it and you know when you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
always used it and you know when you
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760
always used it and you know when you
look at sec overflow the answers are

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
look at sec overflow the answers are
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010
look at sec overflow the answers are
outdated at best they certainly aren't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
outdated at best they certainly aren't
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230
outdated at best they certainly aren't
best practices and often times they're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
best practices and often times they're
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.260
best practices and often times they're
just wrong but some of the blame is on

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
just wrong but some of the blame is on
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300
just wrong but some of the blame is on
our shoulders to our API Doc's are

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
our shoulders to our API Doc's are
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.359
our shoulders to our API Doc's are
written like it's still API level 1 and

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369
written like it's still API level 1 and
 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.320
written like it's still API level 1 and
you know everything has changed since

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
you know everything has changed since
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.140
you know everything has changed since
then so something that we did is we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
then so something that we did is we
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.499
then so something that we did is we
looked over the past year and we looked

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
looked over the past year and we looked
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.090
looked over the past year and we looked
at at the Android ecosystem and we

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
at at the Android ecosystem and we
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.469
at at the Android ecosystem and we
looked at the devices that are out there

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
looked at the devices that are out there
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.039
looked at the devices that are out there
today

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
today
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260
today
and what we found is that although we

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
and what we found is that although we
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660
and what we found is that although we
added you know for example a new gate we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
added you know for example a new gate we
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.300
added you know for example a new gate we
added all these great api's a lot of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
added all these great api's a lot of
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190
added all these great api's a lot of
apps can't really take advantage of them

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
apps can't really take advantage of them
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780
apps can't really take advantage of them
because they only run on the nougat

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
because they only run on the nougat
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330
because they only run on the nougat
devices and that's less than 50% of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
devices and that's less than 50% of
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520
devices and that's less than 50% of
devices today and has been over two

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
devices today and has been over two
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.429
devices today and has been over two
years since it came out but what we also

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
years since it came out but what we also
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.850
years since it came out but what we also
saw is that almost 90% of devices are

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
saw is that almost 90% of devices are
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319
saw is that almost 90% of devices are
running lollipop which means that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
running lollipop which means that
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420
running lollipop which means that
they're taking webview updates and it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
they're taking webview updates and it
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130
they're taking webview updates and it
means that this webview implementation

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
means that this webview implementation
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200
means that this webview implementation
on the device actually implements all

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
on the device actually implements all
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.290
on the device actually implements all
these new api's they just aren't exposed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
these new api's they just aren't exposed
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.470
these new api's they just aren't exposed
on older platform levels so we thought

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
on older platform levels so we thought
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.559
on older platform levels so we thought
can we do better

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569
can we do better
 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.660
can we do better
so over the past year we've worked on

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
so over the past year we've worked on
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.750
so over the past year we've worked on
our Android X library we launched a new

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
our Android X library we launched a new
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.160
our Android X library we launched a new
Android X library and we're pretty

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
Android X library and we're pretty
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.619
Android X library and we're pretty
excited about it and the basic idea is

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629
excited about it and the basic idea is
 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.089
excited about it and the basic idea is
that we're gonna bring all these brand

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099
that we're gonna bring all these brand
 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.059
that we're gonna bring all these brand
new developer api's but we're gonna try

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
new developer api's but we're gonna try
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.770
new developer api's but we're gonna try
to give you the device coverage you need

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
to give you the device coverage you need
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.020
to give you the device coverage you need
and we're gonna support lollipop and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
and we're gonna support lollipop and
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.550
and we're gonna support lollipop and
above we're gonna do this by leveraging

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
above we're gonna do this by leveraging
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.850
above we're gonna do this by leveraging
webbie's update cycle but we also spent

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
webbie's update cycle but we also spent
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500
webbie's update cycle but we also spent
a lot of time on this library to make

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
a lot of time on this library to make
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.240
a lot of time on this library to make
sure it's really usable that you can

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
sure it's really usable that you can
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.410
sure it's really usable that you can
actually use these api's to do

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
actually use these api's to do
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630
actually use these api's to do
productive things so we designed them to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
productive things so we designed them to
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520
productive things so we designed them to
be fairly straightforward to swap out

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
be fairly straightforward to swap out
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.119
be fairly straightforward to swap out
from the frameworks api's alright so

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129
from the frameworks api's alright so
 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.789
from the frameworks api's alright so
this all sounds fine but how can we

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
this all sounds fine but how can we
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:53.930
this all sounds fine but how can we
actually use this to make your apps

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
actually use this to make your apps
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.250
actually use this to make your apps
better so let's take an example since

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
better so let's take an example since
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.259
better so let's take an example since
the very beginning of android we've

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269
the very beginning of android we've
 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.229
the very beginning of android we've
given apps a lot of power to customize

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
given apps a lot of power to customize
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.470
given apps a lot of power to customize
web views behavior and in particular we

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
web views behavior and in particular we
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180
web views behavior and in particular we
added a callback called should override

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
added a callback called should override
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.220
added a callback called should override
URL loading and the idea behind this

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
URL loading and the idea behind this
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.280
URL loading and the idea behind this
callback is that you can choose to for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
callback is that you can choose to for
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.710
callback is that you can choose to for
Souderton navigations you know cancel

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720
Souderton navigations you know cancel
 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.300
Souderton navigations you know cancel
these in the webview and dispatch them

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
these in the webview and dispatch them
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.250
these in the webview and dispatch them
to a different app instead as an Android

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
to a different app instead as an Android
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.559
to a different app instead as an Android
intent so the example is you might have

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569
intent so the example is you might have
 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.710
intent so the example is you might have
a YouTube URL but that might be better

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
a YouTube URL but that might be better
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.589
a YouTube URL but that might be better
suited in the YouTube app and this

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
suited in the YouTube app and this
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.059
suited in the YouTube app and this
sounds great a lot of apps took

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069
sounds great a lot of apps took
 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.069
sounds great a lot of apps took
advantage of this actually but there's a

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079
advantage of this actually but there's a
 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.020
advantage of this actually but there's a
problem with the API we didn't get it

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
problem with the API we didn't get it
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.710
problem with the API we didn't get it
right the first time

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720
right the first time
 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.199
right the first time
the issues that JavaScript can trigger

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
the issues that JavaScript can trigger
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.930
the issues that JavaScript can trigger

actually trigger this navigation and it

actually trigger this navigation and it
actually works really really well but it

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
actually works really really well but it
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.050
actually works really really well but it
only works on these nougat and above

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060
only works on these nougat and above
 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.500
only works on these nougat and above
devices and these before nougat devices

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
devices and these before nougat devices
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.009
devices and these before nougat devices
are still vulnerable so we thought this

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019
are still vulnerable so we thought this

was a great candidate for Android X

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580
was a great candidate for Android X
 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.700

library the idea is we're going to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
library the idea is we're going to
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.470

expose this user gesture organ

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480
expose this user gesture organ
 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.110
expose this user gesture organ
all the way back to lollipop and this

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120
all the way back to lollipop and this
 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960
all the way back to lollipop and this
means that you get this device coverage

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970
means that you get this device coverage
 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.090
means that you get this device coverage
for all these devices and you can

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100
for all these devices and you can
 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.710
for all these devices and you can
provide the safe experience to your

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720
provide the safe experience to your
 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.530
provide the safe experience to your
users but we also made sure that this

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540
users but we also made sure that this
 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.240

would be really easy for apps to

would be really easy for apps to
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.060
would be really easy for apps to
override there'd be no confusion so I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070

think we succeeded but let's take a look

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530
think we succeeded but let's take a look
 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.770
think we succeeded but let's take a look
at the code

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780
at the code
 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.690
at the code
so before nougat here's kind of what our

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700
so before nougat here's kind of what our
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.060
so before nougat here's kind of what our
code what a lot of apps code might have

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070
code what a lot of apps code might have
 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.400
code what a lot of apps code might have
looked like we're overriding should

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410
looked like we're overriding should
 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290
looked like we're overriding should

of this we might be dispatching intents

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
of this we might be dispatching intents

of this we might be dispatching intents
and this is the insecure version of the

and this is the insecure version of the
 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.230
and this is the insecure version of the

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
API but back in those days this is the
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.350
API but back in those days this is the
best we could do some of the better apps

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
best we could do some of the better apps
 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.420
best we could do some of the better apps
out there and when nougat was released

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430
out there and when nougat was released
 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400
out there and when nougat was released
might it have something like this so

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410
might it have something like this so
 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.050
might it have something like this so
you're overriding the old implementation

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060
you're overriding the old implementation
 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.850
you're overriding the old implementation
from before and this is for those before

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
from before and this is for those before
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.250
from before and this is for those before
nougat devices but for the new devices

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260
nougat devices but for the new devices
 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.370
nougat devices but for the new devices
you have this new implementation and

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380
you have this new implementation and
 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.530
you have this new implementation and
we're checking user gesture and we're

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540
we're checking user gesture and we're
 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.770
we're checking user gesture and we're
not launching intent if we have the if

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780
not launching intent if we have the if
 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.620
not launching intent if we have the if
we don't have user gesture so this seems

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630
we don't have user gesture so this seems
 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.450
we don't have user gesture so this seems
great but you know it only runs on a

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460
great but you know it only runs on a

beautiful it means all the code that you

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530
beautiful it means all the code that you
 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.310
beautiful it means all the code that you
already wrote to handle you know the old

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890
client compact class from our Android X
 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.830
client compact class from our Android X
library and we're setting this compact

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840
library and we're setting this compact

you're using the compact client all
these callbacks will get instead of only

these callbacks will get instead of only
invoked on nougat and above they'll

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960
invoked on nougat and above they'll
 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.660

actually get invoked all the way back to

actually get invoked all the way back to
 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.450
actually get invoked all the way back to
lollipop so you're going to get the

changing a whole lot of code this is

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050
changing a whole lot of code this is
 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.480
changing a whole lot of code this is
just one example of what we have to

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490
just one example of what we have to
 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.060
just one example of what we have to
offer in Android X so I'd really like to

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070
offer in Android X so I'd really like to
 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.030
offer in Android X so I'd really like to
encourage you to go check it out and see

good device coverage we almost 90% but

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:14.349
good device coverage we almost 90% but
 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.140
good device coverage we almost 90% but
what about these AP eyes that have been

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150
what about these AP eyes that have been
 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.370
what about these AP eyes that have been
around forever

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380
around forever
 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.610
around forever
these have 100% device coverage but some

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620
these have 100% device coverage but some
 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.920
these have 100% device coverage but some
of them are kind of hard to use even I

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930
of them are kind of hard to use even I
 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.420
of them are kind of hard to use even I
struggle to use them correctly and I

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430
struggle to use them correctly and I
 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.050
struggle to use them correctly and I
work on the team so a common use case

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060
work on the team so a common use case
 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.460
work on the team so a common use case
that we've seen is loading in-app

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470
that we've seen is loading in-app
 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.730
that we've seen is loading in-app
content and the idea here is that you

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740
content and the idea here is that you
 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.469
content and the idea here is that you
want to display some content in your

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479
want to display some content in your
 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.779
want to display some content in your
application but you don't necessarily

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:36.789
application but you don't necessarily
 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.120
application but you don't necessarily
want to fetch it over the internet you

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130
want to fetch it over the internet you
 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.529
want to fetch it over the internet you
want to just compile it right into your

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:40.539
want to just compile it right into your
 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.589
want to just compile it right into your
app but you also want to continue to

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599
app but you also want to continue to
 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.390
app but you also want to continue to
build this content with web technology

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400
build this content with web technology
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.110
build this content with web technology
you want to use HTML Javascript CSS and

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120
you want to use HTML Javascript CSS and
 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.010
you want to use HTML Javascript CSS and
what have you has had pretty good

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020
what have you has had pretty good
 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.370
what have you has had pretty good
support for this in fact we almost have

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:53.380
support for this in fact we almost have
 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.290
support for this in fact we almost have
too much support for this we have so

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300
too much support for this we have so
 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.240
too much support for this we have so
many AP eyes that it's hard to figure

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250
many AP eyes that it's hard to figure
 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.969
many AP eyes that it's hard to figure
out which one is actually the right

00:07:59.969 --> 00:07:59.979
out which one is actually the right
 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.550
out which one is actually the right
thing to use and some of them have some

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560
thing to use and some of them have some
 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.830
thing to use and some of them have some
weird gotchas that make them kind of

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840
weird gotchas that make them kind of
 

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.480
weird gotchas that make them kind of
hard to use so I thought maybe we could

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.490
hard to use so I thought maybe we could
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.100
hard to use so I thought maybe we could
take a look at some of these ap eyes and

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.110
take a look at some of these ap eyes and
 

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.570
take a look at some of these ap eyes and
talk about you know what's so tough

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:12.580
talk about you know what's so tough
 

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.459
talk about you know what's so tough
about them and recommend some best

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:14.469
about them and recommend some best
 

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:15.990
about them and recommend some best
practices you don't have to start from

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000
practices you don't have to start from
 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.510
practices you don't have to start from
scratch with a new API but you can kind

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520
scratch with a new API but you can kind
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.450
scratch with a new API but you can kind
of tweak how you're using these so the

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.460
of tweak how you're using these so the
 

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.490
of tweak how you're using these so the
first API we can look at is load data

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.500
first API we can look at is load data
 

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.430
first API we can look at is load data
and the basic idea here is that this is

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440
and the basic idea here is that this is
 

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.040
and the basic idea here is that this is
going to accept some HTML contact it

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.050
going to accept some HTML contact it
 

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.649
going to accept some HTML contact it
accepts it as a string and it's supposed

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:31.659
accepts it as a string and it's supposed
 

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:34.920
accepts it as a string and it's supposed
to display this in the webview but one

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:34.930
to display this in the webview but one
 

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.389
to display this in the webview but one
of the gotchas is it doesn't really

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399
of the gotchas is it doesn't really
 

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:38.790
of the gotchas is it doesn't really
accept HTML content it accepts encoded

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800
accept HTML content it accepts encoded
 

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.050
accept HTML content it accepts encoded
HTML content

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.060
HTML content
 

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.850
HTML content
the idea is you need to escape some

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:41.860
the idea is you need to escape some
 

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.460
the idea is you need to escape some
special characters you replace them with

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.470
special characters you replace them with
 

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.829
special characters you replace them with
a % and you know code following it and

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839
a % and you know code following it and
 

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.689
a % and you know code following it and
we call this percent encoding and this

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:51.699
we call this percent encoding and this
 

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:54.510
we call this percent encoding and this
is the default configuration for the API

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:54.520
is the default configuration for the API
 

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.240
is the default configuration for the API
but there's actually no framework API to

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.250
but there's actually no framework API to
 

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.970
but there's actually no framework API to
do the percent-encoding for you it's

00:08:59.970 --> 00:08:59.980
do the percent-encoding for you it's
 

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.870
do the percent-encoding for you it's
kind of an oversight but the end result

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880
kind of an oversight but the end result
 

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.330
kind of an oversight but the end result
is that developers what we've seen is

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:06.340
is that developers what we've seen is
 

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.830
is that developers what we've seen is
that developers tend to actually do this

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:07.840
that developers tend to actually do this
 

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.640
that developers tend to actually do this
percent encoding by hand themselves and

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:10.650
percent encoding by hand themselves and
 

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.330
percent encoding by hand themselves and
this is manual it leads to bugs and

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:15.340
this is manual it leads to bugs and
 

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.250
this is manual it leads to bugs and
these bugs can have significant impacts

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.260
these bugs can have significant impacts
 

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.650
these bugs can have significant impacts
for your application you know one small

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.660
for your application you know one small
 

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.590
for your application you know one small
bug might seem okay today but it might

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600
bug might seem okay today but it might
 

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.780
bug might seem okay today but it might
break in a future webview update if you

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:24.790
break in a future webview update if you
 

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.230
break in a future webview update if you
forget to encode a particular character

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240
forget to encode a particular character
 

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.330
forget to encode a particular character
the other issue with load data is this

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.340
the other issue with load data is this
 

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.730
the other issue with load data is this
thing called an opaque origin so your

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:32.740
thing called an opaque origin so your
 

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.290
thing called an opaque origin so your
content gets loaded has what we call an

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.300
content gets loaded has what we call an
 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.650
content gets loaded has what we call an
opaque origin and this means that it's

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:37.660
opaque origin and this means that it's
 

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.380
opaque origin and this means that it's
going to fail all same origin checks in

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:40.390
going to fail all same origin checks in
 

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.050
going to fail all same origin checks in
the web and these same origin checks are

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.060
the web and these same origin checks are
 

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.120
the web and these same origin checks are
actually critical to providing powerful

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.130
actually critical to providing powerful
 

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.910
actually critical to providing powerful
web api's securely without these same

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920
web api's securely without these same
 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.960
web api's securely without these same
origin checks you can't use great api's

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:51.970
origin checks you can't use great api's
 

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.880
origin checks you can't use great api's
like xml httprequest so what can we do

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:56.890
like xml httprequest so what can we do
 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.080
like xml httprequest so what can we do
with this API well first off we can

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.090
with this API well first off we can
 

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.550
with this API well first off we can
actually escape some of these encoding

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560
actually escape some of these encoding
 

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.790
actually escape some of these encoding
related problems it turns out this API

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800
related problems it turns out this API
 

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.160
related problems it turns out this API
has always accepted an alternate

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.170
has always accepted an alternate
 

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.490
has always accepted an alternate
encoding scheme called base64 and this

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:11.500
encoding scheme called base64 and this
 

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.470
encoding scheme called base64 and this
actually isn't that special of an

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480
actually isn't that special of an
 

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.300
actually isn't that special of an
encoding scheme is just a different

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.310
encoding scheme is just a different
 

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.180
encoding scheme is just a different
scheme it's not necessarily better but

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.190
scheme it's not necessarily better but
 

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.130
scheme it's not necessarily better but
it's kind of nice because there's

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.140
it's kind of nice because there's
 

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.750
it's kind of nice because there's
actually a framework API which will do

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760
actually a framework API which will do
 

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.550
actually a framework API which will do
the encoding for you and it does it

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560
the encoding for you and it does it
 

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.090
the encoding for you and it does it
correctly great this is basic C for dot

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:27.100
correctly great this is basic C for dot
 

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.950
correctly great this is basic C for dot
encode to string this will take the

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:28.960
encode to string this will take the
 

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.450
encode to string this will take the
content and spit out the right answer

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:30.460
content and spit out the right answer
 

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.360
content and spit out the right answer
and frankly the only reason it's not

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.370
and frankly the only reason it's not
 

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.010
and frankly the only reason it's not
documented is because this came out in

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.020
documented is because this came out in
 

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.340
documented is because this came out in
API level 8 which today is ancient

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
API level 8 which today is ancient
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.250
API level 8 which today is ancient
history but was still in the future at

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.260
history but was still in the future at
 

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.710
history but was still in the future at
the time of writing load data but we can

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720
the time of writing load data but we can
 

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.330
the time of writing load data but we can
also take a look at these same origin

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:48.340
also take a look at these same origin
 

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.030
also take a look at these same origin
restrictions so the way we recommend to

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040
restrictions so the way we recommend to
 

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.650
restrictions so the way we recommend to
get around this is to use something

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:52.660
get around this is to use something
 

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.740
get around this is to use something
called load data with base URL and one

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:55.750
called load data with base URL and one
 

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.870
called load data with base URL and one
of the nice things about this I think of

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880
of the nice things about this I think of
 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.750
of the nice things about this I think of
as a feature not a bug is that it

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760
as a feature not a bug is that it
 

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.180
as a feature not a bug is that it
actually accepts content as is you can

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.190
actually accepts content as is you can
 

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.740
actually accepts content as is you can
actually give it content that's even

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:04.750
actually give it content that's even
 

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.630
actually give it content that's even
totally unencoded you don't even have to

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640
totally unencoded you don't even have to
 

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.400
totally unencoded you don't even have to
worry about the base64 stuff

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.410
worry about the base64 stuff
 

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.060
worry about the base64 stuff
if you use this API the other really

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.070
if you use this API the other really
 

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.950
if you use this API the other really
nice thing about it is that it has this

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:13.960
nice thing about it is that it has this
 

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.410
nice thing about it is that it has this
thing called a base URL and although

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.420
thing called a base URL and although
 

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.170
thing called a base URL and although
you're displaying this HTML content you

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.180
you're displaying this HTML content you
 

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.050
you're displaying this HTML content you
pass in as a string the base URL kind of

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.060
pass in as a string the base URL kind of
 

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.720
pass in as a string the base URL kind of
configures this origin that it operates

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:24.730
configures this origin that it operates
 

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.300
configures this origin that it operates
with so you can control which origin you

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.310
with so you can control which origin you
 

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.030
with so you can control which origin you
get without disabling important security

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040
get without disabling important security
 

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.910
get without disabling important security
settings just to make api's work so how

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920
settings just to make api's work so how
 

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.270
settings just to make api's work so how
do we actually choose the right base URL

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.280
do we actually choose the right base URL
 

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.430
do we actually choose the right base URL
so this is something that even I

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440
so this is something that even I
 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.840
so this is something that even I
struggle with when I try to use this API

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:42.850
struggle with when I try to use this API
 

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.580
struggle with when I try to use this API
I know it's the right thing but I

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:44.590
I know it's the right thing but I
 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.200
I know it's the right thing but I
actually don't know what the right thing

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.210
actually don't know what the right thing
 

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.800
actually don't know what the right thing
is to pass to it so I actually thought

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:49.810
is to pass to it so I actually thought
 

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.510
is to pass to it so I actually thought
how about we go through some of the

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:51.520
how about we go through some of the
 

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.090
how about we go through some of the
common use cases so something that we've

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.100
common use cases so something that we've
 

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.280
common use cases so something that we've
seen is that a lot of apps use cached

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:56.290
seen is that a lot of apps use cached
 

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.500
seen is that a lot of apps use cached
content this is content they may have

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:58.510
content this is content they may have
 

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.390
content this is content they may have
downloaded from the web over the

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:00.400
downloaded from the web over the
 

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.180
downloaded from the web over the
Internet's but they're saving it for

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.190
Internet's but they're saving it for
 

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.060
Internet's but they're saving it for
later and now when they show it then

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.070
later and now when they show it then
 

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.250
later and now when they show it then
need to show with the right base URL and

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.260
need to show with the right base URL and
 

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
need to show with the right base URL and
the right URL D choose is just the

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.270
the right URL D choose is just the
 

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.030
the right URL D choose is just the
original URL that it came from this

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040
original URL that it came from this
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.770
original URL that it came from this
guarantees that you know if it worked

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:13.780
guarantees that you know if it worked
 

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.270
guarantees that you know if it worked
originally it's going to have the same

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.280
originally it's going to have the same
 

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.370
originally it's going to have the same
exact origin and all the api's are going

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:17.380
exact origin and all the api's are going
 

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.130
exact origin and all the api's are going
to continue to work the other use case

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.140
to continue to work the other use case
 

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.980
to continue to work the other use case
that we've noticed is that apps tend to

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:22.990
that we've noticed is that apps tend to
 

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.990
that we've noticed is that apps tend to
ship their own content and display it

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000
ship their own content and display it
 

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.560
ship their own content and display it
this way which is great what we

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:28.570
this way which is great what we
 

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.600
this way which is great what we
recommend is that you choose a real

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:30.610
recommend is that you choose a real
 

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.530
recommend is that you choose a real
internet type URL under these HTTPS or

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:34.540
internet type URL under these HTTPS or
 

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.260
internet type URL under these HTTPS or
HTTP URLs and it should use your

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.270
HTTP URLs and it should use your
 

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.690
HTTP URLs and it should use your
organization's real domain and the

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:39.700
organization's real domain and the
 

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.250
organization's real domain and the
reason for this is that you can import

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.260
reason for this is that you can import
 

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.920
reason for this is that you can import
other resources from your servers and

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:43.930
other resources from your servers and
 

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.420
other resources from your servers and
use them in this content without

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.430
use them in this content without
 

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.310
use them in this content without
worrying about any same origin checks

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320
worrying about any same origin checks
 

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.640
worrying about any same origin checks
it'll all work and then there's the

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.650
it'll all work and then there's the
 

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.610
it'll all work and then there's the
question of what do we use HTTPS or HTTP

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:53.620
question of what do we use HTTPS or HTTP
 

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.280
question of what do we use HTTPS or HTTP
so here's a little rule of thumb and we

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.290
so here's a little rule of thumb and we
 

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.130
so here's a little rule of thumb and we
always want to encourage you to HTTPS is

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.140
always want to encourage you to HTTPS is
 

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.520
always want to encourage you to HTTPS is
the secure protocol but if you do need

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.530
the secure protocol but if you do need
 

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.250
the secure protocol but if you do need
to show insecure sources in secure

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.260
to show insecure sources in secure
 

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.620
to show insecure sources in secure
resources we'd recommend they use the

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:07.630
resources we'd recommend they use the
 

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.350
resources we'd recommend they use the
HTTP scheme as opposed to disabling

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360
HTTP scheme as opposed to disabling
 

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.360
HTTP scheme as opposed to disabling
important security settings just to get

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:12.370
important security settings just to get
 

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.380
important security settings just to get
your app working and as the last point I

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:16.390
your app working and as the last point I
 

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.650
your app working and as the last point I
want to urge apps to avoid custom URL

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:19.660
want to urge apps to avoid custom URL
 

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.300
want to urge apps to avoid custom URL
schemes so this is something that we've

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.310
schemes so this is something that we've
 

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.400
schemes so this is something that we've
noticed is crop

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:22.410
noticed is crop
 

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.510
noticed is crop
apps will kind of make up their own

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:24.520
apps will kind of make up their own
 

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.480
apps will kind of make up their own
scheme and use that but the problem with

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.490
scheme and use that but the problem with
 

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.690
scheme and use that but the problem with
this is that the web standards don't

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:30.700
this is that the web standards don't
 

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.000
this is that the web standards don't
really expect custom URL schemes they're

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.010
really expect custom URL schemes they're
 

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.800
really expect custom URL schemes they're
very vague about how to handle this and

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:34.810
very vague about how to handle this and
 

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.630
very vague about how to handle this and
it turns out that they wind up getting

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:36.640
it turns out that they wind up getting
 

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.430
it turns out that they wind up getting
handled very inconsistent lis and this

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440
handled very inconsistent lis and this
 

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.400
handled very inconsistent lis and this
can lead to surprising app breakage so

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:41.410
can lead to surprising app breakage so
 

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.530
can lead to surprising app breakage so
if you can stick to one of the internet

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:43.540
if you can stick to one of the internet
 

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.420
if you can stick to one of the internet
URL schemes you're gonna have a much

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:45.430
URL schemes you're gonna have a much
 

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:52.560
URL schemes you're gonna have a much
better time so hopefully I've kind of

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.570
better time so hopefully I've kind of
 

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.050
better time so hopefully I've kind of
expressed that we really do care about

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.060
expressed that we really do care about
 

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.150
expressed that we really do care about
developers at the web view team and

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160
developers at the web view team and
 

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.680
developers at the web view team and
we're trying very hard to make sure that

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:58.690
we're trying very hard to make sure that
 

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.019
we're trying very hard to make sure that
you have powerful api's that have the

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:01.029
you have powerful api's that have the
 

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:02.880
you have powerful api's that have the
device covers you need while also paying

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:02.890
device covers you need while also paying
 

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.920
device covers you need while also paying
attention to some of these old api's and

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:04.930
attention to some of these old api's and
 

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.199
attention to some of these old api's and
making sure that we explain how these

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:07.209
making sure that we explain how these
 

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:09.060
making sure that we explain how these
needs to be used making sure that

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.070
needs to be used making sure that
 

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.000
needs to be used making sure that
they're actually usable if you have any

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.010
they're actually usable if you have any
 

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.790
they're actually usable if you have any
questions me and my colleagues will be

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800
questions me and my colleagues will be
 

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800
questions me and my colleagues will be
around for the rest of today as well as

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:16.810
around for the rest of today as well as
 

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.480
around for the rest of today as well as
tomorrow it would be more than happy to

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.490
tomorrow it would be more than happy to
 

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.210
tomorrow it would be more than happy to
talk to you about whether usage and you

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:21.220
talk to you about whether usage and you
 

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.610
talk to you about whether usage and you
know what you need for your application

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620
know what you need for your application
 

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.190
know what you need for your application
thank you very much

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200
thank you very much
 

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:41.269
thank you very much
