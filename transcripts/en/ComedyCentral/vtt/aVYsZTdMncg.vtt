- Ladies and gentlemen,
Hasan Minhaj.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.069 size:88% position:44%
 (audience clapping)

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.003
 - What's up?

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:04.737 size:84% position:42%
  - [Moshe] What's up, man?

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.571
 How you doin'?

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.506
- What's happenin', man?

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.274 size:88% position:44%
  Yo Reza, Mos, you got 'em.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.542
Close the doors!

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.577 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.712 size:88% position:44%
 - Thank you for joining us.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:13.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Are there any
 memories that stir up

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.415
when I say that phrase
being Muslim in America?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.717
- For me, it was September 12th.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
 I remember when it
 happened my dad, basically,

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.289
sat everybody down at the table,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.824 align:start position:0%
  and he was like, all right
  Hasan whatever you do

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.392 align:start size:88% position:13%
  do not tell people
  you're Muslim,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.827 size:88% position:44%
 do not talk about politics.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.328 align:start position:0%
  And I was like, all
  right cool this rubs off.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.863 size:88% position:44%
 (audience laughing)

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.032 size:88% position:44%
 And we're sitting
 there, phone rings,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.867 size:88% position:44%
 Dad runs over to the phone.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.370 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We both grab the phone
 at the same time,

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.838 size:88% position:44%
  and we hear this
  voice on the line,

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.106
and it was like,

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.274 size:88% position:44%
  "Hey camel jockey,
  where's Osama?!"

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.508
 My dad's like, what?

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.544 align:start size:88% position:13%
 He's like, "I'm gonna
 (beeps) kill you!

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
"(beeps) lane, that's
where you live, right?!"

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:47.980
 Click.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.248
 We sit down.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.085 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I hear foomp, foomp,
 foomp, outside.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.720
So, me and Dad, we run outside,

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:57.423
 and all the windows on
 the Camry are smashed.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.759
 Toyota Camry, car of
 choice for immigrants.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.094 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.029 align:start size:88% position:13%
 All the glass is
 shattered everywhere.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.230 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I look in the middle
 of the street,

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
 my dad is sweeping
 glass out of the road

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.435 align:start size:88% position:13%
 like he works at a
 hate crime barbershop.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.803 size:84% position:42%
  He's like, oh man
  we got customers,

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.373
the neighbors'll see we
got a clear this out.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.575 size:88% position:44%
  I'm livid.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.976 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like, man these kids
they're pranking us,

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.411
they know where we live.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.581 align:start position:0%
 My dad's just barefoot,
 super calm, brown Mr. Miyagi.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.350
And I'm like, Dad what's wrong?

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:28.654
 And he goes, "This is the
 price we pay for being here.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.356
 "So, we lucked out."

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.993
 And that's when I realized,
 my dad's from that generation,

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.929 size:88% position:44%
  like a lot of immigrants
  who first come to America,

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.531 align:start size:88% position:13%
where they feel like
you gotta pay this thing

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.466
 like the American Dream tax.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.468 align:start position:0%
  You come here, you're
  gonna endure some racism,

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.469 size:88% position:44%
 and if it doesn't
 cost you your life,

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:44.370
well hey you lucked out.

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:45.872
 Pay that tax.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.740 align:start position:0%
  There are some days where
  I'm like, he's right.

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.842 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Put your head down,
 go be a doctor,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.211 size:88% position:44%
 get a house in the
 burbs, laugh later.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.714 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then I'm like, wait
maybe it's our job,

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
our generation, to
push the needle forward

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.684 size:88% position:44%
  little by little, and make
  it better for all of us.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.586 size:88% position:44%
  So, I say this a lot, man,

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
a lot of times, a lot
of immigrant communities

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.290
 are Republican in the sheets,

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.758
 and Democrat in the streets.

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.260
 - And then, there's a
 lot of Alt-Right guys

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.862 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that are Republicans
 in the sheets,

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.797
 and they live in the sheets,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.732
 and they wear sheets,

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:13.666 size:88% position:44%
 they're in the Ku Klux Klan

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.902 size:88% position:44%
 is I guess what I'm saying.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 Hasan Minhaj.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.940 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)
