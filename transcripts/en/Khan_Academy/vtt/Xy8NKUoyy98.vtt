00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.320
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.020
the product of x minus
four and x plus seven.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.420
And we want to write that product
in standard quadratic form

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.550
which is just a fancy way of saying a form

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.950
where you have some coefficient
on the second degree term,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.610
a x squared plus some coefficient b

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.520
on the first degree term
plus the constant term.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.420
So this right over here would
be standard quadratic form.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.950
So that's the form that we
want to express this product in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.150
and encourage you to pause the video

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.260
and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290
Alright, now let's work through this.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.890
And the key when we're multiplying
two binomials like this,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.820
or actually when you're
multiplying any polynomials,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.420
is just to remember the
distributive property

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.690
that we all by this point know quite well.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.620
So what we could view this is as

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920
is we could distribute this x minus four,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.720
this entire expression
over the x and the seven.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720
So we could say that
this is the same thing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.610
as x minus four times x

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.220
plus x minus four times seven.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.590
So let's write that.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.820
So x minus four times x,
or we could write this

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.820
as x times x minus four.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.650
That's distributing, or multiplying
the x minus four times x

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.850
that's right there.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
Plus seven times x minus four.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890
Times x minus four.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.050
Notice all we did is
distribute the x minus four.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.990
We took this whole thing
and we multiplied it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.820
by each term over here.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.890
We multiplied x by x minus four

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.450
and we multiplied seven by x minus four.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.950
Now, we see that we have these,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.880
I guess you can call
them two seperate terms.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.610
And to simplify each of them,
or to multiply them out,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.490
we just have to distribute.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.790
In this first we're going to
have to distribute this blue x.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.050
And over here we have to
distribute this blue seven.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.620
So let's do that.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
So here we can say x times
x is going to be x squared.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
X times, we have a negative here,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.250
so we can say negative four is
going to be negative four x.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.350
And just like, that we get
x squared minus four x.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.150
And then over here we have seven times x

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.290
so that's going to be plus seven x.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.820
And then we have seven
times the negative four

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.720
which is negative 28.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750
And we are almost done.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.220
We can simplify it a little bit more.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.020
We have two first degree terms here.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.990
If I have negative four xs
and to that I add seven xs,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.390
what is that going to be?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.720
Well those two terms together,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.590
these two terms together are going to be

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.920
negative four plus seven xs.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.920
Negative four plus, plus seven.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.120
Negative four plus seven xs.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.510
So all I'm doing here,
I'm making it very clear

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.220
that I'm adding these two coefficients,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.050
and then we have all of the other terms.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.220
We have the x squared.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.190
X squared plus this and then we have,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.420
and then we have the minus,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.480
and then we have the minus 28.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.990
And we're at the home stretch!

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.020
This would simply to x squared.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650
Now negative four plus seven is three,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.790
so this is going to be plus three x.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.590
That's what these two middle
terms simplify to, to three x.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.620
And then we have minus 28.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.050
Minus 28.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.920
And just like that, we are done!

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.250
And a fun thing to think about,
since it's in the same form.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.400
If we were to compare a is one,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.650
b is three, and c is -28,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.950
but it's interesting here
to look at the pattern

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.590
when we multiplied these two binomials.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.790
Especially these two binomials
where the coefficient

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.650
on the x term was a one.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.020
Notice we have x times x,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.710
that what actually forms the
x squared term over here.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.650
We have negative four, let
me do this in a new color.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.350
We have negative four times,
that's not a new color.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.740
We have,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.420
we have negative four times seven,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.590
which is going to be negative 28.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.480
And then how did we get this middle term?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.020
How did we get this three x?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.220
Well, you had the negative
four x plus the seven x.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.380
Or the negative four
plus the seven times x.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.610
You had the negative four plus the seven,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.690
plus the seven times x.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.390
So I hope you see a little
bit of a pattern here.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.820
If you're multiplying two binomials

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.250
where the coefficients on
the x term are both one.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.950
It's going to be x squared.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.190
And then the last term, the constant term,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.920
is going to be the product
of these two constants.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.720
Negative four and seven.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.520
And then the first degree
term right over here,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
it's coefficient is going to be the sum

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.790
of these two constants,
negative four and seven.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.290
Now this might, you could do

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.950
this pattern if you practice it.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.250
It's just something that will help you

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.985
multiply binomials a little bit faster.

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:39.250
But it's super important that

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.790
you realize where this came from.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.280
This came from nothing more than

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.870
applying the distributive property twice.
