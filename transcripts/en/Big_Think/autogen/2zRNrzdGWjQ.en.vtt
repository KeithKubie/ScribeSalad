00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.810
 in all states in all 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.810
 cantons like ducks 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.119
 hi my name is bill ackman i am the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.040
 CEO of Pershing Square 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.599
 capital management and I'm here to 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.849
 talk to you about everything you need to know 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.380
 about finance and investment I'm going to 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.779
 do in an hour and you're going to be ready 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.460
 to begin with so let's start so that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.260
 you can have a better understanding about 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.539
 finances and some basic terms 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.610
 associated with a business and invest in 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.830
 a business I will use the example of a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.720
 lemonade stand let's start a 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.120
 business together let's open a post 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.769
 of lemonades so the reason why 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.540
 he used the example of the lemonade stand 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.070
 it's because it's a very easy way to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.750
 understand the basic points of 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.969
 business how to understand the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.280
 operating a business as a 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.719
 business generates profits that involves 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.610
 by raising capital to start a 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.890
 company what to do when it is ready 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.140
 to decide to monetize your investment or 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.850
 remove some money from the table and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.129
 to be able to understand each one of these 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.050
 concepts through the very simple lens 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.030
 of a small business as a position of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.430
 Let's start a business 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 together we are going to start a company and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.509
 we are going to start a lemonade stand 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.860
 so today I do not have any money like that 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.460
 that I'm going to have to raise money from 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.040
 investors to throw the black 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.990
 so how am I going to do that good I'm going to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.790
 form a corporation is a small 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.800
 presentation of documents that you make with 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.750
 state and create the name of your business 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.430
 we'll call it the lemonade stand 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 I see and we are going to collect money from 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.360
 external investors we need a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.979
 little money to start so 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.930
 We are going to start our business with a thousand 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.300
 actions we simply invent the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.550
 number and we will sell 500 more shares 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.040
 for one dollar each to an investor 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.259
 now the investor will put 500 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.540
 dollars we will put the name and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.060
 the idea we are going to have a thousand shares he 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.280
 he will have 500 shares he will have a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.320
 third of the business for its $ 500 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.149
 so how much is our business worth 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.700
 good start is worth 1,500 dollars 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.679
 we have 500 dollars in the bank or more 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
 thousand dollars because I came up with the 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.210
 idea of ​​the company now I'm going to 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.160
 need a little over 500 dollars like this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.080
 what am I going to do I am going to borrow 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.870
 some money I'm going to borrow from 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.340
 a friend and he's going to lend me $ 250 and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.470
 we are going to pay you 10 percent of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.750
 interest per year for said loan now 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 because we borrow money instead 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.650
 from simply selling more good shares 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.330
 because when borrowing money 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 we keep more actions 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.320
 to us so that if the business 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.840
 is successful we will end up with a greater 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.610
 percentage of earnings now let's see 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.410
 how the business looks on a piece of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.510
 paper let's see something called the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.250
 balance sheet and a balance sheet 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.080
 says where the company is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.270
 what are your assets what is your 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.490
 liabilities and what is your net worth or 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.980
 accounting capital so we take the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.560
 active in this case we have put together 500 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.180
 dollars in exchange for the 500 dollars the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.160
 person who put the money just got 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.380
 one third of the business the other two 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 thirds is our property to start 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.740
 the company are 1000 dollars for the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.200
 business value of the business 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.290
 we borrow 250 dollars but let's go 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.270
 to duty 250 dollars that's a liability like that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.700
 that we got 500 dollars in cash 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.650
 for sale of shares 250 dollars 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.260
 obtained by a loan and we owe a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.570
 loan of 250 dollars and we have a 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.120
 corporation that you have and you'll see it in 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.280
 the graph an accounting capital of 1500 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.410
 dollars so that's our point of 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.330
 start, let's continue 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.490
 what we need to do to start 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.320
 our good company we need a 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.780
 lemonade stand and that will cost us 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.550
 approximately $ 300 that's called 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.440
 a fixed asset unlike the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.630
 lemons or sugar or water this is 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.670
 something like a building that one buys and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.680
 one builds wears away with time 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.720
 but it is a fixed asset and we need 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.820
 some inventory that we need to 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.490
 to make good lemonade we need sugar 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.680
 water lemons glasses small containers 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.180
 and maybe some napkins and 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.970
 enough supplies for let's say 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.370
 have 50 gallons of lemonade to be able to 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.290
 start our business now 50 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.270
 gallons does not yield for 800 glasses of 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.910
 lemonade and we're ready to start 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.470
 let's see the balance sheet so now 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.080
 we have spent 500 dollars 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.910
 we have 250 dollars left in the bank but 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.830
 our fixed assets are now 300 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.750
 dollars for our lemonade stand 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.150
 our inventory is 200 dollars 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.800
 those are the supplies and things the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.480
 lemons that we need to make the 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.430
 lemonade the commercial value has not 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.010
 changed a thousand dollars so our 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.800
 total assets are $ 1750 and 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.540
 we still owe 250 dollars to the person who 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.130
 he lent us the money the accounting capital 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.380
 It has not changed like that 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.390
 we have not made any money yet everything 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.280
 what we have done is take money and what 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.230
 we have converted into other assets that 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.410
 we are going to need to be successful with 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.760
 our business of lemonade stands 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.710
 now let's make some assumptions about 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.080
 How will the business eventually go? 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 let's assume we can sell each 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.820
 glass for a dollar and it will cost us 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.470
 approximately $ 530 a year on 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.560
 staff to attend our position of 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.290
 lemonades now let's see the state of 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.420
 results the statement of results speaks 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.490
 about profitability over income 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.470
 what the business generates what are the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.570
 expenses and what is left to the owner of the 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.150
 company so we have a position of 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.160
 lemonade we are selling 800 glasses of 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.410
 lemonade in our position charging a 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.360
 dollar so we are generating 800 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.670
 dollars a year in revenue and we're 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.490
 spending 200 dollars on inventory there 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.650
 a concept here called cpp cox that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.510
 means cost of products sold 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.460
 we have depreciation because our 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.320
 Lemonade stand is abused a little 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.450
 over time and it will wear 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.820
 completely in five years so it's 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.650
 depreciates five years we have our 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.639
 labor costs for people who 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.069
 empty the lemonade 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.439
 and collect the money from the clients we have 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.289
 a gain that is the 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.210
 ivette that means profit before 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.909
 of taxes and interest of 10 dollars 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.800
 it's something like our gain before 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.689
 of business taxes so no 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.219
 we made a lot of money since we took the 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.870
 Earnings before taxes of 10 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.999
 dollars and we compare it to our 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.120
 income and its margin of approximately 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.259
 1.3 percent is not a profit 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.479
 particularly high now we have to 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.759
 pay interest on our debts and 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.259
 we have lost 15 dollars and then no 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.490
 we have taxes but in the end 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.490
 we end up losing money 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.570
 we must continue investing in the 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.430
 business we have lost money in the 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.030
 first year it's time to give us 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.370
 expired 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.230
 well let's think a moment let's do 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.840
 some projections on how it will look 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.190
 the company during the next years 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.140
 let's assume that we take all the money that 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.790
 generates the business and we will use it to 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.740
 buy more lemonade stands 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.540
 so that we can grow let's assume that 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.520
 we are not going to take any money from the 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.230
 company we are not going to pay dividends 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.240
 let's keep all the money in the 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.950
 company and we will reinvest it in 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.020
 create our brand we can charge a 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.030
 little more every year so let's go up 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.860
 Our prices approximately five 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.170
 cents more for each glass of lemonade 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.230
 every year and we're going to assume that we're going to 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.710
 sell 5% more glasses of course per year 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.420
 so let's take on growth 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.790
 let's look at the company now 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.980
 when you see the graph you will see that in year 1 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.110
 we started with a lemonade stand and 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.080
 then we add one per year and for the year 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.150
 5 we get to 7 because we have a huge 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.580
 expansion plan our price for 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.310
 glass goes up 5 cents per year and our 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.870
 incomes go from 800 dollars and they begin 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.490
 to grow pretty fast and the 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.870
 growth comes from the increase in 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.780
 prices of lemon cups 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.240
 and it also comes from opening more positions like that 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.340
 that by year 5 we have almost 8000 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.440
 dollars in revenue our costs are 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.760
 relatively constant comprising 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.640
 lemonade and sugar 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.740
 those are roughly $ 702 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.080
 we have depreciation since more and more 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.270
 posts begin to wear out we have 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.580
 labor costs but for the year 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.820
 5 the business is doing quite well 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.100
 we went from a margin of 1.3 percent to 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.570
 a margin of more than 28 percent the 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.550
 business is adjusted to its size 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.920
 We are beginning to cover some of 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.320
 our costs are still growing 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.420
 We are paying 20 to 5 dollars per year 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.310
 in interest for our loan and 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.650
 we have earnings before taxes 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.440
 after interest for 2,300 dollars 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:05.230
 at the end of year 5 so we put 500 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.180
 dollars to the business we borrow 250 

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.760
 and for year 5 we are having a 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.710
 profit of 2 thousand 300 dollars that sounds 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.360
 pretty good now we have to pay 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.610
 taxes to the government this is 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.530
 approximately 35 percent and 

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.750
 we generate as net income or other 

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.180
 word for earnings of 1500 dollars 

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.380
 for the fifth year and approximately one 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.660
 dollar the action 

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.450
 so if you think about it, our friend put 

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.430
 500 dollars to buy 500 shares he 

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.950
 paid a dollar and after five years 

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.960
 be our business elevates as we expect 

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.950
 will be earning one dollar per share in 

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.160
 earnings 

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.530
 that sounds like a very good deal now let's see 

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.690
 the statement of cash flow to 

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.270
 become the most profitable business 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.890
 we generate more and more cash and the 

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.440
 cash accumulates in the company 

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.690
 we spent $ 500 in cash in the 

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.180
 company to more than 2 thousand dollars in 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.800
 effective during the period the balance 

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.710
 initial general had a capital 

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.360
 accounting for $ 490 dollars but at 

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.610
 become more profitable business 

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.220
 the profits summed up money 

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.110
 they added to the assets of the company 

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.000
 our liabilities have not changed and the 

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.700
 business continues to create value with 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.470
 time again at the end of the five 

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.960
 years we have four thousand dollars of 

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.470
 accounting capital and that's almost three 

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.360
 times what we had when we started 

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:25.330
 is this a good business or a bad business 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.280
 how to know if it is good or bad 

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.140
 thing you have to think about is what 

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.740
 type of earnings we are achieving 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.260
 compare 

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.720
 how much money did the company enter this 

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.790
 It is a business that we have evaluated in 1500 

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.770
 dollars when we start someone put 

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.440
 500 dollars for a third of the company 

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.540
 we gave it a value of 1500 dollars but 

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.240
 At the end of year 5 we are earning more 

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.040
 of $ 1500 so that's more than 

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.290
 100 percent yield for the 

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.570
 money that we put to the company that 

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.220
 it's really a high number we spend 

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.200
 two thousand one hundred dollars in capital 

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.930
 building the lemonade stands and 

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.360
 we won two thousand 336 dollars in five 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.550
 years for the capital that we invest that 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.740
 It is more than 100 percent performance 

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.960
 of capital that is a very performance 

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.060
 attractive earnings have grown to 

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.950
 a very fast rate one hundred fifty and 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.960
 five per year this is a true 

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.950
 growing company and our 

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.870
 profitability went from 1.3 percent to 

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.120
 28.6 percent in the fifth year that 

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.280
 it sounds pretty attractive and it is so 

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.220
 let's see the person who gave the loan 

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.440
 that person put 250 dollars and the 

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.740
 business has been profitable we have been able 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.990
 pay your interest of 10% per year 25 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.579
 dollars a year and he's happy because 

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.129
 put 252 

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:41.499
 is receiving a 10% yield 

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:44.589
 for your loan and the business is worth more than 

00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:47.139
 $ 250 we have obtained more than that 

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:49.269
 in cash as a result they are in a 

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:52.389
 safe position but have only won one 

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:54.459
 10% for your money compare now that 

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:56.110
 with the capital investor the 

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:58.360
 person who bought the shares of the 

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.579
 company that person earned a dollar for 

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.860
 action in five years versus one 

00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:05.100
 investment of one dollar per share so 

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.209
 is earning more than 100 percent or 

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.730
 approximately 100 percent of 

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:12.009
 return on your investment versus just 

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.019
 10 percent of who loans so 

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:15.759
 who got a better good deal 

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.709
 obviously the investor in capital 

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:19.929
 because the capital investor 

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:22.089
 because he got the right to earn a lot 

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:24.009
 more than the lender the answer is 

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:26.170
 that I take more risk if the business 

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:28.480
 failed the lender had the right to 

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.489
 the first $ 250 worth of that 

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.319
 leave the company's liquidation 

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:35.379
 so if I sold the positions of 

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:37.660
 lemonade and only got $ 250 the 

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:40.269
 lender recovers all your money and 

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.489
 obtained its 10% yield while the 

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.360
 business worked he got back to 

00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:45.339
 its 200 

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.290
 to dollars but the investor of 

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:49.600
 capital the person who bought the 

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.779
 actions is left with nothing because it comes 

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.029
 after the lender so what is 

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.829
 the difference between debt and capital 

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.779
 debts tend to be an investment more 

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:00.910
 sure since one has a claim 

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:03.070
 greater by the assets of the company and 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.019
 it happens in many different ways has 

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.610
 heard of mortgage debt for a 

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:08.740
 home that is a secured loan 

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.450
 insured for a house but can have 

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.880
 a mortgage debt on a building 

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.950
 of a company there is principal debt there is 

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.990
 lesser debt there is intermediate debt there is 

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.670
 convertible debt but in the end everything is 

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.769
 good debt in different orders of 

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.240
 priority in a company and the rate that 

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:24.370
 Cobra is inverse in relation to its 

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.470
 values ​​to better the value lower the risk 

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.420
 lower will be the interest rate that has 

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.550
 right to receive between minor is the 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.990
 level of the loan the higher the rate of 

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.149
 interest to which you are entitled to receive 

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.980
 but you can avoid complexity in what 

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.779
 The only thing you need to think about is that 

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.700
 debts are first the loan more 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.649
 sure but your chance of profit 

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.540
 is limited now capital too 

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:45.640
 it comes in different forms there is something 

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.890
 called preferred capital or shares 

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.750
 preferred to common capital or shares 

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.080
 common and again the actions and the 

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.300
 coffee 

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.100
 they are basically synonyms there are options 

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.990
 but it's not worth talking about them today 

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.640
 the important thing is that capital gets 

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.620
 everything that remains after paying the 

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.570
 debts so a claim is called 

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.250
 residual now the good thing about the 

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.200
 residual claim is that if the 

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.570
 business grows in value you do not owe 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.580
 more to your lenders but all that 

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.350
 value goes to the shareholders so the 

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.840
 question is why the lender 

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.820
 he was willing to only take 10% 

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.800
 when the capital won a much rate 

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.540
 greater performance and the answer is 

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.520
 that when the business started there was no 

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.530
 way to know if you are going to succeed or not 

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.450
 and the lender made a bet on the 

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.370
 that if the business failed because they could 

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.710
 sell the lemonade stand you know 

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.340
 it cost $ 300 to do it they would have something 

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.470
 of lemons 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.150
 some lemonade even if they sold with 

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.250
 a much lower price than the dollar that 

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.260
 originally projected the lender 

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.910
 he felt quite comfortable that 

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.710
 I would receive your money back while 

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.870
 that the shareholder really was 

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.430
 taking a risk is betting on the 

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.960
 profitability of the company and is 

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.030
 taking a risk that if it fails 

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.350
 you will lose the full investment so 

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.630
 they have the right to obtain a return 

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.370
 greater or have the potential to have a 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.320
 higher yield in the event that the 

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.100
 business was successful so let's talk 

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.080
 about the risk 

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.760
 he knows a lot of people who talk about the 

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.110
 risk in the stock market the 

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.270
 risk of stock prices 

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.890
 going up and down every day we do not believe 

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.780
 that this is the risk that should be 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.640
 focus on the risk in which it should be 

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.530
 focus is on your investment in a 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.630
 business what is the probability that 

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.430
 lose your money is going to be a loss 

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.440
 permanent when you think about a 

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.420
 investment versus another do not worry 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.490
 whether the price goes up or down much to 

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.590
 short term what matters is finally 

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.630
 recover your money you will get a 

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.670
 return on your investment how to think 

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.590
 at risk a way of thinking about 

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.660
 the risk is to compare your risk with 

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.220
 other alternatives so you can buy 

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.960
 government bonds government bonds 

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.700
 government are considered today 

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.370
 lowest investment risk and the 

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.920
 US treasury issues debt to ten 

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.930
 years three years and five years there is a rate 

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.910
 of established interest and today a bonus of 

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.250
 the treasury to ten years gives him to win 

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.560
 approximately a yield of 3% 

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.450
 you give your government a thousand dollars and 

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.610
 you receive $ 30 in interest 

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.710
 earned at the end of the 10 years you 

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.780
 he receives his thousand dollars back so 

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.790
 it is very very safe and that creates a kind 

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.410
 of base obviously if it's going to be a 

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.820
 loan can lend money to 

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.920
 government and win 3 

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.360
 good if you lend the money to a position 

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.730
 lemonade will want something more 

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.250
 significant so in this case the 

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.650
 lender charges a 10% rate of 

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.510
 interest because 10% because he wants to win 

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.670
 something greater than what you can earn 

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.650
 lending the government because a business 

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.450
 at the start of a lemonade stand is 

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.190
 a business with greater risk the 

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.200
 investors in capital think about 

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.360
 things in a similar way so how much 

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.010
 riskier is the highest business 

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.990
 will be the rate of return that the 

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.220
 investor in capital will wait and 

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.960
 the lower the business risk 

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.760
 less will be the performance that the 

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.320
 investor in capital will wait and 

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.060
 investors in capital do not 

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.920
 get interests in the same way 

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.480
 what lenders do what 

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.430
 investors get in capital 

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.530
 is the potential to receive dividends 

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.390
 during the life of a company let's talk 

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.520
 of raising capital when the 

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.560
 lemonade business the point of this 

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.630
 was making money first of all the 

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.490
 business is still doing well for having 

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.470
 started the business create the name and the 

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.630
 concept hire all people 

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.280
 do not earn anything so the business has not 

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.230
 grown in value but where is my 

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.090
 money i need money to buy a 

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.070
 car for example so I want to buy 

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.480
 a car for four thousand dollars which 

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.730
 are my options that I can 

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.740
 well we have taken all the cash that 

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.930
 has generated the business and reinvested it 

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.970
 in business now the good news is 

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.620
 that we have seized all that money we have 

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.360
 could have used it to buy more 

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.370
 lemonade stands and those positions 

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.529
 lemonade are more productive and they make 

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.750
 grow business value faster and 

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:30.820
 faster and my alternatives could 

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.620
 include also instead of growing 

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.570
 the business so fast instead of 

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.190
 invest in more lemonade stands yo 

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.290
 I could have just been paid 

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.269
 dividends to myself now the good 

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.310
 news about this is that I 

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:44.199
 get money along the way 

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.639
 the bad news about that argument 

00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:47.860
 is that the business does not grow as 

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:49.600
 quickly and if you have a business that 

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.399
 it's as profitable as this position 

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.170
 lemonade and we can earn hundreds of 

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:55.420
 dollars with each new post what 

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.279
 It makes sense to continue investing well 

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.600
 how to maintain my business and do it 

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.760
 grow taking advantage of the opportunities 

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.829
 but taking some money from 

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.419
 budget well how do I do it 

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:06.760
 sell my business from lemonade stands 

00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:08.380
 now I started with this new york 'such 

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.209
 there is someone in new yersey who wants 

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.280
 buy me to consolidate my company 

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:13.750
 lemonade stands the problem with that 

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.429
 is that once sold I can no longer 

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.329
 participate in the opportunity to follow 

00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:18.339
 ahead 

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.260
 in this business I think it's going to be very 

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.789
 successful over time therefore it is 

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.279
 an alternative the other alternatives 

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:26.679
 instead of selling 100% of the business 

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:28.600
 is to sell a piece of the business too 

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.549
 can I do it privately can I 

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.649
 find an investor who wants 

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:34.659
 buy an action in the company and if the 

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:36.399
 business worth enough 

00:17:34.659 --> 00:17:38.529
 I can sell you a piece of the business and 

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:40.000
 we can guess the other alternative is 

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:42.580
 that I can turn the business into 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.830
 public an initial peo public offering 

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.260
 the abbreviation means for the offer 

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.970
 initial public and its initial because it is 

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.159
 the first time a company is done 

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.929
 public go public means 

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:54.820
 sell shares to the broad public and 

00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:56.889
 general instead of finding a 

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.139
 investor to buy an action in 

00:17:56.889 --> 00:18:00.880
 the company and it's an offer because it 

00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:02.500
 we are offering the opportunity to the 

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.110
 people to participate what is 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.000
 interesting is that a peo does not make a rich 

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.860
 no one all he really does is 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.630
 take a business they already own and sell 

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.789
 a piece of this to the public and what 

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:14.799
 list in the bag when you decide that 

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:16.299
 You want to return your business to the public 

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:17.919
 have to reveal a lot of 

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:19.480
 information to the public in order to 

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:21.490
 attract investors to 

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.960
 participate the securities and exchange 

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.179
 commission study 

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.039
 very carefully this booklet and they are going to 

00:18:25.179 --> 00:18:28.899
 make sure that they disclose the various 

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:30.549
 risks associated with investing in the 

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:32.049
 company and you will also have the 

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:34.059
 opportunity to talk about the business 

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:36.039
 that can be an exciting time 

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:38.169
 for you because when you sell shares to 

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:40.029
 public in most cases is the 

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:41.890
 way to get the optimal price more 

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:43.870
 high for the company but you do not have to 

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.940
 sell 100% of business to 

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.289
 public in fact you could normally 

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.510
 sell only a small percentage 

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:50.890
 you can keep the rest you can 

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.809
 maintain control of the company 

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.700
 you can raise money from the offer and 

00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:56.740
 you can use that money to buy 

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.390
 the car we were talking about like that 

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.909
 that before you decide to make it public 

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.679
 or even selling it is probably a 

00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:04.240
 good idea to find out how much is your 

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:06.640
 company ok let's talk about the 

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.140
 valuation or how to value a business a 

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.179
 way to determine the value of your 

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.980
 business is to compare it with other companies 

00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:13.539
 similar the stock market is a 

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.640
 very interesting place to do this 

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:17.110
 comparison a stock market is a 

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.700
 list of companies that have sold 

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.350
 actions to the public and can be consulted 

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.120
 in the new york times or the wall street 

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.070
 journal or online in the section 

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.690
 yahoo or google finance or others 

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.880
 sites and find the prices of the 

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.680
 mcdonald's coca-cola actions and what 

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.660
 what the stock prices say 

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.370
 the value of a company and how to find out 

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.260
 the value of the company you have to see 

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.790
 where is the price of the shares and 

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.290
 count how many actions are 

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.150
 outstanding outstanding shares 

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.760
 will be tendered in several documents 

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.470
 submitted to the commission ss 

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.060
 values ​​multiply times 

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.860
 pending actions for the price of 

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.540
 the shares and tells you what the price is 

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.220
 that you are paying for the assets of 

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.510
 the company if we go back to our 

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.550
 example of our small position of 

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.780
 lemonade we have 1500 shares in 

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.730
 circulation that we have sold 

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.770
 initially for a dollar one third of 

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.750
 them to an investor and the company 

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.670
 initially it had a value of 1,500 

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.620
 dollars what is the value of the business today 

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.970
 Well, one way to find out is to look for it 

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.010
 other companies lemonade stands 

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.660
 let's assume that other companies in 

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.700
 lemonade stands have sold in the 

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.100
 public private market for a price of 

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.020
 10 times the profits or 10 times the 

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.730
 profit that will give you a sense of value 

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.530
 let's also assume that other 

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.330
 Lemonade stand companies are 

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.280
 doing business 20 times the 

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:26.380
 income in the stock market well 

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.840
 we won one dollar per share in the fifth 

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.000
 year if we put a multiple of 20 in that 

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.160
 dollar the business has a value of according to 

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.060
 the comparable parameter about 20 dollars 

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160
 per share 

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.890
 we have 1500 shares outstanding 

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.230
 multiply 1500 by 20 now our 

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.390
 business is worth 30 thousand dollars so 

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.280
 we have a company that started with 1500 

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.870
 and that five years later its value is 

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.210
 of 30 thousand dollars what is really 

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:51.130
 very good well as we raise four thousand 

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.810
 dollars if that is the right value for 

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.150
 our business good if we have sold 

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.040
 two hundred of our 200 shares of 

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.170
 our actions that today are 20 dollars 

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.820
 per share we could increase the 4 thousand 

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.620
 dollars that we're talking about that 

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.060
 is what that would do what would happen if we have 

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.950
 sold two hundred of our shares 

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.870
 in the market well our 

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.730
 interests in the business would go down because 

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.860
 today we have sixty-six and two 

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.960
 thirds percent or two thirds of the 

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.970
 One third of the company is owned by 

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.010
 private investors if we have sold 

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.420
 shares in the market if we have sold 

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.890
 two hundred of the actions that 

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.250
 we would have had our property 

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.990
 would go from 67 percent to 53 percent 

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.670
 so the good thing about this is that even 

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.960
 we would have control of the company because 

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.030
 Most public companies 

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.770
 own a majority of the shares you 

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.020
 allows you to control the business in the 

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.430
 future but because the company is now 

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.110
 owned by public shareholders 

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.400
 you have to make sure that your 

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.020
 interests are properly 

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.030
 represented by what you have to 

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.100
 have a board of directors a group 

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.750
 individuals that represent the interest of 

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.640
 the shareholders who have the duty 

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.530
 make sure that its shareholders are 

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.150
 treated correctly and does not have 

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.830
 the same degree of flexibility that 

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.840
 you had when you were a private company 

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.730
 because you have other shareholders in the 

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.760
 what do you need to think but the benefit 

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.890
 of the upv offer for sale is that 

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.480
 the stock now would be liquid there would be a 

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.520
 market that would change in the markets 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.290
 public and then eventually if I 

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.640
 I would like to sell more shares could 

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.380
 do it or if new ones come 

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.060
 investors they could buy 

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.370
 actions and our actions now 

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.780
 they would be more liquid to feel better 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.880
 about my business regarding me 

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.560
 ability to at some point exit or 

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.270
 even raise more money or you could 

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.130
 sell shares pretty easily in 

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.810
 the market because every day I can see the 

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.340
 price on the web or in the 'new york 

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.530
 times' or on other sites and I can 

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.970
 find out what my business is worth well in 

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.380
 what is your business 

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.000
 the purpose of the example of our 

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.740
 Lemonade stand is going to give them 

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.870
 investors an idea about what 

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.610
 companies are the ones that make profits what 

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.050
 that the various reports provide 

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.630
 the investors so that they 

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.670
 determine what each company and the 

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.470
 purpose of this conference is for 

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.000
 tell you some of the things in which 

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.260
 you need to think when it comes to wanting 

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.240
 invest some of your 

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.800
 money if you want to invest in a position 

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.740
 of lemonade or in a company in the 

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.540
 market let's assume that at 22 you already have 

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.460
 a good job instead of spending your 

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.100
 money in artifacts or in an apartment 

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.200
 luxury or one not so luxurious or go out to 

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.460
 drink you decide to save some money and 

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.870
 start investing 

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.970
 let's say you can save 10 thousand 

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.400
 dollars at 22 and that you can earn a 

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.470
 10% of the profitability of that money 

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.900
 between now the time to retire how much 

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.790
 you would have in 43 years the answer is that 

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.410
 If you put aside those 10 thousand dollars, 

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.330
 you save a penny more than you already 

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.280
 you have invested and what you earned from 10 

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:27.310
 percent of that money per year would have 

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.740
 600 thousand dollars at 43 years old and the reason 

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:32.770
 of this is that in year 1 your 10 thousand 

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.770
 dollars would become 11 years your 

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.840
 $ 11,000 could grow by 10% and 

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.640
 that way he would have earned interest not only in 

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.830
 the main and original but it would have 

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.900
 interest accrued on interest 

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.580
 earned the previous year and that effect 

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.440
 allows money to grow from a 

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.230
 almost unstoppable way now obviously 

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.120
 If you win more than 10% you can win even 

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.980
 higher profitability now that's if 

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.530
 you just set aside ten thousand dollars to the 

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.159
 22 you would have saved 600 thousand dollars in 

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.289
 43 

00:23:57.159 --> 00:24:01.509
 years that's pretty good what happens if 

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:03.549
 you had to wait until 32 the 

00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:06.369
 problem is that for the 33 only 

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:08.499
 you would have 232 thousand dollars maybe that's not 

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:10.210
 it's enough to retire, so what 

00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:12.099
 important here is if you want to be 

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.379
 investor one of the most active 

00:24:12.099 --> 00:24:16.809
 valuable we have today at 18 or 19 

00:24:14.379 --> 00:24:18.309
 years of age is youth should you 

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:21.419
 start early so your money 

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:21.419
 can grow over time 

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:29.380
 What would happen if you could win 15%? 

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.230
 to explain the capitalization and how 

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:35.260
 powerful is remember that with 10% to 

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.809
 the 43 years would have 600 thousand dollars that 

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.539
 it's pretty good but if you win 15% 

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:42.429
 you would have more than 4 million now you are 

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:43.870
 in a pretty good position and 

00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:46.330
 obviously smart decisions 

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.620
 about where to put your money makes a 

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.820
 big difference in what your 

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.130
 retirement assets 

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.380
 obviously you can save more than 10 thousand 

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.659
 dollars if you could save 10 thousand each 

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.029
 year your wealth would be absolutely 

00:24:55.659 --> 00:25:00.039
 huge just to have fun let's see 

00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:01.630
 this example if you were one of the 

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:04.000
 largest investors in the world 

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.669
 warren buffett is a good example if 

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.029
 you could earn 20% per year for 43 

00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:11.409
 years you would have 25 million dollars the 

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:14.289
 original investment of 10 thousand dollars 

00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:16.630
 would increase more than 2,500 times during that 

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:18.399
 period only by obtaining a 

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.260
 20 percent return 

00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:22.179
 Albert Einstein said the most force 

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.250
 the powerful in the universe is the interest 

00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:26.950
 The key is to start early 

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.080
 earn an attractive return and not lose 

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.520
 money and you're going to have a very 

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.500
 nice 

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.720
 well now let's talk about the 

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.370
 risk of losing money let's assume that 

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.380
 to try and get a 20 for 

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.360
 hundred percent you've taken many 

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.550
 risks and it turns out that you know it from 

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.170
 Every 12 years, you can lose the 

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.910
 half the money because you had bad 

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.340
 luck in the market or you took 

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:51.550
 unintelligent decisions good your 

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:54.760
 25 million dollars at 20% now only 

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.920
 would be worth one million 8 in 43 years like this 

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.020
 that a key success factor here is not 

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.550
 just invest by investing but not trying 

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.100
 of getting the highest performance 

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:06.190
 avoiding significant losses during 

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.110
 that period is fine as it says 

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.090
 warren buffett the number one rule of 

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.640
 the investment rules is never to lose 

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:15.130
 money and the number two is never to forget 

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.840
 rule number one so if you can 

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.970
 avoid losses and get a return 

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.040
 attractive with time you will have 

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:23.890
 a lot of money if you can stick to this 

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.960
 rule for a long period of time 

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.760
 well as being a successful investor 

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.560
 I'm assuming you're not going to enter 

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.540
 investing business I'm assuming that 

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.340
 are you going to be a doctor, a lawyer, or are you going 

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.170
 to pursue your passion but you're going to 

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.570
 have some money that you will save in the 

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:39.070
 time and I'm going to give you my advice about 

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.110
 subject a council not necessarily 

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.300
 definitive but it is the advice that could 

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.920
 give my sister my grandmother in what 

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.170
 it should be done to be in the same 

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.210
 position I think that probably is 

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.190
 the right way to think number 1 

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:53.110
 how do you avoid losing money what are 

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:55.300
 good business to invest my first 

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:57.220
 advice is despite the story about 

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.140
 the lemonade stand avoid investing in 

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.610
 Lemonade stands avoid investing in 

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.500
 business launched very 

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.540
 recently where the prospects do not 

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.700
 they are very well known because they do not 

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.800
 You need to earn 100% a year to 

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.200
 have a fortune, just invest in 

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.120
 an attractive return on 10 15 percent 

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.740
 for a long period of time and you 

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.170
 money grows very significantly 

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.240
 Then how to avoid investments more 

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.980
 risky, my advice would be to invest in 

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.200
 public securities invest in companies 

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.150
 listed companies that trade in the 

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.560
 stock market because because the 

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.360
 business tend to be better 

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.220
 established have to comply with 

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.880
 certain obstacles before turning 

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.860
 public 

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.750
 the shares are liquid so you can 

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.220
 change your mind if you want to sell if 

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.720
 you invest in a private position of 

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.060
 lemonade it's hard to find someone 

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.650
 to get you out of that investment unless 

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.750
 that the business becomes fabulously 

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.550
 profitable so this is my advice 

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.950
 number one invest in public companies 

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.870
 number two you should invest in business 

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.280
 that you can understand what I mean 

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.260
 with this is that there are a lot of 

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.750
 companies with which you have treatment in the 

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.190
 course of your day and of your personal life already 

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.290
 whether it is warehouses that 

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.390
 you know because you like to buy there or 

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.220
 that is a product the ipad that already 

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.110
 do you know and what do you think is a great 

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.940
 product you have to understand how the 

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.040
 company makes money if the company is 

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.960
 too complicated and you do not understand how 

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.300
 they make money they have even had a 

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.310
 great trajectory better avoid it a lot 

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.230
 people thought that enron was a company 

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.120
 incredible because he seemed to have a good 

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.040
 history but very few people are 

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.350
 they understood how I earned money is a 

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.180
 good idea to avoid those other companies 

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.340
 very important criterion is that you should 

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.140
 investing at a reasonable price could 

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.940
 be a fabulous business that has had 

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.550
 success for a long period of time 

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.770
 but if you pay too much for him you're not going to 

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.420
 earn a very good return and return 

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.280
 and the last advice is that you should 

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.130
 in a business that could theoretically 

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.260
 be yours forever if the market of 

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.510
 values ​​will close its doors by close to 

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.370
 10 years would not be a catastrophe that 

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.410
 I mean with this if you're going to combine 

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.390
 your money based on a 10 or 15 for 

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:55.090
 percent return during a period 

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:57.130
 43 years old you really want a business 

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.930
 that you can be an owner forever 

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.940
 I would like to constantly have to spend 

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.770
 from one business to the next and which are 

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.870
 the business that you can own for 

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.030
 always good there are very few who can 

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:09.490
 meet that standard a good example is 

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.350
 cocacola the good thing about cocacola is that 

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.600
 it's a relatively easy business to 

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.490
 understand you understand how cocacola does 

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.830
 money correctly sells a 

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.720
 syrup formula to bottlers and 

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.430
 business establishments and earn a 

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.620
 benefit every time you serve a 

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.390
 cocacola people have drunk a lot of coca 

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.590
 colá for a very long period the 

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.930
 population of the world is growing 

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:31.120
 sold in almost all countries of the 

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.220
 world and every year people drink more 

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.990
 cocacola and it's a very easy business to 

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.730
 understand and also a business that is 

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.800
 unlikely to have a competition 

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.780
 to take it out of the market as a result 

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.550
 of technology or someone else's 

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.260
 new product has been with us 

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.150
 for a long time people 

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.920
 parents have become accustomed to the taste 

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.900
 they give it to their children and you can wait 

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.820
 that the brand is maintained I think it's a 

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.740
 good example another good example could 

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.510
 being mcdonald's you can not love the 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.640
 mcdonald's burgers but it's a 

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.100
 business that has existed for 50 years 

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.440
 and you understand how they make money they make those 

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.390
 small boxes rent to the franchisees 

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.370
 they charge royalties in exchange for the name 

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.710
 from who sells the hamburgers and 

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.540
 french fries and you know that people have 

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.130
 that eating your food is a cost 

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.960
 Relatively low quality is 

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.880
 pretty good and they keep growing every 

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.710
 year I think the coherent message here 

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.180
 is to try to find a business that 

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.190
 can you understand that it is not 

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.440
 particularly complicated that you have a 

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.120
 successful long-term history that wins 

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.800
 an attractive benefit and you can 

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.540
 grow over time what are the 

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.460
 key things you should look for in a 

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.410
 business as I say it will last forever 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.060
 we create a company that sells a 

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.430
 product or service that people 

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.290
 need it to be something unique and that it 

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.210
 have loyalty to this product or brand 

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.430
 in particular and that people are 

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.380
 willing to pay a premium for them and 

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.940
 another good example could be a business 

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.770
 of sweets while people are 

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.300
 willing to buy generic versions 

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.630
 of many types of products 

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.090
 food 

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.980
 sugar flour do not need to buy the 

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.930
 Brand product when it comes to 

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.030
 candy people do not have to buy 

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.220
 the version of wallmart or of kmart 

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.530
 they want the chocolate bar jersey or 

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.390
 the cadbury chocolate bar want 

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.820
 to the brand and are willing to pay 

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:09.800
 a higher sum to get it and that 

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.080
 is in my opinion the key you want the 

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.000
 product is unique you do not want it to be a 

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.410
 merchandise that everyone can sell 

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.300
 because when selling a merchandise 

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:19.160
 anyone can sell it and can 

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.110
 sell it at a better price and it's very 

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.000
 hard to make a profit like this if you're 

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:25.250
 investing long-term you want 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.990
 invest in companies that have very little 

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.790
 debt in one of our examples 

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.580
 previous we talked about our position of 

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.620
 lemonade and there are 250 dollars of debt that 

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.270
 they do not put too much pressure on the post 

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.070
 of lemonade from the company but if 

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.230
 it would have been a thousand dollars and we would have 

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.330
 had bad streaks the business could 

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.770
 have broken for lack of payment the 

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.820
 shareholders could have been 

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.380
 annihilated 

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.090
 so if you can find a company 

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.430
 that can make attractive profits 

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.050
 that does not have a lot of debt and that generates 

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.300
 many more benefits than those 

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:55.280
 they need to pay the interest of your 

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.290
 debt then you found a place 

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.390
 sure to invest your money 

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.860
 a long period you want the companies 

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.870
 have what are called barriers of 

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.370
 entrance you want a business wherever 

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.620
 difficult for someone tomorrow 

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.900
 put a new company to compete 

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.790
 with yours and throw yourself out going back 

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.560
 to the example of coca-cola coca-cola has 

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.270
 such a strong presence in the market 

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.370
 people already know that when they go to 

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:18.470
 a restaurant they order a cocacola and they 

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.990
 they give a coke it is very difficult to 

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.940
 someone else enter this clear circle 

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.920
 that of course there are pepsi and other 

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.990
 soda brands but the pepsi have 

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.790
 been circulating for a long time and the 

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.920
 Coca cola and the pepsi have continued 

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.930
 existing side by side during long 

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.000
 years so when you're thinking about 

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.830
 choose a company make sure you get 

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.990
 sell a product or service that is 

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.180
 difficult for someone to do better than 

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.160
 yours and that no one can think of 

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.110
 want to change you for another product in the 

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.030
 future you also want the companies 

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.470
 are not particularly sensitive to 

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.140
 factors from outside called factors 

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.640
 extrinsic that you can not control well 

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.800
 that if a business were affected 

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.840
 dramatically if the price of a 

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.060
 particular merchandise or if the rates of 

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.680
 interest go up and down constantly or 

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.630
 If there was any change in the prices of 

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.890
 the currency you want a company that is 

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.870
 pretty immune to what 

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.820
 is happening in the world and we are going to use 

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.530
 the example of cocacola is to say if you 

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.270
 you put to think about the cocacola is a 

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.940
 product that has probably existed 

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.830
 120 years during that time there have been 

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.900
 several world wars the development 

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:20.150
 of nuclear weapons all kinds of events 

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.130
 unfortunate and tragedies and so 

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.260
 successively but every year the company 

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:26.120
 knead more fortune earns much more 

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.070
 money from what they earned before and they go to 

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.020
 continue to exist you can be sure 

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.120
 based on the story that this is a 

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.190
 business that will continue to stand almost without 

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.860
 matter if the interest rates are of 

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:39.050
 14% if the dollar is on the ground and the 

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.210
 gold price is going up or towards 

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.100
 down those are the types of company in 

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.440
 those who want to invest in the long term 

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.700
 companies that are extremely immune 

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.280
 to the events that are 

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.990
 happening in the world another criterion if 

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.030
 they think about our company's positions 

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.130
 lemonade as we grew we had 

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:57.050
 than to buy more and more posts now 

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.510
 these lemonade stands only cost 

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.490
 300 dollars each but imagine a 

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.080
 business where every time he grew up if 

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.720
 you had to build a new factory 

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.460
 that produce more and more products and those 

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.290
 Factories are real faces because if 

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.700
 well that company could generate a lot 

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.010
 business money for 

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.290
 to be able to grow, we would have to reinvest each 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.000
 more money in the business, the better 

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.190
 companies are those that do not require 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.200
 a lot of reinvestment of capital that generates 

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.419
 a lot of money that can be used to 

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.859
 pay dividends to shareholders or 

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:26.540
 where you can invest in new 

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:28.820
 attractive high performance projects 

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.649
 I think the last thing I would say is that 

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.839
 they must invest in public companies 

00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:34.940
 It's probably safer to invest in 

00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:36.950
 companies that are not controlled a 

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.379
 Controlled society looks like our 

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:40.730
 business with lemonade stands 

00:34:38.379 --> 00:34:42.740
 Become a public company 

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.820
 problem with controlled companies is 

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.520
 that except that the majority shareholder 

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.929
 be someone of full confidence and except 

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.750
 that there is someone with excellent 

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.740
 background of handling the so-called 

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.179
 minority investors the 

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.429
 shareholders who do not exercise control 

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.500
 investing in such a company can be a 

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:59.570
 risky idea because you are at the mercy 

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.130
 of the majority shareholder and for more than 

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.990
 the majority shareholder is someone 

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.640
 with whom you feel comfortable there is no 

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.859
 no assurance that said person 

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.900
 do not sell your controlled shares to another 

00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:10.640
 person who will not be so supportive with 

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.470
 the shareholders of the company then 

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.180
 it's not that you can have a business 

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.160
 profitable a company that has 

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.270
 gone well but you must make sure that 

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.430
 the address and the 

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.680
 who controls the company think of you 

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.790
 as in an owner and they can protect 

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.830
 Your interests 

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.380
 these are some of the criteria in 

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:30.049
 what to think 

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.240
 good when you're ready to 

00:35:30.049 --> 00:35:33.940
 start investing money I would start from 

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.750
 the same premise that you are a student 

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.210
 you probably have loans 

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:40.250
 educational maybe you'll even have some 

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.289
 Debt on your credit card passes 

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.720
 graduate you're going to get a job 

00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:46.849
 then if you do not want to start from now 

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.920
 while you already have enough debt 

00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:51.410
 pending begins to invest in the 

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.089
 stock market the stock market is 

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.069
 the ideal place to invest when 

00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:57.140
 you have money that you can save and that 

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:59.869
 you will not need for five or maybe ten 

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.579
 years then if you're paying rates of 

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:03.680
 relatively high interest in your 

00:36:01.579 --> 00:36:05.630
 credit card you will surely want 

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.339
 pay the credit cards before 

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:09.069
 think about investing in the stock market 

00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:11.240
 values ​​your educational credits 

00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:13.099
 probably have a lower cost to 

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.380
 your credit cards but on the other 

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:17.630
 side in this case my advice would be that 

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.240
 If your educational credits have a 

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:22.369
 rate of 6 or 7 percent if the liquid 

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.710
 you will surely earn a performance of 6 

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:26.210
 or 7 percent and it would be better that you can 

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.920
 get rid of the debts of the 

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.779
 credit card and loan 

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.819
 education before consigning a 

00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:34.430
 significant amount of money to the market 

00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:36.530
 stock market even after you settle your 

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.750
 of the credit card assuming that 

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.670
 have liquidated your educational loan is 

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.920
 necessary to have enough money in the 

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:45.020
 bank so that in the case of staying 

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.720
 without work you have money saved for 

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.490
 6 or up to 12 months let's talk a little bit about 

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.230
 the psychology of the investment then 

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.450
 we already know some of the factors 

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.170
 technicians how to think about how much it is worth 

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.760
 deal 

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.619
 let's say you want to buy a business to 

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.940
 a reasonable price you want to buy a 

00:36:57.619 --> 00:37:01.280
 business that will continue to exist 

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.410
 whenever you have access barriers 

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.540
 to make it difficult for others to compete 

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.190
 with you but all these details are 

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.020
 important and many investors 

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.430
 follow its principles 

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.950
 the problem is to put them into practice 

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.079
 the world panics and the market 

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:17.000
 stock market is going down every day and 

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:18.980
 investors see how the 

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.869
 value of their retirement contributions or 

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.640
 your investment account then the 

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:25.190
 natural tendency is to do the opposite 

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.050
 what it would make sense to do to be 

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:29.059
 a successful investor you have to be able 

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.559
 avoid some normal tendencies of 

00:37:29.059 --> 00:37:33.020
 human beings like letting you carry 

00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:35.210
 for the others the stock market follows 

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.069
 lowering daily your natural impulse is 

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.930
 to sell when the market goes up all 

00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:40.849
 the days you will be predisposed to 

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.360
 buy then when it comes to 

00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:43.430
 bubble 

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.470
 you would probably be a seller but in 

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.360
 crisis you would become a buyer 

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.090
 you have to have this kind of discipline 

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.670
 you have to be able to withstand the volatility 

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.650
 of the stock market the key to being able to 

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.960
 support market volatility 

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.790
 stock market is to have confidence there 

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.380
 feel confident that you have enough 

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.270
 money in the bank like to not 

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.880
 need what you have invested during 

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:06.740
 many years that is an essential factor in 

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.110
 second place you have to recognize that a 

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.180
 short term the stock market is what 

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.010
 what we call a voting machine in 

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.750
 the short term really represents the 

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.220
 whims of the people there are many things 

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:18.440
 affecting the prices of the shares 

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.940
 in the world things happen that really do not 

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.920
 have nothing to do with the value of 

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.570
 certain companies in which you invest 

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.070
 you have to accept the fact that the 

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:27.080
 value of what you acquire can 

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.760
 decrease considerably after 

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.800
 buy it but that does not mean that 

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.180
 you have made an investment mistake is 

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.310
 only the volatile nature of 

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.020
 stock market how to feel comfortable 

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.640
 with this you do not buy a package of 

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.290
 actions simply because you like the 

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.390
 name of the company you make your own 

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.400
 research reaches a good level of 

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:45.590
 business understanding you make sure that 

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.910
 it's a business that you understand, you make sure 

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.869
 that the price you are paying is 

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.369
 reasonable 

00:38:47.869 --> 00:38:51.819
 compared to the profits of the 

00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.819
 company 

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.170
 let's say this is not for you I do not want 

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.720
 invest I do not want to buy shares 

00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.730
 Individuals seems too risky 

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.200
 I do not have the time to do my own 

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:04.150
 research what are the 

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.310
 Alternatives that are good for you 

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.390
 alternatives with stan in outsource 

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.100
 your investments 

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.140
 make them through third parties you can 

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.610
 hire an investment manager or 

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.530
 You can hire a group of 

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.910
 financial administrators there are several 

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.610
 alternatives for an investor 

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.230
 beginner the most common alternative 

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.940
 they are investment fund companies 

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.430
 which are mutual investment funds 

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.230
 we could say that from the point of 

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:28.630
 technical view are like a corporation 

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:30.730
 but where you buy shares in said 

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.800
 corporation and the manager selects a 

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.960
 portfolio of shares then what is 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.400
 does it is to raise capital money from a 

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.930
 large group of investors 

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.030
 let's say they put together a billion 

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.010
 dollars take the money and invest it 

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.620
 in a diversified range of values 

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.960
 now the benefit of this approach is 

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.030
 that with a small amount of money still 

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.920
 with less than a thousand dollars you can buy 

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.080
 a participation in a portfolio 

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.060
 diversified managed by a manager 

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.490
 professional who receives compensation 

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.599
 for doing a good job for you at 

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.759
 invest in the market 

00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:02.229
 so mutual investment funds 

00:40:00.759 --> 00:40:04.869
 they are good candidates for an investment 

00:40:02.229 --> 00:40:07.660
 the problem is that there must be about 7000 

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:09.640
 8,000 or perhaps 10,000 different funds and 

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.779
 some are fantastic while 

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.640
 others are not very good 

00:40:10.779 --> 00:40:14.950
 you must find a good administrator 

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.299
 Mutual investment funds as well as you should 

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.519
 do it to find actions 

00:40:16.299 --> 00:40:20.489
 individual then it's not that simple 

00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:23.229
 invest in mutual investment funds 

00:40:20.489 --> 00:40:25.089
 There are some key success factors in 

00:40:23.229 --> 00:40:26.829
 what you should look for to identify 

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:28.359
 a mutual investment fund or a 

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:28.690
 financial administrator of the type that 

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.640
 be 

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.529
 first of all you need someone who 

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.630
 have an investment strategy that 

00:40:32.529 --> 00:40:36.910
 make sense to you you must understand what 

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:38.380
 what they do and how do they know that 

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.479
 they are taking advantage of your insecurity 

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.369
 using complicated words and 

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:44.019
 expressions that you do not understand if you do not 

00:40:42.369 --> 00:40:45.759
 can explain in two minutes what 

00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:47.589
 they do and how they do it and why it has 

00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:50.140
 meaning then that is a strategy 

00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:52.390
 where you should not invest in 

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.460
 second place and the order is not accurate 

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.499
 this should probably be the first 

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.900
 criteria you need someone with a 

00:40:56.499 --> 00:41:00.130
 good reputation for your integrity if 

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.720
 just start 

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.729
 You probably want to invest in a 

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.380
 Mutual investment fund sponsored by 

00:41:03.729 --> 00:41:07.510
 some of the largest groups 

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.460
 mutualists instead of a small fund 

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.560
 mutual investment supported by a 

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.330
 mutual funds company of which 

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.220
 you've never heard there are some 

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.260
 benefits when investing in institutions 

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.670
 bigger you can have more confidence 

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.650
 that they're not going to steal your money 

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.330
 you need an approach where the 

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.310
 investor invest your money in 

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.500
 value function I know this sounds 

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.840
 pretty obvious but the investment in the 

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.580
 value has a very long trajectory and 

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.440
 then there are other types of investments 

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.510
 including technical investments 

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.550
 where people bet on stocks 

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:38.500
 according to the price dynamics but I 

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.720
 I recommend not getting close to that kind of 

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.220
 boarding then you need someone 

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.350
 that invest in the sense of buying 

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:46.690
 companies believing that the prospects to 

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:48.730
 future of said business are good and that 

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.620
 the price paid compared to the value 

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:53.080
 of the business represents a discount 

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.700
 important you need to invest together with 

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.500
 a person who has a track record 

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.570
 long I would say that five years of 

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.640
 experience is the absolute minimum of 

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.380
 ideal way would be someone with ten fifteen 

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.210
 twenty years of experience doing 

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.620
 investments in the markets because there 

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.540
 much that can be learned by being 

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.610
 long-term investor in the 

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.530
 market you need someone who has a 

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.580
 consistent approach and that there is not 

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.890
 changed means 

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.030
 what you do every year you have to 

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.590
 see if you have a strategy 

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.690
 formulated that has respected 

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.640
 constantly and that it has helped 

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.590
 get attractive profits during your 

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.450
 investor activity it seems to me that of 

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:27.520
 somehow the most important thing always 

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.740
 is that you get someone to invest 

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.160
 most of your own money together 

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.050
 to yours 

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.510
 you are going to want to have someone whose 

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:36.790
 interests correspond to yours if you 

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.380
 it's about a mutual investment fund you're going 

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:40.660
 to want them to have a lot of money in their 

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.670
 own mutual fund if it is about 

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.380
 a speculative fund that is a fund of 

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.720
 private sale for investors who have 

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.820
 Higher net assets you will want 

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.330
 also administrators that invest 

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.330
 with you 

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:59.570
 we started with a small business 

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.580
 of lemonade stands the goal of 

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:04.970
 that example was to offer a basic idea 

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.980
 of how to think of a business that is to say of 

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.470
 where the profits come that are the 

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.600
 income what are the expenses what is a 

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:14.270
 financial balance what is the statement 

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.580
 of income how to think about how much is worth 

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.560
 a business how to think about the difference 

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.480
 between a good business and a bad business 

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.700
 how debt is generated at a risk 

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.980
 minor and also to a lower performance 

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.140
 as investors in shares buy 

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.570
 the shares or the property on a 

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:32.150
 company how can you earn more or lose 

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:34.010
 more we use these details as a basis for 

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.650
 give us an idea of ​​the vocabulary that 

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:38.120
 employs in the world of investments and 

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.640
 we talk about investments in the 

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.650
 stock market we talk about ways 

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.720
 to think about how to select investments 

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:46.700
 how to face some of the problems 

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.770
 psychological investments we have 

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:52.150
 travel pretty terrain in a period 

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.150
 of fairly short time 

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.810
 the title that I have chosen for this 

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:00.150
 talk is all you need to know about 

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.130
 finance and investments in less 

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:04.110
 of a good hour that's not really 

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.790
 all you need to know is just one 

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.950
 introduction and I hope not to have you 

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.810
 cheated by convincing you to look at this 

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:11.910
 for an hour but there are actually 

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:13.560
 much more to learn and there are some books 

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.750
 wonderful that can teach you 

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.970
 quite about the subject but I think that 

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.710
 the most interesting thing about the investments already 

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.720
 whether they choose this as a career 

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:23.940
 full time or not is that if they want 

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.980
 succeed in this race must win 

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.990
 money and how to invest that 

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.030
 money will make a big difference in the 

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.770
 quality of life they have and maybe the 

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.420
 quality of life of their children or in the 

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.460
 house they can buy or in the 

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.140
 retirement that they can enjoy we have 

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.900
 talked about the difference between a 

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.290
 10% yield and a yield of 

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:45.090
 15 or 20% over a very long life and 

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.190
 what impact does this have on the 

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.200
 fortune that can be accumulated in the 

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.330
 respective period then the 

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.610
 investments are important we like or 

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.590
 no and learn more about this will have 

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:58.200
 a strong impact on their quality of life 

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:01.730
 if money is something they need to 

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.730
 meet some of your goals 

00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:06.690
 it started to interest me when I had 

00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:08.729
 22 or 23 years ago I started to be interested 

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.039
 investor and I read a book that 

00:45:08.729 --> 00:45:13.079
 called the smart investor was 

00:45:11.039 --> 00:45:15.539
 written by ben graham who is a 

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:17.910
 famous investor in values ​​is like reading 

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:20.910
 the essays on the existentialism of 

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:22.920
 jean-paul sartre you read them and they seem 

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:25.200
 a whole revelation and affect your life 

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.660
 directly or you're not interested in anything 

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.519
 this book is the same thing but about the 

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.559
 investments I found a book 

00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:33.690
 fascinating what I liked about the 

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:36.150
 investments was that it's about something 

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:39.509
 accessible even for someone of 22 or 23 

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:41.400
 years and what captivated my interest was that 

00:45:39.509 --> 00:45:44.430
 It is one of the few jobs where each 

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.229
 day you can study something new you're 

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:48.779
 constantly learning about new 

00:45:46.229 --> 00:45:50.989
 business new situations new 

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:54.239
 management teams new topics 

00:45:50.989 --> 00:45:56.130
 so it's an infinite challenge and the 

00:45:54.239 --> 00:45:59.130
 world and the stock market are 

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:01.650
 obviously very dynamic places like that 

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:03.930
 that the challenges continue the same 

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:06.869
 concepts that are very useful at the time 

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.880
 of deciding how to invest your portfolio are 

00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:11.910
 also useful to contemplate 

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.070
 such as buying a house or 

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.800
 make decisions at work or decide 

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.570
 if you have to hire more people these 

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.750
 types of conjectures and mental processes 

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:23.190
 they are useful and serve in life and 

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.530
 I recommend learning more 

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.740
 thank you for paying attention and I wish you 

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.740
 the best
