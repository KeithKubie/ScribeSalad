00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Welcome everyone.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.859
It's a pleasure to see you both here in Mountain
View as well as VC.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.179
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.580
I have the immense pleasure of welcoming Dr.
Dario Nardi to come speak with us today.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Welcome.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.580
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Thank you.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.109
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I wanted to give a little
bit of background on Dario and then we will

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.300
have an hour and 20 minutes with him.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.730
So, we are truly, truly grateful for his expertise
today.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.540
I invited Dario to come speak with us because
he is truly an expert in the field of personality

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.880
type.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.160
This area is of greater and greater interest
to us here at Google as we start to use some

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.480
of the tools that are associated with understanding
personality type.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.660
And because, as a culture, we really value
the ability to communicate and work effectively

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.390
with people of all different types and approaches
and preferences, and equally in the products

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.960
that we design.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.430
We really strive to design things that are
highly usable and relevant for our users.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.750
And so, the awareness of personality types,
the awareness of preferences and how people

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.970
tend interact, behave with one another, make
decisions, can only add it to both our effectiveness

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.940
individually with those that we work, but
certainly with the products that we create

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.930
for the world.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.240
Dario is really taking the research into personality
type to the next level with his neuroscience

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.960
research that he's been doing at his lab in
UCLA, working with his students to really

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.660
understand and really see what are the patterns
of brain activity that occur and how do those

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.550
connect with people's personality types when
they have truly identified for themselves

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.930
what they know to be their best fit type.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.950
And when we talk about type, we're referring
primarily to the MBTI instrument,the Myers-Briggs

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.900
Type Indicator, which many of you may have
come across in your careers, either before

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
or at Google, or perhaps even earlier than
that in college.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.850
So, there will be some clear references to
type as identified by the MBTI.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.820
A little bit of background on Dario.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.630
As I mentioned, he works at UCLA.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.310
He's a Professor of Human Complex Systems
there.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.480
Several Googlers have been through his program,
which is exciting.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.080
He is also the author, or co-author, of ten
books on personality type.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.950
In fact, his latest is called "The Neuroscience
of Personality."

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.220
And it is hot off the presses and I highly
recommend it.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.450
He has some books here for sale, here in Mountain
View, for any of you folks that are interested.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.680
You can buy those from Yosha here in the back
at any point.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640
They're 24 dollars plus two dollars tax.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.380
Dario is also the owner and publisher of Radiance
House, which is a publishing company for authors

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.630
of system, games, and personality.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.280
So check that out whenever you get a chance.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.580
Today, based on his groundbreaking research,
Dario is really gonna clue us in on what are

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.210
those patterns of personality type, or brain
activity, that correlate with personality

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.210
type.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.069
And what does that mean for us, personally,
in terms of how we tend to interact.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.870
And also, how we can flex our style to meet
others more clearly where they are.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.150
So, without further ado.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.819
Oh, actually let me say one more thing.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.370
As the structure of this presentation will
be such that it'll be an hour of Dario presenting

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.800
to us and then we'll have 20 minutes from
10 AM here in Mountain View to 10:20 for questions.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.520
So, you're welcome to ask those here in Mountain
View and as well on VC.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.790
We have someone taking questions via chat.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.200
You can ping your questions to Nedi Sharma,
and that's nsharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.200
So, feel free to do that and Nedi will represent
your questions here in the room.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.540
That's it.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.880
Welcome, Dario.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.220
&gt;&gt;Dario: Fantastic.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.560
Thank you.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560
[applause]

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.920
Thank you everyone for coming this morning.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:14.390
And it's my pleasure to share with you what
is the culmination of five years of lab research,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.600
first hand, looking at brain activity.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.739
Primarily of college students.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.240
So, you know what that age range is, right?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.559
But it's 18 to 25 actually, so that may include
some of you.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:32.099
And you're generally spending two to three
hours with each student.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:41.379
So, across a whole bunch of different activities
, among those activities are going to be whatever

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.379
is their big interest or expertise.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.310
So in other words, allowing them, if they're
actually a drummer, they'd come in and play

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.720
with their drums and to see what happens with
that, in addition to the usual things.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.150
And what's come out of that, primarily, everyone
is different.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.880
I mean, truly that comes out.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.370
There's this individual difference that's
there.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.939
And the other thing that has come out of it,
there really are these patterns that are consistent

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:11.939
for an individual and those patterns correlate
very well with the student's best fit personality

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:12.939
type selection.

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:18.349
Keeping in mind that personality type is,
itself a model that we have in our minds in

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.860
order to help us simplify the people we encounter
and how we work and so on.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:32.419
It's really interesting to see that yes, there
actually is something to it and has some grounding

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.419
with it.

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.419
And here we go.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.419
OK.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.229
What I hope you're gonna get out of today
is some idea of the research.

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.680
Now, I usually do a whole-day workshop on
this.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680
In fact, folks have been pushing for me to
do two days because there really is a tremendous

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.000
amount, not just of information, but of applications
that come out of it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.729
But it'll give you a little bit of an idea,
an hour of what's fun.

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.729
And, oh my voice is changing as I talk.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:57.729
[laughter]

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:58.729
Perhaps there's, OK.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.520
I know I won't talk too loud otherwise there's
reverb in it.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.069
Numerous implications for how you and other
operate.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.470
Maybe give you a little bit of an idea of
what that is.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.539
And then I'm gonna focus on different ways
that we can enter the state of creative flow.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.969
And this is a state that might last anywhere
from just a few seconds to ten minutes, or

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.229
even longer.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.099
And what are those kinds of things, activities,
that lead us into this state.

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.419
This is my lab.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.840
It's actually pretty informal.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.500
It's not some fancy dark space somewhere with
lots of equipment.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.300
There's no Frankenstein here.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.669
And in fact, what you don't see is there's
a beautiful set of windows like you all have

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.819
in the building next door in the cafeteria.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.020
So, students can look out and they see like
the squirrels and the trees.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.410
And it turns out that's actually very important.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.009
So for the students who identify with one
of the SP personality types--so they have

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.999
S and P in their code--they actually show
more brain activity when they're looking out

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.789
the window than they are doing the tasks that
I give in front of them.

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.309
And if they're standing and looking out the
window, then that's even more so.

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.850
So, that reminds us how important windows
are to some people, looking out at nature

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.909
and the patterns that are there.

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:16.110
Otherwise, students wear this little red cap
right here.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.419
And we, they put on the cap and it has these
little pickups.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.569
It doesn't shock them or anything like that.

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.039
It's a purely passive device.

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:31.219
And then, we take a nice little syringe, but
I show them the syringe is blunt, and inject

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:33.531
water soluble gel throughout all of that.

00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:38.059
And the gel helps maintain a connection between
the pickups and the skull, so that even as

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:42.930
they move around, it's going to be picking
up the electromagnetic activity on the surface

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.439
of the brain.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:48.449
And that actually is remarkable that that
information is detectable, even through our

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:49.449
skull.

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:52.999
We might get an idea then, of how strong those
signals are.

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:55.060
So, they sit there for a couple of hours.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.650
And we also do a few things.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.349
This is an inadvertent advertisement for V8.

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:02.259
I didn't plan on that.

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.860
And sometimes the students come in and they
know each other and there's this friendly

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.770
social environment and I also include confederates
at times.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.819
So, individuals who come in that the subject
doesn't know.

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:15.169
And none of this is formal study.

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:18.270
I've done one formal study.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:23.550
But primarily, I want there to be an open-ended
discovery environment.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.379
What I say in my book is that all of this
material and research for the past five years

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:35.469
is like one giant, really, really big rich
pilot study.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:38.219
This is what I see at my end.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:44.490
And this is the color representation of what's
going on in the brain in real-time.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.209
So, I'm using a technology called EEG, or
electroencephalogram.

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:55.510
And it divides up the brain here into various
regions that roughly match where there are

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.290
different lobes and fissures in the brain.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.420
So, it isn't completely arbitrary mapping.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.230
And I see this nice color representation.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.560
And it's more than color.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.970
There's actually two pieces of information.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.260
There's the color, which indicates frequency.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.019
And then, there's the length of the bar here,
which indicates amplitude.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:16.281
So, after I spend two or three hours with
the student there may actually be something

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:20.340
like 60 megabytes worth of data on their brain
activities.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.529
So, that's a statistician’s nightmare.

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:23.990
And fortunately, I'm not a statistician.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.490
So I don't have to deal with all of that.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.441
And so, that's a little bit of what I see
from my end.

00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:32.380
And it does change in real-time.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:41.190
But the really funny thing is the brain activity
comes about 300 milliseconds before the person

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.330
executes the action or behavior associated
with the brain activity.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.779
So, as I'm watching--and you would see it,
too--you would actually see something light

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:54.079
up in the brain and think for a moment, "Oh,
the person's about to do such and such."

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:57.830
But by the time that thought occurs to you,
they've already gone ahead and done it.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.310
So, it's a little bit like mind reading, but
there's such a short period of time, that

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.519
mind-reading is not that helpful.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:08.399
There's no time to take notes or anything
like that, or even say anything.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:12.920
It's just enough time for it to register in
my brain, which coincidentally between perception

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.160
and the thought, the matching is also about
the same amount of time.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.620
So, it's a really wonderful, very quick--.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.399
When they're doing mathematics for example,
and they're going to carry the one, you can

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:29.480
see that 'cause the brain does something.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.750
So, to summarize what it is that I'm working
with here, electroencephalogram, and it's

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.959
measuring activity in the neocortex only.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:40.310
So, there are different layers of the brain
and this is the outer layer.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.470
Really, really important in human beings.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.040
Our neocortex is huge compared to even the
other great apes and certainly monkeys on

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.899
down to very, very small neocortex compared
to what we have.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.899
It's fast.

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:53.899
It's simple.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:54.910
It's cheap.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:00.690
Contrary to what people might think, professors
are paid terribly and we very little funding

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.250
except for the few who somehow manage to wrangle
up something.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:09.420
So, it's great to some research that doesn't
cost ten or twenty thousand a student.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.670
The different colors.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.670
Know that red--.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.949
It follows the color spectrum, so red indicates
that that region is showing the most activity

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:18.620
there.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.630
And if we go down then from yellow, that's
a little bit less.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.540
Green, less still, but on the low end.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.779
Blue, much less.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:29.740
That's a relaxed state.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:35.319
If the brain were all blue, that would indicate
you're on the edge of sleep.

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:38.930
You might even be aware, but you're not active
in any way.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.300
And then black indicates no activity.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.589
And yes, something that's really interesting
is most people have one or two regions, even

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:51.190
after I go through and calibrate and whatnot,
one or two regions that simply show no activity

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.900
except under the greatest duress or stimulus.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.509
So, as we go through the different regions,
I mentioned those, you might consider which

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:05.140
ones, not only do you use or prefer a lot,
which ones do you not use?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.360
It also could have higher resolution than
it does.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.560
But it's the way it goes.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.579
What do I have people do?

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:14.899
I have two to three hours.

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:17.019
So, plenty of time.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:21.160
Usually 30 to 45 minutes, we spend doing more
introverted activities.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.319
So, they do meditation.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:26.759
They solve math problems.

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:27.759
A whole bunch of fun--.

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:28.759
[feedback sounds] Feedback.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:29.759
In the land of feedback.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:33.750
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: There you go.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.120
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: There we go.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.120
OK.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.000
I know, there's like a boundary space here.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
OK.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.440
So, we're playing games--card games, word
games.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.040
They do physical tasks like juggling.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.550
They might juggle by themselves or they have
a partner to do it with.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.399
Math problems, analogies.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:53.370
And many of these are laid out so that the
math start easy and get more difficult.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.720
Or with the juggling, we start with one ball
and then it moves up to more of them.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.000
Communications is speed dating, both real
and virtual.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.190
So, how does the brain interact when we are
interested in someone or not?

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.920
And some actually really funny anecdotes that
have come out of that.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.689
I can tell when a student is sitting there
and they really like the person they're with

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:17.949
or not so interested.

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:23.689
And I remember this one time, I could tell
this student had seen--.

00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:27.759
He had been on real dates, essentially, real
speed dates, five minutes each.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.750
And this was the third girl in a row.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.420
And it was clear from the brain activity--I'm
sitting like, 20 feet away from them--but

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.259
it's clear from the brain activity that he's
interested.

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:38.430
He's attentive in a variety of ways.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.779
And then all of a sudden out of the blue,
in the conversation that they're having, she

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:48.120
mentions that her whole family has converted
to Evangelical Christianity.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.110
And in that one moment, all of the interest
disappeared.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.200
[laughter]

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.600
And then we all had to laugh, even though
we're try and keep quiet until the end of

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.600
the task.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.230
And they're like, "What?

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.230
What's going on?"

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.230
So, we explained it.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.720
And she said, "Oh, that's actually not me
or even my immediate family."

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.540
Because what she meant, she was from Latin
America.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.880
So when she said her family, she meant like
her 30 closest relatives.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.519
And even not her immediate family.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:18.480
So the definition of family was different.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.259
And so then you would think after explaining
that this was something that OK, maybe he

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.660
might be more open.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.680
He wasn't.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.790
His brain never regained that level of interest.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.290
Although, they both remember the event to
this day, which is interesting.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.350
First impressions are very important.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.850
And so, be careful about what you say on your
first date.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.660
No sex, no politics, no religion, no death.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.259
And you'll be good.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:49.920
So, they also do simulated speed dating and
they do a role play with actors.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:57.730
A couple of ENFP theater students have come
in concocted a variety of situations.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.899
Recalling items on a list.

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.819
Details in a scene.

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:04.749
And then some open-ended stuff, like go back
to your childhood, or foresee into the future

00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:08.149
or where is your life gonna be ten years from
now.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:14.740
And we might think with something like this,
maybe its memory.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.490
So, recall an event from your childhood that
maybe there will be visualization and a little

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.589
bit of memory regions.

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:24.250
But there are some individuals who stand out
as recalling information in a very special

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.250
way.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.570
And some individuals who visualize the future
in a very special way.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.970
So, all of them have this potential to show
individual differences.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.550
And, oops.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.550
There we go.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.759
So this is an example of an easy open-ended
task.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:40.410
What comes to mind?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.070
And a lot of folks will mention stories as
we go along.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.970
Maybe what are some possible interpretations
of the story?

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.180
Something telling is how many different interpretations
can a person give.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.610
Some folks are like, "Well, there's one and
maybe two."

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.279
And then they peter out.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:02.029
And others can continue on for a while and
be able to offer different scenarios.

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:06.240
I mean, perhaps she's upset because she's
just poisoned him.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.069
And there's a whole bunch of things you could
read into it.

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:11.129
And then, they think the task is over, but
it's not.

00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:13.579
Fifteen minutes later, we come back to it.

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:14.960
I don't show them the picture, though.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.170
I just say, "Remember that picture I showed
you?

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.759
Could you recall for me as many details as
you can?"

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.009
And so, they remember the details.

00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:26.029
And the things they don't mention, I’ll
say something like, "Does the dress go down

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:28.670
to her ankles, to her knees?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.580
Does it cover her feet?"

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.959
All that kind of stuff.

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:33.499
And really is amazing.

00:16:33.499 --> 00:16:37.069
It's very consistent with personality type
who remembers more.

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:40.339
In fact, it's great because there are--.

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:46.139
One type, all of the ENFJ and ENTJ, if we
have any of those in the room.

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:50.790
Those two personality types actually remember
a lot of details, but incorrectly.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.790
[laughter]

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.120
So, it's important to know.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.540
Otherwise, the SP types are the ones who actually
remember the most.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.800
And which I found maybe people thought that
was a little bit of a surprise, but I think

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.530
because there's a drama in the image they
remember it.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.740
So, what I found overall.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:15.089
One is there are these regions of the neocortex
that light up when they're being used for

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.440
an activity.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.000
And really, each region has what is called
the "threshold to activation."

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.101
That if you receive just a little bit of input
and it doesn't pass that threshold, the region

00:17:27.101 --> 00:17:28.390
doesn't light up at all.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.650
But the moment you pass the threshold, then
it begins to light up.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.150
For some folks, that threshold is very low.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.260
So, almost any kind of stimulus will light
it up and the more stimulus they get, the

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.490
more it gets active.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:46.300
For other folks the level, the activation
to, the threshold activation is much higher.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.470
So that there's a lot of input that will come
in and it doesn't get active, doesn't light

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.270
up, and then all of a sudden it would be really,
really active out of nowhere.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.280
So, this region actually is related to embarrassment.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.730
Now, all of us love to be embarrassed, right?

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.260
[audience chuckles]
Some of us more easily embarrass than others.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.330
So, ENFJs for example, the personality type,
are really pretty easy to embarrass.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.610
And in fact, you can point out, "Oh, look.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.250
The embarrassment region is lighting up."

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.490
And then they get more embarrassed.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.490
And then, "Oh, look.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.990
You're getting even more embarrassed."

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.540
And then it lights up even more.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:25.880
And other folks very, very difficult to activate.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:32.550
But INTPs, so those are very different folks,
generally speaking, that region is quite dark.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.780
They don't even notice the social feedbacks,
so why would they get embarrassed?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.430
But when they do get embarrassed, oh boy,
does that activate.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.430
Not just in that region.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.300
It floods over like a little tsunami to all
of the neighboring regions as well.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.810
And so, it's funny because one of the neighboring
regions to this area here is the one responsible

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.840
for dexterity and for moving smoothly in the
environment and having boundaries between

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.020
self and others.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.030
So, if you've ever known someone who doesn't
get embarrassed very often, but when they

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.990
do, all of a sudden becomes flushed red and
they're klutzy and that's those folks there.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.440
So, that's representing how the brain works.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:19.860
And dark regions indicate what's not in use
has really become automatic.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.920
Signing your name should be a pretty easy,
mindless experience.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.820
There are various, also, holistic patterns
for the whole brain.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.160
And there are zigzag sequences.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.300
And so, we'll take a look at some of those.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.140
My environment here is very dynamic I have
to say.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140
[laughter]

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.140
You're lighting up and down.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.300
We're in the brain right here.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.780
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: It's task oriented,
watching the brain.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.780
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Yes.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.780
Yes.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.780
Yeah.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.780
We're inside the Google brain.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.080
So, this is what I was coming with, is I would
see--.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.370
What I would do over the two or three hours
is I would average the brain activity.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.420
That's not the only thing I do, but statistically,
it makes it really easy when you have 50 or

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.320
60 megabytes of data.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.300
And these are real people.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.750
They're not their real names.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.270
But I have Maria and Ross here.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.830
And they happen to identify with the these
particular personality types.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.740
And I had ten weeks to let them get to this
best fit process.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.440
So, I felt that was very important in doing
research.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.890
If you're gonna make connections to personality,
you better make sure that it's an accurate

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.880
connection.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.690
And again, red regions are the most active.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.490
And then yellow and going all the way down--green,
blue, and then black.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.030
And they look quite different from each other,
don't they?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.990
Really, really quite different.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.310
But one thing we notice is that the--I'll
point to this one.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.430
I'm afraid of walking too far over there.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:49.620
This region here, this one here, there's really
on average no brain activity, which is remarkable.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.810
But there's this nice halo.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.950
And this is very light because it's just blue,
light activity.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.350
This little bridge across the halo here.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:04.520
Others might describe it as the rim of a volcano,
but because she happens to identify with INFP

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.190
and I think INFPs prefer the halo metaphor,
as good and evil.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.190
[laughter]

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.120
Over here, you can see the letters are very
different.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.440
So, even if you're not that up to date with
the Myers-Briggs terminology, it's absolutely

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440
fine.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.450
You can tell that I versus E and N versus
S, F versus T. They're pretty different from

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.450
each other.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.180
And in the interior here, they're practically
mirror images.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:36.120
At the same time I was doing these experiments,
I was also reading quite a bit about what

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.410
others have discovered, primarily using EEG,
but other technologies like fMRI as well,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.040
what these different regions tend to do.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.520
And as I mentioned, the regions are a little
bit arbitrary.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.510
But we could be more fine-grained about it.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.500
So, sometimes there's some overlap in what
goes on.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.620
But I wanted to know.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.490
So, what does this mean?

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.070
They're showing these consistent use of these
regions.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.090
Does this say anything about their personality?

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:08.450
I did discover, and we'll just point out the
red regions here, that on this side here,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.830
this is for listening to words, specifically.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.980
So, diction, grammar, word selection.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.540
Not like a logical word selection, necessarily,
but at least what fits grammatically.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.350
Over here on this side, at least for right-handed
folks, this is about tone of voice.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.900
So, listening to tone of voice.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.390
So, part of tone of voice, there's a little
region around here that branches over to this

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:38.760
area slightly, which is responsible for evaluating
intention, motivation.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.270
So if you ever wonder how come I better assess
people's intentions, will hopefully stimulate

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.510
the neighboring area.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.320
Get that, pay attention to tone of voice and
what's going on there.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.270
So, when people emphasize words, that'll tell
you right there.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.230
You also notice this region up here is red.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.140
This does two different things.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.650
And this actually was really well flushed
out by the work with autism because autistic

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:06.770
individuals tend to have a lot more activity
here than on this side.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.800
And this region, one that handles how much
you like or dislike something.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.960
So, when a musician would come in and he would
say "my guitar" and "my music."

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.510
Every time he would say "my guitar" and "my
music," this region would light up--whatever

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.650
happens to be important to you.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.150
Now, some people will say a meta-type of statement.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.050
So, they'd be like "my values."

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.260
And that will light it up as well.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.700
The region also handles something else.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:39.070
It really gets active when people remember
detailed information accurately.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.270
And at first, this was thought to be a little
bit strange.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.740
Like, why is it that something for like and
dislike, belief, and in fact, this region

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.840
is also associated with religious beliefs.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.180
When people talk about their religious beliefs,
your religious beliefs, this region gets active,

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.190
too.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.960
Why would it also be related to detail?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.700
But if you tease it apart, you understand
really quickly what's going on.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.730
If something is important to you, it's not
just happens to be important say, here today

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.040
at Google.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.350
It's something that is important generally
speaking across your life, no matter what

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.340
situation it is.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.950
And so, you take those beliefs with you as
something that holds across different contexts.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:24.330
The reason this region gets active around
detail is a lot of the time, people get information.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.130
And then we ask, "What did you do earlier
this morning?"

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.550
You may not remember every detail.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.380
You don't need to because you can fill in
with context.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.580
It's like, were there other cars on the road
this morning?

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.460
You probably weren't paying attention to specifically,
was somebody gonna ask me later how many cars

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.830
did I see, but you can guess pretty well based
on context and past experience.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.960
But guessing based on context is handled on
the other side.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.860
When this side is more active, it's again
about, "we're not gonna pay attention to context"--this

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.060
idea that something that holds across situations.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.940
So, if we forget about context, we're not
gonna do any guessing in context.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.440
We're always gonna think something is true
no matter what.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.620
Now we understand why this region is really
good with detail because the detail--we're

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.800
not trying to fill in the blanks or do guessing.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.670
It's just what we remember and that's it.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.180
Finally, this region over here.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.700
So this is right up here on the front.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.700
This is really, really important, this region,
on both sides.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.660
These are the executives.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.640
Sometimes we can think of them as CEOs.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.400
Now, what is a company like when it has two
CEOs of equal power and authority?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.200
Well, that's a really interesting question,
actually, to ask at this company.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200
[laughter]

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.940
But it's a little bit different.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.790
People still have defined roles.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.580
And there's a difference between founders
and then all the responsibilities that happen

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.790
for day to day.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.790
And it can work out.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.970
But for the most part, people have a preference
for one side or the other--either this executive

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.230
or this executive, even if they're right-handed.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.870
So, the stereotype is all right-handed folks
are more active on this left side over here,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.020
but that's actually not the case.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.950
It has more to do with personality type than
it does handedness.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.990
This region here is for explaining and deciding.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:14.570
So, if I give you three fingers, which finger
do you like the most?

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.380
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Not the middle
one.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.380
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: OK.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.380
So it's gonna be this one here.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.380
OK, good choice.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.380
OK.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.380
And then, why did you select that one?

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.380
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: It's very useful.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.380
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Very useful.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.420
OK, where you can point with it and this and
that and it's not the middle one.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.170
So, you've made a choice.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.990
You've done some decision-making and you gave
an explanation.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.630
We might think, "Oh, was that a logical explanation
you gave?"

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.310
But if you actually had to work out the logic
as you were speaking, like, the situation

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.370
would go on.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.350
But it takes so long to work out the logic
of "is that really the logical choice?"

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.620
So, most of the time, we don't actually use
our whole brain.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.520
It feels like we're thinking and making logical
decisions, but actually it's just the executive

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.040
making up something that sounds perfectly
reasonable and it's pretty workable.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.350
And that's what goes on with this region right
here.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:02.150
So, I suppose you could say INFPs are really
good at coming up with reasons and explanations

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:07.400
and making long-term life decisions that revolve
around their personal identity and values.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.480
And they're very good at listening and working
with words, whether those are literal words

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.280
and composition, word choice, or perhaps reading.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280
It's not just writing.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280
It's reading as well.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.720
And also attentive to tone of voice and intentionality.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.990
And so, if you're a little bit aware of Myers-Briggs,
great.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:30.060
That sounds like a good match with INFP, especially
when we notice that the yellow sections over

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.070
here, that these are related to the areas
of asking "What if?"

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.880
And visualizing some possibilities.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.400
And down here, this is also noticing visual
impressions.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.630
If you don't know Myers-Briggs, I've actually
given you a pretty good description of INFP

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.980
in terms of their capabilities, or their skill
set.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.500
This was really wonderful to see that match
that was there.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.530
Conversely, ESTP.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.310
I won't go into detail about this one, but
you can see that the other executive is the

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.260
one that's more in charge.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.980
And this side over here, this side here, is
much more about managing process, for allowing

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:14.380
more information in and dwelling on that information
and allowing it to affect what it is that

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.090
you do.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.160
These regions here are for logical reasoning.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.932
So, if A equals B and B equals C, than--

00:28:21.932 --> 00:28:22.932
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: A equals C.

00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:27.430
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: A equals C. Yes.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.430
Absolutely.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.850
So this region will hopeful--.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.850
No, that's a little bit.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.260
Folks already know that, so they don't need
to think too much about it.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.650
But if you really wanna go through that logical
branching, this is the region that is gonna

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.710
be really fantastic for that.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:46.550
Over here, a great example would be a porpoise,
is that a mammal or a fish?

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.660
It's a mammal.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.660
Yes.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.790
In fact, you would even think it's strange
to mix those categories that are there.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.330
This region is about weighing.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.260
Something comes in and it has a spacial relationship,
actually.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.670
There's thousands potentially of categories
and sub-categories.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.470
Where does something fit when it comes in?

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.360
What is the category that it fits well in?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:15.320
Down here, this is for weighing odds for risk
and uncertainty.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.060
So, you go to Vegas and you want to know is
this a better game or is this a better game?

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.030
And if I put this amount, how much money do
I lose?

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.080
But if I could put this amount, I might lose
something.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.160
So, there's all these different options and
there's these risks and uncertainties there

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.620
and weighing those all at once.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.790
You see this is very active for economics
graduate students.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.960
And then there's not just me.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.560
Like, this is known in the literature.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.920
This is very active for econ graduate students.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.060
And so, right there, we can just see by these
red regions here that I've given you some

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.200
idea of the analytical skills of ESTP.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.470
Maybe they don't show them all the time.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.900
Notice that none of these here are connected
to--.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:59.650
Well, I suppose there's a little bit of adjacency
over here and a little bit here on the corners,

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.840
but they're not immediately adjacent to the
speaking areas.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.630
So they may not necessarily verbalize what
they're saying.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.370
It goes on in the interior of the neocortex.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:14.120
I think this is the part where I normally
ask if there are any questions.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.910
I don't think I've lost anyone.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.910
OK.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.590
I also know I'm supposed to count to five
after I ask if there are any questions.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.590
It's a good rule to know.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.590
Yes.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:36.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: If you just looked
at an EEG of some person, like, that has color

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320
dye.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Mm-hmm.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Can you quantify
them into the 16 boxes of the Myers-Briggs

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320
personality?

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Yes.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320
Right.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320
Right.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320
Right.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320
Repeat the question.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320
If I were to just see--.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.320
Oh, I already advanced this for a moment go
back here.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320
If I were to just see this activity--.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.860
I would say if I'm sitting there at the computer,
I'll have some ideas.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.380
If I were to get the statistical average it
would give me a much better idea.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.700
Would I be able to guess the person's Myers-Briggs
type?

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.300
And I would say quite a bit of the time, yes.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.270
Right away there's the, is this side or this
side more active?

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.340
That will immediately narrow down from 16
to eight.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.520
And from there, I might do something like,
are one or more of these regions on the interior

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.490
active that indicates an interest in--it's
called introverted thinking.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.560
It's not the same as being an introvert with
the thinking preference, but we'll get to

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.560
that.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.910
Do they have a lot of listening?

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.830
The same folks who show a lot of activity
in the middle here, tend to have a lot less

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.830
listening.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.800
So, that would be a sort right there as well.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.391
I've seen the halo a number of times.

00:31:36.391 --> 00:31:42.260
I've had seven INFP subjects and you can pretty
well tell them, not just from this activity

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.470
here, but what I'm also gonna describe is
the whole brain activity that happens.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.370
And no, I would say though still, everyone
is unique.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:55.050
Like, that's why I start with Maria, who happens,
in parenthesis, to identify with INFP.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:00.130
'Cause I've had other INFPs, let’s say one
who does sports, and he had much more activity

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.470
in this region here, which would be very useful
for doing sports.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.190
So, a person's background and their skill
sets will definitely do it.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.250
So, I'm just gonna--.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.460
I'm not gonna go through all of this, but
give you a sense of what it is that ends up

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.920
on this chart.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.580
Everything that I put up here is both found
in the literature, so not by me.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.230
Other people have located these things.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.840
And I saw it.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.730
It worked out in my lab from the lab data.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.980
And I didn’t want to talk about anything
that wouldn't meet those two criteria.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.650
I thought it was really important to be able
to say, "Yes, this is happening here on someone

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.220
and I've seen it for real."

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.000
Otherwise, it's so easy to draw connection
between what I read and thinking like, "Oh,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
yeah.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That sounds like such and such."

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.580
The other thing you'll notice, you may have
stumbled across some theories about maybe

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:53.131
people are more left-brained or right-brained
if they use more of one quadrant of the brain

00:32:53.131 --> 00:32:54.430
over the other.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.430
Sorry.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:01.600
Our brains are much more complex and interesting
than just having a simple left and right or

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.450
different quadrants, something like that.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:09.370
Like, all these regions, and really, these
are the results of evolutionary forces.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.440
So sometimes you have things grouped together
in you're like, "Well, why aren't these neighbors?"

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440
I don't know.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.180
That's just the way it worked out.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:24.260
And down here, this section on doing mathematics
and integrating vision and sensation, that

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.690
also comes as reading.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:34.410
I had a woman from Saudi Arabia asking, "Why
is it that going to a Koranic school where

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.410
they memorize--.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.960
They read the Koran and they memorize it and
repeat it verbally.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.330
Why is it that it improves their ability in
mathematics?"

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.300
I said this actually is really not a surprise
because reading and math and both, especially

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:51.380
rote mathematics--so what is five times five,
kind of thing--and reading are both really

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.550
heavily associated with this one region right
here.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:01.410
And so, there was a natural carry over between
those.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:08.679
This is a favorite for folks who use the personality
type to explain preference.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.929
And I thought, "Oh, this will be really great
example.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.620
I'll just try this in the lab and see what
happens."

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.659
And I was actually ended being really shocked.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:22.730
This one exercise turns out to be a fantastic
sorter between S in the code or N in the code.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.770
So, I asked them to sign their name with their
preferred hand.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.419
And then I asked them to sign again.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:30.270
Actually they do several things.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.460
They sign again with their non-preferred hand
and then they sign again backwards, but with

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.480
their preferred hand.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:41.020
And then sign yet again, a fourth time, backwards
with their non-preferred hand.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.610
And the expectation, we might think is a common
sense hypothesis, that signing your name should

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.450
not require too much work.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:53.080
And it won't evoke too much brain activity.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.300
But signing your name again with your non-preferred
hand backwards will definitely, it should

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.670
evoke more activity, right?

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:04.440
You're trying to figure out which letter comes
next and you have to work your hand, knowing

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.760
how to be left-handed about it and how does
it go.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.660
So, I thought well, this is gonna be easy.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.880
I'm just gonna demonstrate signing with your
non-preferred hand takes more work in the

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.880
brain.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.180
And I was wrong.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.410
I wasn't completely wrong.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.730
It turns out that folks who have an intuiting
preference, so they have an N in their type

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.180
code, that that holds true.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.960
They try harder with the second activity.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:32.720
For folks who have sensing preference, they
have an S in their code, it's actually the

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720
reverse.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.630
That signing their name, you see some brain
activity.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.580
And when I asked them to do, sign backwards
with your non-preferred hand, it doesn't really

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.480
show any activity.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.880
Now why might that be?

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:51.100
Well, as one student said--he had a sensing
preference--"Signing your name backwards with

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:56.200
your non-preferred hand, that's just some
random, weird fun activity to do.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.000
Like, that doesn't have any meaning to it.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.830
Like when would I do that in real life?"

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.380
So, there was no attempt.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.740
It's not important, which really highlighted
to me that motivation.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.120
It's not just about competence.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.270
It's about motivation as well.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:13.730
Whereas for some of the sensing preference,
often signing your name really nicely is important

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.730
to them.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.230
They don't just randomly repeat it.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.200
There's actually some brain activity that
goes into it.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.840
And that got me thinking that maybe there's
something interesting going on.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.190
And then I really tried that out more.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.850
And I had a student who knew French and Arabic
and English.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.970
And I said, "Fantastic."

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.840
And he's very good at English.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.600
You wouldn't know that Arabic was his original
native language.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.600
And I said, "Could you write your name in
Arabic backwards with your non-preferred hand

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.260
in addition to writing it the usual way."

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.870
And he had an intuiting preference.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.780
So, I thought, "Writing his name in Arabic,
it's gonna be no brain activity.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.670
And writing his name backwards in Arabic,
it'll evoke more brain activity."

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.670
Didn't happen.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.820
Why not?

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.530
I said, "You didn't show any brain activity
here."

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.510
After we debriefed the task.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.200
What happened?

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.400
And he said, "Well, none of you in the lab
can read Arabic, so it didn't matter how I

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.400
wrote."

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400
[laughter]

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.010
So, it really was--.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.920
I'm like, "Oh.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.920
Of course."

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.010
So really, the motivation and context do play
an essential part in how it is that we use

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.010
our brains.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.520
So, competence plus motivation together.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.940
And that's then what I call this engagement
curve.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.460
Being engaged means being competent and/or
motivated, preferably and.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.920
I think we can be somewhat engaged if we have
competence just because--.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.010
I don't really, I'm not like a big math nerd
or something, but I did a lot of math.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:44.890
I did probably three solid years of calculus--linear
algebra and the matrices and all that kind

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.920
of stuff as an engineering student.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.600
I don't remember any of it.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.670
I recognize what part of the book I need to
look to understand to do it, but that's it.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.010
So yeah, I could do that.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.860
Also, somebody could be motivated and terrible
at it, but they're gonna try.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.310
But ideally, it's both.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:08.400
So engaging activities evoke progressively
more brain activity as challenge and motivation

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400
increase.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.570
So, assuming the student is motivated to do
the math problems and not look like a fool

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:17.380
because they can't subtract 17 from 34.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:23.710
As the problems get more challenging, this
curve will move up, assuming they're motivated.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.910
The moment they reach the point where they're
like, "Oh, I don't know this math.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.910
I can't do it."

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.550
And they give up on it.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.280
The motivation is lost.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.300
There's an instant drop in brain activity.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.700
So, it really could go in a particular, several
regions.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.080
One, two, three.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.520
Goes from blue to green to yellow to finally
some red that's there.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.010
And it just drops off to black.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.010
Nothing.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:48.480
So, if I said, "Please all of you now take
a moment to sign your name in Urdu."

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.940
There might be one person who can, OK?

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.220
But for most of you, probably not.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.870
So I think that's really important and that's
one of the things that I hear about 'cause

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:01.680
I don't see it firsthand, but I hear Google
really is very welcoming for their employees

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.340
to have time to do their own projects, which
is great because presumably you're motivated

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.380
to do your own projects.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.020
And you're picking something that you have
some competence in.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:16.720
So, that is going to engage you and get you
in there.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.130
Now I'm talking about some of these holistic
activities.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.180
This is--.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.170
It comes out a light blue.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.010
It's darker blue here.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:33.190
It should be like the color of the sky because
the brightness reflects something as well

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.680
as just the frequency of the color.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.840
This is every region is in sync with every
other region.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.820
All of them have the same, or dominated by
the same frequency and amplitude of electromagnetic

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820
activity.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.820
What does that mean?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.870
That means it's not just a mansion filled
with rooms and each person is doing their

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:52.870
own thing.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.780
It's everybody's in sync and working with
everyone else.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.820
People can maintain this for a few seconds.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:05.420
So, you win at a hand of cards, or even just
the process of shuffling cards may evoke this.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:10.400
Or, it may remain there for two minutes, three
minutes, ten minutes, whatever it is.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.820
And when doing a task as an expert--.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.620
There's actually an exception to this and
that relates to two of the personality types.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.050
But let's take a look at what are those activities.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.450
What the question that you might consider
as we look through these, are any of these

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.250
like what you do?

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.630
And it was interesting because somebody asked
me, "Do people know when they're in the state

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.630
of flow?"

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.580
Sort of, do we have some kind of self-reflective
intuition?

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580
Something like that.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.340
I don't think so from my lab.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:43.350
Like, none of them could report when they
thought they showed this or not.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.670
So then, I think it's important to then--.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.700
Actually, this is an example why knowing personality
type would be really helpful because in general,

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.960
these were associated with either your skill
area, like music or dance, something like

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.650
that, or they were related to the person's
personality type.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.650
Acting.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.770
By following a highly rehearsed scene--.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:08.132
So, we had an actor, an EFNP actor by the
way, and when he did a cold reading it didn't

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.240
show up.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.740
And when he did improvisational acting, it
didn't show up either.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.990
It was only doing--.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.330
What ENFPs love to do, right, which is lots
of memorization and rehearsal?

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.330
No.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:23.380
But that's when they reach the state of flow
is after he really forced himself to spend

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.220
all this time repetitions, doing practice.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.210
Describing the ultimate meaning of why people
live or die.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:35.080
So, I give out this little news article and
usually I read it to the person.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.580
And it's a fictitious article and it's about
something sad that reflects a little bit of

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.840
your responsibility from one of the people
mentioned in the article.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.311
And after I read it--.

00:41:45.311 --> 00:41:47.090
And it involves death.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:51.570
And after I read it, I ask people to use one
or two words to describe how you feel right

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.570
now.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.990
And most people will say, "I'm sad," or "I'm
angry," or some combination thereof.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:05.120
However, this one student with ENFJ preferences,
E-N-F-J, refused to answer with one or two

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120
emotions.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120
She said, "That's too easy.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120
That's childish."

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.730
It would be so easy to just say I'm angry
or I'm sad.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.450
So she began to give a philosophical reason
for why people are put on the earth and what

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.150
are our responsibilities to each other as
human beings.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.250
And all the while, while she's giving me this
and answer and drawing from the article and

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.730
composing a response that fits with her philosophy,
there was solid blue.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:31.820
Every region was participating, contributing,
to her philosophical response.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:37.470
In contrast, by the way, her opposite type,
ISTP, I had a student like that recently.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:40.060
I read the same article and asked the same
questions.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.930
And the ISTP, she said to me--.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.581
I asked, "How do you feel in one or two words."

00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:45.930
And she said, "I feel nothing."

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.580
She says, "I wasn't there.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.530
It didn't involve anyone I know.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:55.869
I haven't really had time to think about how
I feel."

00:42:55.869 --> 00:43:00.270
So I think that was even, even not just looking
at brain activity, but just listening and

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:05.000
watching how people do activities in the lab
and the kind of responses they give are--.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.320
It never occurred to me that someone would
have no emotional response to it.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.190
She said "if you give me some time to think
about it and I read it over again, I can give

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.170
you an emotional response."

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:20.890
That's sort of, you have to manufacture where
you send it to the plant and they make it

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.610
and bring it back.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.620
[laughter]

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:34.330
My younger brother has ISTP preferences and
he used to do a lot of track racing and I

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.580
asked him after a win how he felt.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.410
And he said, "I think I feel happy."

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.370
I'm like, "But how do you feel?"

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.370
[laughter]

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.370
Drumming a familiar beat.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:49.040
So, we had a drummer and when she drummed
her favorite familiar beat, not other times,

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.170
but when she did that.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.360
Handling a dramatic crisis in a role play
scenario.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:57.830
So, this is what I've seen with all the types
with S and P in their code, especially ESFP

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.180
and ESTP.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.680
As the actors come in, the theater students,
they can get up.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.740
So the subject can get up.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.360
They can't swivel their head around a lot.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.670
I discourage that, but otherwise they can
move a little bit.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.119
And they're engaged in a crisis role play
and they like getting into it.

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:14.550
They absolutely do.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.550
And they're very creative.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.670
They pick topics that I would never think
of, involving--.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.660
Well, I won't even get into it.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.270
Things that are not repeatable here.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.910
But they know Dario was cool and will be OK
with it.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.981
[audience chuckles] So, as they get into it,
they go from having brain activity about listening

00:44:30.981 --> 00:44:36.640
and seeing and so on, and all of a sudden,
as it ramps up the crisis, their brain show

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.660
a little blue here and blue there and some
regions starting to hold and then disappear.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.770
And then they just hold like this, really
tightly.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.680
And they remain there for two or three minutes
until the crisis began to resolve itself and

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.290
then it would slowly start to come apart again.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:55.340
So, the ability to be in a state of flow with
a crisis--and they didn't know what was gonna

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.369
happen next.

00:44:56.369 --> 00:45:00.390
So I wouldn't say that that was an area of
expertise, except maybe they're good at crisis

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.560
management and good at role play in the situations.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.640
Listening intently to somebody else.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.650
I've had some students who can debate contentious
topics, like gun control.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.310
And by some, I mean only the INFPs.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.330
And maybe some ISFPs a little bit as well.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.730
So, those are two types that have a lot of
similarities to each other.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.650
They're good listeners.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.470
One student, he sat--.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:29.290
And you know normally, when we hear something
we disagree with, what is our natural response?

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:34.680
It's to come up with counter arguments, even
as the other person is still speaking.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.180
'Cause we sorta guess what they're gonna say
and we come up with again with what is our

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.180
own view.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.230
He didn't do that.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:46.960
For ten solid minutes, whether he was speaking
or whether his argument, opponent, his opponent

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.290
in the argument was speaking, he remained,
every region was in the state of awake, but

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.010
alert.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.380
And then finally, after ten minutes that pattern
broke.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:03.260
And there was a lot of activity in the left
prefrontal areas as he decided and explained

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.410
his final opinion.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:09.170
And he's like, "I gave you ten minutes to
give me your point of view and I really did

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.170
consider it."

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:12.010
So, that's what I mean by truly active listening.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.810
"And now, I have decided my perspective on
it."

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.150
And that was the end of listening.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.630
So, I would say with folks who are really
good listeners, keep in mind they're not always

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:22.730
really good listeners.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.530
Once they make up their mind that’s it.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.830
And it's great to see.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.140
Now I also had one student.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:34.410
He would only show the pattern of active listening
when he listened to me and another professor.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.440
So, this was about the central authority figures.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.880
Anyone know someone like that?

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.390
Yeah, what did the authority say?

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:48.300
I also had one student who would only listen
that way to women, but not to men.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.840
And it was really funny 'cause he and his
fraternity brother were both in the lab.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.900
So, his fraternity brother could back this
up.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.210
The fraternity brothers made fun of him.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.190
They were always, "Kareem, you never listen.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.590
I mean, you never listen.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:03.590
You never do any chores.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.690
You don't remember to do anything when say
stuff to you.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.710
It just goes in one ear and out the other."

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.560
And he said that just didn't make sense.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:16.650
And he was saying, "I have all these female
friends."

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:22.270
He has, like to him, just keeping to one date
is difficult because they all want to date

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.270
him.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.930
And all of them, he says, "My female friends
me, they're like, 'Kareem, you're a fantastic

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.150
listener.'"

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.790
And now we know why.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:34.690
He enters a state of active flow when he's
listening to women, but not to men.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.500
Maybe he might wanna work on that.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.060
I don't know.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.590
Pointing while talking, or using a finger.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.730
I always noticed my mom when she would read.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:42.730
She uses--.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.550
She never took a speed reading class, but
she uses her finger to read.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.990
And one time I asked her, "Why do you do that?"

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.160
And she said, "It helps me focus."

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.160
I'm like, "OK."

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.570
I don't feel like I need to use my finger
and I can focus.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.540
But I'll trust that it works for you.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.260
So, I saw a student do this in the lab of
a similar type and I said, "Hey, what's going

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.260
on?"

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.060
And he said, "Oh, it helps me focus."

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.200
And so, the whole--.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.230
His finger was there.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.230
It was all blue.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.420
He takes the finger away.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.190
All of a sudden it breaks up into pretty much
nothing.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.190
I say, "OK.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.190
Now reapply your finger."

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:12.190
It's suddenly blue again.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.250
"Take your finger away."

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.130
I mean, really is like that fast.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.359
That's the great thing about EEG.

00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:17.859
It's like, instant.

00:48:17.859 --> 00:48:19.720
And I'm like, "Wow.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.190
Make sure you don't lose those fingers.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.020
And don't give them away to somebody else."

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.020
[laughter]

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.020
You want that.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.020
That's a good thing to know.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.340
So then there are all these other things that
came up.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.869
Reviewing the past or visualizing the future.

00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:35.450
If I asked you what your life is like or going
to be ten years from now.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:42.010
The natural tendency is to think about what
we'd like to happen or what stereotypically

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:46.160
happens to people, or logically what will
probably happen.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.380
But some people really open up.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.610
Every region of the brain gets involved in
this state of flow.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:49:00.410
So, it's a coordinated, synchronized contribution
to say, "Yes, what will happen in the future."

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:02.320
Or, for the past.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320
The same thing.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.890
Review your life, something that happened
to you say, 20 years ago or--.

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.350
Well, the students didn't necessarily live
that long.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:10.550
They won't remember.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.990
But, when they were kids.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:17.800
See, this is, I think, where some of the stuff
really began that might be relevant for you.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.890
Singing a unique song.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.330
So, the student was a musician playing guitar.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.140
He's a professional singer and guitar player.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:30.470
Singing other songs did not evoke that flow,
only when he did his own.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.150
Singing other songs, there would be like this
motor activity that goes on with the hands

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:37.500
and so on--kinesthetic activity and some auditory.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.740
But it was doing his own stuff.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.090
For the entire song, he'd remain in that state.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:46.820
And I've seen this time and again that when
the students would do things that were directly

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.030
related, was a unique product.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.310
So that's why I say it's more than expertise.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.760
A lot of times it's creative expertise, as
what the person has done individually, that

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.070
really evokes that state.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.270
They internalized it and made their own.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.350
In fact, one student, she was a dancer for
15 years--from age three to age 18.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.160
So, that's probably pretty burnt into the
brain.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:10.440
All she had to do was sit back and relax,
close her eyes and visualize dancing.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.190
And every region of her brain was in sync
with every other.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.430
Now, sometimes this has interesting implications.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:22.940
I had a student sorting between his parents
wanted him to go to dental school and he wants

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.300
to be a rap musician.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.300
Very different.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.160
And I guess the parent's feel like we've paid
for you to go to UCLA.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.470
Like, you're gonna graduate and become a dentist.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.650
And he comes from a Persian family.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.619
And if you may know, Persian families tend
to be very--how can we say--hands on with

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:41.720
their kids in guiding them.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.680
And when we talked about dentistry, that didn't
really evoke any--.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.240
Even in this region up here about importance.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.530
It just did not evoke anything.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.390
When he did his own rap songs that he had
made up.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:56.640
So this is really funny 'cause this is like
a Persian guy, 20 years old, and he's singing

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.990
like, ghetto rap songs.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.150
And even his own versions.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:03.760
And he went into this total state of blue
creative flow.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.400
So I just reported that to him that "you do
seem to have some kind of special affinity,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.560
talent, expertise, creative expertise with
this."

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:16.100
I understand it's been like, four years since
he's graduated and he's been studying for

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.040
the dental exams for those four years.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.770
Hasn't actually gone to dental school yet.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.670
There are also some other patterns.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:27.510
And these are hilarious, actually.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.220
'Cause people ask, "Well, OK.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.270
So we could be solid blue.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.270
What does that mean?"

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.220
What happens when a person holds a state that
was solid?

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.780
And this doesn't happen all the time.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.830
But you can usually find it somewhere.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.190
And it's not just me, OK?

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.780
This is in the literature.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.440
Watching television evokes almost no brain
activity in the neocortex.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.930
I've seen two exceptions.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.720
And I did a whole like, very structured research
study with a student, with randomized introduction

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.500
of film clips and so on.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.760
All very nicely done.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.650
The APA would love me for it.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.570
I did all the right things.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:00.570
Only two things.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.390
If you're familiar with the movie "Memento."

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.880
So, the movie "Memento" follows a man who,
his short-term memory doesn't write itself

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.470
into long-term memory.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:14.790
And it's filmed in such a way that you experience
some of the same confusion that the character

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:15.950
does.

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:20.720
That evokes some brain activity.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.000
Everything else, from--.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.390
Well, the other thing is there was an ending
scene in the first Charlie's Angels movie,

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:33.240
which has each of four different protagonists,
each in a different location, fighting somebody

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.220
different and we're just thrown as a viewer
into the middle of all of these different

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.290
shots and cuts.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.850
So, it takes a while for the viewer to figure
out who's where and what is it that they're

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:42.890
doing.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:50.380
All the other ten examples from Texas Chainsaw
Massacre to Teletubbies evoke no brain activity.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:55.250
So, what I tell parents "if you have a choice
between TV and video games, at least let your

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.540
kids play video games."

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.490
That's so much better than TV.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:59.920
Now, green.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.690
What happens when it's solid green?

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:07.060
When they're doing speed dating and you dislike
someone, it's green.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.000
When a person is engaged in an argument.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.290
Now, if they get really active in the argument,
it might look like this, but a lot of the

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.190
times it'll just have quite a bit of green.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:20.870
Losing at a game of cards.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.410
And I began to think about, OK, if these and
other situations, I said, "What did they all

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:25.410
have in common?"

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.100
And I would debrief them after the activity.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.760
It has a disassociation in common.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:36.030
Disassociation means, in psychological terms,
that you don't want to feel your bodily sensations

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.030
and your emotions.

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:42.260
You want to separate yourself from what's
going on so that the cognition is separate

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:45.920
from all those impulses and emotions that
might sway you.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920
And it does make sense.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.790
I mean, if you don't like someone, you don't
want to feel the feeling of disliking them.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.211
How about losing at a card game?

00:53:52.211 --> 00:53:55.430
Anyone wanna dwell in that feeling of loss
and failure?

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.910
No.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.420
Focus thinking though, also helps.

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.460
And sometimes I saw the reverse in card games.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.350
A person would lose and all of a sudden, it
was solid green.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.350
OK.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:05.350
And then they would win.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.350
And it would be solid green.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:10.040
Unfortunately, I debriefed them and then they're
saying, "Well, I thought I'm just gonna try

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.530
and redouble my effort."

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.500
And so there was this focus thinking a lot.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.200
In contrast is a solid yellow.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.300
This is a great sort for doing sensing.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.850
That doesn't mean you only show it if you
have an S in your type code.

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.330
But when any of us, 'cause we all can do,
it's about preference.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.720
Like, I have right hand, left hand.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.460
I can use both.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.540
I might have a preference for my right hand,
but I use both.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.980
So, people use both intuiting and sensing,
both thinking and feeling.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.430
But people would show this when they really
like somebody, when they're really feeling

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.430
bodily sensations.

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.390
Like, I asked them to close their eyes and
they're listening to music and to feel the

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:47.390
beat.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.440
When they win at a game of cards.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.280
As I begin to add all these things together,
I realize a lot of this is being in an associated

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.280
state.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:00.020
When you really allow those body sensations
and those emotions from the mid-brain and

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:04.570
from the body to well up and influence your
thinking and to experience those.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.340
Finally, when it's solid red.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.369
So, this is the highest frequency possible.

00:55:08.369 --> 00:55:12.850
This is like when the mercury on the thermometer
goes all the way up to like, what do they

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:13.990
max out at?

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:16.260
Like 120 degrees Fahrenheit?

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.130
Fahrenheit, for those of you who are in countries
who use Celsius, which is probably just about

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.750
everyone, right?

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.750
Hyper stimulated is when it shows.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.720
I took all my setup to Burning Man.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.570
I know some executives from Google go to Burning
Man every year.

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:31.760
They get flown in, too.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.760
That's so nice.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.690
They don't have to wait in line for three
hours in a car.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:38.690
Burning Man is--.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:40.550
How many of you know about Burning Man?

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:41.790
Oh, wow.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.790
Almost every one of you.

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:45.680
What a good company to inform their employees
about Burning Man.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.099
All three subjects from completely sober to
completely not.

00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:54.280
And I did this at dusk, which is like the
perfect time when there are lights and sounds

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.090
and everybody's getting really active and
there's still enough light to be able to see

00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.560
what's going on clearly.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.430
All of the brains were at maximum frequency
and amplitude.

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:03.960
They couldn't go any higher on the device.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.730
They might have been higher, but I couldn't
measure it.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:12.250
And in fact, in order to do an activity like
saying economic odds making or something like

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:13.960
that, they actually had to come down.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.910
So if this region here would go from red down
to green in order to get active.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:19.910
So, hyper stimulated.

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:23.380
It's also been seen in experiments where people
have an "aha" moment.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.830
Oh, my God, that's what you mean.

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:30.710
And learning a new game, especially a game
of cards.

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:32.400
And so, that's why I say, OK if your kids.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.400
OK.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.400
TV not so much.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.390
Video games evokes some brain activity for
sure.

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:37.480
It depends on the video game.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.290
Do like a board game or a card game.

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.460
And that evokes even more, especially if they're
learning a new game.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.720
If you keep playing solitaire five hundred
times, you're not gonna be there.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.790
It's about learning new games.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:53.880
So those are some of the very broad patterns.

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.240
Not to oversimplify them, we might consider
times when we see a circuit.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.170
So, here is and I'll see this very quickly
and in one second.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:02.859
Da da da da da da da da.

00:57:02.859 --> 00:57:04.550
Da da da da da da da da.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:06.340
And it just repeats two or three times.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.620
Maybe even four or five times.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.620
It's just goes around.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.310
It's almost like the person must have some
kind of a superhighway built in.

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.630
I'm not sure because there's no connection
from here like this to here.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.410
It's not a typical trunk connection.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:20.540
Either they go this way or they go this way.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.380
But there it goes.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.020
It just dances around.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.859
And it's great 'cause they hear words.

00:57:26.859 --> 00:57:32.000
They're going to do some logical evaluation
of those words.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.730
They're gonna weigh what the belief is about
those, or maybe how it compares to facts they've

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:37.730
remembered.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.630
And then, they do explanation and decision.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:42.000
Very fast.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.550
The two types that showed this consistently
were ENFJ and ENTJ, which are both known to

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:49.240
be very in charge social style.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:57.480
ENFJ being more of an emotional warm and fuzzy
in charge--still in charge, mind you.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.040
ENTJ being that's they get right to it and
implement.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.080
And consistently, they have this superhighway
built in.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.490
So, it's like a freeway with no off ramps.

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.770
Now what does that mean though when they're
presented with new information that doesn't

00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:12.910
fit with this convenient circuit?

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:16.730
It's like you want to stop at that town, but
there's no off ramp from here to the town.

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:20.980
What do you do?

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.980
Surprise.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:28.550
It highlights that we have trade-offs when
our brain is developing that we specialize

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:33.270
in some ways invariably and therefore, there's
going to be some side effects that come from

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:34.270
those.

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:37.790
Not just regions we don't use, but side effects.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.790
This is the last brain pattern we'll look
at.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:42.180
I call this the Christmas tree.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:47.030
And how it looks on the screen, it's not static
like this is actually keeps moving back and

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:51.849
forth and up and down like the lights on a
Christmas tree, except that each light can

00:58:51.849 --> 00:58:53.170
actually be a different color.

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:57.730
So, this is just one moment in time and then
the next moment, this could be black.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:59.660
And this one will be red.

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.660
And this one will be blue.

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.770
And it just keeps changing all the time.

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:07.380
And I saw this with subjects.

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:14.490
There's a few types who show this quite a
bit, almost like a default pattern.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:17.590
For other people who would really become active
when I would give them input.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:23.510
So, I could say to all of you, I could ask
you please visualize a cat and a dog.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.931
And most people will show some auditory as
they think about those words.

00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:31.730
And probably a fair amount of visual and maybe
some memory activity.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.070
Memory is actually deeper in the mid-brain.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:37.760
So, sometimes the memory doesn't show up at
all.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.490
For these folks, though, if I say cat and
dog, even if I ask them specifically, please

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:47.650
visualize a cat and a dog, it could light
up a whole bunch of things.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:50.570
They could be memories of the cat and the
dog they had before.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.630
Oh, it's raining cats and dogs.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:58.380
Let's see, I've been to many presentations
before and some of them are dog presentations

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.359
and some of them are cat presentations.

01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:02.200
Not literally, but in terms of their style.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.310
Some people are dog people.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:06.220
Not just they own dogs, they're like dogs
in a way.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.910
That's what people are like cats.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.531
And so, there's all of these metaphors and
ideas that can come in.

01:00:10.531 --> 01:00:19.369
And when I give them word play tests, things
like "I know this gal and she married a rock."

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:22.460
Immediately, there are two possible meanings
to that.

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.810
The literal meaning.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.369
They're walking down the aisle and she has
a rock with her, preferably like on a silver

01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:28.670
platter or something.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.280
That's the imaginative answer.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.520
And then there's somebody, she married someone
who's very stoic and quiet and so on.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.070
And so, they're really quick with those.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.830
They think of a lot of them.

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:45.619
They don't necessarily give the answers right
away quickly because what happens with those

01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:51.490
folks is I'll give them something interesting,
like she married a rock or--.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.120
If I said "desktop computer" and use that
in a sentence.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.530
Most people can say, "I went to my office
and I cleaned my desktop computer or I turned

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.530
it on."

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:00.530
And I say, "OK, that's great.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:01.530
How about underwear computer?

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.530
Use that in a sentence."

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.950
Most of us if we work at it, we can think
of something.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:07.940
Some students will say to me, "Oh, that's
not a real thing."

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.490
They refuse to do the task.

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:11.720
Others are gonna be like, "Hmm.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.900
Underwear computer."

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.880
And then they just think, "I have an underwear--.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.750
Dario has given me the phrase underwear computer."

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.750
[laughter]

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.950
I mean, you used it in a sentence, but that
doesn't really count.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:27.671
For a few students, the ones who show this
pattern, they actually think of like, ten

01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:28.960
different answers at once.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.320
And then it's really hard for them to pick
which one.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.150
They're like, "Can you give me some time to
give you all things I just thought of?"

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:38.580
And then in that time that they said their
brain actually produced like ten more things.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.770
And they really can keep on giving those analogies
quick, quick.

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.990
And so, that really, there's this wonderful
process called "trans contextual thinking."

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:52.190
The ability to see patterns and relationships
in one situation and match those to many other

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.760
seemingly very different situations, but where
that context still holds.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.570
So one of my favorite activities is that they
do these little tasks.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:03.060
And these are very similar.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.280
Oh, here's a much better choice.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
OK.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.650
So we see these two here.

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:12.790
And just for the purpose of demonstration,
which one would you like to date?

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:13.790
[laughter]

01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.790
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: This one.

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:18.090
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: This one here and why is that?

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:19.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's taller.

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:20.340
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: It's taller.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340
OK.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340
Ahh, got it.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340
OK.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.700
So by the way, good sign that you're using
trans contextual thinking is that people smile

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.520
and/or laugh.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.510
That's like external evidence of what's going
on.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.510
And that's what we just did.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:37.240
You took it from one context, a set of relationships
about being tall or shorter, fat or thinner,

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.930
different kind of markers or colors and map
those on a completely different situation.

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:44.359
You think it's useful for creativity?

01:02:44.359 --> 01:02:48.180
Tremendously so, to be able to analogize from
one kind of situation--.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.490
Say, "Hey, is there anything to learn?"

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.490
There might be nothing.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:54.870
Just 'cause the relationships match over pretty
well, doesn't mean that they match smartly.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:03:00.400
We can compare the atom to the solar system,
but they work a little bit differently.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400
10:05.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400
OK.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.960
It says 57 minutes here.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.090
Is that also, is that on track with it?

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:08.090
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yes.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:09.090
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: OK.

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:10.550
So just to summarize some things that I found.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:13.980
Various regions do similar tasks for all of
us who are right-handed.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.580
And you're like, "Well, what if I'm left-handed?"

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580
Interesting question.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.290
How many lefties do we have?

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:25.220
Oh, we have a deficit of lefties statistically.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.560
That's interesting.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.660
And one of them I brought with me.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.660
[laughter]

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:36.400
Well, you sir, have a 50 percent chance of
just being the mirror image of a righty in

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.580
terms of your brain organization.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.400
Otherwise, it works the same.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.140
You also have a 50 percent chance that your
brain has an arbitrary organizational pattern.

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:49.520
You could have regions that are next door
neighbors that nobody else has as neighbors.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.820
Which could make you a really unique or special
thinker.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.820
[laughter]

01:03:54.820 --> 01:04:01.570
Well, apparently Google hired you, so it sounds
like you're more in the unique creative category.

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:02.570
Being engaged.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:06.789
Oh, but people vary greatly in how much stimulus
is needed to engage a region.

01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:11.089
And engage means being competent and/or motivated.

01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:15.960
There are whole brain patterns, such as being
in the zone--that solid blue--that comes from

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.030
creativity.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:18.210
It could also be though.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:22.070
It doesn't have to be creativity because we
saw with some personality types that this

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:28.060
seems to clearly be related to, or at least
matches with, correlates to their personality,

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.460
their Myers-Briggs type.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.740
And there's also the Christmas tree pattern.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.560
There are many other patterns that happen,
too.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.100
There's one called the tennis hop.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:42.320
For those of you who are attending the session
after this one, the coaching and learning

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.830
techniques, will talk about the tennis hops
and so on.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:51.230
And personality type, mainly a Carl Jung's
eight functions model, correlates to brain

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.230
activity.

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:56.010
Now, you've probably heard of Myers-Briggs,
but what you may not realize is that Myers-Briggs

01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:03.760
is an assessment that was created to get at
Carl Jung's eight functions model.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.369
Carl Jung was an Austrian psychiatrist and
he was a student.

01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:14.280
He was one of the two or three principle students
of Freud.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280
And he left Freud.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.020
He broke away from him and was very much interested
not only in culture and symbology and the

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.760
collective unconscious in terms of introversion,
extroversion, and having a complex and a dark

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.450
side and a shadow--all of those come from
Jung.

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:31.440
Our pop psychology is filled with Jungian
concepts.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:37.490
But he postulated that there were eight mental
functions.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:43.890
And he meant functions for those math folks,
like a math function, which is a set of relationships

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.310
and that's what he meant by function.

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:50.140
We have these eight mental functions, which
are now also called cognitive process or what

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.140
not.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.220
And he really proposed that people have all
of them.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:01.420
We use all of them, but we definitely have
a strong preference for one and usually two

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.890
or three to cover all the bases of what's
needed.

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:11.100
And I have found it's, if I just use Myers-Briggs,
the instrument, I would not have found all

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:16.460
the correlations I did because I really went
back to what it was originally trying to assess,

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.060
which are these eight functions.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.950
And that is where I saw all the beautiful
correlations that went with it.

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:27.109
And that is where the excitement is.

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.740
And we can actually skip to the last slide.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.860
Oh, I just wanted to say here, there's one
more slide before the end.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.300
Individual uniqueness is still there.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.680
So let's say, are there any other.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.680
We have one ENFP.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.320
Do we have any other ENFPs in the room?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
Anyone know?

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320
You might not know.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.660
But you probably know some ENFPs.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.950
What's the chance that you are going to have
almost identical brain activity to them?

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.920
It's that little slice up there.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
That's your percent chance.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.660
It's like three percent.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:02.200
However, there's a huge percentage chance,
50 percent, something over 50 percent that

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.580
you'll have mostly the same activity.

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.130
It turns out to be like 80 percent.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.820
You'll have 80 percent of your brain activity
in common.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:14.960
You also have a big chunk, say 35 percent
chance, that you will have half of your brain

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.260
activity in common.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.940
And then, this sliver here, up here with the
purple, which I forget what percentage that

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.940
is.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.300
You all can add up and find the difference
off of a hundred percent.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.880
And that's a chance you only have somewhat
similar.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.940
So, by the way, that's much better than if
we just compare any two people randomly in

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940
the population.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:38.250
So, like EFPN, ESTP, the chance that you'll
have almost identical or mostly similar brain

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.360
activity is like almost nothing.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.650
It's very small.

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:45.570
So, really good validation in terms of does
type actually point personality type point

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.690
to something, it does.

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:53.450
But it is not an assurance because you can
have two ENFPs say, and they might have quite

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:54.750
different brain activity.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:59.090
Now, you'll still show the Christmas tree,
which is well-associated with all the types

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:00.780
with N and P in their code.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.680
But beyond that, there might be some big differences.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.720
So, individuality still matters quite a bit.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.940
And I think that feels natural to all of us.

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.090
We're not surprised to hear that.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:14.869
And that’s a picture of the brain from the
side.

01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:16.000
And that's the end.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.979
Thank you.

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:21.839
[applause]

01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:25.889
So now is opportunity for Q&amp;A.

01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:30.619
And we did skip a few slides, so I probably
may have some resources for folks as they

01:08:30.619 --> 01:08:31.650
answer questions.

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:33.019
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Thank you Dario.

01:08:33.019 --> 01:08:37.150
We'll take some questions here from the audience
in Mountain View and also if we have any questions

01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:38.259
from VC sites.

01:08:38.259 --> 01:08:44.849
Go ahead and ping Nedi Sharma, nsharma, if
you'd like to ask your question.

01:08:44.849 --> 01:08:46.750
Any questions here in Mountain View?

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.329
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: I was curious
what your studies show and what your thoughts

01:08:48.329 --> 01:08:58.579
are in terms of how these personality types
interact, if that shows up in the brain activity

01:08:58.579 --> 01:09:00.372
and how that shows up.

01:09:00.372 --> 01:09:04.249
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: So, what is it that we see
when people interact with each other?

01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:09.179
I have never looked at two people's brains
at the same time as they interacted, but I

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:13.739
do frequently look at what's going on as they
interact with one other person, either around

01:09:13.739 --> 01:09:14.739
an activity.

01:09:14.739 --> 01:09:19.609
One thing I do is I give them eight tarot
cards and they have to create a story together,

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:23.409
or they're engaging in mock speed dating or
something like that.

01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:26.589
Playing a competitive game, tossing balls.

01:09:26.589 --> 01:09:30.769
It seems some of it is driven by a feeling
of relationship with the other person.

01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:35.289
So, in the speed dating example, where it's
almost the task and the relationship to the

01:09:35.289 --> 01:09:39.900
person match with each other.

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:47.479
That you're going to see brain activity liking,
disliking, and so on.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:51.219
It's something like the ball toss, what you
really see is the tossing of the ball back

01:09:51.219 --> 01:09:53.650
and forth and so on.

01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:54.650
And I don't know.

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:58.389
Just as a brief break, Yosha, if you want
to help them out.

01:09:58.389 --> 01:09:59.900
Yeah.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.230
So, it seems like it's more task-oriented.

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:08.800
And that makes sense for the neocortex.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.239
As we look a little bit deeper into the mid-brain,
I suspect it would be quite different, but

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:15.380
the EEG doesn't reach that far down there.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:21.119
And when the task is socializing, that's when
we see a lot of the activity.

01:10:21.119 --> 01:10:22.119
That's relevant . Yes.

01:10:22.119 --> 01:10:25.190
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: You talked a little
bit about motivation as being one of the things

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:28.809
that lights up at certain parts of the brain.

01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:33.810
Did you look at external motivation, or is
it just assuming an internal motivation?

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:36.979
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: I do believe external motivation.

01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:37.979
Oh, right.

01:10:37.979 --> 01:10:38.979
Right.

01:10:38.979 --> 01:10:43.159
So, the question is, in terms of motivation
and competence , the sense of competence primarily

01:10:43.159 --> 01:10:44.679
comes from the inside.

01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:48.659
Motivation can come from the inside or there
can be peer pressure or social influence and

01:10:48.659 --> 01:10:51.340
guidance to help that come from the outside.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:57.340
There's a region back here, T5, which is really
strongly responsible for helping us respond

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.739
to social feedback from others.

01:10:59.739 --> 01:11:03.909
And the more active that region was it seemed
like the more the person was driven to do

01:11:03.909 --> 01:11:09.250
behaviors based upon looks that they got from
other people, verbal feedback they got from

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:10.250
others.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:13.580
In contrast, they had much more activity in
this region, which is actually diametrically

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.580
opposite.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:18.389
So, this region here, but almost no activity
on this side.

01:11:18.389 --> 01:11:22.179
It seemed like no matter what we did, the
person might notice the feedback, but they

01:11:22.179 --> 01:11:24.459
have no interest in responding to it.

01:11:24.459 --> 01:11:32.690
In fact, it might even show some activity
here when they're curious what others are

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:33.690
thinking.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.269
But once they hear the feedback, actually,
the activity goes away.

01:11:38.269 --> 01:11:39.850
And they don't respond to it.

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:46.449
So, a good example is I'm in a fiction writing
group and there's a woman with INFP preferences.

01:11:46.449 --> 01:11:47.449
And I would predict.

01:11:47.449 --> 01:11:50.360
She would have a lot of activity here and
a little bit here.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.219
So, she's not really big on social feedback.

01:11:53.219 --> 01:11:57.110
And she brings her stories in and we give
her comments and she never incorporates the

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:58.110
comments.

01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:00.600
But she's always asking for comments.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.540
And it's not just to be nice.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.630
And she said one time, she explained, "I'm
just trying to confirm what I think your feedback

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:08.900
is going to be."

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:14.739
But unless it's like a missing period or something,
she doesn't actually make the change.

01:12:14.739 --> 01:12:18.150
And so, that's an example where I think the
motivation in her case really comes from the

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:19.310
inside.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:23.699
But for others, I've seen a couple of subjects
where it's just like, it's almost like they

01:12:23.699 --> 01:12:27.119
have like a hundred buttons on the outside
and you can just say or do things and they

01:12:27.119 --> 01:12:29.680
just like, keep following for the feedback
whatever you do.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.429
I mean, amazing sometimes, I think I'm not
even giving them feedback, but if I just glance

01:12:34.429 --> 01:12:36.360
this way, all of a sudden they like--.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360
I had one kid.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.650
He had his feet on the table.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.909
And I didn't even turn my head.

01:12:40.909 --> 01:12:44.479
I just looked this way and I noticed it, and
I don't care actually.

01:12:44.479 --> 01:12:46.920
And all of a sudden he's like, "Oh, I have
to put my feet down and this and that."

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.020
He was like hyper attentive to that external
feedback.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020
Great question.

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.020
Yes.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.079
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Have you noticed
any cultural differences as you, with the

01:12:57.079 --> 01:12:58.079
subjects that you have?

01:12:58.079 --> 01:13:03.389
Like, people who are raised more with a language
system that's more symbolic as opposed to

01:13:03.389 --> 01:13:04.389
alphabetic?

01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:12.079
And how that's played into brain area reactions
[fades away]

01:13:12.079 --> 01:13:14.469
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: Great question.

01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:19.320
So, have I noticed some differences in brain
activity based upon cultural background?

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:26.809
For example, if a person was raised learning
Kanji or the symbolic writing system as opposed

01:13:26.809 --> 01:13:32.150
to the simplified alphabetic system that we
use in English.

01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:33.150
The answer is yes.

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:39.630
And in fact, I really wanted to explore cultural
differences, so I selected three, well, two

01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:43.179
primarily, but I would allow some other students
to come in, too.

01:13:43.179 --> 01:13:50.409
Japanese exchange students and students who
were first generation or Persian or Middle

01:13:50.409 --> 01:13:51.409
Eastern immigrant.

01:13:51.409 --> 01:13:56.440
So, mainly Persian, but there were some Lebanese
and so on.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.139
And tried to keep it to that.

01:13:58.139 --> 01:14:04.550
What I found was that in activities that are
more learned, for example, performing mathematics.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:05.550
And I would ask them--.

01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:09.940
They have an interview sheet as they come
in and I ask them to do some sample math problems

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.210
and reflect on that.

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:17.249
And let me know what kind of math methods,
if they remember, how is it that they learned

01:14:17.249 --> 01:14:18.289
math.

01:14:18.289 --> 01:14:22.499
And it was really fascinating to see the differences
in brain activity that reflected--.

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:26.050
I could understand in terms of personality,
but this also seemed clearly related to the

01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:28.199
method that they learned with math.

01:14:28.199 --> 01:14:31.110
And a great example--the Japanese students.

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:32.959
Incredibly efficient brain activity.

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:33.959
And these were all students.

01:14:33.959 --> 01:14:36.980
I made sure to pick ones for the math when
I do the comparison that were all students

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.099
who would use math as part of their majors.

01:14:40.099 --> 01:14:42.019
Incredibly efficient brain activity.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:46.770
Just like one perfect region, the P3 region,
which educators would hope would be like,

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:54.159
the region for simpler mathematics as opposed
to over here, P4, for more spatial and multivariant

01:14:54.159 --> 01:14:55.709
mathematics.

01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:57.310
And no other regions really active.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:58.989
So, very fast, efficient.

01:14:58.989 --> 01:15:03.380
You wanna be using your brain at maximum capacity
when you're doing math problems if that's

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.239
gonna be your job doing a lot it.

01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:08.320
In contrast, I had a student raised in--.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:15.350
A Middle Eastern student who had the French
method of learning math, which is a lot about

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:16.690
sounding out and repeating.

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.900
So, he showed a lot of auditory activity.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:25.360
The hassle is, though, the auditory areas
also keep track of their hearing in the physical

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.010
environment.

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:31.449
So he had difficulty doing the math problems
because there was noise in the environment.

01:15:31.449 --> 01:15:36.810
And he expressed he needed to work alone in
a really quiet space in order to do math.

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:41.860
I had a student finally who came from Northern
California and learned in one of the new math

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.310
systems where students are allowed to discover
principles for themselves and so on.

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:48.829
And she worked quickly and she got all the
problems right.

01:15:48.829 --> 01:15:53.050
And she used well over half her brain to do
it.

01:15:53.050 --> 01:16:01.090
And unfortunately, the half that she used
didn't involve any of the key reasoning centers.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.090
And as she described it.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.670
She said, "I'm trying to remember what we
did and remember the formulas.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:09.550
And I know I was visualizing the problem and
then I was wondering if I was taking too long."

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:13.050
And so, she ended up using everything that
would be part of an experiential process.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:17.229
And apparently, the new math methods for imparting
principles didn't actually impart any principles

01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:22.550
to her, which contradicted her personality
type preference, too.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:27.140
Which I thought, "Well, if it didn't work
for her, then what does that mean?"

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.139
At least for the school that she attended
or to the teachers she had.

01:16:30.139 --> 01:16:32.199
So, it does seem there's some elements around
that.

01:16:32.199 --> 01:16:36.739
I also thought it was interesting when I compared
INFPs since I had seven of them and could

01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:38.280
look at their ethnic background.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:43.729
But the one who was the perfect listener--in
every situation, she was like, "What?

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:44.729
You're talking?

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:45.829
I'm gonna listen with my whole brain."

01:16:45.829 --> 01:16:48.790
Was the Japanese INFP.

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.630
And I know, having lived in Japan and speaking
Japanese.

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:52.820
It's really interesting with the grammar.

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:56.900
You have to wait until the end of the sentence
to know what the verb is.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.709
And essentially, the most important part.

01:16:58.709 --> 01:17:01.650
So you really need to be a good listener in
Japanese.

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:05.820
And then, she was female, which in Japanese
society would push it even further.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.030
She's a really great listener.

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:10.750
INFP are already stereotyped as listeners
to begin with.

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:12.349
And I'm expecting that from the brain activity.

01:17:12.349 --> 01:17:14.780
And she was like, super-listener.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:18.550
And just really listened to everyone actively.

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:23.999
She might want to consider if she wants to
keep doing that all of her life.

01:17:23.999 --> 01:17:26.920
Now that she's learned this, it's up to her
what she does with that knowledge.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:33.829
Whereas, I had an INFP who was very, like,
European background, grew up in America and

01:17:33.829 --> 01:17:34.829
so on.

01:17:34.829 --> 01:17:36.460
And he did listening, but not nearly as much.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:40.039
And those are specific students, but if I
put them all along a spectrum I can see that

01:17:40.039 --> 01:17:46.260
there's definitely, where the Persian INFP
probably did the least listening of the seven

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:47.539
that were there.

01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:48.539
Yeah.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.539
Yes.

01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:54.190
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: I was wondering
about something that you said earlier.

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:58.719
I was wondering in a lot of what you described
as correlation of these personality types

01:17:58.719 --> 01:18:05.659
to brain activity, is there anything that
you would suggest is translatable to our lives

01:18:05.659 --> 01:18:07.880
in terms of how to cause changes?

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.199
For example, how one personality type, how
would that interact with another or might

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:21.479
become a better listener by engaging brain
activity in a neighboring region or something

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:22.479
like that?

01:18:22.479 --> 01:18:26.229
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: So, the question is, are there
ways to take this information we've learned

01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:31.309
about the brain and translate into practical
applications in our everyday lives?

01:18:31.309 --> 01:18:36.579
And some examples would be having a better
idea of how to interact with somebody else.

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:43.540
Can we actually improve, perhaps, a particular
ability or develop particular skill around

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.540
something.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.219
I can think of three options right off.

01:18:47.219 --> 01:18:52.790
One is that you go to Australia and you do
their trans cranial stimulation.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:53.790
You participate in that.

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:57.940
So, they turn off certain regions of the brain
by stimulating them or turn on other regions.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.079
And they've really had some nice success in
terms of shifting people's activity.

01:19:02.079 --> 01:19:05.579
Many of us, apparently, are really good artists
and we don't know it.

01:19:05.579 --> 01:19:10.829
And the trick is to actually turn off regions
in the left frontal areas and especially in

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.460
this region right around here.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.909
And all of a sudden, for two or three or maybe
four hours, we're gonna have significantly

01:19:15.909 --> 01:19:17.929
better drawing ability.

01:19:17.929 --> 01:19:21.210
Because apparently, there are signals from
here that are sent out to block signals from

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:22.340
the other hemisphere.

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.170
So, that's an example where we've seen some
nice stuff.

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:29.139
That's a very high-tech end, but maybe Google
could arrange that for you.

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:30.219
[laughter]

01:19:30.219 --> 01:19:33.909
Another is that after this session there's
a break.

01:19:33.909 --> 01:19:39.550
And then there's a human resources, another
hour and a half activity workshop.

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:43.909
And that's when we'll talk about actually
what are those coaching tips and techniques

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:44.959
for those eight types.

01:19:44.959 --> 01:19:46.590
And there really are a lot that come out of
it.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:47.849
Much more than I've--.

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:52.410
I mentioned personality types without saying
for this for this for that for that.

01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:56.929
'Cause personality type, we would say, some
colleagues have asked me, "OK, now that you've

01:19:56.929 --> 01:20:01.540
gotten this point, isn't personality type
like Myers-Briggs just nice scaffolding to

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540
problem-solving?

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.170
And now that you figured out what the brain
does, you can throw it away."

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:06.219
And I said, "No."

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:07.810
Because I'm not done yet.

01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:11.969
And also, most of the time we really don't
know what's going on inside a person's brain.

01:20:11.969 --> 01:20:17.300
And it turns out to be pretty good if we also
know the person's expertise skill sets.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:22.869
Those two pieces of information together can
give us a pretty good picture of what's likely

01:20:22.869 --> 01:20:23.979
to go on.

01:20:23.979 --> 01:20:26.840
And then from there, we can actually do some
interactive things.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.079
We can say maybe this is the kind of person
who needs to have windows in their office.

01:20:31.079 --> 01:20:34.769
Or, at least be able to get outside or something
like that.

01:20:34.769 --> 01:20:42.150
And my third answer is because these really
are skills, cognitive skills, as I would call

01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:45.340
them, we can't develop them instantly.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.929
But I believe with anywhere from probably
three to six months of practice, upwards of

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:54.420
three years, that we can develop particular
regions to work better, as long as we know

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:59.270
we're working activities that actually cause
the brain to function in that area.

01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:03.650
And don't allow us to rely upon other areas
to fill in.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.550
Like, we really, you understand what I'm saying?

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:07.550
That we--.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:08.729
Our natural inclination is like, "Hmm.

01:21:08.729 --> 01:21:09.830
There's a new task.

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:13.030
What familiar resources can I bring to bear
for the brain to solve it?"

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.030
No.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:17.820
We wanna design a task that forces them to
use an area they're uncomfortable with.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.670
And naturally, it'll be unpleasant at first.

01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:27.699
But I can certainly say now and then rewinding
some 20 odd years ago, that my region F7,

01:21:27.699 --> 01:21:30.159
it must surely work much better than it did
before.

01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:31.159
I don't know.

01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:32.280
I didn't have it done before.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.619
But I'm thinking it works a lot better now.

01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:37.739
And that had to do with specific trainings
that I got and so on.

01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:40.300
And over many years.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.170
So probably going to Australia would be the
easiest one.

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:44.659
But I think all of them.

01:21:44.659 --> 01:21:47.170
You can do the workshop today and that's a
good start.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.929
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We have time for one more
question and then--.

01:21:49.929 --> 01:21:51.189
Do you have a question?

01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:54.959
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: You can learn
a lot about yourself by actually going and

01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:56.139
doing this study.

01:21:56.139 --> 01:22:03.510
Is there a way, is the study still going on?

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:08.099
&gt;&gt;Dario Nardi: I will agree with you that
yes, you can learn a lot from doing this.

01:22:08.099 --> 01:22:13.499
In fact, the last two people I did--both students--were
a couple.

01:22:13.499 --> 01:22:18.040
And they gave permission for the other person,
their partner, to watch as they did it.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.920
Now, they'd been going together for a while,
so they weren't completely surprised.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.380
But it did confirm a lot of things that they
sort of felt the case.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:30.880
One of the jokes is she's the one who wears
the pants in the relationship.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.489
He's the one who listens.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:36.989
His preferences are INFP and we really saw,
yes, he's the listener.

01:22:36.989 --> 01:22:41.099
There were also some really funny moments.

01:22:41.099 --> 01:22:44.750
One of the things I do with the virtual dating
is they see pictures of potential dates.

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:46.809
So men and women that are their age.

01:22:46.809 --> 01:22:48.249
Young men, young women.

01:22:48.249 --> 01:22:50.639
And I asked them to pick.

01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:53.160
They have the virtual experience, but towards
the end they can pick, they narrow it down

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.880
to three and down to one.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.650
All of the females and all of the males, they
picked the same people.

01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:00.030
So, all of the males picked the same girl
at the end.

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:04.039
And all of the females picked the same guy,
regardless of personality type or whatever.

01:23:04.039 --> 01:23:07.479
All of the females picked the guy who's wearing
the football jersey and has blonde hair.

01:23:07.479 --> 01:23:08.479
I'm not kidding.

01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:10.469
Like, that really is.

01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:13.920
All of the guys picked the blonds who's on
the beach in a bikini and has really great

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.710
abs.

01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:22.989
And this couple, the guy thought that his
girlfriend would select in the gallery of

01:23:22.989 --> 01:23:27.469
options, would select the guy that looked
like him.

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:30.280
And that guy didn't even make it to the top
three.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.280
[laughter]

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.619
Much less the top one.

01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:37.480
And he seemed a little surprised and disconcerted
by that.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.519
I think from her point of view that wasn't
why she was with him.

01:23:40.519 --> 01:23:46.389
And I think that's a great example of looking
at, I would say it's this.

01:23:46.389 --> 01:23:52.320
Because who we like and dislike, it's an instant,
sexual response, is coming from the limbic

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320
system.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.360
I mean, we see things and we smell things
and so on and it comes from there.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.439
But the neocortex is designed to override
that, or at least give us more options in

01:24:00.439 --> 01:24:02.179
decision-making.

01:24:02.179 --> 01:24:06.579
And so, it's not really surprising that she
would have an immediate reaction on one level

01:24:06.579 --> 01:24:10.650
and yet for a long-term partner would say,
"No, I want somebody else."

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:11.650
And make that sensible.

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.679
In fact, she even felt that the football player
probably not make a good mate.

01:24:14.679 --> 01:24:17.349
I mean, that was part of the questioning.

01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:22.429
But allowing people to see that is tremendously
illuminating.

01:24:22.429 --> 01:24:27.769
I mean, the biggest and the most fun, is voyeuristic
in those two or three hours.

01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:32.579
I get to know the person at a level that would
probably take months, or even potentially

01:24:32.579 --> 01:24:37.940
years, if I didn't live with them to know,
to figure out their responsiveness and so

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.940
on.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.340
So, I hope for the day that more people will
be able to do this.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.929
In terms of is this still going on or not?

01:24:44.929 --> 01:24:46.780
I'm doing some minor research.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.130
I want to fill out my subject set.

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:54.710
And then, my focus, my desire is to actually
create wireless technology that a person can

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:59.369
wear the cap throughout their working day
and then there'll be a computer program that

01:24:59.369 --> 01:25:03.389
automatically analyzes what's going on so
that I can have a lot more subjects and not

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:06.070
be tied down with it.

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:10.690
I have one possible funding source, but I'm
looking to move to that level first before

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:11.690
doing more.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.760
'Cause people naturally ask, "What about my
brain?"

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.920
And I'm working on that.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.940
Yes.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:20.940
Thank you.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.940
I appreciate the invitation.

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:21.941
[applause]
