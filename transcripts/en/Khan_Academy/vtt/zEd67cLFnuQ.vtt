00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.851
- [Voiceover] What I hope
to do in this fraction is

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:04.824
be able to rewrite the fraction 8/10

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:08.225
as being something over 100.

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:10.222
So I could put a question mark here.

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:12.347
I could put a star over here.

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.321
Star over 100.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.749
And what I care about is figure out

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.595
what is this star equal to.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:22.552
Eight over 10 is equal to what over 100?

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.756
And I encourage you to pause
the video to think about it.

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.544
Now to help us work through this

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:32.420
I have set up a little diagram,
or actually two diagrams

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.323
to think about what 8/10 looks like.

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:36.914
And then I have the same whole,

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:38.992
instead of being split into /10,

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.989
I have it split up in /200.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.485
I have it spit up to 100 equal sections.

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:44.820
And we just have to figure out

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.154
how many of these 100 equal sections

00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:51.519
are equivalent to the eight
out of the 10 equal sections

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.017
right over here.

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:55.025
So lets think about that a little bit.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.556
So once again, we have
10 equal sections here.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.784
And we have colored in
one, let me mark'em all.

00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:04.139
If we've colored in one, two, three, four,

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:07.390
five, six, seven, eight of them.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.685
This diagram, this
picture, represents 8/10.

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:14.356
10 equal sections I have
colored in eight of them.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.601
Now how do I do that if
I'm talking about /100.

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.056
Well it's the same whole right over here.

00:01:20.056 --> 00:01:23.652
Now if I want to fill up the
same amount of that whole,

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:26.533
so let me get a little paint brush here.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:31.229
So it would the the equivalent of 1/10

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.709
would be filling in 10/100.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.823
So that's 10/100 right over there.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:38.516
Then 2/10 or that second /10,

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.606
every time I fill in a
/10, that's the same thing

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.218
as filling in 10/100.

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:45.726
Let me write that down,
cause that's interesting.

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:48.222
So we see here that 1/10

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:51.949
is equal to 10 over 100.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:53.621
Every time I fill in a /10,

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:57.823
that's 1/10 right over there.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:01:58.984
If you look at this diagram,

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.817
that's the equivalent to 10/100.

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:05.451
It's equivalent to 10 of
those 100 equal sections.

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.528
So if I wanna fill out 8/10,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:12.487
that's gonna be eight
time 10/100 or 80/100.

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.252
And lets just see that right over here.

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:17.920
So we already did 10/100, 20/100.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.158
This is gonna be 30/100.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.387
40/100.

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:26.883
50/100.

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:28.990
60/100.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.817
70/100.

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:33.687
And 80/100.

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.090
Notice I've filled in the same amount,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.284
and I can fill it in just to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:40.583
But I filled in the same amount

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:43.346
of both of these equal wholes.

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:46.748
But over here, how many of
these squares have I filled in?

00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:50.823
I have filled in 80, now
let me get my pen going.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:54.585
I have over here, I have filled in 80

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:57.174
out of my 100 squares.

00:02:57.174 --> 00:02:59.287
While over here, I filled in eight

00:02:59.287 --> 00:03:02.304
out of my 10 equal rectangles.

00:03:02.874 --> 00:03:04.453
But they're the same amount of area.

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:06.694
They're the same fraction of the whole.

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:09.492
So eight over 10 is going
to be the same thing

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:13.521
as 80 over 100. You see
it's the exact same thing.

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.784
We've just divided the
one on the right here

00:03:15.784 --> 00:03:18.315
into 10 times as many sections.

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:20.417
And you can even see it mathematically.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:23.726
Then look, if we divided into
10 times as many sections.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.593
So, if we multiply a denominator by 10

00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:28.254
to go from 10 to 100.

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:31.121
Well that means that each of
this eight sections in this one

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.488
are going to represent 10
times as many in this one.

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:36.915
So we would say, well,
eight is going to represent

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.177
10 times as many of the /100.

00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:42.116
So eight times 10 is 80.

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:44.391
10 times 10 is 100.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.120
8/10 is the same thing as 80/100.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.949
And in general, if you're
trying to rewrite a fraction

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.087
and not change its value,

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:54.748
so you want an equivalent fraction,

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:57.325
as long as you multiply the denominator,

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.217
as long as you multiply the numerator

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:01.748
and the denominator by the same thing,

00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:05.092
you will not be changing
the value of the fraction.

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:07.739
It's also true if you divide the numerator

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.388
and the denominator by the same thing.

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:12.546
You also will not be changing
the value of the fraction.

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.693
In this case we have
multiply both the numerator

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:16.551
and the denominator by 10.

00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:18.566
And you see why we did it.
