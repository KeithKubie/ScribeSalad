00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.870
well one of the great things about using

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:05.880
well one of the great things about using
 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.610
well one of the great things about using
online learning resources especially

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
online learning resources especially
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.280
online learning resources especially
with the oli modules as in your course

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
with the oli modules as in your course
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.930
with the oli modules as in your course
is that we have a way to instrument or

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940
is that we have a way to instrument or
 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.029
is that we have a way to instrument or
collect data on students as they're

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
collect data on students as they're
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.880
collect data on students as they're
learning so we can go to look at the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
learning so we can go to look at the
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.610
learning so we can go to look at the
data online to see what your students

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620
data online to see what your students
 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.490
data online to see what your students
have how they've performed what they've

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
have how they've performed what they've
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.860
have how they've performed what they've
done and remember we also created a

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870
done and remember we also created a
 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.040
done and remember we also created a
pretest and a post-test so that we can

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
pretest and a post-test so that we can
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350
pretest and a post-test so that we can
compare students performance before they

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
compare students performance before they
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750
compare students performance before they
used your modules to their performance

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
used your modules to their performance
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540
used your modules to their performance
after they use the modules this can be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
after they use the modules this can be
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040
after they use the modules this can be
really helpful because we can see how

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
really helpful because we can see how
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500
really helpful because we can see how
they improved we can also see the areas

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
they improved we can also see the areas
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720
they improved we can also see the areas
where they still could use some more

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
where they still could use some more
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.660
where they still could use some more
support and that can help us refine the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
support and that can help us refine the
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670
support and that can help us refine the
module of themselves right I'm glad you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
module of themselves right I'm glad you
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.440
module of themselves right I'm glad you
thought of setting up that pretest

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450
thought of setting up that pretest
 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.500
thought of setting up that pretest
because is it you know if I only told

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
because is it you know if I only told
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930
because is it you know if I only told
using traditional methods I wouldn't

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
using traditional methods I wouldn't
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420
using traditional methods I wouldn't
have remembered to set up that pretest

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
have remembered to set up that pretest
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580
have remembered to set up that pretest
okay great well maybe we should take a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
okay great well maybe we should take a
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.549
okay great well maybe we should take a
look at your data so here is the post

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
look at your data so here is the post
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.160
look at your data so here is the post
test data so you can see the number of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
test data so you can see the number of
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620
test data so you can see the number of
students who completed it in the last

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
students who completed it in the last
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440
students who completed it in the last
version of this course was used and this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
version of this course was used and this
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.219
version of this course was used and this
part here shows the percent of students

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
part here shows the percent of students
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.889
part here shows the percent of students
getting each question correct so you can

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899
getting each question correct so you can
 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.050
getting each question correct so you can
really see on some of the items they did

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
really see on some of the items they did
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.879
really see on some of the items they did
really well yes but there are a few

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889
really well yes but there are a few
 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.249
really well yes but there are a few
items where students performance was not

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
items where students performance was not
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.999
items where students performance was not
so good so sometimes what is a pretty

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
so good so sometimes what is a pretty
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940
so good so sometimes what is a pretty
efficient strategy is to first target

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
efficient strategy is to first target
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.309
efficient strategy is to first target
the questions where students performance

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319
the questions where students performance
 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.370
the questions where students performance
was not so high and see if you based on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
was not so high and see if you based on
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719
was not so high and see if you based on
your experience teaching and your

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
your experience teaching and your
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999
your experience teaching and your
knowledge of the subject matter can

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
knowledge of the subject matter can
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.519
knowledge of the subject matter can
identify what might be going on if there

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529
identify what might be going on if there
 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.800
identify what might be going on if there
was a misconception or if maybe the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
was a misconception or if maybe the
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.319
was a misconception or if maybe the
material was confusing or if there's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
material was confusing or if there's
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.429
material was confusing or if there's
something we might want to do

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
something we might want to do
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.249
something we might want to do
differently next time yeah so I think we

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
differently next time yeah so I think we
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980
differently next time yeah so I think we
can look at this question here this is a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
can look at this question here this is a
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.379
can look at this question here this is a
question that is what is the value

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:57.389
question that is what is the value
 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.319
question that is what is the value
returned by the following function

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329
returned by the following function
 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.979
returned by the following function
mm-hmm it's a common problem students

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989
mm-hmm it's a common problem students
 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.800
mm-hmm it's a common problem students
usually get confused between the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
usually get confused between the
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.490
usually get confused between the
function print and return in a return

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
function print and return in a return
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890
function print and return in a return
statement so it's actually expected I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
statement so it's actually expected I
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.290
statement so it's actually expected I
try to address this in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
try to address this in
 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.950
try to address this in
in the class but the fact that it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
in the class but the fact that it's
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.970
in the class but the fact that it's
still you know it still shows itself in

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
still you know it still shows itself in
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.330
still you know it still shows itself in
the post-test makes me think maybe we

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
the post-test makes me think maybe we
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880
the post-test makes me think maybe we
should address it even more carefully we

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
should address it even more carefully we
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.040
should address it even more carefully we
could now what we can do is we can go

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
could now what we can do is we can go
 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.260
could now what we can do is we can go
back to do you know where in the course

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
back to do you know where in the course
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390
back to do you know where in the course
this material would have been addressed

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
this material would have been addressed
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.720
this material would have been addressed
right the initial module okay so this is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
right the initial module okay so this is
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.000
right the initial module okay so this is
the module where that concept would be

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
the module where that concept would be
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250
the module where that concept would be
introduced right this learning dashboard

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
introduced right this learning dashboard
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.800
introduced right this learning dashboard
page shows students performance and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
page shows students performance and
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.720
page shows students performance and
their learning during that initial

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
their learning during that initial
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.880
their learning during that initial
exposure to that topic so maybe we can

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
exposure to that topic so maybe we can
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070
exposure to that topic so maybe we can
dig in and see is one of these more

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
dig in and see is one of these more
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.230
dig in and see is one of these more
relevant to what we just tell this may

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240
relevant to what we just tell this may
 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.110
relevant to what we just tell this may
be the part okay nice try it so this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
be the part okay nice try it so this
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.070
be the part okay nice try it so this
shows us in this area students were

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
shows us in this area students were
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.400
shows us in this area students were
answering questions about defining and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
answering questions about defining and
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.070
answering questions about defining and
using their own straight line functions

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
using their own straight line functions
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.860
using their own straight line functions
using built-in functions now the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
using built-in functions now the
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.230
using built-in functions now the
built-in functions would be most likely

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240
built-in functions would be most likely
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.320
built-in functions would be most likely
okay point so we can click on here and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330
okay point so we can click on here and
 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.130
okay point so we can click on here and
see students performance on those items

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
see students performance on those items
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.949
see students performance on those items
in the module was pretty strong right

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
in the module was pretty strong right
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.590
in the module was pretty strong right
except for on this one let's do that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
except for on this one let's do that
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.320
except for on this one let's do that
yeah let's view it in the course so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330
yeah let's view it in the course so
 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600
yeah let's view it in the course so
that's an interesting phenomenon that

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
that's an interesting phenomenon that
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.580
that's an interesting phenomenon that
when they're first learning about this

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
when they're first learning about this
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.500
when they're first learning about this
topic and they're focused on it they

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510
topic and they're focused on it they
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.660
topic and they're focused on it they
seem to be doing quite well but then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
seem to be doing quite well but then
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.390
seem to be doing quite well but then
when some time goes on right they need

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
when some time goes on right they need
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.460
when some time goes on right they need
to retain that conceptual understanding

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470
to retain that conceptual understanding
 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.250
to retain that conceptual understanding
and transfer maybe to a new situation

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260
and transfer maybe to a new situation
 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.600
and transfer maybe to a new situation
like that print function it's a common

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610
like that print function it's a common
 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.160
like that print function it's a common
challenge for students learning to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
challenge for students learning to
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.780
challenge for students learning to
retain and transfer what they've learned

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
retain and transfer what they've learned
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.660
retain and transfer what they've learned
so giving them even more practice and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
so giving them even more practice and
 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.370
so giving them even more practice and
more distributed practice might be a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380
more distributed practice might be a
 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.560
more distributed practice might be a
good strategy so I could think of

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570
good strategy so I could think of
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.790
good strategy so I could think of
injecting similar questions in other

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800
injecting similar questions in other
 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.000
injecting similar questions in other
modules yes exactly so then they learn

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
modules yes exactly so then they learn
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.040
modules yes exactly so then they learn
it here and they're doing well but then

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
it here and they're doing well but then
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.170
it here and they're doing well but then
you can come back to it and check their

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180
you can come back to it and check their
 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.320
you can come back to it and check their
understanding and help them practice it

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330
understanding and help them practice it
 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.540
understanding and help them practice it
and refine it and we could see then if

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550
and refine it and we could see then if
 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.490
and refine it and we could see then if
you make that change if the post-test

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500
you make that change if the post-test
 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.560
you make that change if the post-test
performance looks better yes let's try

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570
performance looks better yes let's try
 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.919
performance looks better yes let's try
to do that next time yeah
