00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.440
This is Radiolab. I'm Robert Krulwich, boom, run and this anchor,

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm going to curse you, dad.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.660
I'm going to ask you to just simply do this fun thing.

4
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:13.020
You know that song that we both hate? [inaudible] um, pump, pump, Burnham, um,

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.000
pump. God. It's like the moment you start that and keep going.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.180
[inaudible] there are some songs that I can stick in your head and they just

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.880
won't leave. There's somebody, of course,

8
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:30.881
who's a head who got this song somehow stuck in her head and then his songs that

9
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.660
just go away because you didn't even invite them and they stay.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.130
This is an hour on the music in our heads. Where does the songs come from?

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.690
Why do they stay a whole hour without Suzanne Vega,

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.680
thankfully on radio lab. Let me ask you a question to get us started here.

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.450
When a song gets stuck in your head,

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.630
do you have one in there right now by any chance? Oliver,

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.710
the Broadway show tune of course. What does it sound like when it's in there?

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.820
What does it sound like? Yeah, but it just think before you answered six.

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.260
What does it really sound like? Describe it. Uh, musically. Um,

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.330
well it does. Well, it's funny that you mentioned this. It,

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.320
it's doesn't actually, I don't hear any musician because it loud. No,

20
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:20.180
it's nothing. It's not loud. It's not like a location, you know, tambor?

21
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.790
No, it just has a melody. A vague foggy. Like a shadow email. Yes,

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.930
exactly. Okay. Well, so that's our starting point. You know,

23
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.350
most of us get a song in our head. It's kind of like what you described vague,

24
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.190
but there are people who when they get songs stuck in their head,

25
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:38.420
it's a whole dish. It's a whole different experience.

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.020
It is not vague. In fact, they wish it were vague. They wish it were a shadow

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.680
<v 1>and you'll know what I mean. In a second, let me introduce you to someone.</v>

28
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.260
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb,

29
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.310
little lamb always has songs running through his head everywhere that Mary went,

30
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.400
the lamb was sure to go. He's plagued by them actually.

31
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.850
Then he spoke with our producer Lulu Miller and said that that was going through

32
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:02.470
your head just now. That's right. Mary heard a little loud over and over again.

33
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.620
Yeah. Let me have you just introduce yourself really quick. Oh, I'm a,

34
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.220
My name is Leo Rang Gail and I'm uh, not young.

35
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.260
I just had my 94th birthday.

36
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.360
I've been in la since I was in the War World War II. Leah is a psychoanalyst.

37
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.400
Oh yeah. I'm still in practice.

38
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.460
We find everything that's been going on in his own head sort of intriguing from

39
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:28.120
a professional standpoint. I'm trying to think what the hell am I doing? Anyway,

40
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.520
this whole thing started for him about 12 years ago.

41
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:34.860
He had just had major heart surgery and he wakes up in his hospital bed. Oh.

42
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.930
I wake up in the ICU and almost as soon as I'm conscious outside my hospital

43
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:45.110
window, I hear music and there was this,

44
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.810
it sounded few near-real like hymns. I hear these songs.

45
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:53.700
I look out the window. I've had a rabbi is out there.

46
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.070
I say to my kids, I casually say, hey, there's a,

47
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.200
there's a rabbi out this singing.

48
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.410
<v 1>They said, what do you mean? So I said,</v>

50
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.510
there must be as rabbi school and he must be teaching young people how to be

51
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.910
rabbis. And they, the kids looked at each other

52
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.963
<v 2>the new</v>

53
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.140
<v 3>because they weren't hearing anything. But at that moment,</v>

54
00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:22.430
that didn't matter to Leo because the music was so loud and vivid to him.

55
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:25.610
So totally coming through that window that

56
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
<v 1>I dismissed them as, oh well they could have their opinion if they want.</v>

57
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.310
I didn't think anything of it.

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.060
<v 2>Uh, Duh, Duh, Duh.</v>

59
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.330
<v 1>And then the rest of the week in the hospital, uh, you know,</v>

60
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:41.430
I'm getting better and better and as I get better, the music changes.

61
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.600
I stopped being a Ma more perky and the songs,

62
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.400
the music out the window changes to Chattanooga, Choo Choo.

63
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.180
Did Dod do the chat, the new that you Chattanooga Choo Choo.

64
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.570
Did you Julie? One of the morning, two in the morning.

65
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.890
I'm waking up with these songs.

66
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.180
<v 4>They're always coming in from right outside that window.</v>

67
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.570
<v 1>Then I thought, Gee, there's a pretty energetic group there across the street.</v>

68
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.271
At this point.

69
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:15.660
Leo was beginning to suspect that something a little weird was going on,

70
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.930
but the real cool drug came when I was going to leave the hospital after a week

71
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:26.280
or so and um, this tune, I didn't know the words at first,

72
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.040
but I started to hear that that Duh,

73
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.100
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh.

74
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.830
<v 4>Because he packed up, signed out of the hospital and got into his car.</v>

75
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.880
I was reflecting. That's when it hit him. I still was hearing the song.

76
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.560
The song was still coming from outside a window, but now the scenery was moving.

77
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.010
I thought it was related to the hospital until the thing across the street.

78
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.220
Here I am in the car listening to this. Oh,

79
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.460
and that's when the lyrics appeared. Find me.

80
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.840
The words come when Johnny [inaudible] home again or Ra ra,

81
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.700
he couldn't ignore it anymore. Not only was the song following him home,

82
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.530
it's like the song was about him. He was the Johnny. The girls will cheer,

83
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.950
marching home, coming home from the hospital.

84
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.250
I realized I am listening to me.

85
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.500
I am listening to me.

86
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.070
<v 3>Okay. Is He really though?</v>

87
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.270
I mean is he really listening to anything or is he just think he's hearing

88
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:27.870
something? Well, there's nothing out there for him to hear it from the inside.

89
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:31.040
Like is this brain actually hearing music? Ah,

90
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.150
well lucky for us.

91
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.360
There's a professor in England who had the exact same question. I called him up.

92
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 5>Hello.</v>

93
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 3>Hi. Can I speak to professor Griffith please? Okay. Tim Griffith is his name.</v>

94
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.150
He is a professor of cognitive neurology at New Castle University.

95
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.691
Here's what he did.

96
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:50.640
He took 35 people who are likely who claim to be hallucinating music. Yeah.

97
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.210
And he scanned their brains. Right? Simple experiment.

98
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.940
<v 5>I just put people on a scantron and said, what are you hearing now?</v>

99
00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:59.160
What are you hearing now? When they told him, uh,

100
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.080
<v 3>there, there,</v>

101
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:04.800
I'm hearing music that that moment he would snap a picture of the rain. Right?

102
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.220
Then he took a different group of people who have no hallucinations,

103
00:06:08.221 --> 00:06:09.570
played them real music,

104
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.310
<v 5>music,</v>

105
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.980
<v 3>scan their brains. And then he compared the pictures</v>

106
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.270
<v 5>and if you look,</v>

107
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.600
<v 3>they looked virtually identical.</v>

108
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.880
<v 5>If you were to put those in front of me and say one's people hallucinating the</v>

109
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.030
other people being played, music I, I wouldn't be able to tell you,

110
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:22.864
which was weird,

111
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.920
<v 3>which tells you two things. First, this condition is real.</v>

112
00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.140
These people are not making it up, and second,

113
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.430
this goes way beyond the ordinary experience that the rest of us have where we

114
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:33.480
get a song stuck in our head.

115
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.250
These people are getting the full high Phi experience of listening to music.

116
00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:39.660
Their entire brain is lit up.

117
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.580
The music sounds so convincingly like real life music.

118
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.820
What are you to think when it suddenly appears? That's Diana Deutsch,

119
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.130
a psychologist at the University of California,

120
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:53.460
San Diego who's been collecting emails from hundreds of different people who

121
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:58.080
hallucinate music. One person described it in the following way. He said,

122
00:06:58.081 --> 00:07:03.060
imagine that you wear to a rock concert standing right by loudspeaker.

123
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.130
Well, it's louder than that.

124
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.640
<v 1>At the beginning when I didn't know what was going to happen,</v>

125
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.070
I thought it was going to take over my mind.

126
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.420
You hear that it started interfering with sleep. It's the Atchison,

127
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:18.370
Topeka and Santa Fe.

128
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.173
<v 6>Ah,</v>

129
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.380
<v 1>well night. Oh, I got mad. I used to say, stop it already.</v>

130
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.300
Stop it. Cut it out. Come on. Enough. Enough. Enough. But you're never free.

131
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.613
<v 7>Yes. Never.</v>

132
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.060
<v 1>Yes. That was the low point. I thought, I've got to get help for this.</v>

133
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.930
At what point did you bring it up with doctors? Oh, the doctors,

134
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.180
they were completely impotent. To this day. They rolled their eyes.

135
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:46.050
When I tell them about it,

136
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.920
one doctor told him that maybe it was the fillings in his teeth picking up the

137
00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:54.120
radio. Okay. I hoped it was right, but it wasn't. It continued forever.

138
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.960
Nothing he could do. It could make it stop. I don't have an off button.

139
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.130
It's like there was a jukebox in his head run by an evil Gremlin.

140
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.610
In the worst part, the Gremlin would mess with the tempo. Like,

141
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.900
<v 7>uh, okay. Uh, that are Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,</v>

142
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.890
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

143
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.660
And have the man on the flying.

144
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.070
Drippy is letting young man only the flagging speeding up, Dah, Dah, Dah,

145
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.460
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

146
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.910
That's the worst when that started to happen, I'm really getting close to panic.

147
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.130
I have the feeling that it could go at its rate and I couldn't stop.

148
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:33.100
It stands on my own.

149
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.580
It's like you're on a galloping horse and the horse runs away with you. Oh,

150
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:42.870
you guys do that. I once told that to my daughter. She said, dad,

151
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.930
why did you just instead think of the song?

152
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.163
No.

153
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.100
And I could control the tempo and instead when that galloping, I would

154
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v 3>go,</v>

155
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.950
<v 7>uh, I did, uh, uh,</v>

156
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.910
the

157
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.510
[inaudible]

158
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.860
<v 8>an immediately up, completely relaxed as well.</v>

159
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.010
<v 3>And the Gallup is</v>

160
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.760
<v 8>completely gone and I couldn't even let it come</v>

161
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.280
<v 3>back. And it would start now being, Oh God,</v>

162
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.220
<v 9>yeah, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh.</v>

163
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.523
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.160
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

165
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.050
<v 3>and that was no longer ever a problem of the tempo running away with me.</v>

166
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.920
Okay. So let's just assume Leo is not crazy.

167
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.900
I never thought I was psychotic. Never. Never. Because most people,

168
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.140
it turns out with this condition are not crazy.

169
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.570
There's nothing else wrong with them according to Diana Deutsch.

170
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.920
So then the question becomes,

171
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.430
how can a person who is otherwise sane hallucinate to such a crazy degree?

172
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.530
Well,

173
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.250
in the 60s there was a Polish psychologist named Jersey Konarski who thought

174
00:09:58.251 --> 00:09:59.560
about this and uh,

175
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.730
and he came up with a simple kind of beautiful idea based on an assumption that

176
00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:08.570
he couldn't prove yet, which was that between the ears and the brain,

177
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.250
there are some connections.

178
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:15.251
He thought just a few stray connections that run backwards brain back to ear,

179
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.100
which would allow sound to run in reverse. Now, this was just an idea.

180
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:20.840
He couldn't really test it, but many years later,

181
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.670
sure neuroscientists like Tim Griffith start to poke around in the brain.

182
00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:28.510
They start to explore and what they find is that he was right.

183
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.220
<v 5>Yes. Daily. Right. Do you look at the pathway between the years on the brain?</v>

184
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.060
Probably about 70% of the fibers don't actually go up. They go down,

185
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.470
they go the other way. Towards the end,

186
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.360
<v 3>70% go out. 70% go from the brain to the ears.</v>

187
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.200
Yeah. It's like our ears are literally wired to hear our brains now.

188
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.740
Konarski his idea was that normally our ears wouldn't hear what the brain was

189
00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:53.650
saying because it was too busy. You taking in all the sounds from the outside,

190
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.800
but what if he thought the sound from the outside stopped?

191
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.160
Maybe then there would be a kind of backflow

192
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.650
sound stored in your brain would start to flow backwards. Now again,

193
00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:09.760
this is just an idea,

194
00:11:09.761 --> 00:11:14.140
but there might be something to this because it would explain why most of the

195
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.510
people who suffer from musical hallucinations,

196
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.030
according to Tim Griffith have one thing in common

197
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.631
<v 5>by far and away.</v>

198
00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:24.631
The common situation you see it in is in people who have deafness usually in

199
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:25.870
middle or later life

200
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.210
<v 10>and you have to take his word for it. Nearly the incident that I went deaf,</v>

201
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.970
I started experiencing round the clock,

202
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:34.940
24 seven auditory hallucinations.

203
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.130
<v 3>This is Michael Cora's.</v>

204
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.230
When he was 36 he lost all of his hearing and he remembers the moment that it

205
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.641
happened.

206
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:44.960
He was in the emergency room talking to a nurse and suddenly the sound started

207
00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:45.320
to go.

208
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.620
<v 10>It was like going from talking like this to talking like this to Tony like this,</v>

209
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.380
to talk like this. My ears were just draining out like water draining of the,

210
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.580
uh, of about, uh,

211
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.320
I was just getting deffer and different deffer and at the same time I was dying

212
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:00.100
to hear

213
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.350
<v 11>a very loud ringing sound in my ears.</v>

214
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.730
It was gradually morphing prints of sort of formless eerie,

215
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.020
ethereal music, music at the spheres.

216
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:18.960
Really don't recall it. And you read slowly more

217
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.930
into some version of the Avi Maria

218
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.110
<v 12>[inaudible].</v>

219
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.980
<v 11>It was almost as if as a sort of recompense to being deaf.</v>

220
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:40.981
I was like plugged into some sort of deep background Meli and the cosmos.

221
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.563
<v 4>Yeah. Here's the question.</v>

222
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.300
What would happen if Michael suddenly got his hearing back? Well,

223
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.690
a couple of months later, Michael got a cochlear implant installed.

224
00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:54.680
This is a little chip.

225
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.730
It's put into his brain which promise to return at least part of his hearing.

226
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:00.620
And he says when the doctor's turned it on

227
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:01.970
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

228
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.640
<v 4>moment, he says they turned it on, it sounds from the world came brushing</v>

229
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.690
<v 11>and the music stopped,</v>

230
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.690
<v 10>stopped cold. Just went away almost instantaneously.</v>

231
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.330
Huh? There you go. Well,

232
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:22.110
but I happen to know a woman who had a very,

233
00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:25.620
very different experience. What do you mean she had the same problem?

234
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:28.890
She went deaf. She started hearing music. Let's see. What kind of music was it?

235
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.040
Um, hands, spirituals, patriotic songs. Uh, her name, uh,

236
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.680
this is actually a real name. It's Cheryl sees what we're going to call her.

237
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.790
She wanted the music in her head to stop and she'd heard about a patient,

238
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.750
like your friend there who had musical hallucinations.

239
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.080
We saved the cochlear implant and her hallucinations disappeared.

240
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.660
So I wanted to do it. So she did it. She got the implants,

241
00:13:53.661 --> 00:13:58.661
she wakes up on the operating table and I heard the music.

242
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:04.630
It was inside me still there. Just was there. I can't stop it.

243
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.310
Why in the first case, and they're, they're kind of the same situation.

244
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.860
They are very much the same. Why would there be that difference?

245
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.360
I don't know why there is this difference between them.

246
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:17.040
So I asked a Dr. Oliver Sacks, we often talk to on these questions.

247
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.100
How do you explain the difference as a physician who no one sees patients that

248
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.450
you, you ask about their symptoms, they produce their symptoms,

249
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:32.550
but it is equally important to see the relation of the symptoms of the disease

250
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.490
to the person themselves, to the identity.

251
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.350
He's discovered over the years that the problem is expressed in the patient is

252
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:43.860
partly a disease. I mean the person is sick or in trouble in some way.

253
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.890
At the same time the disease is reflecting something about the person in front

254
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:53.300
of him when sees interaction and a, a liaison,

255
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.400
a collusion, the condition,

256
00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.410
I don't know what word to use between the self and a symptom and sometimes it

257
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.390
can come out. So strangely, for example,

258
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:06.390
there is a patient he has who was a Jewish guy. He was a Jewish boy who, who'd,

259
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.420
who'd grown up in Hamburg and the 1920 and 1930s and he had been terrified by

260
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:17.651
the Nazi youth and for some horrible reason he hallucinated Nazi marching songs.

261
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.700
He was tormented. But on the other hand,

262
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.900
Oliver told me about an old woman he wants made in a nursing home who was

263
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.160
haunted by lullabies one after the other nonstop. But see,

264
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.060
she was an orphan.

265
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:36.860
Father died before she was born and her mother before she was five orphaned

266
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.730
alone.

267
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.320
She found the songs in her head deeply comforting the music and the

268
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:47.321
hallucinations in fact seemed to be a door into a lost part of childhood.

269
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.050
So then the differences between people and music floods into their head.

270
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.760
What's going on says Oliver is the disease and the person they're talking to

271
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:02.840
each other, the, the self can be molded by hallucination,

272
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.730
but it can mold them in turn. I wonder where Leo fits into this. Lulu,

273
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:13.370
how would you say that that Leo self interacts with his symptoms or vice versa?

274
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.790
<v 13>Well, uh, he's a psychoanalyst, so whenever he gets a song stuck in his head,</v>

275
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.170
which is like all the time, he analyzes it,

276
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.600
he looks for a hidden meaning and [inaudible]

277
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.730
<v 1>like, you know the way dreams reveal your inner life. The same thing with songs.</v>

278
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.770
<v 13>Leo will tell you that every song is a message from his subconscious.</v>

279
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.570
<v 1>Everything has an unconscious connection, pleasant or unpleasant,</v>

280
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.760
and he's just got to figure out what it is.

281
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.360
I'm analyzing me like I have a patient in front of me.

282
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.190
<v 13>Like when I first called him up, he had a,</v>

283
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.470
Mary had a little lamb stuck in his head that he told me it was because he'd

284
00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:47.400
been thinking about

285
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.560
<v 1>passivity of the American people in following a leader that misleads them and</v>

286
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:57.390
everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was, was sure to go. I'm in,

287
00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:58.810
and the connection is obvious.

288
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.510
<v 13>Or when he first got home from the hospital, he always had America.</v>

289
00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:04.740
The beautiful stuck in it,

290
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.680
<v 1>and I'm certainly not a raving paper yet,</v>

291
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.720
but what this meant was Holmes Weed America to me was home.

292
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.920
<v 13>It's easy to think that this is kind of a stretch.</v>

293
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:22.180
I mean every song has some very specific meaning for him,

294
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.190
but I dunno,

295
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:27.910
there was this one time he told me about where he woke up with a song in his

296
00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:28.240
head.

297
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.190
<v 1>I stopped going to brush my teeth. I'm singing along as I go to the bathroom.</v>

298
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.820
This is what it was. It's just a few years after his wife had died.

299
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.670
My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

300
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.730
My Bernie lies over the sea.

301
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.050
My Bernie lies over the ocean, the Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

302
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.230
Dah. Bring back, bring back,

303
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.790
bring back my Bonnie to me. To me. Yeah.

304
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.153
And um,

305
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.460
I realized when I said, why am I singing that song?

306
00:18:09.461 --> 00:18:13.750
And then suddenly I realized it was our wedding anniversary that week.

307
00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:16.990
That was one of our major anniversaries. You know,

308
00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:18.760
that song can kill me when I hit it.

309
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.150
<v 3>Even. So he told me that when that song comes, he doesn't want it to go.</v>

310
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.220
<v 1>I found that when the song disappeared, I didn't want it to disappear.</v>

311
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.880
<v 3>It's now been over a decade of hallucinating music for Leo and he found that at</v>

312
00:18:31.881 --> 00:18:36.881
some point the music switched and went from intruder to friend,

313
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.670
<v 1>Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Now he looks forward to</v>

314
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.560
the Song Stars and Steel Guitars at the company to Dah, Dah, Dah.

315
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.930
Cause often the [inaudible] he finds himself alone that that the in Monterey.

316
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.900
It's true that one of the things about being 94 is that when you look at your

317
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:57.290
telephone address book, the half of them are not there anymore.

318
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.980
You scratch out the name and that's not easy. No, no, no.

319
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.160
Just Molly and me and baby makes three all happy and uh,

320
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:13.410
the Loo Heaven Radio Labs,

321
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.770
<v 3>Lulu Miller. Thanks Louisville. Yeah, thanks to Leo.</v>

322
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.010
Leo has a book out about living with musical hallucinations.

323
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:23.310
It's called music in the head, living at the brain mind border.

324
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.900
And so does Michael [inaudible]. He's the guy with the cochlear implant.

325
00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:29.380
His book is called rebuilt my journey back to the hearing world.

326
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.570
You can find links to all of those on our website,

327
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.820
radiolab.org and I am special thanks to Oliver Sacks who basically gave us his

328
00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:39.430
Rolodex and we were able to find all these people and interview them.

329
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.970
Thanks to LRA and Kate Edgar. Here's a system. Absolutely. Now Robert,

330
00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:45.400
before we go to break, I just don't see it. One more clip if you don't mind.

331
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.960
[inaudible] couldn't figure out a place to put it.

332
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.730
From my interview with Diana Deutsch,

333
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.000
I was asking her about musical hallucinations and where this stuff comes from,

334
00:19:52.001 --> 00:19:54.070
like where does the music come from, what triggers it?

335
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.450
And she told me basically, well, it can be anything. That's striking.

336
00:19:58.451 --> 00:20:02.830
Example was somebody who wanted very much for her hallucinations to go and

337
00:20:02.831 --> 00:20:05.650
suddenly they did go away and so she said, oh great,

338
00:20:05.651 --> 00:20:08.940
this is the sound of silence. And immediately [inaudible]

339
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.110
<v 15>the Song Sandra silence, darkness,</v>

340
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.200
Simon and Garfunkel Song started, I come to talk with. So

341
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.790
the same Radiolab will continue in a moment

342
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.800
<v 16>is funded in part by the outfits, p Sloan Salvation,</v>

343
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.430
the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

344
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.590
<v 14>Radiolab is produced by W N Y C New York public radio and distributed by NPR</v>

345
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.880
national public radio.

346
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.620
<v 17>Hey, I'm Jad apple, I'm Ron [inaudible] and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.</v>

347
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:54.550
Our topic today is songs that get stuck in your head and won't unstick.

348
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.050
Now in the last section we would got,

349
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.800
we've talked about people who were invaded by music and couldn't get the music

350
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.830
out of their heads. Yep.

351
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.940
Now let's switch and talk about people who desire more than anything to get a

352
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:09.010
tune a melody into their heads. Oh No,

353
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:12.670
it was just specifically people who are professional songwriters.

354
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.160
Well like Pam. Hello,

355
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:19.780
my name is Bob Darrow and I'm visiting here with radio lab.

356
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.020
Is that it? And what is it? It's radio.

357
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.750
Everybody is completely aware of our program, but then again,

358
00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:29.230
not everybody would be necessarily aware of Bob Duro was that good?

359
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:34.250
But you may know this. What's your

360
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.193
list?

361
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.500
<v 6>Yes, I'm already up and I'm sitting here on campus.</v>

362
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.200
<v 17>Let's see. Whoa, my hero. How wonderful you are.</v>

363
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.490
If you grew up in the 1970s and 1980s which I by the way did not new.

364
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:55.280
So everything that we've just heard I never heard before.

365
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.020
But you heard that your whole, Oh my God, am I heard? They go,

366
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:03.050
you know schoolhouse rock and you have Bob Durrow to thank for all the songs

367
00:22:04.011 --> 00:22:07.190
that will not leave your head xe.

368
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.130
We invited Bob over to my apartment to sit by piano.

369
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.710
Talk a little bit about Hook Enos. That's right.

370
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.090
What makes a song so sticky? So sticky? For your head.

371
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.090
How does that happen? One ever gets there, but you get your,

372
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.480
he told us a story of getting a call.

373
00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:27.060
This was back in 1972 from a fellow named David [inaudible]

374
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.810
<v 18>call. He was in the advertising executive,</v>

375
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.020
the president of a small advertising agency. And uh,

376
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.120
he simply said, my little boy, I can't memorize the times tables,

377
00:22:38.121 --> 00:22:41.380
but he sings along with Jimmy Hendrickson,

378
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.300
the rolling stones and gets their words,

379
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.600
why can't we put the multiplication tables to music?

380
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.420
We'll call it multiplication rock. What do you think?

381
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.470
Looking at me and that shit. Yeah.

382
00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.560
Did you say ea was confident? Well then I did some research.

383
00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:05.561
I looked in the math books that I had in my library and then I just came to me

384
00:23:06.831 --> 00:23:11.790
as your title three is a magic number. [inaudible] man.

385
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.180
Hey, it's good. Yes it is. It's a manager.

386
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.790
Want to hear Martin? Yeah.

387
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.260
Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity.

388
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.410
And then I went to look in the Bible and I looked everywhere.

389
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.240
It is one of the magic numbers.

390
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.030
I thought of Buckminster Fuller wanting buck Fitz cause of that GTZ film thing.

391
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.013
Well, the triangle,

392
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.500
literally strongest shape that can be because it can't bend.

393
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.820
A square can sag, right and become parallelogram or something.

394
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.650
But a triangle is fixed by its very triangular parity, right?

395
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.920
Every tracking has three corners. Every tracking S3 side, no more,

396
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.053
no less.

397
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.420
You don't have to guess when it's three sees the magic.

398
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.570
<v 19>I don't mean that's a bad number.</v>

399
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.030
<v 20>It's a magic. No. As you can hear from these remakes three really is a magic,</v>

400
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.260
<v 19>but in any case, at the end of the</v>

401
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.450
<v 20>the conversation I asked Bob drove the think back,</v>

402
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:27.650
way back before you did schoolhouse rock, before you became a jazz musician,

403
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.120
back to when you were a kid.

404
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.890
Do you remember the first time you got a really good musical idea when a melody

405
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:36.770
that Kinda popped into your head? He said, of course I do.

406
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:38.600
Let me play it for you.

407
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.630
<v 18>No.</v>

408
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.630
The doorstep side by side on the doorstep brand

409
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.680
tonight. Shit. No. On the doorstep tonight.

410
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:56.681
We'll do the fourth step on the doorstep with my bread.

411
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.650
<v 20>Okay. That's all there. That's all they are. Like that was your first song.</v>

412
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.790
Not a bad melody.

413
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.560
Terrible words and I made it up plowing.

414
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.000
I was helping uncle John on the phone. I was riding a Herro.

415
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.560
I don't care where you were wrong. So right off the bat,

416
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.340
bomb bump on [inaudible].

417
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.320
That's a pretty good hook in [inaudible]. What I care about is weird.

418
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.320
Did that come from, from hearing pop music?

419
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:32.321
You pick up the phone even though one school I would say I knew something about

420
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:37.391
songs sub consciously form because it's a,

421
00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:39.620
it's the architecture of all those other ones. Yeah.

422
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.760
Do these things like when you hit the right one, do they like shout?

423
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.630
I'm the one they do. They do. They do. I'm not gonna Forget it.

424
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:50.390
Now I can go to town and shop for groceries,

425
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.900
go to a movie and the next day it'll still be there because it identifies its

426
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.570
shelf almost kind of like it feels like it has. Suddenly it has weight,

427
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.250
like it has weight and identity in there. It is.

428
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.503
It's there.

429
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:10.690
Sometimes I get the melody and then it's just sheer labored and make the word

430
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:15.410
spit. Where does the melody come from? Melody comes the Muse.

431
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.233
You ever met this

432
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.233
<v 18>use?</v>

433
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.610
A lot of people are visited by the Muse and they don't recognize her.

434
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.960
When you were plowing that day way back, you know I had a muse. Yeah,

435
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.140
but did you know that you had one or do you just think it was just something

436
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:30.411
that like,

437
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:34.070
like your like new shoes and I thought it was something that just came out of

438
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:36.860
the air to me. I wonder if I stole it.

439
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.630
<v 20>That would, that would worry me, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

440
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.300
Oh that's one of the songwriters mean objectives.

441
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:49.530
When you think of a melody say,

442
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.440
<v 17>am I stealing that? See the,</v>

443
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.870
that's how mysterious this is.

444
00:26:55.871 --> 00:27:00.190
You don't know whether the idea was yours as originally yours or whether you

445
00:27:00.191 --> 00:27:03.010
heard it in some earlier part of your life and it belongs to someone else you

446
00:27:03.011 --> 00:27:06.010
don't know. So the muse is a tricky kind of God is,

447
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.860
and you know where it really gets extra tricky.

448
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.730
Imagine if you write a tune and it has weight for you.

449
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.220
People begin to enjoy it where you live.

450
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.960
And then very mysteriously it begins to circle the world.

451
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.530
And people who don't share your language, don't share yours.

452
00:27:23.531 --> 00:27:26.650
Tradition your culture. Share your tune.

453
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.070
That is really mysterious.

454
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.240
<v 20>Ah, I got one for you. There is a delightful English artists,</v>

455
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.460
England's property or young recording star,

456
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.830
but you look Clarke [inaudible] have a very fine

457
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.580
<v 21>welcome. This is a tune that was written by a British guy who came in New York,</v>

458
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.380
sang by a Parisian who everyone thought was American and what they made

459
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.340
everybody else. One of my favorite records to the car.

460
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.820
<v 22>Listen to the music drama traffic in downtown.</v>

461
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.260
And this particular record has special memories for me.

462
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.090
Bits of sweet memories if you like, because I mean,

463
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.420
I'll pull the record out of the case here. Um, there'll be, oh,

464
00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:17.254
this is the original

465
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.040
<v 20>well single that I would have bought at the time. High records,</v>

466
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.190
no scratches. Always looked after a,

467
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.910
a clock downtown written by Tony Hatch.

468
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.520
<v 23>I didn't write downtown specifically for Petula Clark.</v>

469
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.233
<v 21>Yeah,</v>

470
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.030
<v 23>well I'd been to New York in October,</v>

471
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.540
1964 I stayed on central park, turned left from the [inaudible]

472
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:46.913
<v 21>him</v>

473
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.410
<v 23>dad walk down Broadway. And by the time I got down to Times Square,</v>

474
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.490
I thought it was strange that there wasn't a song called downtown.

475
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.190
<v 20>When you're alone and life is making you lonely,</v>

476
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.040
you can always go downtown.

477
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:03.650
<v 23>Okay,</v>

478
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.320
<v 20>just listen to the music of the traffic in the city.</v>

479
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.770
<v 21>Linger on the sidewalk like a new on the signs of prison. How can you be</v>

480
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:17.973
<v 22>Bobby Stanley</v>

481
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.943
<v 21>[inaudible] sonic?</v>

482
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.080
<v 23>It had different meanings in different places,</v>

483
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.520
but for me on that first trip there, it was the center of life.

484
00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:35.360
It was a great place to be and even though I was on my own,

485
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.120
I didn't feel lonely. That's the first line of the song.

486
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.190
<v 20>When you're low, none, life is making you lonely. You</v>

487
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.550
<v 22>can always go down.</v>

488
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.000
<v 23>I brought the idea back to the UK and in those days in between recording</v>

489
00:29:50.001 --> 00:29:52.370
sessions and mixing down the recording session,

490
00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:56.390
I used to have about an hour in the recording studio and I would go and sit in

491
00:29:56.391 --> 00:29:59.540
the studio and just a doodle around it. It's a good time.

492
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:01.160
After a three hour recording session,

493
00:30:01.161 --> 00:30:04.070
the mind was very active and the music was flowing very freely.

494
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.470
I actually then wrote the tune to downtown. That was it. I left it.

495
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.900
<v 20>Well, I remember when Tony Hatch came to the apartment in Paris.</v>

496
00:30:13.901 --> 00:30:17.320
That's where I was living at the time. You know, I had moved over to France.

497
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:18.630
I've married a Frenchman,

498
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.750
already had two small children and a life was great.

499
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.850
This was I guess in 63 or four and I said, well, I tell you what,

500
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.240
I'll go make a cup of tea and you play something to me on the piano.

501
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:34.950
<v 18>[inaudible]</v>

502
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.890
<v 23>I played her the bones of downtown, the,</v>

503
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.060
the outline of it and the few words that I had and put the word downtown into

504
00:30:43.921 --> 00:30:44.850
wherever it was going to go.

505
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.120
<v 20>And I was in the kitchen making tea when I first heard the music for downtown</v>

506
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.950
and I absolutely adored it and I came back with a t and I said,

507
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.600
<v 23>that's the one I wonder record.</v>

508
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.960
That could be a fantastic song and a great record.

509
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.090
<v 20>We were in the studio maybe a couple of weeks later and recorded a monster.</v>

510
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.060
Okay. Now here's the interesting thing. As the song grew, something happened.

511
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.500
The meaning began to change a bit. I mean,

512
00:31:12.501 --> 00:31:16.580
here's a song that was initially a celebration of the city. You go downtown,

513
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.900
you see the bright lights, you with people, you'll never be alone. Well,

514
00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:21.591
after a while,

515
00:31:21.591 --> 00:31:26.591
Petula Clark and some of the people who sang it expanded the song to include the

516
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:29.540
exact opposite, meaning instead of comforting,

517
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.660
the city is now a haunted place and you are now more alone than ever.

518
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.450
Same Song completely, right?

519
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.960
It's got a lot of character and a lot of different angles you could take on it.

520
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.950
The one that sprung to mind for us was the kind of blade runner,

521
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.060
like a much darker picture of what it's like to go downtown

522
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.633
[inaudible].

523
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.140
I always thought with the original that it presented a very happy,

524
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:14.290
bright lights thing that you always had this sense of shallowness that if you

525
00:32:14.511 --> 00:32:16.190
were on your own and you went downtown,

526
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.450
it probably stay on your own and get quite depressed at sleep.

527
00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.740
Watching lots of people having fun around you,

528
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.140
<v 22>right? You resolve the noise.</v>

529
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.420
Just being out on the street and being with other people and seeing the lights.

530
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.950
There's a kind of slight desperation in that life. How can,

531
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.930
<v 3>the lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles.</v>

532
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:49.640
Forget all your care. I like that line. The lights are much brighter there.

533
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:52.670
You can forget all your troubles. Forget all your care while you can't actually,

534
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:56.810
but you can go out and try. It takes your mind off stuff.

535
00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.093
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

536
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.490
<v 18>Don't hang around and let your problems surrounding their movie shows.</v>

537
00:33:05.491 --> 00:33:06.600
Want to go downtown.

538
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.560
Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close downtown.

539
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.253
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

540
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.550
<v 3>thank you to Ellen hole and the BBC and falling tree productions for that piece</v>

541
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:25.070
you note. I think if our question right now is like,

542
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:28.520
when a song falls from Song Heaven, why does it find an audience?

543
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:29.630
Sometimes the global audience,

544
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.230
how I think it's not really the music in this case. I mean it's a catchy sure,

545
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:37.050
but the experience of going downtown in New York and you're excited,

546
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.670
you want to see the bright lights,

547
00:33:38.671 --> 00:33:41.910
you want to be with people and you get there and it still sucks.

548
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.260
You still lonely. I think people in Shanghai understand that feeling.

549
00:33:46.261 --> 00:33:49.050
People in Bombay, everybody knows that feeling.

550
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.740
<v 17>Yeah. It's like migration music in a way. Yeah. You know,</v>

551
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:53.930
moving from one place to a new place. Yeah.

552
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:58.430
And there is interestingly precedent for this 50 years before they wrote

553
00:33:58.431 --> 00:33:59.264
downtown,

554
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.050
this was already happening on a much bigger scale than I had ever imagined.

555
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.220
Right here I learned about this from, from this Guy Aaron A. Fox.

556
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.480
He is a professor of musicology at Columbia University in New York and the damn

557
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:14.270
good country, Western league guitar player, country,

558
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:19.271
not that rock and roll one too deep down in narrow Nan and [inaudible].

559
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.530
I hear that train to come in Nitro and roundabout country music is a genre we

560
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:27.170
normally associate with Kentucky and Nashville,

561
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.370
West Virginia particular part of America will always pick up. Yeah.

562
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.400
But it has spread. He says to the most unusual places.

563
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:37.660
So some examples of that and there were quite a few include the uh,

564
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.320
extreme popularity of American country and Western music over the last 50 or 60

565
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.000
years with aboriginal Australians.

566
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.020
You mean Hank Williams would be recognizable to somebody similar in Western

567
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:52.430
Australia? Absolutely. Neely Dolly Parton being another one elite part.

568
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.090
Dolly Parton is this international global star of the world's music,

569
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.510
especially in southern Africa. She's a revere like a saint

570
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.480
<v 22>[inaudible] Zimbabwe as well. Dolly Parton,</v>

571
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.020
you can fill a venue with a band playing Dolly Parton song and everybody will

572
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:14.650
know all the words. Oh, his blood. Yes, doing good. He was in that rocky job.

573
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.930
<v 17>Most universally evolved. Don Williams,</v>

574
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:23.170
I left Oklahoma [inaudible].

575
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:28.030
If Don Williams were to go to Dar es Salaam or to Zanzibar or to Kenya or

576
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.740
someplace and book a club.

577
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:34.840
Don Williams has actually gone to Zimbabwe where he has filled a soccer stadium

578
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.970
with 40,000 people twice a row. Wow.

579
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.850
<v 24>Imagine 40,000 Zimbabweans crammed into a peak state and down here in the center</v>

580
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.050
in the lights is Don Williams.

581
00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.880
I just wondered

582
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.820
<v 17>what exactly are they hearing?</v>

583
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:03.030
I have asked Grenadian St Lucians Trinidadians or Macon Norwegian bins during

584
00:36:03.071 --> 00:36:06.690
the session. Chinese and American aboriginal Australia Anti [inaudible]. Um,

585
00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.020
why do you like country music?

586
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.860
And the first answer is virtually always something along the lines of it's the

587
00:36:11.861 --> 00:36:14.560
stories. Like as in the stories in the lyrics,

588
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.590
I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison and I went to pick her up in the

589
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:21.250
rain,

590
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.510
but before I could get to the station in my pickup truck,

591
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.280
she got run over by a damned old train.

592
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.880
That doesn't sound very aboriginal to me.

593
00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.360
You know how many aborigines are actually run over by trains? Thousands.

594
00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:36.730
Actually, that's not what Professor Fox is saying.

595
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.030
He says ignore the details and listen for the larger story,

596
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.770
which has to do with moving, with migration and with regret.

597
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:50.050
You're lonesome for something and the thing you're missing is the old hometown

598
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.160
now, the green, green grass of home, the green grass,

599
00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.130
Aaron Foxes. You can boil much of this music down to just this feeling.

600
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:04.540
You look and look around me. You long for something simpler,

601
00:37:04.541 --> 00:37:09.541
something that use that's left behind and I realize that I was only dreaming

602
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.780
what would be the best couple of examples you can think of of I missed the farm.

603
00:37:15.851 --> 00:37:18.050
I missed the crickets. Oh, the start.

604
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.610
The first hit country song was in the style Jack Reverie for quote

605
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.410
little old log cabin.

606
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.720
The lane performed by Jimmy Rogers and Phil and John Carson.

607
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.580
The song was recorded in 1927 and that happens to be the moment if you look at

608
00:37:34.581 --> 00:37:35.430
the u s census,

609
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.020
because he'll tell you when the United States crosses the threshold from more

610
00:37:39.021 --> 00:37:43.550
than 50% agrarian and rural dwellers to more than 50% urban dwellers.

611
00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.880
In other words, country music really exploded.

612
00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:51.320
And this is not an accident when most people no longer lived in the country.

613
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.560
Country Music is born when the country becomes a nostalgic idea.

614
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.860
And so in America anyway,

615
00:37:57.861 --> 00:38:02.210
suddenly there was this dreamscape of country places that no longer existed

616
00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:06.170
except in heads. And the music started just been so.

617
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.470
People in Los Angeles had in Chicago, heard country in their minds,

618
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.730
it seems just as logical that people who move from the country to the city in

619
00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:16.300
Asia,

620
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:21.040
in African Australia might have exactly the same experience that these songs are

621
00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:25.000
sung in English. If these people in these far away places don't speak English,

622
00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:26.020
what are they hearing? Well,

623
00:38:26.021 --> 00:38:29.020
it's important to understand English and the real enthusiasts around the world

624
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.610
are English speakers. However,

625
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.420
one explanation for its popularity elsewhere is that even if you don't speak

626
00:38:34.421 --> 00:38:37.780
English, the is literally in the music itself.

627
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.080
There is grammar here in the vocalization, the singers,

628
00:38:42.081 --> 00:38:43.760
this is a very normal country western thing.

629
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:48.590
They actually make a croaky sound that is very distinctive. You know,

630
00:38:48.591 --> 00:38:50.510
it's a gold [inaudible].

631
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.770
<v 22>Well, I</v>

632
00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.083
[inaudible]

633
00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.880
<v 17>one of the principle vocal articulations is what country singers</v>

634
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.670
<v 22>call it cry, break [inaudible]</v>

635
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.960
<v 17>in my book by parts of the CRI break into dozens of different specific</v>

636
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.973
articulation.

637
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.610
<v 22>No, Eh,</v>

638
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.280
<v 17>and it's not just the voices by the way says Fox. It's, it's the instruments.</v>

639
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.140
Instruments seem to be crying like the steel guitar is,

640
00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:25.270
the signature is out of country because it's recognized as iconic of a crying

641
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:29.870
human voice. It's called the crying steel.

642
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.490
<v 6>Uh, um,</v>

643
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.310
<v 17>you can hear the loons of them.</v>

644
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.933
<v 19>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:46.160
<v 17>and what seems to come rule is things just aren't what they were before and all</v>

646
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:50.940
over the world where people are leaving from the country to the city and they

647
00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:51.990
are an enormous number.

648
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:54.230
<v 19>[inaudible]</v>

649
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.830
<v 17>this is a story. All kinds of people can understand.</v>

650
00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.160
Country is just as much Grenadian music as it is Kentucky music.

651
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.060
It's just as much a why in music editor as it is West Virginia music is that one

652
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.960
when you feel a football stadium with Dolly Parton listeners,

653
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.430
are we saying that they're there in part because the song she's seen are their

654
00:40:13.431 --> 00:40:16.090
stories too? Yup. Yup. This is our music. Yep.

655
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.060
<v 22>I've written a lot of songs about the smokey mountains where I grew up.</v>

656
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.630
We had a good life back there in heels and we're all

657
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.420
<v 17>going through some version of, you know, oh,</v>

658
00:40:26.421 --> 00:40:30.860
on one to two or 300 year change from being esentially peasants

659
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.743
<v 6>to being modern.</v>

660
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:37.310
I remember sitting know on the front porch on a summer afternoon in a skate to

661
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.120
plead against the wall.

662
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.840
<v 22>Professor Fox has a book on this subject,</v>

663
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.840
real country music and language in working class culture.

664
00:40:48.841 --> 00:40:51.300
You can find more information about that on our website.

<v 17>Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich today on radio lab.</v>

671
00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:22.310
Our topic is the music in our heads. How does it get there?

672
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.310
Where does it come from and why? We want it to go away. Yes. No,

673
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.370
you think that the music you listen to is your music.

674
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.350
It comes from the place you live, but there is such a thing as everybody's,

675
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.980
and

676
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v 0>we offer the next story as a kind of proof comes to us from reporter Gregory</v>

677
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.220
Warren. Gregory wonder, you won a journalism fellowship and they said to you,

678
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:46.280
you could go anywhere in the whole world. Where did you decide to go?

679
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.880
So I went to Afghanistan. Have you ever been to a war zone before by any chance?

680
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:54.500
Yeah, I mean I've, no, but have you done any international reporting before?

681
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.370
Well, actually earlier that year I had been in Astonia covering and accordion

682
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:02.810
festival. So that was a, a prime piece of, uh,

683
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.030
so you play the accordion? I play accordion.

684
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.970
Do you like it an accomplished accordionist? No, no, no, no.

685
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.570
I'm just an amateur. Accordionist okay, but, but so when you go to Afghanistan,

686
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:14.110
do you bring your accordion with you? Yeah, I brought my car.

687
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.760
How does that work out? Well, I show up in Afghanistan,

688
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:20.780
I'm carrying my accordion and I'm thinking maybe this wasn't the smartest idea

689
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.160
because it wasn't an accordion playing crowd.

690
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.560
I mean I was coming down the street and women in Burkas are holding their babies

691
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:33.620
and little boys will actually sob, sob,

692
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.480
begging you to sort of buy a piece of gum.

693
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.430
Here I am with my shiny red accordion and it's just not very appropriate.

694
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.400
Does there come a time when you were actually willing to use the accordion?

695
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.130
Well, it was a weeknight and was in my living room.

696
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.940
I find that jeep is my fixer and translator. He's working for me.

697
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.510
He's lying on his back and he's flinging his legs up into the air.

698
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.510
A guard is catching his legs and flinging the back down. Well,

699
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.450
this is the kind of Ab crunchy, that's what we're listening to now. Yeah,

700
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:06.650
there he's throwing his legs up. [inaudible] pushed him back down, going up,

701
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.530
back down. So I figured I'd help him out.

702
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.870
So I start playing my accordion for him.

703
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:23.483
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

704
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.590
<v 0>and it's going well. The jeeps bopping his head too.</v>

705
00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:30.300
And then he kind of looks at me, this is it.

706
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.490
How do you know Afghan music? I say,

707
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.530
I'm not playing African music. And he says, yes, you are. I say, no, I'm not.

708
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.280
Yeah you are. I said, no, no, no, that,

709
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:43.420
that's like folks out from the 60s called. Those were the days my friend,

710
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.720
some song that my mom used to say,

711
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.910
<v 18>oh, Dave's my friend. Yeah, that's my mom.</v>

712
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.170
[inaudible] we'd sing him dance.

713
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.110
[inaudible]

714
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.550
<v 0>no, no, that's an Afghanistan.</v>

715
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.810
And then he's back to the app crutches and I'm like, no, no, no, wait, wait,

716
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.570
please tell me the story of those were the days, my friend.

717
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.050
So what's the story of a, those were the days my friends,

718
00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:13.990
that's what we call it. Tell me about that song.

719
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.480
[inaudible] senior who is famous for it? [inaudible] it.

720
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.030
His name was Alma [inaudible] famous. Same Guy, Ghana son.

721
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.930
It's 25 years ago, but not [inaudible].

722
00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:37.060
<v 12>Then Paul showed them [inaudible]. Oh, that</v>

723
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:39.743
[inaudible]

724
00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.370
<v 0>wait, wait, wait. That's not [inaudible]. Okay. It's true.</v>

725
00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:47.290
He did get it wrong, so I forgot about it.

726
00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:49.420
I thought he was crazy and it kept happening.

727
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.140
I would bring my accordion played for some people. Every time people would say,

728
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.960
hey, isn't that an homage to your song? How do you say,

729
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.980
how do you spell this name? Z. A. H. I. R. I'm is He, who is he? Well,

730
00:44:59.981 --> 00:45:00.910
that's what I wanted to find out.

731
00:45:00.911 --> 00:45:05.560
So the first thing that jeep gave me was his entire CD collection and one night

732
00:45:05.561 --> 00:45:09.730
I sit down, listen to it. I'm hearing one western riff after another gentleman,

733
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.970
Nat King Cole. Definitely a lot of Elvis. Like I realized I'm this tune.

734
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.910
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

735
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:22.680
<v 0>is the name of the year too. You can actually overlay the Elvis version.</v>

736
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.523
<v 12>No</v>

737
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.013
[inaudible]

738
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.510
<v 0>right on top of it. Is he stealing these tunes? Is that what you're saying?</v>

739
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.660
It's more like he Afghanistan, like here's one of his biggest hits.

740
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.860
10 hoster them Denton

741
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.560
<v 12>[inaudible]. Uh Huh.</v>

742
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.580
<v 0>Hey, you remember this is the song that the jeep sung to me,</v>

743
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.830
but it did sound familiar. So I emailed this tune to an old friend in St Louis.

744
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:55.970
He immediately said, Oh yeah, that's that Western disco hit El beam boat.

745
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.590
Ah, that's a daisy. No, this is the western version.

746
00:46:03.591 --> 00:46:06.440
It's the same melodies. Ahmed's a year version. Same Keven.

747
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.370
Now let's just go back to the almond. Say Your version for a second.

748
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.620
<v 12>No, listen to this. My little [inaudible].</v>

749
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.690
This is east meets West. Um, and say your style,

750
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:24.310
and this is like the mega hip in Cabo in 1973.

751
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.130
This the sound of Afghanistan

752
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.123
[inaudible]

753
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.170
<v 0>so I begged the chief to tell me more, but this Ahmed's a yard guy.</v>

754
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.490
And finally he says, okay,

755
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:45.870
I'll take you to meet the old childhood friend of the man himself.

756
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.210
So we drive up to this gate.

757
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:52.940
This guy with white hair opens the door low energy.

758
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.220
Chad forbid. [inaudible] said that dark, dark, dark, dark.

759
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.190
He's been friends with them since the fourth grade and he takes us inside.

760
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:07.080
He closes the gate behind us, the scene changes. Suddenly it's a garden.

761
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.000
Birds are chirping and then sit up stops and he points to this old fountain in

762
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:16.260
the courtyard and he says something in the jeep and the jeep starts laughing and

763
00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.071
Najib says, you know,

764
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:21.180
this is the fountain where Ahmed Z ear used to play his accordia.

765
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.450
[inaudible] he plays accordion just like me saying that uh,

766
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.060
40 girls were lying down and he was playing the accordion here, you know,

767
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.870
40 girls, 40 girls. Oh they,

768
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.860
they did call him Casanova for a reason. But was that okay?

769
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:41.680
Cause in Afghanistan maybe girls and boys aren't supposed to like be hanging

770
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:41.831
out?

771
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:46.420
Yes and no because Afghanistan was a pretty different country in those days.

772
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:48.760
It's something I didn't even realize until I got there.

773
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.870
This is the seventies the women are wearing skirts and Jane Fonda haircuts.

774
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.260
The men are wearing sideburns and they're doing, they're James Dean.

775
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.360
And it's not just what people are wearing,

776
00:47:58.361 --> 00:48:02.170
it's that there's this sense of possibility in there. The things are opening up.

777
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.500
Finally, and the poster boy for all this is Ahmed's ears.

778
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:10.570
He's a bad boy that I'm even [inaudible] taken. He had a concert,

779
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:16.230
you buddy all the places and girls would come to his concerts wearing new

780
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:20.800
clothes and not only all the girls have a fan of son,

781
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.220
but the foreign girls, they also were in love with him.

782
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.750
Let me just play you one little clip from one of his shows and I want you to

783
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:33.460
hear a little screen that comes right in right here.

784
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:36.620
<v 25>[inaudible]</v>

785
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.510
<v 0>for young Africans at the time, especially young African women. Um, it's a year.</v>

786
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:46.850
He was like, God, what does that accomplish? [inaudible] no,

787
00:48:46.851 --> 00:48:51.110
mother will give birth a child as good as Amazon

788
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.920
and this is where the story gets a lot darker.

789
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:04.310
It's 1973 the Russians start to move in and the new president that they put in,

790
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.800
he doesn't really like them. It's that year at all. Why? Well,

791
00:49:07.801 --> 00:49:11.460
it was really in their interest that Ahmed's a year would come out publicly

792
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.260
praising the government, and he always refused to do it. Anything political,

793
00:49:15.261 --> 00:49:18.560
he wouldn't play the show. And some of his songs, especially the later songs,

794
00:49:18.561 --> 00:49:23.410
started to actually have coded anti government lyrics in them. Oh yeah,

795
00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:23.750
yeah.

796
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.810
And then he would have other lyrics about how freedom is the most important

797
00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:30.470
thing. So what did the government do to him? They ban his songs from the radio.

798
00:49:30.471 --> 00:49:32.540
They start throwing him in jail kind of regularly,

799
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.220
but even when he gets out of jail,

800
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.130
he refuses to play any of the communist party events.

801
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.940
But he plays plenty of his own shows. In fact, after one concert,

802
00:49:40.941 --> 00:49:44.760
he meets this beautiful woman named for Hero. The way she tells the story,

803
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.280
he taps her on the shelter. He said,

804
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:51.030
<v 26>he says, hi, can I talk to you? I turned my face. I said, yeah.</v>

805
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.110
He said, no, never mind. He tapped you on the shoulder. And he said,

806
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:56.780
can I talk to you? And then he said, nevermind.

807
00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.860
And he walked away and he just walked away.

808
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.290
That was pretty good seduction technique. But yeah,

809
00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:06.210
I guess he was very good in it. You got lots of guys like that and he got hurt.

810
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.720
Yes, and they got married and she got pregnant. Meanwhile,

811
00:50:09.721 --> 00:50:12.240
the political situation was getting worse and worse.

812
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.600
All his friends are fleeing the country. There are murders, tortures.

813
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:19.080
Somebody came to our house, knocked the door and he said,

814
00:50:19.081 --> 00:50:23.990
can I talk to Ahmed Zeit please? Ms Aid offered them, can I get you a drink?

815
00:50:23.991 --> 00:50:27.090
I said, no, no, no. I've just come from the Ministry of Interior.

816
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.560
There's a plan for you. I don't know what the going to do to you.

817
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.630
That's all I want to tell you to be careful. But

818
00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.740
<v 0>um, it's a year and his wife, they don't do anything. They don't,</v>

819
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:40.010
they don't leave. Why? He says, oh, we'll go after the baby's born.

820
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.970
Five days later, it's his birthday. June 14th, 1979,

821
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.510
he's actually signing a contract for a concert that they went to sign a

822
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.940
contract. As he's driving away, he tells her to make some lunch.

823
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.580
When we come back, we'll go shopping and then I will

824
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.440
<v 26>make Lasagna and then we'll go out.</v>

825
00:50:55.710 --> 00:51:00.690
<v 0>So she makes Lasagna and she waits for him to come back and she waits and then</v>

826
00:51:00.691 --> 00:51:01.524
she falls asleep.

827
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.910
I had a very weird dream.

828
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:12.550
<v 26>I'm somewhere very high in the mountains and I have no shoes and there is a very</v>

829
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:20.370
strong wind blowing and my hair is everywhere. I know,

830
00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:24.070
I see him, not the way he went in the morning,

831
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.930
his beard out,

832
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:30.190
like he hasn't shaved for the past two days and he has something white around

833
00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:35.191
him and something is pulling him and he's calling me that I don't want to go.

834
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.570
And suddenly I woke up, I ran down, I saw my father in law.

835
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.570
He wouldn't talk, he was just bending.

836
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.500
<v 0>No, like checking himself when bending and just holding my home.</v>

837
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:55.080
I didn't know anything. What, what happened? So what happened then?

838
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.400
Well, the government says that, um, it's a year, had a traffic accident,

839
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.980
but everybody else tells me he was shot in the head,

840
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.370
probably by government operatives and the news spreads through all the

841
00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:08.610
neighborhoods in town. So you have Tajiks, postions, Uzbeks.

842
00:52:08.611 --> 00:52:11.670
They're all getting up and not really knowing what else to do.

843
00:52:11.671 --> 00:52:13.830
They come walking to Ahmed's at your house.

844
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.950
The courtyard starts filling up with people. 5,000, 200.

845
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.560
They're inside the house. They're outside the house. They're on the street.

846
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:25.210
At this point, the body comes Bourne by six policemen on a stretcher.

847
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.820
People start to whale, they start to push. In fact,

848
00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:29.950
all the windows break the doors break.

849
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:34.340
They bring the body through the courtyard into the living room and for Kiera

850
00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:37.760
pushes through the police and she sees her husband's body on the stretcher.

851
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.760
So I thought he was hurt that something. And when I

852
00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.540
<v 26>pull the sheet from his face, that's when I fell down on top. Uh,</v>

853
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:50.370
when I fell, it took me to the hospital and that's how Shabnam was bombed.

854
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:51.830
So

855
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.330
<v 0>does she go into Labor cheat? She goes into Labor right there. Yeah.</v>

856
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.910
And she almost dies in childbirth. Yeah. But her baby's saved.

857
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.370
She saved and her baby has the same birthday.

858
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:04.130
Then her baby was born on that very day. That very day.

859
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:09.620
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

860
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.160
<v 27>so then what happened? Well then the music basically stops.</v>

861
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.530
It's that winter that the Russians and fade starts a long period of war.

862
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.000
You have the jihad, then the mood j Dean in the civil war.

863
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.220
When the Taliban come in, they just band music entirely.

864
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.690
<v 0>I mean, no instruments.</v>

865
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:32.930
We're talking 20 years where the cultural life of this country basically,

866
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:37.990
it's frozen. I can't even imagine what that's like.

867
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.730
I can barely go a day without hearing some tunes.

868
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.150
<v 19>2001 the Americans come in Afghanistan's open, back up.</v>

869
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.930
The radio is turned back on and it comes out of them.

870
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.910
[inaudible]

871
00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:01.450
<v 3>so Greg, when you turn on the radio today in Kabul,</v>

872
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.500
do you hear I'm at Zaire or telling you it's my main way that I connect with

873
00:54:05.501 --> 00:54:08.920
taxi drivers and variably they're listening to [inaudible] your song even now.

874
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.570
Oh yeah. Why? Because there's just not [inaudible]

875
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.860
<v 0>been a chance for new artists to emerge or it's just, you know,</v>

876
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.120
it was a deep freeze.

877
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.240
And also I would say he reminds everybody of what capital used to be.

878
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.240
I had this experience with my accordion again and again myself.

879
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.070
Even when I played people in my music,

880
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.750
they'd get this smile on their face as if I was reminding them of something they

881
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:29.310
knew before me. In fact,

882
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:33.330
there was one time I was up north and there was this big music festival and I

883
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:36.840
had brought my accordion and they said, well, why don't you play? And I said,

884
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.810
well, I mean I could play for you. Sure. And they said, how bout right now?

885
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.160
And so they kick the band is on their off. They send them to drink green tea.

886
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.470
They shoved me up on stage. I'm standing in front of 300 Afghans and these guys,

887
00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.250
<v 3>they're not from Cabo, they don't speak English,</v>

888
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.160
they're not wearing suits and ties. This is a very Afghan crowd.

889
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.550
So I figure I should play some Johnny Cash. Okay.

890
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.753
