00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.600
So there are several correct ways you could have

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.390
answered this question and what I've done is given you

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.320
four different levels of answers that could have fit.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.450
And they're all sort of ranked in order of being

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
an OK answer to really what would be the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.570
most comprehensive and best answer based on the material that

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.330
you've been presented with here. So I want to read them

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.750
to you and see what you think. an okay answer

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.560
would have just said the human genome is made of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.020
DNA, right. And you just sort of remember one, you know,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.750
very important point but, you know, didn't say anything else. A

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.610
good answer would have said that the human genome is 23

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.860
pairs of nuclear chromosomes, right. We know that they're in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.350
nucelus, and we know that we also have a mitochondrial chromosome

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.890
and that They're all made of DNA. A better answer would

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810
have said that we have to copies of over 3 billion

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.170
base pairs of DNA, and it's organized into

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.540
23 pairs of chromosomes. And we have the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.400
nuclear genome, and then we have the mitochondrial

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.660
genome. The best possible answer would've said that we've

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.230
got two copies of over three billion base

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.470
pairs of DNA. To organize by histone proteins into

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.720
23 pairs of linear chromosomes, 22 are autosomes,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.560
and we have a single pair of sex chromosomes.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.190
That's in the nuclear genome. And we have one

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.440
copy from each parent. And then of course we

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.670
have 17,000 basepairs From a circular mitochondrial chromosome found

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.260
in every mitochondrion, we have many per cell. So

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.100
this would be the most comprehensive or exhaustive answer.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100
Okay, what I want you to do is to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.960
actually look back at the answer, your response for

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.570
this question. And see how it compares to the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.990
four you see here. And then I want you to rank

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.460
your response here on the left. So, if you rank right here

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.020
with this first answer, I want you to check the box

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.140
that says OK. If you're think you're somewhere in between these two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620
answers, the first and the second, then you can check the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.710
box in between them. If you think your answer is more similar

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.750
to the second one then click the box for good. And

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.090
I want you to look at each of these and think about

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.759
where your answer, your response best fits,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.050
and then check the box that's most appropriate.
