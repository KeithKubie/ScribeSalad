00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Good afternoon.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.290
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.620
My name is Colleen Shogan,
and I'm the deputy director

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.910
for National and International
Outreach here at the Library.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.520
We're the division responsible
for public programming,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.800
and the Kluge Center plays an
important role in that respect.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.150
We'll soon hear introductions
of our esteemed panel,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.670
but I'd like to take a
moment to briefly talk to you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.220
about the John W.
Kluge Center directed

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.260
by Dr. John Haskell
who is on stage.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.720
It is our scholarly center
at the Library of Congress

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.660
but has a unique mission,
namely, bringing top minds

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.720
to Capitol Hill with the
goal of informing Congress

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.300
and the larger Washington
D.C. community.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.610
In short, the Kluge Center
aims to bridge the division

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.760
between knowledge and power.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.930
The Kluge Center supports
visiting scholars each year,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.550
both at the junior
and the senior levels.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.110
We want our residential scholars

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.650
to utilize the Library's vast
collections and spend time

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.720
with our knowledgeable
experts and curators.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.050
We also want our scholars

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.730
to share their discoveries
and insights.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.810
The Kluge Center does that
through a variety of programming

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.490
for the general public,
for members of Congress

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.790
and for congressional staff.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.390
In that regard, I
would be remiss

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.860
if I did not make you aware

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.470
of some terrific Kluge
programming in the near future.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.410
Tomorrow, Dr. Bruce Jentleson,
a former Kluge Kissinger Chair,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.490
will discuss his new
book, The Peacemakers.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.060
That event will take
place in room 119

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.340
of the Jefferson Building
just across the street.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.790
Additionally, there is a wide
variety of programs scheduled

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.010
for the coming weeks
ranging from Italian opera

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.610
to the Bible's role
in American history.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.310
Please check the Kluge Center
website for more information.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.210
Finally, we are proud to
cosponsor this event today

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.090
with the University of Denver.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.060
I'd now like to welcome Dean
Daniel McIntosh to the stage

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
who will provide introductory
remarks for our panel.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.340
&gt;&gt; Daniel McIntosh:
Hi, I'm Danny McIntosh.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.130
I'm the dean of Arts,
Humanities and Social Sciences

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.830
at the University of Denver,
and it is a real pleasure

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.100
to be cohosting this
with the Kluge Center

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010
and the Library of Congress.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.690
The University of Denver is a
private university dedicated

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.240
to the public good.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.300
As such a university, we
hope to engage scholars

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.880
and the community across the
nation and across the world.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.000
We believe there should be no
barriers between scholarship

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.760
and practice, no barriers

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.930
between campus and
the community.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.410
Therefore, we encourage and we
support our students, faculty

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.860
and staff to engage with
the wider communities

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.900
to share their scholarship
and to be in conversation

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.920
with scholars, staff people

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.450
and the community
across the country.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.850
We want to model this
integration not only in our work

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.820
but also in our students'
experiences.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.310
From psychology students
who prepare research reports

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.360
and plans for nonprofits
in the city of Denver

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.780
to religious study
students who work as interns

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.530
in faith-based organizations
across the country.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.330
And from anthropology students
who work with rural Coloradans

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.880
and Japanese-Americans
interpreting the events

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.860
and the remnants of the Amache
Internment Camp, our students go

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.930
from the classroom to the field
to the lab understanding how

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.270
to integrate and tie together
scholarship and application.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.150
One example of this
effort at the University

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.060
of Denver is the Center
on American Politics.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.220
The Center on American
Politics is a new organization

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.040
that is interdisciplinary
that ties together scholars

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.260
from the law school, from arts,
humanities and social sciences,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.940
political science, sociology
and international studies,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.080
all working to understand
the very basis

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.950
of politics in America.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.540
Politics are the way that
people's voices are heard.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.270
It's important for us to
understand how this works.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.550
One of the speakers today
is Professor Seth Masket,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.480
professor in the Political
Science Department and director

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.760
of our new Center on
American Politics.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.900
We want to be part
of the conversation.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.920
We want to be a part of applying
our scholarship to issues

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.810
that are important to critical
issues of the time, and as such,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.930
we are pleased to be
cosponsoring this even

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.840
with the Kluge Center and
the Library of Congress.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.950
With that, I'd like to introduce
our moderator, John Haskell,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.280
who's the director of
the Kluge Center here

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.820
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.180
Thank you.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.480
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank
you, Dean McIntosh.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.130
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.840
And as Colleen pointed out a
minute ago, we're really happy

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.360
to work with the
University of Denver

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.960
because we're doing
what we both want to do,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.420
which was to bring our
scholars, to bring scholarship

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.720
to the wider community.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.100
And in this particular
case, we have Seth

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.650
and also two other scholars.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.120
And I'll say a couple of
other things about Seth

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.420
that weren't mentioned.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.200
He's already, he is the
chair in American Law

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.050
and Governance here
at the Kluge Center.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.680
He just started in May,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.920
and he'll be here
through the summer.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.780
And we have other
programming in mind for him.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.340
He is, as pointed out, the head
of the Center at the University

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.930
and is very well-regarded.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.550
He is a classic of the kind
of scholar we try to bring

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.980
to Kluge Center because not
only is he well-respected

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.550
within the field, one of the
leaders within the field,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.290
speaking to other academics,
he's out there on 538 and a lot

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.460
of other sites and writes
for a much larger audience.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.450
Jennifer Victor is in
that same category.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.810
Her PhD is from Washington
University.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.390
She's been at George Mason
University as a professor

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.090
of American Politics
and Legislative Politics

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.930
with a specialty area
of political parties,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.960
and we're glad to have
her for the first time

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.930
at a Kluge Center event.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.040
Yuval Levin right here to my
right is a political scientist,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.900
also a political philosopher
University of Chicago.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.660
He's at the Ethics and Public
Policy Center as a fellow.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.930
He's also the editor
of National Affairs.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.340
He's working on a
book right now that is

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.370
on American institutions, and
he's thinking about issues

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.770
about the future
of institutions,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.070
including the political parties.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.850
So we're going to launch right
into questions, and I'm going

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.700
to ask Jennifer to
set the stage.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.450
In simple terms, Jennifer,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.610
what role do political
parties play in the US?

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor: Wow,
I didn't know I was going to be

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.080
on the hot seat first.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.000
So, at a really basic
level, the scholarship

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.490
in political science
has thought of parties

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.300
in different concepts
over history.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.350
The classic way that I often
describe it to students is

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.690
as a tripartite organization
that's really sort

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.020
of three separate organizations.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.200
We think of parties in the
electorate as the partisan ship,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.200
the party ID that voters hold.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.980
Then we think of parties in
Congress as the organized bodies

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.820
within the legislature that
helped to pass legislation

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.780
and control agendas
and build coalitions

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.840
to achieve policy and so forth.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.760
And the third part we think
of parties as organizations.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.440
This is the DNC and
the RNC and all

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.520
of their component subsidiary
organizations at the national

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.820
and in the state levels.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.580
And for a long time, scholars
have thought of this tripartite

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.500
or setup of political parties

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.990
that in some ways is quite
useful but also can be kind

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.490
of confusing because
there's a lot of crossover

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.750
and overlap interplay
between these component parts.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.850
And a number of years
ago, sort of a new school

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.800
of thought emerged
around political parties

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.650
that conceptualized them as
more the network of actors.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.310
Some that are policy-oriented,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.680
some that are more
ideologically-oriented,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.270
where the parties themselves are
made up of activists and writers

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.050
and thinkers and voters and
donors and so forth that make

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.050
up these dense coalitions
of participants.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.270
So at the end of the day,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.280
whichever conceptualization
we think is most useful,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.550
given the current politics, I
think it's important to think

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.920
of parties ultimately
as organizations

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.930
that try to win elections.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.110
A party's job is to win
seats in a legislature,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.840
whether you're talking
about the Congress

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.220
in the state governments,
at the state level,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.610
and the various ways
that parties do

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.350
that get kind of complicated.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.600
One of the areas of
research that I spent a lot

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.960
of time looking at is
campaign finance and the way

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.660
that donor activity and campaign
finance activity plays into all

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.810
of those various party networks,
which I think is a big part

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.460
of the question as well.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I know
Seth and having read some

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.820
of the things you've written
that you speak similar

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.060
to what Jennifer said, parties,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.380
a key role is screening
candidates.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.470
And clearly, you want to
get the candidate you want

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.770
to achieve certain policy ends.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.730
But then of course,
they've got to get elected.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.610
Are parties today stronger
or weaker than they were

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.080
in that function say 20
years ago or 50 years ago?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.480
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Yeah, I'm going
to do the good academic thing

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.780
and dodge the question.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.150
It's, I don't know that
they're stronger or weaker,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.290
but they're very different than
they were 20 or 50 years ago

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.250
in the sense that the
things a party used to do,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.600
whether that's raise money
and spend it on advertising

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.390
or recruit candidates and train
them to run for office or,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.690
you know, help to
organize elections,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.970
help with voter turnout.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.310
The formal parties don't do as
much of that as they used to.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.540
In some ways, they're kind of
hampered from the ability to do

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.590
that due to a number of laws
that we've put in their way.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.910
But there are other groups
that can do those things.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.250
So for example, you know,
the democratic party works

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.280
with some democratic clubs
and some labor unions

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.540
and activists groups and
organizations like Emily's List

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.190
or the Human Rights Campaign
and other groups that do things

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.430
like train candidates
and help them get out

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.670
and organize a constituency.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.660
And they're all more or less on
the same page with each other,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.130
but it's very much in
the sort of network model

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.520
that Jen was talking about.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.660
That they coordinate these
activities across dozens

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.520
of different organizations.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.610
Now, does that mean
that they're weaker

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.910
or stronger than
they used to be?

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.530
In some ways, there
are probably some costs

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.000
to being spread apart,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.010
spread across all these
different organizations.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.310
They're still very polarized.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.200
They still have a set of
beliefs they believe in.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.050
But actually figuring
out, you know,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.350
what's your favorite candidate

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.020
across all these different
groups can be tricky.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.430
There's some evidence that this
fragmentation may have actually

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.620
contributed to polarization
in some ways,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.700
because when you have money and
all these other things going

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.300
through these very
passionate activists groups,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.150
you tend to have a
much more passionate

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.200
and ideological set
of actors involved.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.400
Whereas, the formal
parties themselves tend

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.370
to be pretty pragmatic.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.670
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yuval, do
you have a view on this?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.460
I'm saving the really,
really hard question for you.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Oh good.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.060
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
I just want to see

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.360
if you have a view
on what Seth --

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.660
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well
I, well, first of all,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.960
thank you for doing this
and for involving me in it.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.190
I've learned an enormous amount
from Jennifer's work on Congress

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.840
over the years and from
Seth on parties is less,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.140
but I think it's your last book,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.880
The Inevitable Parties is really
a fantastic set of insights

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.500
on these very questions.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.380
I think the parties are
certainly weaker than they were

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.620
if we think of them as actually
possessed of some purpose.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:40.310
A party is, the goal of a
party is to allow a coalition

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.470
to cohere and to then help

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.320
that coalition win
elections and govern.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.460
And I think that it
would be easy to show

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.330
that our coalitions have more
trouble cohering than they used

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.600
to and more trouble governing.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.200
And I do think that
that weakening

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.150
of the parties has a lot
to do with all of that.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.730
The fact that some of the
functions of the parties

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.030
because of campaign finance laws
and other things have been moved

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.280
to other groups means that
they're now in the hands

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.820
of groups whose function is not
to enable a coalition to cohere

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.880
and then to get elected and
to govern but rather groups

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.560
that have narrower purposes
than that and purposes

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.520
that very often are
at odds with the goal

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.390
of allowing coalition to cohere.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.100
And I certainly think
that has a lot to do

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.500
with why we have
become more polarized.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.800
We have this odd situation,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.130
a number of political
scientists have pointed this

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.100
out of intense partisanship
amid weak parties.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.300
And those things are
connected to each other.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.980
We have turned over the
functions of parties to groups

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.800
who have much more of an
interest in polarization

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.000
and much less of an
interest in broad,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.340
nationally electable coalitions.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.220
And so I think the parties as
institutions are much weaker

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.240
than they used to be, and I
think we pay a price for that.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.270
We should want them to be
stronger, though if you want

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.590
to find an unpopular cause

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.820
in American politics,
the parties are it.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.280
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So, is the
weakness of the party due

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.430
to the fact that voters, and
particularly young voters,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.510
not really associate with
them or identify with them?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.480
Or is that a dependent variable?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.980
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well,
I think it's related.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980
But voters are polarized.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.730
Voters are, even people who
call themselves independents,

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.700
as a general matter, voters now
identify themselves on the left

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.130
and right in a more coherent
way, not a less coherent way,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.350
than you would have
found a generation ago.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.000
And yet, the parties
are not stronger.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.890
And I think part of that
has to do with the fact

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.560
that we have treated the parties

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.290
as institutions is part
of the problem here.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.070
Rather than seeing them as
potentially part of the solution

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.870
to the problem of polarization.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.940
And the parties have
just become, they've come

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.240
to have less

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.690
of an organizational
institutional existence.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.840
They're just platforms
for individuals.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.140
You really see that.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.360
I mean look, half the people who
ran for president as republicans

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.880
in 2016 ran in order to
elevate their media profile.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.180
They were just running

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.910
to get better contracts
in TV and radio.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.170
And the party couldn't
stop that.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.470
There was nothing they
could do about it.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.380
In fact, I think the
person who ended up winning

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.950
and winning the presidency
probably started

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.380
out running that way.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.130
And the party turned out to be
pretty helpless against that

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.780
because it's lost a sense of
itself as an organization,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.910
with members, not just
the kind of open field

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.980
to populate the rest
of our democracy.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.450
And so the loss of that
self-identity as an institution,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.340
I think, is certainly
a sign of weakness.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.640
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Jennifer,
where are you on that question

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.940
of the overall health
of the parties?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.890
I think Yuval made clear
his position on that.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.390
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
No, I definitely agree

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.520
that parties have been
demonized in American politics.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.240
Americans like to
point to partisanship.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.830
And part of the reason
I think that happens is

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.240
because Americans tend

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.980
to not differentiate
partisanship from parties.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.590
They think that's the same
word and means the same thing.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.380
And so if republicans
and democrats

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.680
and them fighting is what's
wrong with us, that must mean

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.660
that parties is what's
wrong with us.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.490
But in fact, these
are separate things.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.850
Partisanship is polarized,
but parties themselves,

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.810
I'm not sure, I'm less
comfortable with describing them

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.900
as weak and more
comfortable describing them

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.620
as more highly decentralized.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.570
I think the networks in which
they operate are much broader

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.870
and include more players

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.390
than perhaps they
did 50, 60 years ago.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.030
But they have less central power
within each of their parties.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.840
And I think that largely
comes from two things.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.060
One is internal changes
within the parties themselves

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.880
about how they manage
their nomination processes

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.260
and how they funnel
their resources

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.220
and make their decisions about
who to support and so forth.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.600
And also, laws that
govern parties.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.390
And particularly here, laws
that govern campaign finance.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.600
So, the main role that parties
have is to recruit candidates

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.120
and fund them and
try to win elections.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.330
And when campaign finance
laws change in such a way

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.630
to diminish the power of
parties to do those things,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.870
so the laws that we have on the
books now give outside groups

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.130
and any wealthy donor that wants
to use their free speech right

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.460
to go and promote a
candidate to play that role,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.920
it weakens the power of the
party to control that process,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.120
which is how we wound up with
the republican kerfuffle.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.590
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So there
are, you know, no --

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.890
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll
Victor: Technical term.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.190
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
no single component

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.880
of the political system
exists in a vacuum, of course.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.740
So are the, is this
weakness of the parties

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.480
or the decentralization, I
guess is the word you prefer,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.870
more symptomatic of a
larger systemic issue?

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.940
The model probably feeds
into itself, but is it,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.030
are parties a significant
cause in it?

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor: Are
parties a cause of polarization?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.120
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Of a larger
problem in the political system.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.910
Or are they just
symptomatic of that?

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.940
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor: So
to me, a party is an institution

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.810
that performs the very
convenient feature

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.790
of solving collective
action problems that voters

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.330
or candidates or
legislators need to solve

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.950
in order to run democracy.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.930
So if parties didn't
exist we would create them

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.480
because we'd need
something to do that for us.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.810
So, to me, parties
are in fact, you know,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.900
we shouldn't be demonizing,
parties are the solution

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.260
to most of our problems.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.240
They are mechanisms by which
we can take disparate ideas

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.280
and use them to coalesce around
something, to build on the word

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.810
that you all have used earlier.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.900
So, where it contributes
to problems is in the idea

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.890
that we seem to think parties
are a part of the disease,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.980
and we've weakened
the structures

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.450
on which they operate, both
internally and externally.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.530
It's been sort of an endogenous
and exogenous force on them,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.170
that I think contributes
in now a sort

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.880
of a self-perpetuating problem.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Where are
you on this question, Seth,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.650
before I hit you with
another impossible question?

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.800
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I mean I tend to
agree with what Jen said here.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.870
You know, I see parties
as essentially they do,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.450
they're supposed to be
doing the parts of democracy

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.700
that voters themselves aren't
very good at by themselves.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.870
They're supposed to, you know,
take really complex topics

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.600
in groups of lots of
candidates and boil them

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.460
down into fairly
simple questions

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.660
of should we do this or that.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.430
Should we raise taxes
or lower them?

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.880
Should we make this
easier to obtain or harder?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.320
Or this candidate
or that candidate?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.020
And yeah, when we, you know,
when we essentially move too far

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.020
in the other direction,
it makes democracy harder.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.880
It makes it more
confusing for people.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.660
It makes voters want
to tune out.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.290
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So given
everything that all three

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.550
of you have said, is one party
or the other doing better?

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.960
Seth.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.260
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I think
one party is doing worse.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:46.260
So, I think, it's possible
to learn too much from 2016.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.710
There were many ways in
which it was possibly just a

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.250
flukish year.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.980
But the things we saw going

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.260
on in the republican
presidential nomination cycle

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.260
in 2016, I mean it was really
a pretty fascinating moment.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.710
Generally, what happens

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.230
in presidential nominating
cycles is that, you know,

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.690
party insiders, you know,
people, activists, major donors,

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.440
people who have just been
longstanding influential

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.290
within the parties,
kind of pick a favorite.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.960
They kind of, you know, long
before anyone starts voting

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.260
in Iowa or New Hampshire,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.560
they kind of lean toward
one candidate or lean away

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.860
from some other group
of candidates

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.160
who they think would be bad

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.910
for the country or
bad for the party.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.260
And the republican party just
didn't really make a choice

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.340
in 2016.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.320
A few people came out
an endorsed Marco Rubio,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.170
some were for Ted Cruz,
some with John Kasich,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.810
but they were kind of split.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.580
Most party leaders just
kind of stayed quiet.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.100
Most members of congress
on the republican side,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.340
governors just didn't
endorse anyone.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.890
And that's an environment, and
when you have 17 candidates,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.060
that's an environment in which
a very famous wealthy person can

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.130
just rise to the top in the
absence of a party signal.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.570
And that's really what
ended up happening in 2016.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.180
That didn't happen on
the democratic side.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.730
The democratic party more
or less got, you know,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.110
the candidate it wanted.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.770
The insiders were more or less
happy with Hillary Clinton.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.930
She had a long history
of policy stances

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.230
that were very consistent

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.880
with where the party
had been for some time.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.130
So they basically got a
conventional candidate.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.040
Does that mean they're
healthier?

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.340
I don't know.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.510
Are they, they might face
the same problem in 2020

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.380
that the republicans
had in 2016.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.250
You already have some two
dozen democrats or more

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.390
who have said they're interested
in running for office.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.680
And you know, in the
absence of a clear kind

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.120
of preferred candidate, it
could be just as fragmented

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.420
as the republican one.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.320
We'll be finding that out within
the next year, year and a half.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.640
I had made a point of saying
last year and during 2016

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.750
that the presidency
is not the only thing.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.830
That parties work with
lots of different offices.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.970
And just because something,
there is some cracking going

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.770
on in the presidential level
doesn't mean that's going

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.320
on at the state or local level.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.620
In fact, if you looked

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.160
at republican congressional
nominations in 2016,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.550
they were nominating pretty
conventional candidates.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.920
Then comes Roy Moore in Alabama.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.320
And then there's some
evidence in this cycle

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.960
that the republican party is
nominating a lot of people just

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.990
without any history in politics.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.860
And maybe that's good,
maybe that's bad,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.180
but it's just there is
an unusual dynamic going

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.570
on within that party.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.870
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So Yuval,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.170
do the republicans
have greater intentions

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.840
and ideological diversity?

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.470
I mean are they confronting
more challenges

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.580
in that realm or other realms?

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.940
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well, I
would say, and this relates

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.240
to the previous question
you asked too.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.880
I do think the parties
are subject to some

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.390
of the same pressures as
everything else in our society

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.690
and that this idea

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.470
of institutions getting turned
inside out and being turned

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.320
into platforms for individuals
is actually also a way

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.520
to understand what's going
on in Congress where a lot

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.490
of members come to Congress
to get more media exposure

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.860
and don't think fundamentally

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.300
about their roles
as legislators.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.230
It's certainly how the president
is behaving in the presidency

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.530
as a kind of performance artist.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.980
I think you see it in the,
you see it in the professions.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.460
It's a way to understand what's
happening in the universities.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.760
So it shouldn't surprise us

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.200
that this is happening
to the parties.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.420
If you had asked me
before the 2016 election,

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.820
I would have thought that the
republican party as a party was

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.490
in better shape than
the democratic party.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.360
I think Reince Priebus
as chairman

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.550
of the RNC devoted a lot
of attention and energy

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.570
to strengthening the party as
a multistate national party.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.920
He focused on the state parties.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.220
He had been a state
party chairman himself.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.610
And the work that
it had real effect.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.110
The party as an institution
looked much stronger for it.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.700
What he didn't do was think
at all about the party's role

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.000
in the presidential race.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.330
I think his expectation was that
it would just happen as it had.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.200
And when the race turned
out to be very unusual,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.210
Reince had no plan whatsoever.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.730
And he, as a result,
did nothing whatsoever.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.010
The assumption was these
strange candidates would rise,

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.310
and then they'd fall.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.610
That happened in 2012.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.910
It happened in 2008.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.210
You know, you'd have a period

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.360
where this populous
businessman would kind of seem

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.600
like he was leading, and
then he would disappear

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.060
and you'd have a
bunch of senators

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.930
and governors fighting it out.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.570
And I think that the party
apparatus itself expected

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.440
that to happen until
very late in the process.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.930
And very few, you know, there
was kind of Mike Lee screaming,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.230
standing at the window banging

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.220
on it screaming saying
stop this.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.180
But almost nobody else was
trying to get the party

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.460
to really act to resolve what
was basically a collective

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.470
action problem.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.740
You know, there were too many
candidates until very late,

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.390
and I think it was
the case that any two

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.030
of them combining their efforts
might have stopped Trump even

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.330
pretty late.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.060
And they wanted to,
and they didn't do it

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.360
because there was no way

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.240
to address the collective
action problem.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.170
Which is exactly what
the party is for.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.100
So, in the wake of 2016,
I think you have to say

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.360
that the republican
party looks weaker

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.810
than the democratic party.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.010
I think it's also the case
that they now have the problem

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.890
that the democrats had
during the Obama years,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.900
which is a president with a kind

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.750
of cultive [phonetic]
personality around him

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.390
in the party that
drives attention

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.460
and energy away from the party.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.510
And Obama did enormous damage

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.100
to the democratic party
as an institution.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.270
Because he himself was very
popular, and he didn't try

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.570
to use that popularity

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.750
to strengthen the party
really in any way.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.490
So that the democrats came

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.800
out of the Obama years much
weaker as a national party.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.610
They had much less
strength in the states.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.350
They'd lost a lot of seats
in state legislatures

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.460
and in local races
and state races.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.050
And a fair amount
of it had to do

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.310
with Obama drawing all the
attention and all the money.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.760
That's exactly what is
happening now with Trump.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.400
The party is having a lot
of trouble presenting a face

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.840
to the country, and it's
also suffering with a very,

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.390
with a very unusual generational
divide within the party.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.340
And I think it's not
getting enough attention

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.310
but is a huge problem
for the party itself

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.690
where older republicans
love Trump.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.870
You don't find republicans
over 60 who don't like him.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.290
You don't find republicans
under 30 who do like him.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.680
And the difference is very,
very intense, and it's felt

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.500
within every institution on
the right so that, you know,

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.190
that too is a kind of problem

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.560
that you would hope a
party could help deal with.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.320
But I don't think it's in
very good shape to do it.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.350
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So Seth,
you're studying here

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.350
at the Library how the
democrats are responding

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.120
to losing the 2016 elections.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.330
And you mentioned a minute ago

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.460
that they've got a couple
dozen people of some level

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.400
of seriousness at least.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:39.000
Where are they in terms of
the mistake, if Yuval's right,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.310
that Priebus made in not
really having a plan?

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.450
I mean, are they in a
position to have a plan,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.140
or is the democratic
party headed to something

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.440
that might resemble
what happened

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.400
with republicans in '16?

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.920
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I mean,
part of what I've been doing

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.380
in my career in research is
just interviewing democratic

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.250
activists in various early
primary and caucus states.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:04.520
And quite a few of them treated
2016 as kind of a wakeup call.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.270
You know, they are fully
cognizant of the kind

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.360
of underinvestment
at the state level.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.320
And, you know, they
didn't expect to lose

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.620
at the presidential level,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.920
but then once they lost
there they looked around

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.080
and said oh my God, we've lost
all these state legislatures.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.300
And so they're sort
of, you know,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.990
seeing this as an important
building time for that and kind

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.340
of reinvesting a lot into
state and local candidates.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:31.660
I think some of them are, you
know, feeling encouraged by some

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.010
of the special elections
that have been going

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.310
on over the last year.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.550
And the ability of the party
to essentially pick candidates

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.150
who are appropriate for
their various districts,

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.070
conservative candidates or
at least moderate candidates

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.370
in the more conservative
districts

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.700
and pretty liberal candidates
in the more liberal districts.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.890
But they were also, you know,

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.830
caught off guard
in so many ways.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.910
And they're still trying to
navigate the current system.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.980
And they definitely haven't
come up with a plan for 2020.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.910
Most of them are not quite
thinking at that level just yet.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.760
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Jennifer,
what's your view on that?

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.930
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll
Victor: So, theoretically,

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.680
I think parties would
be better off

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.980
if they separated presidential
elections from state and local

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.540
and congressional elections.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.070
Because they're two
separate processes.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.200
And this collective action
process of coalescing

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.350
around the national candidate
during a presidential election

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.970
is a totally different type of
coordination that needs to go

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.410
on than what goes on, for
example, what we're seeing

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.250
in the midterm election
season happening right now.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.590
And primaries where politics
really is much more local

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.230
and about congressional
districts and so for.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.240
And we're seeing
different kinds of variation

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.470
across the primaries right now.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.300
But I think that our
politics has become

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.080
so much more nationalized.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.380
Our parties, I think,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.480
are essentially severely
hampered to separate these.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.500
I think if they could operate
as a national organization

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.030
that focuses on presidential
elections

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.850
and then local organizations
that focused on congressional

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.440
and state and local elections,
and they had the infrastructure

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.390
and the financing set up and
so forth to actually operate

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.240
that way, it would be better.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.590
And I think it's essentially
very difficult for them to do

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.760
that now, in part, because
our politics itself is

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.010
so nationalized and partisanship
and parties are seen

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.310
as such a national thing.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.860
And you know, we can think
about how media plays into that

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.000
and national agenda and
discussion and so forth

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.280
and just how much space there
is in any local, you know,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.200
any local congressional
district.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.540
The air in the room is being
sucked up by national politics.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.290
And so it's more difficult
for the parties to play

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.590
at that diverse level.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.890
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So
are there any ways

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.530
that they can change
the way they go

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.000
about doing their business
that might address that?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.200
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
I think there possibly are,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.520
and Seth is closer to
what the parties are doing

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.640
at the more local level
and the infrastructure

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.690
of the organizations than I am.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.660
But I have a sense that if
parties were empowering their

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.940
localities in ways that
allowed them to engage

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.270
in candidate recruitment
and candidate training

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.940
and constructing the local
issues, whatever they are,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.620
in ways that advantaged
the partisan candidates

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.420
in local districts.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.940
Whether that's state legislature

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.970
or congressional
districts, whatever.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.960
That that would be
advantageous to the parties

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.260
at the national level.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.620
But they need to have the
tools and the resources

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.920
to be able to localize.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.360
And the parties have
to be willing

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.140
to have a local candidate
that flies off the rails

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.050
and maybe doesn't follow
the national agenda

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.140
on a particular issue.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.320
But in general, politics is
not about issues these days.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.720
The partisanship and the
parties and the camps

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.020
in which we see ourselves

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:45.040
as partisans is really driving
people's taste for politics.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.690
So it, to me, that
should empower parties

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.010
to like let the issues go.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.310
The issues don't matter.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.560
It almost doesn't matter what
issues the local candidates are

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.090
going to talk about because
the partisanship is going

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.520
to rule the day anyway.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.110
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Do you all
have a view on, when you read

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.070
about what's going on
within the democratic party

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.300
and the primaries, Seth
made an observation

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.710
about the republicans this year.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.260
You know, we're going
back to Roy Moore.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.880
And it's sort of the Sanders

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.670
and other progressive
organizations doing battle,

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:21.260
you know, with democrats
who want to see candidates

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.380
who might be slightly
more moderate.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.050
Where is the democratic
party on this?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.910
Are they headed for
some sort of crackup?

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:34.720
Or is this just really
just about style?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
We need another cycle.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.320
We don't know yet.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.620
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Don't know yet.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.530
Time to make a prediction.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.440
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well look,
I think they are going

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.590
through a fight between
their activists

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.770
and their elected officials,
especially in Washington

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.070
that is interesting to watch.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.370
Democrats in Washington
I think have a sense

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.720
that they should not go too far

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.240
and that they cannot make Trump
the focus of everything they do.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.070
But the activists' energy
wants to do just that.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.250
And that's a problem
that's very similar

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:05.970
to the one republicans
faced in dealing

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.700
with Barack Obama
during the last

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.480
presidential administration.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.640
I think the democrats have
the added pressure here.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.410
If they win the House,
they're going to need

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.980
to impeach the president.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.030
It'll be very hard for them
to avoid at least starting

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.330
that process because that's
where their activists are.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.400
And I would say the leaders
of the democratic party

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.040
in Washington do
not want to do that,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.490
because they don't
think it would be good

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.620
for the party going forward.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.410
But good luck to them
trying to stop it.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.400
I think they will be under
immense pressure to do it.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.490
So it's not a crackup
in the sense

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.120
that the party falls apart,

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.450
but I think that it's intense
pressure that is the kind

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.320
of thing that a party might
exist to help address.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.590
And so it'll be a test.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.100
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So Jennifer,
you brought up campaign finance,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.020
you know what do we need
to look at and think

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.550
about if there were going
to be reforms in that area

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.610
or either changes in
the ways the parties go

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.390
about their business?

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.810
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
Yeah, so it's a sticky issue.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.280
It's very complicated.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.660
But the, so the Supreme Court,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.540
so we changed the campaign
finance law in 2002

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.880
under what was known as
the McCain Feingold Bill.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.050
And then it got updated
again in 2010

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.400
with the Supreme Court decision

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.930
and some following
FEC decisions known

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.940
as Citizens United
and then Speech Now.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.510
And the result of those reforms

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.610
over that period are a
great decentralization

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.470
of our campaign finance
system where the parties used

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.600
to have quite a bit of
power in controlling things,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.300
and there was this soft money.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.620
Everybody was worried about the
soft money through all the 70s,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.170
80s and 90s, and this was the
big thing that John McCain

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:41.220
and his various political
partners were all worried about.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.620
The parties were being used

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.210
as a basically a money
laundering machine

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.700
that were allowing donors to
funnel as much unlimited money

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.340
as they want to candidates.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.700
But it turns out in retrospect,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.730
that money laundering was
somewhat healthy for the system

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.160
because it was giving
the parties control

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.560
over where the money went.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.570
So what we have now is the soft
money in that sense is gone.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.470
The parties aren't doing
that funneling anymore

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.160
because of the ways
the laws have changed.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.680
But that money is
still out there,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.650
and it's just happening
on its own.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.650
So whatever wealthy donors
or organizations or activists

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.600
or whoever want to get involved,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.220
they're out there
picking their candidates

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.870
or picking their horse in
local races or national races

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.470
and just going after them.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.030
Now to stay within the
confines of the law,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.850
they technically are not allowed
to coordinate with the parties.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.610
Otherwise, then it's seen
as a campaign donation,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.020
and it's limited by law.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.730
So they're in this
atmosphere where they can raise

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.790
as much money as they
want in this unlimited way

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.930
without the party
filter that tends

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.680
to kind of moderate things.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.500
So, it would be helpful, I
think, to change the laws

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.300
in a way that strengthens
parties,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.840
that gave parties more control
over where the money came

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.720
from and where it went.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.510
It's not clear to me what the
viable, either legislative

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.060
or judicial path to make
that happen is at this point.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.360
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.660
What do you think, Seth?

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.960
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Just on the --

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.260
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Yeah, the question --

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.560
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Fixing
the party kind of thing?

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.860
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah,
fixing the parties broadly

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.160
but on the campaign
finance side.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.320
You know, because, you know,
Jennifer refers back in the 90s,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.290
you know, Clinton allegedly
rented out the Lincoln bedroom.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:13.090
So that made it look bad even
if it was good for the party,

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.750
right, to do that kind of thing.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.230
And then yeah, you
know, he found,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.460
I guess his people found the
big loophole at that time.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.240
Is there something that
we don't know about now?

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.610
Well, of course, if we
don't know about it,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.270
we can't talk about it, right.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.720
But you know, we have to think
a little bit outside the box.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.530
There's going to be reform,
you know, things that worked

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.090
in the past probably
aren't going to work now

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.390
for all kinds of reasons.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.690
You know, where are you on that?

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.170
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Yeah, I mean,
the problem, this is the basis

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.520
of my last book, you know,
every time we reform them,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.870
there's all these
unanticipated consequences

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.780
that we don't always
think about.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.210
And, you know, when
you attempt to sort

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.640
of wall off a certain
type of spending,

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.720
the money is going
to get there somehow.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.860
If someone wants to so spend on
a race, someone wants to donate

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.570
to a candidate, somehow,
that money is going

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.870
to get into the system.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.870
It's just a matter of, you know,

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.000
every time we cut off a
certain barrier for it,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.270
we make that money
less traceable.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.390
And we make the system of
just tracking who donated

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.910
to whom a lot harder to follow.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.230
Which is generally
undesirable things.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.230
Yeah, I would love to see,
you know, similar with Jen,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.250
I would love to see more
of, more funding going

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.220
through the formal party system.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.760
I would love to see the parties
themselves have more power

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.430
to allocate that money rather
than sending it across,

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.670
you know, 100 different groups.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.700
You know, more generally,
just kind of outside

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.630
of the campaign finance
system, and this is, I know,

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.930
an uphill battle,
but I would love

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.150
to see the parties
being less democratic.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.540
That is --

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.840
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Small D.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.140
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Yeah,
yeah, small D democratic.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.690
That is, you know, more
elite-driven, less, you know,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:53.330
less subject to what individual
members within the party want.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.520
The Democratic National
Committee right now,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.970
this summer, is probably,
they're working

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.270
on some sort of reforms.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.120
They're probably
they're going to get rid

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.860
of their superdelegate
system, or they're going

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.340
to substantially sort of
disempower the superdelegates.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.090
The superdelegates
are, of course,

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.800
the people within the party.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.160
They're DNC members.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.420
They're elected officials
who have a vote

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.780
at the nominating convention,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.160
regardless of what
primary voters want.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.070
And just as some of the
reforms coming out of 2016,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.880
they're going to substantially
disempower those people

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.220
most likely.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.040
And which is in some ways
remarkable given what they saw

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.080
going on in the republican
side in 2016

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.060
where in many ways it leads
to not have enough control

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.360
over what was going on.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.090
They're moving in
that same direction

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.390
that the republicans moved.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.120
Now, I haven't been
hugely impressed

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.940
with the power superdelegates
have

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.870
or the power they're willing
to exercise to push back

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.700
against their own party voters.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.880
But if anything, the parties
seem to be moving in more

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.190
of a small D democratic
direction.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:58.110
Which I think in some ways
carries a lot of danger.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.810
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And I
know, Yuval, a lot of,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.990
when you read a lot
about a republican

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.790
or conservative intellectual
said well let's have the

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.270
republican party, let's define
it the way we want to define it,

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.570
free trade, low taxes, etcetera,
cutting back on entitlements,

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.090
and Trump doesn't fit that.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.400
You know, there's a lot of talk

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.000
in conservative intellectual
circles.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.880
And so let's be clear
what our party is about

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.780
and that there are
short-term consequences.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.270
But nobody really had the
power to do that, right.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.200
I mean, is that effort
still going on?

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.360
Is there any prospect of
success for that kind of effort?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.790
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well, I
think that it's not been much

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.670
of an actual concrete effort.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:45.170
I do agree that there are ways
to re-empower the parties some

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.130
in our system relative to
the other forces at work.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.890
And I think that allowing the
parties to raise much more money

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.780
but in a more transparent
way, we sort of have

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.200
to ask ourselves, what is
the least illegitimate place

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.500
for all that money to go?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.960
And I think the parties are
the answer to that question.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.950
So that, because their goal
is to create broad coalitions.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.000
And that's what we have to
want our politics to involve.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.790
And so I think we ought to allow
the parties to be the place

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.980
where a lot of money goes
provided that it is transparent.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.250
And it also seems to me that the
party is gaining some control

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.670
over their own processes
are a way to address some

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.390
of these problems, as Seth
suggests, that the parties have

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:27.900
to realize that they are owners
of very, very powerful brands.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.290
They have a banner.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.990
And whoever gets that banner in
a presidential election is going

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.730
to get at least 45% of
the vote in that election.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.440
Literally whoever they are.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.510
I mean, if we have learned
anything, it is that.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.270
And so they have got to realize

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.780
that that is an immense
responsibility.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.490
And to take very seriously the
responsibility they have to own

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.320
that banner that comes
with 45% of the vote

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.350
in a presidential election.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.160
You know, that person
is basically going

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.620
to have pretty much an even
shot of becoming president.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.800
So they need to think about how
they choose who that person is,

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.230
because they have an
obligation to the country.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.910
And at this point,
they just fall

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.210
down on the job in doing that.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.090
They allow it to
happen of its own.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.590
I think republicans
have a tendency

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.600
to following the
democrats in setting rules.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.790
They're kind of lackadaisical
in setting rules

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.290
for nominating processes.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.170
The rules of the presidential
nominating process now were

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.470
adopted after the democrats

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.440
after I think a pretty
thoughtful process in the 1970s

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.120
where they really fought
out their differences.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.900
And the process that
emerged from that is suited

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.200
to the dynamics

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.500
of the democratic
coalition at the time.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.010
And then the republican party
just adopted it wholesale

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.310
without really thinking

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.390
about how it related
to its own coalition.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.670
Something like that
is happening again.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.550
I think the democrats
are talking about how

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.850
to change the process.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.160
I don't know if they'll
be able to do it,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.170
but they're at least
thinking about it.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.010
There's really nothing
at all like that going

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.800
on that I can see on
the republican side.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.920
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
I just wanted to add

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.450
that thinking about, I
think it's worthwhile

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.610
to take a slightly longer view
in thinking about how we got

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.990
to this point where our parties
are relatively decentralized.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.150
Because I think there's
a tradeoff, right.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.360
So, if you go back to the
early part of the 19th

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.150
or 20th century, what you had
were really centralized parties.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.450
You, in fact, had party bosses

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.200
in the proverbial
smoke-filled room.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.770
And these, you know,
a couple of people

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.750
who basically made all the
choices about who were going

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.160
to be the candidates and
where the money was going

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.500
to go and so forth.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.240
And that system was
incredibly correct.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.930
And it was easily captured,

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.870
and it was very un-small
D democratic.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.240
And so the push in the 100
years since then, I think,

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.770
has been towards more
democratization of the parties

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.200
to give the voters
greater influence in all

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.000
of those things, the candidate
selection and recruitment

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.080
and everything that parties do.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.760
And what we're seeing
now is we're

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.700
at the other end
of that spectrum.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.000
And what we're seeing is,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.870
there's huge costs
to this end as well.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.160
And so there's essentially
a tradeoff, I think,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.180
between centralized parties
and decentralized parties

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.100
where at one end you
get left polarization

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.260
and really effective clean
results but with corruption.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.920
And at the other end, you get
dysfunction and disorganization.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.930
But we don't have that kind
of corruption that we used

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.640
to be worried about
like, I mean,

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.500
yeah you get a Jack
Abramoff story or something

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.800
like that every once in a while,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.100
but those are really
pretty rare these days.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.400
Like we've really
gotten rid of that type

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.150
of corruption in our politics.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.020
And the price that we're paying
for it is this dysfunction,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.320
this terrible polarization.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.620
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We focus
on the glass half-full --

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor: So I
feel like there's an equilibrium

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.400
to be had in the middle, but the
parties, it's not clear to me

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.140
at all the parties as an
organizations, if I could speak

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.350
of them as having
a central brain,

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.310
are aware of the necessity
of finding that equilibrium.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.610
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Before
we get to some questions

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.730
from the audience, I wanted to,
you know, play off on one thing

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.660
that Yuval said, and I think
he's right, that each party kind

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.160
of starts with 45% in a
presidential election.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.650
Sometimes they don't
get much more than that.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.730
But and so, democratic
banner, republican banner,

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.080
Seth what's the chances
there could be a different

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.460
banner sometime?

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.700
What would that look like?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.500
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Not large.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.800
Well, I mean, I mean --

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.760
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I mean
France suddenly, you know,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.610
overnight suddenly they have
a guy getting all the votes

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.090
and getting all the
legislative seats.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.550
Different system.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.340
And now Italy is
doing the same thing.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.040
I mean sometimes, you know,
sometimes what happens

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.340
in Europe affects us here.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.790
It doesn't always go
the other direction,

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.540
even if we'd like to think that.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.840
And so there's something

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.620
out there that's a
dissatisfaction obviously

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.300
that I don't know whether
it's reached that level

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.040
or whether our system is more,
you know, ossified or something.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.050
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: You know, I
mean, this is one of those areas

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.350
where I think we
probably focus too much

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.070
on the presidential level

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:45.480
where the two party outcomes
just are very resilient.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.540
I mean you could possibly see
a scenario where, you know,

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.510
Trump suddenly becomes
very unpopular.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.140
There's a recession or
something like that.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.900
If republicans want to
run someone else in 2020,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.100
and he splits off and
forms his own party.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.490
I mean you could sort of
see something like that

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.200
but probably not
lasting in the long run.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.170
There was a fascinating
sort of counterexample

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:10.530
to this in Colorado in 2010.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.820
There was a gubernatorial
election.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.290
That's where the democrats
first elected John Hickenlooper.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:20.230
The republicans threw
a bizarre series of,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.010
it was a big tea party rally,
and it was a scandal for sort

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.310
of the favorite candidate.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.480
And this little-known tea party
activist named Dan Mayes ended

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.870
up getting the republican
nomination

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.310
through the primary there.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.400
And the republican
party didn't like him.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.220
Like all the republican
leaders said this guy is

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.520
totally irresponsible.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.820
He was going all over the place

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.740
with these very paranoid
theories

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.410
about how the UN
was going to take

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:47.170
over through a bike sharing
program and that sort of thing.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.030
He was quite sincere.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.460
So a lot of state republican
leaders backed Tom Tancredo

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.310
as a third-party candidate
to run for governor.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.030
Knowing it was probably
going to split the vote

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.180
but basically saying we
don't want to win with this.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.420
We don't, we think this is
actually bad for the party

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.160
in the long run if we all
rallied behind our nominee.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.930
And it did split
the republican vote,

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.070
and Hickenlooper won
in a pretty easy run.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.990
But that sort of thing happens
a little more at the state

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.970
and local level than
you definitely see

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.270
at the presidential level.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.120
But again, the two-party
system is so deeply engrained

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.870
and so favored by the
systems we have here.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.560
If we did have a third party,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.930
it would likely become the
second party very quickly

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.750
if the other party
just disappeared.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.370
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Any
thoughts on that Yuval?

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:35.670
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Well, I agree.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.970
I think we've seen
that a little bit.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.480
The durability of
a two-party system,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.030
even when the federalists or the
Whigs went away pretty quickly

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.910
or back to a two-party system,
the 1912 presidential race

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.210
where the republicans
were really split,

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.110
and there were really
two republican candidates

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.800
and three presidential
candidates.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.400
That seemed like the end
of the republican party.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.980
And one cycle later, the party
was back basically to itself.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.820
And so, you know, a part of it
is structural in the first past

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.830
to post election system
and the rest of it.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.740
I think our system
really is just geared

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.120
to a two-party system.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.040
That doesn't mean it
could never change,

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.870
but I think the parties
have survived times

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:15.170
that have been more
dramatically problematic

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.470
than what they're
going through now.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.770
It could get crazier.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.070
It could get worse.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.690
But I don't see it
at this point.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.990
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank
you all for your insights.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.790
We'll move to some questions.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.260
Let's bring it up to the
gentleman in the front.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.420
Wait, we've got a
microphone for you here.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:35.880
&gt;&gt; How does like polarization

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.120
in the general population
play a part in this?

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.130
Like, I've noticed, at
least in my lifetime,

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.890
it's really increased
how people are very,

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.820
either extremely democratic
or extremely republican.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.250
I mean it happens in my
school, and it happens

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.690
in people older than me.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.990
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: You know,
one of the striking things

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.000
about polarization is the most
aggressively partisan people

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.410
hate their parties
on both sides.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:03.000
And so there is a way in which
strengthening polarization

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.220
actually undermines the strength
of the parties as institutions,

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.240
as organizations, and
empowers these smaller groups

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.580
that represent kind of
subcultures within the party.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.490
And so I think it's
not a coincidence

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.980
that we've seen increasing
polarization at the same time

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.330
as weakening institutional
parties.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.160
Part of what the parties do is
broaden their own coalitions

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.270
and allow a republican who's
running in Massachusetts

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.720
to be a little less
conservative than a republican

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.250
who is running in Texas.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.860
And that becomes more difficult
to do as polarization grows

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.430
and the parties weaken
at the same time.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.910
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Who else
had something over here?

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.910
Greg, that guy in the middle.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.440
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you all for coming

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.950
out to the Library
of Congress today.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.970
I just had a question
regarding the future of parties

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.240
in regards to voter systems.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.420
And I'm based in New England
recently, and there's been a lot

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.210
of talk about Maine and perhaps
Vermont adopting the instant

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.570
runoff choice system of voting.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.090
Which would most likely
theoretically collapse the idea

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.890
of big time coalitions,
but at the same time,

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.900
give people more fluidity
when it comes to elections.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.170
If something like this was
implemented or advocated

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.460
for at the national level,
could you see it succeeding?

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.870
And if so, what do you
think the outcome would be?

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:26.340
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Seth
might should speak to that.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.640
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Oh man.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.940
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Sorry about that.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.240
That's a great question.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.580
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I think
it's actually trying

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.430
to implement something
like instant runoff voting

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.060
at the national level.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.600
There's a lot of
questions in there.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.420
Are we talking about
making that part

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.160
of the electoral college
calculation within every state?

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.160
Are we talking about an
actual national popular vote?

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.780
There's a lot of
changes that would have

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.770
to occur to get to that point.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:53.980
It's potentially an
interesting case though.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.020
And it's possible to
see if you had some sort

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.420
of like a national
primary system

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.800
with instant runoff voting.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.270
You might have had, you know,
the republicans might have come

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.570
up with something very different

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:08.920
than Donald Trump
last time around.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.820
If you have, if there's no
one who everyone, you know,

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.030
seems to like for their
first-round choice,

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.490
but everyone is sort of
okay with John Kasich

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:19.080
or something like that.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.960
You could end up with that
sort of a consensus nominee.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.690
There was, I mean
even going back to,

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.080
there was some great quote
from when Lincoln was running

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.110
in 1860, that his whole
strategy, I think,

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.320
it was actually a quote from
him saying my whole strategy is

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.570
to be everyone's second
favorite candidate.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:42.310
You know, just so, so all of the
sort of most passionate people

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.740
on every side of the party just
kind of cancel each other out.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.910
They all say yeah, but
I'd be okay with him.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.270
And that's kind of
how you get in.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:49.670
And I think something

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:52.930
like instant runoff voting
actually helps that occur.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We've
got somebody over here.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:55.530
Right there, Mike.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.680
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks for coming out.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.220
So my question is
a bit reflective.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.110
When I was younger, I am older,
a lot older than what I look.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.380
So when I was younger, I did
ten years in the Marine Corps,

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.040
so I always had this mindset
that you can pull yourself

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.810
up by your bootstraps.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.250
Now that I'm 40 plus
and have two kids,

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:22.700
one 17 and 15, I've
been a teacher.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.550
And I've seen that that is not
the case for African-Americans.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:30.960
So as I taught fourth grade,
teaching them the 13th,

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.610
14th and 15th Amendments, and
especially that 14th Amendment

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.270
about equality for
African-Americans.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.230
And we were discussing the
Brown versus Board of Education.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.500
And I've lived in
many states before,

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.440
but then I started
reading and learning

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.870
about how Virginia was able
to circumvent that Brown

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.650
versus Board of Education
and how

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.230
that still plays a part
today in our education system

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:04.120
and how negatively it
impacts African-Americans.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:10.190
And I was talking to my husband
yesterday, and I was like,

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.890
where could an African-American
mom, our family go

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:18.220
to an African-American
community that is thriving?

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:23.350
That you have doctors, lawyers,
hospitals that look like you,

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:27.580
there's very few
places that you can go.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.890
And I asked him that question
because I spent a year

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:37.920
as a teacher in a
very wealthy community

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.450
where teachers did
not want to work

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.340
with me simply because
of my color.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.210
That never happened to
me in the Marine Corps.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.750
And I can say well, thank God

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:50.470
for all the African-Americans
that came before me.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:54.630
But why would I want to put
my kids through that ordeal?

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:59.320
Why would they have to
endure that simply because,

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:04.550
and then I don't, republican or
democratic, there's not enough

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.860
of African-Americans
to make it a valid,

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.550
that we have a valid say.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.220
So regardless of
what party is voting,

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.800
when do we get past the
nationalism of isms?

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.430
When do we get past
that and look

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.060
at people for their humanity.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.480
Because we're spending
so much money making sure

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.100
that other countries do it
right, but we don't do it right.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.520
And I can't send my kids, my
daughter graduates next year.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.000
I don't feel comfortable sending
her into a work environment

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.430
that she has to endure
what I endured

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:50.730
and am still enduring simply
because we raise communities

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:54.550
to believe that we're one better
than the other because of isms.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.380
How do we address that?

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.900
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So I think one
of the ways we could maybe talk

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.900
about that is to talk about
how is it that minorities,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.100
whether ethnic or racial
or other, you know,

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.780
sexual orientation,
other minorities,

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.940
how do they get influenced
within the party system?

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.420
You know, what's a good
way to think about that?

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.590
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor: So
to me, part of what's going

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.490
on in polarization in
American politics right now,

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:21.790
and you're speaking primarily

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.170
about the African-American
community, which is largely

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.540
for the last 50 years or so
been kind of solidly married

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.820
to the Democratic party.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.860
For, largely, I was going
to say for better or worse,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:38.650
but really it's for worse that
throughout American history,

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.210
one party or the other has
essentially always kind of been,

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.290
I don't want to put this
impolitely, but sort of married

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.870
to the racist devil, right.

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:49.060
So for lots of the 19th century
and into the 20th century,

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.360
it was the democratic party.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.660
They were the party of slavery.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.320
They were the party that
controlled the South and fought

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.710
to maintain slavery and
then ultimately lost.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.830
But then found various
institutions to kind

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.950
of keep that culture going.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:03.380
Until you get to the middle
part of the 20th century,

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.470
and the democratic party
reforms on that issue.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:10.300
And you get actors like John
F. Kennedy and LBJ and others

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.370
who pick up the mantle
of civil rights.

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:14.530
The African-American has sort

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.700
of opportunistically
bringing this new portion

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.960
of the electorate
into the party.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.260
They did that quite well.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.200
The republican party
responds and pivots

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.320
by following what Nixon
called the southern strategy.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.510
And that sets off the
democratic and American

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.970
and republican parties on their,
what is now their current path

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.200
in which the democratic party
much more strongly holds the

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.810
mantle of civil rights.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:42.090
And the republican party is
often the counter to that.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:46.810
And so part of what I think
perpetuates this and prevents us

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.960
from getting beyond
it in some of the ways

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.530
that you're expressing
is that as a country,

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.100
we've never really
reconciled how

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.950
to get beyond our
legacy of slavery.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.820
We've never done a very
good job as a country

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.820
of showing complicity there and
showing some sense of contrition

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.750
for the role that we played
in perpetuating that economy

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.570
for hundreds of years.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.950
And it's now completely baked
into our political parties

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:18.070
in ways that is divisive
rather than in ways

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.440
that promote some
kind of healing.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.350
And lots of institutions
perpetuate this.

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.840
I'm not just talking about
structural racism, but I mean,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.120
federalism itself, the
fact that we have states

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.280
and United States Senate, like
all of these institutions were

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.220
in some ways created
to perpetuate slavery.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.930
And our inability to
overcome that issue

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.170
and to really fully
reconcile with it as a country

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:42.680
and as a people I think
has it much more baked

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.770
into our politics in ways
that are really difficult

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:48.710
to reconcile at this point
until we get political actors

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.660
who decide they want
to try to address that.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:56.600
So I often think about in the
post-Nazi period in Germany,

00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:00.610
you can't go into a town village
or hamlet in all of Germany

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:04.820
without finding some memorial
somewhere to the Holocaust.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.570
It's a part of the
national identity.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.560
It's a part of the
national culture

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.980
to show some national contrition

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.690
for their participation
in that genocide.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.950
And the Americans never
done that with slavery.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:20.210
And I think that affects the
way our partisan politics deals

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.490
with that issue even today.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:24.400
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So we have time
for one or two more questions.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.890
We'll take these two here.

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.190
David and then the
woman in front.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.280
&gt;&gt; Hi, I have a question
about party coalitions

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.210
and evolving party coalitions.

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:38.700
So, as all of you know, there's
an education realignment that's

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.270
occurred where the democrats
now have something close

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.190
to a 25-percentage point
advantage among whites

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.550
with college degrees.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.450
That wasn't true
even 15 years ago.

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:51.250
They have a 35-percentagge
point advantage with whites

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.000
with advanced degrees.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.380
And I wonder how long
a party coalition

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.790
on both sides can continue
in terms of the policies

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.990
that they advocate not
match its constituency.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.000
Because at the same time while
we have this difference in terms

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.770
of education, we also
see a closer correlation

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:13.570
between education and income

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.210
than we did even
a generation ago.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:19.310
And so, at some point, you would
expect actually the democrats

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:24.100
to flip and start advocating for
lower taxes and less regulation.

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:29.140
It's not happening right now,
but I wonder if you guys want

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.410
to speculate about what
will happen in a generation.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.730
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Tough question.

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.890
Either of you guys
want to say something.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.710
&gt;&gt; Yuval Levin: Sure,
I won't speak

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.470
to about what'll
happen in a generation.

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:43.080
Having gone through
2016, I don't even speak

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.200
about what will happen
next Wednesday.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.490
But I do think that we shouldn't
overestimate the degree

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:53.470
to which economic
interests drives voter's

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:55.810
self-understanding about
political interest.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.350
One of the things we've been
learning in this century

00:56:58.350 --> 00:56:59.970
about our politics is
that people who care

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.460
about what we think
of as kind of cultural

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.360
and identity issues
much more than they care

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.730
about economic issues.

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.030
And in some ways both

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.810
of the parties now are
advocating things that are

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:14.510
against the economic interests
of their core constituents.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:17.460
And you know, republicans
are the party of the elderly

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.050
that wants to change
social security,

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.200
or they used to want to.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.300
They're the party of the
working class that wants

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.690
to lower their boss' taxes.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.280
If you think about economics
that way, I mean politics

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.550
that way as an extension
of economics,

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:32.240
it just doesn't make sense.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.460
But the part coalition makes
more sense if you think

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.760
about what it is that people

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.500
in this economic
brackets value most

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.910
and what they care about,
what they believe in.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:45.760
I think in that way, the
coalitions make some more sense.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.690
And so it may be that what
you're really seeing is

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.320
that higher income people

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.480
in America have certain
cultural attitudes and views

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.570
that incline them more
toward the leftwing party

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.820
and our politics, and
the working-class people

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.310
in America tend to have more
conservative views on the issues

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:06.610
that they care about most.

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:09.470
So, you know, it used to be said
that conservatives care more

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.270
about the culture and liberals
care most about the economy.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:14.540
But the right keeps
winning on the economy,

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.840
and the left keeps
winning on the culture.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.480
So we're kind of
permanently frustrated.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.820
I think we're actually
at a point now

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.090
where both coalitions
seem to care most

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.010
about cultural issues
one way or another.

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:26.310
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Okay, last question.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.670
We have one of our friends
form the University of Denver.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:30.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:33.470
More women than ever are
running for office this year,

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:37.790
and I wanted to know, what do
we think the increased number

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.680
of women eventually
holding office,

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.410
if that will change anything

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.890
within the political
party system.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:44.190
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
That's a great question.

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:46.050
I think both Jennifer
and Seth speak to that

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.640
in whichever order you'd like.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Nicoll Victor:
So the literature suggests

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:52.010
that once women win office,

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:55.720
they tend to legislate
much the same way men do.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:01.770
That being said, so on one hand
you might not think actually

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.880
politics would be very much
different in terms of policy.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.240
On the other hand, there's
a good amount of literature

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.820
that suggests that women tend
to sort of behave differently

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.280
in office as leaders,
as managers,

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.320
as running either their personal
offices or their committees

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.920
or whatever position
it is that they have.

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.790
And I'm thinking of
members of Congress.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:26.350
And so it could be that
there are more subtle forms

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:30.300
of negotiation or
management or politicking

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.100
that changes operations at a
level that's more difficult

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.690
for scholars like us to observe.

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.080
Except perhaps in the long run.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.480
So I guess I'm of
mixed mind about this.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.620
On the one hand, I think
creating a Congress

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.910
that looks more like
America is a good thing.

00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:51.820
We know that there are huge
advantages to having some level

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.570
of descriptive representation.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.220
Whether that's race
or gender or whatever.

00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.120
On the other hand, we also know
that once a minority group,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.270
whether you're talking about
race or women or whatever,

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.240
come into office, and they
reach a certain level,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.870
they tend to sort of wind up
acting just like the people

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.600
who were there before.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.230
So, there are dividends to
be paid on the front side.

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:18.590
I think for recruiting of more
diverse crop of candidates

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.620
to run for office, and it might
be that there will be dividends

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.000
to pay in politicking
and management

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.160
of politics in the long run.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.230
How exactly we observe that
in policy is a little bit more

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:32.060
abstract, I think.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.600
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Hey Julie.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.840
So, check me if I'm wrong here,
but I think women tend to be,

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.740
within both parties, women tend
to be more liberal than men.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.920
You know, both within
their republican

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.350
and within the democratic
parties.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:51.750
And so, you know,
that, you know,

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:54.700
as their numbers increase
among elected officials,

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.110
that tends to suggest
it will somewhat change.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:01.750
It could end up making the
republican party more moderate.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.110
It could end up making the
democratic party more liberal.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.540
And interestingly, it's not
just on thing, it's not even

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.980
on things like reproductive
rights,

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.280
where actually women's views

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.930
and men's views are very
similar it turns out.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:15.480
But on just sort of
general economic issues,

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.880
on general social
welfare issues.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.990
That could have the effect

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:22.320
of moving the system
somewhat to the left.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.040
Now, it depends where these
women are getting electing.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.290
My understanding is most of
them are running as democrats.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.600
Most of the women
who are running

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.510
for Congress right now
are running as democrats.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:36.610
So that'll probably
have a greater effect

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.680
on the democratic party than
on the republican right now.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.770
But yeah, we could
see a different effect

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.800
across both parties.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.790
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well thank
you all three for your insights

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:46.090
on the future of
political parties.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.390
And thank you for attending.

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.510
We have a reception here, and --

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:54.910
[ Applause ]

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:58.610
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
