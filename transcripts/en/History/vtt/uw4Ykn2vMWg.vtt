00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.586
This is a brutal weapon.

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:06.214
This is
the Danish bearded ax.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:09.134
It's capable of dealing
brutal blows.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.012
Historical sources indicate
it was used by the elite troops

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.223
among the Saxons
and the Normans.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.851
The similarities and the
differences between this

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.936
and a longsword
in the Armored Combat League --

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.689
a longsword is gonna be
light up at the tip,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.274
heavy -- heavier in the hilt.
-Right.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.818
This is heavier in the tip,
lighter in the hilt.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.154
Um, we don't really use
half-swording techniques

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.239
because they're not effective
for what we do,

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.574
because we're not --
we're not doing

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.534
any piercing, any thrusting.
-Right.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.661
Or the trapping
and breaking of arms.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.371
Right. For the most part,
a longsword,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.249
you got the weight in your hand
and it's for singles.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.626
Longsword is not
very effective in melee,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.128
because
it doesn't hit hard.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.381
It can hit fast,
it can hit accurately,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.924
but it's not
gonna hit hard.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.761
Therefore, it can be
ignored in melee.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.472
This weapon cannot be
ignored in melee.
Cannot be ignored.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.099
[ Chuckles ]
Um, if you miss a block
with this,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.643
you're gonna be hurt
or you're gonna be stunned.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.729
You should also put it like
this -- If you try to ignore it,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.397
it can get your attention
pretty damn fast.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.440
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.404
But you'll see fighters using
this not only offensively,

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.573
but also putting it over the top
of their opponent's head...

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.492
-Mm-hmm. Right.
-...and then controlling them,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.076
and using it
to throw opponents.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.411
Going up and just hitting
to the front

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.330
or the back of the head.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.916
The small "beard,"
or lower portion,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.211
it's possible that you can
ward a shot with the haft

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.963
and then use that
to pull his weapon down,

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.883
and then return another hit
before he can recover.
Right.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.011
And in tight quarters, you'll
see like we've seen before --

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:39.432
at-range, out here;
mid-range, choked up tight.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:43.102
The thumbs are facing inboard,
and now you're using this to --

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:46.439
to pummel and throw shots
with your body into the face,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.691
almost like
a punching action.
Wow, yeah.
That's interesting.

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:50.860
Ooh,
that's gonna be good.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.029
So it is -- it's a pretty
versatile weapon.
It is.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.907
Really versatile.
Yeah. You'd think it's simply
just chop, chop, chop.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.034
But it has its own
particular techniques.
