00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:21.340
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.465
We're going to get started.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.016
The homework-- does everybody
have a copy of the handout?

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:27.900
If not, there's some
on the steps there.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.610
There's Muddy
Cards on the steps.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.049
And we're going to do
three things today.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.500
That's this complex
problem I want

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.432
to talk about, a problem
on center of percussion.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.890
And then as we have
time, I'm going

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740
to summarize some
summarising statements

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.590
about imbalances, which we've
talked a lot about off and on.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.310
So I want you restrain looking
at the notes I've handed out.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.141
The notes I've handed out
are this complex problem.

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:54.890
And I'll let you look
at them in a minute.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.348
But I want to get you to think
about some things before you

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.412
see what's on the notes.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:00:59.995
But the notes are
intended so that you

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:02.650
don't have to spend a lot of
time writing down messy stuff.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.720
You can think and listen.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.650
And they'll also be
sent out on the web,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.120
posted, so you don't have to
grab a copy for your friends.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.690
Because I only made 100 copies
and there are 122 of you.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.755
OK.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.130
So let's start
with this problem.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.490
This is basically a complex
system, a mass, a pendulum.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.940
And when you-- I've
made up one for you.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.110
So here's the pendulum.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.930
It's on an axle
stuck into my cart.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.470
The cart's got springs
connecting to it.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.980
And it naturally
has some damping.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.910
So this is a realization
of what's been drawn there.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.850
So let's just give
it a little bump.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.670
Cart moves back and forth.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.020
Pendulum swings back and forth.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.050
If I start it this way,
it'll act a lot more crazy.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.210
It'll have a more chaotic
looking kind of motion.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.150
The reason for that
has to do with, this

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.440
is a multiple degree
of freedom system, has

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.500
more than one natural frequency,
has more than one frequency

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.330
that responds, all
mixed together.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.300
And that's why it'll do
kind of crazy things.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.060
Like that'll stop, almost
stop, and then start up again,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.150
stuff like that.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.620
All completely natural.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.490
But if I give it a
nice, gentle start,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.290
it actually mostly
vibrates in what

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.701
I call one mode of vibration.

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:30.200
OK?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.115
So we want to get the equations
of motion of this system.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.290
So here, I've drawn it.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350
And the first question
about a system

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.980
like this when you
go to analyze it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.473
is, how many degrees of
freedom does it have.

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:47.800
All right?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.590
So I'm going to claim this to
be a planar motion problem.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.980
It's confined to the board
and confined to rotation

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.010
perpendicular to the board.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.810
OK?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.660
Any time that happens,
each object has,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.640
at most, three degrees of
freedom, x y, and a rotation.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.150
So we said no rotations
around x or around y.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.520
So three possible ones for
this mass, three possible ones

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.620
for this mass.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.490
And then we start looking for
the constraints in addition.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.090
Well, this one is constrained.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.739
It can't move out
of the-- let's see,

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.030
we've already constrained that.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.613
Wait a second.

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:40.990
How do I want to say this?

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.930
This one is certainly
constrained in the y because

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.960
of the track here.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.390
So that's one constraint.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.390
We're starting off
with six possible.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.000
We've got one because
it's constrained in the y.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.120
But it can certainly
move in the x.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.050
Can it rotate in the
z, this big mass?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.190
So that's two.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.890
So out of the three
possible, the top one only

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.460
has one possible
degree of freedom, x.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.890
This one also has three
possible degrees of freedom.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.643
It's pinned at A. What does
that do for constraint?

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.850
So this one, take 30 seconds
and talk to your neighbor.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.750
How many constraints are
caused by the pin at A?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.740
All right.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.420
So at least-- how many believe
that there's one constraint

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.515
provided by the pin at A?

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.390
Let's see the hands that
believe we have one.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.560
Get them up high, up high now.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.311
How about two?

00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:26.810
OK.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.101
How about three?

00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:29.600
All right.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.460
A little uncertainty here.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.110
All right.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.590
Do you know the motion at A?

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.260
Have you prescribed the
motion at A in any way?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.940
In what way?

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.566
I see you nodding your head.

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:44.483
AUDIENCE: It has to move
with the other block.

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:46.190
PROFESSOR: It has to
move with the block.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.550
But we've already given the
other block a coordinate.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.050
What is it?

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.260
AUDIENCE: In x.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.447
PROFESSOR: So if you know x,
do you know the motion of A?

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:53.946
OK.

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:57.650
So you have established
the motion of A.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.280
So if you know A-- you don't
need any additional information

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.400
about A do you?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.750
You've already chosen
a coordinate for it.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.540
So if A is
prescribed, that means

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.700
x1 and y1, the motion--
the coordinates

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.050
describing this
thing-- and I've given

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.443
started at a center of
mass, a little x1 that way,

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:20.630
and a little y1 that way.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.916
Those are my possible
displacement coordinates.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.290
And it has a
rotation coordinate.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.410
Three possible degrees
of freedom, right?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.410
x and y are prescribed
at this point.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.280
If you prescribe the
motion-- fix the motion--

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.300
at any point on a
rigid body, what

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.810
does that say about
translational motion

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.715
any place else on
the rigid body?

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.510
Remember, this is back
to that subtle definition

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.890
of what we mean by translation,
what we mean by rotation.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.830
AUDIENCE: It's a
parallel motion.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.425
PROFESSOR: Parallel motion.

00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:59.510
The translation part of this--
every point on the object

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.300
moves parallel to
every other point.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.840
So if you've prescribed the
translation of any one point

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.370
you have prescribed the
translation for all.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.180
So this second body,
basically, its only translation

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.820
that it can have is
x of the main body.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.270
So you have confined
it in x and y.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.890
It has no x and y possibilities.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.940
Those are two constraints
leaving you with-- one.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.440
Right?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.890
One degree of freedom.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.530
And then we pick a
coordinate for it.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.960
And the natural one to use
for that is the angle here.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.350
So we need two.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.200
Two coordinates completely
describe the motion.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.490
It will yield two
equations of motion.

00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:45.150
OK?

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.420
So on quizzes, you say, how many
independent degrees of freedom

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.050
are there.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.680
That is the same
question as saying,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.730
how many equations of motion are
required to completely describe

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.100
this system.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.120
Or how many
independent coordinates

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.630
are required to completely
describe the motion of system?

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.254
They're, all three,
the same questions.

00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:07.860
And that threw a couple
people on the last quiz.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.470
OK.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.030
Let's move on to
free body diagrams.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.124
So now we know we've got two
coordinates, theta and x.

00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:15.665
And now you're free
to look at your--

00:08:15.665 --> 00:08:17.122
you can be free
to look at things.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.830
And I want you to
spend most of your time

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.690
thinking and listening
and not having to write.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.260
But make notes as you get
insights about things.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.770
Free body diagram
then, two of them.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.530
The pendulum piece is
actually pretty simple.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.610
You've got Mg down.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.000
And you have two possible forces
at this point of rotation.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.960
And I've just named
them F1 and F2.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.299
And I've drawn them--
not arbitrarily,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.659
but I've picked the
direction to draw them in.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.670
I don't know what
direction they're in.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.040
And that's my complete
free body diagram.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.110
If I've missed
anything, tell me.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.501
Or if you have any
questions about it, ask me.

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.000
OK.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.530
The free body diagram
for this guy-- this

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.310
is capital M. This one's M1.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.500
This is mass M2 just
to keep it straight.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.470
Lots of possible
forces in this thing.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.730
Reaction forces
through the wheels,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.390
there are only vertical.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.385
I've left out friction,
ignored friction.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.760
But also, these F1
and F2 act at to pin.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.680
And notice I've drawn
them exactly equal

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.290
and opposite to these.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.610
Kind of a key thing to do.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.680
And why do we do that?

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.655
There's a law.

00:09:35.655 --> 00:09:37.475
What's the law?

00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:38.820
Newton's third.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.491
You've bot to do that
or else it won't work.

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:41.990
OK?

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.980
These are common unknowns.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.330
But they're equal and
opposite at this point.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.930
And we have an M1g hanging down.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.560
The spring force resists.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.680
Any positive motion,
a spring pulls back.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.690
Any positive velocity,
the damper holds back.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.784
And that's all of the
forces on this thing.

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.700
It's going to be necessary
to be able to break

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.600
these things down.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.080
Because I'm going to sum things.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.580
Going to need to have bits
and pieces of F2 and F1,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.410
so cosine thetas
and sine thetas.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:26.160
Now resist looking at
your paper for a second.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.740
Next concept question.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.220
We talked a lot
in the last couple

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.010
of the lectures about the
best approach to do problems,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.965
right, especially
using angular momentum.

00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:39.881
Do you think you're going
to need some angular

00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:42.240
momentum to solve this problem?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.622
An approach using torques
and angular momentum?

00:10:45.622 --> 00:10:46.330
More than likely.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.560
Anytime things are
rotating, more than likely.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.550
So what's the best
approach here?

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.490
Are we going to compute
angular momentum with respect

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.890
to A, that pivot point?

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.295
With respect to g,
the center of mass?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.940
And it's not too obvious.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.430
So if you were starting
out this problem,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.540
how would you begin it?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.070
Would you decide, I'm going to
sum my torques around point A

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.810
or, I'm going to sum
my torques around g?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.700
Did I mark g?

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.790
Yeah, it's right at the center.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.850
All right.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.580
Think about that for a second.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.352
Got a question?

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.234
All right.

00:11:27.234 --> 00:11:29.450
I'm going to ask you this.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.970
Any questions
about the question?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.030
I want a real show
of hands here.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.505
I want you to just-- what
would you do to start with?

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:39.710
So how many would sum torques,
compute angular momentum

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.490
with respect to point A?

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.080
OK.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.390
How about g?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.510
Hmm, interesting.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.782
And another way?

00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:52.240
Some of you are
holding back on me.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.130
Not everybody raised
their hands here.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.040
OK.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.540
All right.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.920
Most people would
do it around A.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.700
A would work.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.470
g would work too.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.030
And in fact, when I sat
down to do this problem,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.310
I did it with A first.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.850
And then I went
and did it with g.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.945
And it turns out that
doing it with respect to g

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:13.230
is just slightly easier.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.410
OK.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.720
So the approach we need to
find two equations of motion.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.090
We have two bodies.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.560
We're going to use Newton's and
Euler's laws to go after them.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.840
So starting out, first
one, sum of the forces

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.625
in the x direction on this body.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.850
There's a lot of unknowns.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.610
So I'm going to end
up-- or start off--

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.640
with more than two equations.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.350
Because I've got
how many unknowns?

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:53.850
One, two, three, four,
x, the motion x, five,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.170
and the angle theta, six.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.070
I could need as many as six
equations to start with.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.670
If I sum forces in the
vertical direction I can--

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.700
it turns out that N1 and N2
two here, I never actually

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.990
have to deal with.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.250
So don't start there.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.810
If you're thinking you might
not have to mess with them,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.580
don't start there.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.940
You're going to
waste a lot of time.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.350
I don't think I'm going
to have to deal with them.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.058
And in fact, I'm only
going to need four.

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:23.516
I'm going to find four equations
involving F1, F2, x, and theta.

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:24.016
OK.

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:32.140
So here's how I'm saving
a little time today.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.150
I've written it down for
you and I've written it out.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.670
Same thing on your paper.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.800
Let's talk about the first one.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.990
This is a sum of forces in
this capital X direction, which

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:51.650
is our inertial frame, X,
on the main cart on mass 1.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.340
So it's got to be the mass
times the acceleration.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.700
And this is not [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.590
I don't how that
sneaked in there.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.400
And I've called it-- in
capital, I had direction.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.020
OK?

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.210
Mass times acceleration.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.540
I just sum up all the
forces on the cart.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.910
Spring force holds back.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.780
The direction of the arrow
on my free body diagram

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.450
tells you the sense of it.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.290
Minus KX minus bx dot
plus F2 cosine theta

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.620
plus F1 sine theta, all
in the X I hat direction.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.550
OK?

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.415
Some of the forces on my little
bar here in the x1 direction.

00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:34.180
Now x1 is down here.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.040
And y1 is off that way.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.440
So sum of the forces in
x1, which is now on mass 2,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.935
must its mass times
its acceleration.

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:50.834
And I've just called it-- it
doesn't matter where I do my--

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.250
what point I'm
going to do angular

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.900
momentum with respect to.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.330
This is Newton's law.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.480
And it's the acceleration
of the center

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.420
of the gravity with respect
to an inertial frame.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.600
But this is in the
little i hat direction.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.710
So it's the complement
in that direction.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.850
I have a minus F1i
in that direction.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:15.460
And I have a plus M2g cosine
theta i in the i hat direction.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.970
Pretty straightforward
Newton's second law.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.030
Again, the other
component for Newton's

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.180
in the Y1 direction, mass times
the acceleration in the j hat

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.900
direction, minus F2j--
because my F2 happens

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.570
to be in the minus
direction in the free body

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:38.020
diagram-- minus M2g
sine theta in the j hat.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.510
And finally, I'm going
to sum my moments

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.680
about the center of mass.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.760
It would also work--
if I did it around A,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.380
I would-- the reason you
normally do it around A, which

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.870
is why I started there, is why?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.960
What's the advantage
of doing it around A?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.824
The potential advantage
of going to A?

00:16:01.824 --> 00:16:04.534
AUDIENCE: So you can
eliminate forces at the pin.

00:16:04.534 --> 00:16:05.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.474
F1 and F2 don't generate
moments at the pin.

00:16:08.474 --> 00:16:09.890
And there's a hope
that, then, you

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.920
can get what you need
to know without ever

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.730
having to evaluate F1 and F2.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.690
Right?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:20.884
And in this case, they're going
to pop up in these equations.

00:16:20.884 --> 00:16:23.550
And you're going to have to deal
with them anyway, it turns out.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.120
So it doesn't actually give
you much of an advantage.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.390
So it's easier because
the torque equation's

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.610
easier in terms of the
number of terms it has.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.970
That's what makes it slightly
easier in this problem.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.260
You've got to deal
with F1 and F2 anyway.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.670
So it's just the time rate
of change of the angular

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.580
momentum with respect to g.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.010
And that's external torques.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.480
And the only external
torque is caused by F2.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.200
And I left out a minus sign.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.945
You have it on your
paper, I think, here.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.610
No, it's correct.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.790
It's positive.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:05.707
So you have, F2 acts on
a moment arm about g, L2.

00:17:05.707 --> 00:17:07.540
And it's going to be
in the k hat direction.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.200
That's the external
torque on the system.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:16.050
Its gravity causes no torque
because it's acting at g.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.069
All right?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.364
And this has got to be the
time rate of change of h.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.349
I claim in this
problem-- you don't

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.290
have to do this--
but in this problem,

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.540
I claim I can write h as
a mass moment of inertia

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:42.760
matrix times a vector that tells
you what the rotation rate is.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.740
You, in fact, can
always do this about g.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.925
This is I with respect to g.

00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:53.210
If you know what
it is, this I-- I

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.900
have chosen a set of
coordinates that pass

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.090
through the center of mass.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.150
x1 that way, y1 perpendicular to
it, are they principal coord--

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.100
and z coming out of the board--
are they principal coordinates?

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.130
Sure, you know that.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.080
This is just a uniform rod.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.230
But just symmetry, immediately,
should tell you that they are.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.092
Yes.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.290
AUDIENCE: I thought you said
that IMA could only work

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.996
for a stationary rotation axis.

00:18:18.996 --> 00:18:21.702
I thought IMA could only
work for a stationary axis

00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:22.450
of rotation.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.290
PROFESSOR: And rotation
about the center of mass.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.361
You can always do things
with the center of mass.

00:18:29.361 --> 00:18:29.860
OK?

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.580
But you could just work this
out by the basic definition

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.280
of angular momentum.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.731
Don't do it the hard way,
r cross p's and those kind

00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:41.230
of things.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.870
And you end up in
the same place.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.940
This one, because
it's 0 0 omega z,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.230
when you do the multiplication,
this is a diagonal.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.877
The only term that
matters is this one.

00:18:52.877 --> 00:18:54.100
Right?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.980
So that's going to give us an
IzzG theta double dot, which

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.211
is omega z, k hat direction.

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:02.460
And it's not theta double dot.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.270
The h gives you theta dot.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.790
Omega z is theta dot.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.330
And we've taken the
time derivative,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.230
which gets us theta double dot.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.330
And we know what the
mass moment of inertia

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.440
about a uniform
stick is with respect

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.600
to G, ML squared over 12.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.700
Theta dot-- OK.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.600
So there's our four equations
that we have to work with.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.980
And do they involve N1 or N2?

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.589
Not at all.

00:19:27.589 --> 00:19:29.380
That's why I said we
had, potentially, six.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.850
We really only
have four unknowns.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:39.962
And now you use these two
to solve for F1 and F2.

00:19:39.962 --> 00:19:43.210
And once you get
expressions for F1 and F2

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.230
you can eliminate them
from here and here.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.060
And you're done.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.360
But there's a bit of
work left to do that.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.092
But that's the approach.

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:57.860
You use these two
to isolate F1 and F2

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.500
and plug them into
these two to get

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.890
your final equations of motion.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.140
But we have a couple of
things we don't know yet

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.000
that we need in here, the
acceleration of that center

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.870
of mass in the i hat--
and break into two

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.310
components, i hat and j hat.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.700
But that's what we've been
studying kinematics for.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.310
So we need to know the velocity
of G with respect to O.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.410
And we need to know
the acceleration of G

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.380
with respect to O. OK?

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.580
So the velocity is
pretty straightforward.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.890
We've done this many times.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.680
So the velocity of
A with respect--

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.890
Remember, you pick things
you know to work from.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.970
And you try to make as few as
possible things you don't know.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.740
Or put them in
forms that we know

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.250
how to go about getting it.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.720
These are vectors.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.812
Do we know the velocity
of A with respect to O?

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.410
What's A?

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.170
A is the place where the pin is.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.124
What's its velocity
at that point?

00:21:23.124 --> 00:21:23.980
AUDIENCE: x dot.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.830
PROFESSOR: x dot.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.682
And in what direction?

00:21:26.682 --> 00:21:27.807
AUDIENCE: Capital I hat.

00:21:27.807 --> 00:21:28.390
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.700
So this is x dot capital I hat.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.970
And now this term, the velocity
of G with respect to A,

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:44.320
this is a rigid body which
is rotating and translating.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.480
And we've run into
this before, right?

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.630
And basically, the
equation for such things

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.150
is the motion of the
translational velocity

00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:01.430
of the object plus the
velocities within the object,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.870
including anything
contributed by rotation.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:10.192
So this term is the velocity of
the point G, with respect to A,

00:22:10.192 --> 00:22:14.590
to the center-- velocity of
the center G with respect

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.780
to point A.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.650
And that is-- I'll write
it consistently here.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:26.500
This is the velocity of G
with respect to A evaluated

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.640
if you had no rotation.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.300
If you're sitting--
the other way

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.380
the books often
say it is this is

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.370
what you would see if you were
on the object sitting at A

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.150
looking and G. Is it moving?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.660
You'd say no.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.760
Well, another way of
saying that, that's

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.288
the velocity of this thing
if there were no rotation.

00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:47.180
All right?

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.750
So this term happens to be 0.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.890
Plus omega-- now we're kind
of doing this on purpose.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.300
We know this is omega
z in the k direction.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.685
But reminding you,
make it always

00:23:00.685 --> 00:23:05.060
with respect to the
inertial frame-- cross

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:12.460
RGA, the position vector
from between the two points.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.810
And so this case,
we end up with an x

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:31.860
dot I hat plus-- this is going
to be-- omega zk cross L/2

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.010
little i hat.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.264
k cross i is j.

00:23:36.264 --> 00:23:42.380
So x dot I hat.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.530
This is in the little j moving
coordinate system direction.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.650
Omega z is theta dot.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:57.520
Theta dot L over 2 j hat.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.520
I didn't even leave
enough room here.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.680
Let me see this.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.104
x dot I plus.

00:24:13.104 --> 00:24:13.980
OK?

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.620
Familiar, our omega term.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.260
So that's your velocity
of G with respect to O.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:27.920
We need to find an acceleration
of that same point.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.540
And we're going to take the
derivative of this to get it.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.800
A point to-- we haven't
talked about this in a while.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.110
This has mixed unit vectors.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.610
Right?

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.670
It's got unit vectors in the
inertial frame and the unit

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.950
vectors in the rotating frame.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.080
Is that allowed?

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.680
No problem.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.060
It's perfectly
legitimate, right?

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.665
You have to reduce
it, eventually,

00:24:54.665 --> 00:24:56.740
to get a workable equation.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.270
But that's just fine at
this intermediate stage.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.200
OK.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.900
The next thing you want to do
is find this a with respect

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.760
to G-- aG with respect
to O, the acceleration.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:17.790
And we know that's just
a derivative, remember,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.735
with respect to the
inertial frame-- that's

00:25:20.735 --> 00:25:24.590
why we have to deal with this
rotation business-- of velocity

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.660
of G with respect to O. But
the derivative of this-- does I

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.960
change direction?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.460
Nope.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.020
So this is just x double dot.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.170
And we have a single
term here that we

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.390
have to take a derivative of.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.935
So we get a theta
double dot L/2 j.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.460
This is a little lowercase j.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.250
But now, does j rotate?

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.775
Yeah?

00:25:56.775 --> 00:25:59.910
And so this is the derivative
of a rotating vector.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:06.810
The derivative of j
is minus theta dot I.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:21.690
So minus theta dot
squared L over 2 i hat.

00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:26.200
All right?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.870
And that's all there
is to getting G.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:35.185
Now we could have done--
oops, I want that one.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:51.780
I don't want you to be afraid
of using the big, kind of hairy

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:58.450
looking 3D vector
equation for acceleration.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.230
Acceleration and this gets
called-- this is A with respect

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.870
to O, putting it in
terms of this problem,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.490
plus the acceleration
of G with respect

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:23.230
to A evaluated with no rotation
plus omega dot cross RGA

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:39.310
plus omega cross omega
cross RGA plus 2 omega cross

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:46.610
velocity GA omega equals 0.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.870
And I should have one, two,
three, four, five terms.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.980
There's always five
potential terms

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:58.280
when you're evaluating the
acceleration of a point

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.640
on a rigid body which is
translating and rotating.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.950
This is translating and
rotating reference frames,

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.090
attached to the rigid body.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.470
And then you just go
in and fill it in.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.570
This is the acceleration
of the rigid body,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.050
the translational acceleration.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.550
In this problem, what is that?

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.542
Louder.

00:28:21.542 --> 00:28:22.500
AUDIENCE: X double dot.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.083
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:26.286
This guy is capital
X double dot I hat.

00:28:26.286 --> 00:28:28.780
All right?

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.000
This is the acceleration
of point G relative to A

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.900
if you were in the
object, on the object.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.933
It is?

00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:35.432
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:28:35.432 --> 00:28:36.307
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:28:36.307 --> 00:28:37.430
0.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.560
This is the Eulerian term.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.310
This is theta double dot
crossed with the distance

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.720
from between the two points.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.240
Is this 0?

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.290
No, not necessarily.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.524
So this is theta double dot.

00:28:56.842 --> 00:28:59.740
This is the L/2.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.180
That's this.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.130
And when you do the cross
product of k and I, you get j.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.280
That's that term.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.380
Omega cross omega cross RGA,
this is the centripetal term.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.180
Would you think
it's going to be 0?

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.120
Nope.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.402
So this is k cross I.
That's j. k cross j is

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:22.070
I minus-- this is the term
that gives you minus-- theta

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:27.880
dot squared L/2 i.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.440
And this is our Coriolis term.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.735
It requires motion of that
point, G, relative to A.

00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:34.920
Is that moving?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.420
Nope.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.250
So this term just goes to 0.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.197
Get the same answer?

00:29:39.197 --> 00:29:39.696
All right.

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:40.990
So don't be afraid of this.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.350
This thing, just lay it down.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.850
Just plug the things in and
the right things will fall out.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.350
All right.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:54.160
On the paper, I break down the
acceleration of G with respect

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.680
to O into its little i
and little j components.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.200
And I end up with
acceleration of G with respect

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.940
to O. I group the terms.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:15.871
The I capital X double
dot sine theta--

00:30:15.871 --> 00:30:17.370
I actually have to
break this-- see,

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.570
this is not in the direction
of little i or little j.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:28.030
So I know that I can express
capital I as a lowercase i sine

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.090
theta plus j cosine theta.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.110
And I use that.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.220
So it's X double dot
sine theta minus L/2

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:40.090
theta dot squared-- it is in
the little i hat direction.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:48.610
So this is the i hat term--
plus X double dot cosine theta

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.610
plus L/2 theta double dot.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.900
And this is the j hat term.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.820
OK?

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.590
Yeah.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.085
AUDIENCE: Why would you choose
to put everything in terms

00:30:58.085 --> 00:31:02.004
of the rotating inertial frame?

00:31:02.004 --> 00:31:03.420
PROFESSOR: You
have to always have

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.760
these same decisions to make.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.960
And it's what you're
comfortable with,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.160
what you think is going
to lead to the least work.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.980
You have no idea how much time
I spent working on this problem

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.520
to put it in a
form that I thought

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.650
I could teach it to you.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:19.220
I spent a lot of time on it, the
point being, occasionally, you

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.820
have to spend a lot of time
working them out, going down

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.090
a path that doesn't pay
off, backing up, going down

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.240
the next one.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.410
On quizzes, on
homework, most of what

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.927
stops you from getting
to the final right answer

00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:35.510
is confidence.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.490
You've got to
believe that you've

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.510
learned these things
well enough that you know

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.710
this is the right thing to do.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.740
And it'll get you there if you
just do the arithmetic right.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.647
OK?

00:31:47.647 --> 00:31:48.980
And we all make little mistakes.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.120
And you'll all have to
back up and do it again.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.161
But that's why the
fundamentals and understanding

00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.980
the basic concepts
are so important.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.140
If you've got the
concepts down cold,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.730
you'll have confidence that
your method's going to work.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.630
OK.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:06.810
So this is my i direction term.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.740
This is my j direction term.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:17.290
I can take those and take
this bit and plug it in here.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.650
Let's just give it a name.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:25.694
Let's call this A and
this piece here B.

00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.240
And your A goes right here.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.899
That's A. And this is B. OK?

00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:37.690
And not that you've
made that substitution,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.310
you can solve for F1.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.880
And they're all in
one direction now.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.170
They're all in the
little i hat direction.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.100
You make the other substitution,
everything's in little j hat.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.450
And you can drop them.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.530
You no longer have
to carry it along.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:57.910
You now have scalar equations
you can solve for F1 and F2.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.870
So that's done.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.020
And you take those
two expressions--

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:13.440
so this implies F1 equals-- and
this one implies F2 equals--

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.740
and you take those.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:23.150
And you put F1 and F2--
you need F1 and F2.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.690
And you plug it in here.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:29.125
And in this equation,
you only need an F2.

00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:42.210
And when you do that, you get
your two equations of motion.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.360
Now a couple things happen.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.920
It turns out, when
you do this-- when

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.970
you make the substitution in
here-- you end up with an MX

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:00.420
double dot cosine squared theta
and an M2 X double dot sine

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.920
squared theta.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.740
And sine squared
plus cosine squared

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.110
conveniently equals-- 1.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.159
And that collapses
and goes away.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:19.300
So you end up with the
two final expressions

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.260
here after you've made
those combinations.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.464
So from four over here--
I'll call it four prime--

00:34:23.464 --> 00:34:25.130
you get one of your
equations of motion.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.010
That's one equation of motion.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.500
It's primarily about
the translation of-- I

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.260
mean rotation-- of the system.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.320
It derives from all those
substitutions in this equation.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.910
Curiously, these two
bits go together,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.790
which, if you had worked
around A and you used,

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.980
dangerously, perhaps, a
parallel axis theorem,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.160
you would have ended up
with ML squared over 3.

00:35:29.842 --> 00:35:31.300
But that's your
first equa-- that's

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.640
one of your equations of motion.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.150
And from the first one, it
comes from the sum of the forces

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:43.990
on the main mass, M1,
plus M2 X double dot

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:48.640
plus b X dot plus KX.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.490
All the usual, just things
for mass spring oscillator.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.540
But now you've got
these additional forces

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.180
that are exerted on that
because it's got this pendulum

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.420
flagging back and forth.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.548
And if I made a mistake on
the board, believe the paper.

00:36:22.548 --> 00:36:25.320
I think I've got it
all transcribed right.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.810
This is your force
equation on the main mass.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:31.520
If you didn't have the
pendulum hanging there,

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.560
there's your equation of
motion for a cart going

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.460
back and forth with springs.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.570
Then you have this pendulum
hanging on it, which

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.740
puts additional forces on it.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.690
It comes through
those F1 and F2 terms.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.410
And you can see they have to
do with having to accelerate

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.770
things down there.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.270
OK?

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.900
Now these two
equations are actually

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.350
quite easy to linearize.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.910
So linearize means
you can always

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.630
linearize around the
equilibrium position.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.560
This is its
equilibrium position.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.465
Small motions.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.390
That can be described,
what you see there,

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.790
by linearized
equations of motion.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:25.590
And to linearize-- so for
theta small sine theta

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.240
is approximately equal to theta.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.560
Cosine theta is
approximately equal to 1.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.880
And you just have sines
and cosines in here.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.380
You let this guy go to 1.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.710
You let this go to theta.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.090
Here, 1.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.880
Here, theta.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.740
And you have linearized
equations of motion.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.340
Now other problems can
be harder to linearize.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.200
But this is particularly simple.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.992
Two linear equations, solvable.

00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:55.450
If you solve them,
they'll give you

00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:03.970
two natural frequencies for the
system and two vibration modes.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:04.470
All right.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.910
That's the end of this problem.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.170
Any last questions about it?

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.800
I'm going to move on to this
topic of center percussion.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.970
OK.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.178
This next one is kind of fun.

00:38:30.178 --> 00:38:32.220
It has a real practical
purpose in life.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.870
I didn't bring my tennis
racket or my baseball bat.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.300
But if any of you
play sports that

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.640
use things that hit things,
you know, when hit the baseball

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.660
and you hit it
down on the handle,

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.900
it really stings your hands.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.840
Right?

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.930
Or the tennis racket, if
you don't hit it right,

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.850
you feel a lot of
forces in your hands.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.425
And you hit it really sweet,
you feel almost no force at all.

00:38:55.425 --> 00:38:58.010
How many have had
that experience?

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.650
Really common.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.149
OK.

00:38:59.149 --> 00:39:01.665
So is there a right
place to hit it?

00:39:01.665 --> 00:39:02.820
The answer's yes.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:08.020
And we're going to go
through that right now.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.760
So here's our--
I'm looking down.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.250
Here's my baseball bat.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.170
z is in this direction.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.750
This is kind of the top view.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.490
So here's my handle of my bat.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.890
Ball's coming in.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.200
Put some force on it.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.400
I think I put it
lowercase in the notes.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.060
OK?

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.060
And I want to know-- and I
want to minimize that force

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.124
at my hands.

00:39:39.124 --> 00:39:40.540
I'm going to call
this place where

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:47.685
it hits P. I'm going to say
here's its center of mass at G.

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.730
The point about which
you're holding it

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:57.100
and it's rotating is A. And
my coordinate system attached

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.240
to the bat-- we always have
this coordinate system attached

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.520
to the bad in these
rotational problems

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.670
so that we can divine things
like moments of inertia.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.540
So it's a coordinate
system attached to the bat.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.770
And here's my y direction.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.110
And z's coming out of the board.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:21.940
And this distance is going
to be important to me, RGA.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.990
And this distance here,
I'm going to call q.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.950
It's my unknown.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:35.490
And I want to know,
where's the sweet spot.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:40.180
What do I want q to be so that
I minimize the force at A,

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.380
where I'm hanging onto it.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.440
So how many degrees of freedom?

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.210
How many independent coordinates
do I need to do this problem?

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.160
This problem is complicated,
because it's a-- you know,

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.270
a real life situation
is probably complicated.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.346
And I'm going to do a lot
of simplification and claim

00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:01.220
that the answer-- and
then look at the answer

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.480
and say, does it makes sense.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.590
Did my simplifications
make sense?

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.850
So I'm going to do a
number of simplifications.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.210
I'm going to argue that I think
I can get at most of the answer

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.240
by essentially saying, right
here where I'm hitting it,

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.430
my wrists are like
a hinge point.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.970
That's point A. I'm going to
assume it rotates about a fixed

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.522
point at that moment.

00:41:25.522 --> 00:41:26.880
OK?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.600
Pretty gross simplification
of the real thing going on.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.090
You've really got muscles,
you're putting moments on it,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.280
your wrists actually
are moving some.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.450
But I'm just going to say
rotating only about that point.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.010
It stays in this plane.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.360
It's a planar motion problem.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.010
At most, three possible
degrees of freedom,

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.620
x, y, and some theta.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.904
Right?

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.570
And I'm going to make
the simplification

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.150
that it's pinned at A.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.665
So if it's pinned at A, how
many constraints is that?

00:41:53.665 --> 00:41:54.455
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:41:54.455 --> 00:41:55.080
PROFESSOR: Two.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.160
One left.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.660
So I only need-- I'm going
to pick one coordinate.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.220
That's going to be my theta.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.210
So even though I've made
these gross simplifications,

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.470
will the answer actually
turn out to be meaningful?

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.940
And this G is my center of mass.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:22.850
And let's assume that
we know Izz with respect

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:29.020
to G, that is, mass moment
of inertia for rotation in z.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.950
OK?

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.085
Assume that we know that.

00:42:31.085 --> 00:42:31.650
It's given.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:41.480
So for this problem,
when you have fixed

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.430
rotation points--
this problem here,

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.330
that A point wasn't fixed.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.230
It was moving, accelerating.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.980
It could have had lots
of complicated terms

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.910
in its expression for torque
if you'd done it that way.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.070
This is fixed at A. It
makes a lot of sense

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:01.790
to compute moments
about A. All right?

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.440
So my first equation
here, that I

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:11.350
want, is the sum of the moments,
torques with respect to A.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.790
And these are-- well,
they will all turn out

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.460
to be in the z direction here.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:27.280
And they are time rated
change of the angular momentum

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.180
with respect to G, which, in
these planar motion problems,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.600
always then boils down to
the mass moment of inertia

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.250
for the axis you're rotating
it about times the angular

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.250
acceleration.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.890
That's that term.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:50.450
Oops, not G. A.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.950
Excuse me.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:51.783
We picked our point.

00:43:51.783 --> 00:43:53.170
We've got to stick with it here.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:53.669
OK.

00:43:53.669 --> 00:43:56.680
I need that.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.690
And this is in the
k hat direction.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.420
This is the only term
in our torque equation.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.560
What are the external torques?

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.830
Well now, z is out of
the board like this.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:21.920
I've got a force
acting on a moment arm

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.780
giving me a torque in
the other direction.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:30.448
So this is minus
fq-- also k hat.

00:44:39.074 --> 00:44:40.490
Now I might have
done this sooner,

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.530
but we should look at
a free body diagram.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.830
So here's a little
stick figure of my bat.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.850
And I potentially
have an unknown force

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:56.260
in the y direction, Ry,
and another unknown force

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.040
in the x direction here
at A, that pin point

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.552
where it's rotating it about.

00:45:02.552 --> 00:45:05.920
Out here is G.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.100
And at G, is there an mG term?

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.610
Well, it's gravity, right?

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.300
But it's acting-- it's
in the minus z direction.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.420
And I'm looking down on it.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.480
This is a top view.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:25.040
So gravity would create a
moment in the y direction.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.360
And I don't have
to deal with that.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.710
My only moment-- this
is my torque equation--

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.310
only has k hat terms in it.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:36.490
Gravity creates a
moment in the y,

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.841
which, in fact, you have to--
that's a static equilibrium

00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:41.590
problem-- you do have
to provide that when

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.440
you're holding the bat or
else the bat would droop.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:43.939
Right?

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:46.610
It doesn't have anything to do
with the dynamics, actually.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:47.110
OK.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.100
Here's G. There's no gravity
term that you can see.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.400
It's pointing into the board.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:57.750
And out here is my
point P. And here's f.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.510
OK.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.460
So I need an equation-- I
have an equation for moment

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.590
equilibrium.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.960
I need some dynamic equation.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.320
I have two possible equations
for force equilibrium.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.701
How many unknowns do I have?

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.270
But no others.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.270
Three possible unknowns.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:24.645
I'm going to need
three equations

00:46:24.645 --> 00:46:26.840
to get rid of these two terms.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.900
Right?

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.040
And I am looking ahead.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.929
My objective is to
make that term go to 0.

00:46:32.929 --> 00:46:34.720
So I both have to find
an expression for it

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.511
and then figure out
how to make it go to 0.

00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:38.630
That's how you do this problem.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:41.640
OK.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.510
So let's do sum of
the forces in the y.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:47:02.106
So you have an Ry j hat minus
f, also in the j hat direction.

00:47:02.106 --> 00:47:03.855
And that's basically
all there is to that.

00:47:03.855 --> 00:47:07.140
But that must be
the mass of the bat

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.760
times the acceleration
of G with respect

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.460
to O in the y direction.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.800
So that's our j hat component.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.000
This is just the component
of acceleration in the j hat

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.870
direction.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:25.770
And the sum of the forces
in x, we look at those.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.850
Well, we have an Rx in the i.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.630
And there are no others.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.180
And that must be, then,
the mass of the bat

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.480
times the acceleration, G,
with respect to O, of the bit

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.160
in the x direction.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.230
And that'll be in the i hat.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.640
So I've got two unknown
accelerations, now,

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.410
that I have to deal with.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.260
But we know lots
of kinematics now.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.330
So let's do it this way just
to give you the practice.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:10.060
Acceleration of G with respect
to O. Acceleration of A

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:15.890
with respect to O plus the
acceleration of G with respect

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:32.940
A omega equals 0 plus omega
dot cross RGA plus 2 omega

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:46.160
cross VGA omega equals 0,
and finally, plus omega

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.215
cross omega cross RGA.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:59.150
One, two, three,
four, five terms.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:02.230
Our vector 3D equation
is figured out quickly.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.970
What's this term?

00:49:06.218 --> 00:49:08.080
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.900
PROFESSOR: 0?

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.716
Why?

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:10.590
AUDIENCE: It's fixed.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.048
PROFESSOR: Fixed
point of rotation,

00:49:12.048 --> 00:49:13.090
that's our assumption.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.270
This guy goes to 0.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.100
OK.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.662
The velocity of G
with respect to A?

00:49:18.662 --> 00:49:19.162
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:49:19.162 --> 00:49:19.745
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:49:19.745 --> 00:49:21.580
Another 0.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.890
Omega dot cross RGA?

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.861
So that could-- you
know, if there's

00:49:29.861 --> 00:49:31.980
an angular acceleration,
which there might be,

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.130
cross R, that's a
perfectly legitimate term.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.600
And that'll give you
a-- this will give you

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.260
a theta double dot, just before.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:49.590
It's in the k direction,
cross RGA in the i.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.020
That's this term right here.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.520
OK.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.820
This velocity of G
with respect to A

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.140
on the bat, that went to 0.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.140
The Coriolis, that goes away.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.200
So at this point, I've only
got one term from there.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.910
And this term is our
centripetal term.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.993
You think there's going
to be a centripetal force?

00:50:07.694 --> 00:50:14.580
Common sense should be any time
you have a rotational moment,

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:18.570
something rotating about a
point, if the center of mass

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:24.700
is not the point
of rotation, you

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.310
will be forcing a mass
to move in a circle.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:31.270
And that always requires--
that centripetal acceleration--

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.520
always requires a force.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.040
This, for sure,
will give you a term

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:43.057
which is a minus omega z squared
type term times the distance

00:50:43.057 --> 00:50:43.556
RGA.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.660
That's its radius.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.840
And it's inward.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.010
So in this direction,
it will be i hat.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.710
Three terms, same as before.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:54.960
We now have our accelerations.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.750
OK.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.790
So from our top
equation up there

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.650
from the summation
of forces in the y,

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.770
we'll now substitute these in.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:21.940
We have M RGA j hat.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:28.750
The acceleration term, we ended
up with the-- the k cross i

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:29.800
term gives you j.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.110
So the Eulerian term is
going to show up here.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:38.490
So that, we need a
theta double dot.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:39.810
And this is in the j direction.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:44.680
That comes from the
acceleration we figured out.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:50.390
And that's equal
to minus f plus Ry.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.881
And this is all little j hat.

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.570
Let me write the
other one first here.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:10.330
Here's the summation
in the x direction.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:16.550
It's mass times our acceleration
in the i hat direction.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.790
And we only ended up
with one term doing that,

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.870
and that's our centripetal term.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:36.460
So we get minus RGA
theta dot squared i hat.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.430
That's the centripetal
acceleration times the mass.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.950
And the only term
that it is equated to

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.788
is the other reaction force.

00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:47.150
OK?

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:51.290
So here's the key
step in this problem.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:56.910
We want what to
be 0 so that we're

00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:00.032
hitting it at the sweet spot?

00:53:00.032 --> 00:53:01.282
What's the original objective?

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.730
We want Ry to go away.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:08.710
All right?

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.127
Just make it go away.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:37.010
So f, then-- I'll do it
as an intermediate step.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.240
Just a second. f is then--
I'm going to leave Ry

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.560
for just a second longer.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:48.270
Ry minus M RGA theta double dot.

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:50.910
And since this is my--
I can drop the j hats.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.380
This is now a scalar equation.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.200
I can find an expression
for this force

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.950
that-- I don't even
know what the force is

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:59.190
that the ball exerts on the bat.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.060
But it exists.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.990
I can say this must be true.

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:07.000
And my objective is
that this should be 0.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.330
So that says, when
that's true, f

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:14.010
is minus M RGA theta double dot.

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.056
And I'm going to use
that in just a moment.

00:54:17.056 --> 00:54:22.660
So I'm going to substitute
this into our first equation

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:26.640
up there for moment,
equation number one.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:35.870
So this implies that f is
minus M RG with respect

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:38.570
to A theta double dot.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:46.590
And this goes into 1,
which I have in fq.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.891
So I do that.

00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:54.040
Where are my notes?

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.610
This is now also
a scalar equation.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.190
I can drop the k hats.

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:28.520
So Izz with respect to A theta
double dot equals minus fq.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.680
But f is minus, so
the minuses cancel.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:42.916
So I get M RGA theta
double dot times q.

00:55:48.580 --> 00:56:10.370
Now Izz with respect to A can be
expressed as M times some thing

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:14.240
we call the radius of gyration
squared with respect--

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.250
and this has got to
be-- with respect to A.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:20.676
The radius of gyration
for rotation about A,

00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:23.440
I can find an
expression like this

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.310
so that it's equal to
Izz with respect to A.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:28.670
And all the radius
of gyration means

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:33.210
is that if I took all the mass
and put it that distance away,

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:36.450
the mass moment of inertia
of that concentrated point

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:38.240
mass with respect to
the point of rotation

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.410
is the same as in
the real object.

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.640
So this is just a
convenience that we use.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.370
So that's M Kappa squared.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:57:00.840
And that says, then, that M
Kappa squared A equals M RGA

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.450
theta double dot-- I have a
theta double dot here too.

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:06.310
Sorry-- times q.

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:08.380
And I can solve for q.

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.000
The theta double dots go away.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.540
The M's go away.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:21.797
And q is just Kappa
squared A divided by RGA.

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:42.610
And that's the answer to this
center of percussion problem.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.370
Here's your bat.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:59.686
Here's A. Here's G. Here's
P. The q is about here.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.280
Whoops, excuse me.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:12.530
q is the distance
to P. It's always

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:16.811
outside of G. It will
always be outside of G.

00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:19.060
We'll have to think about,
maybe, the reason for that.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.290
So here's the center of mass.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.790
Here's RGA.

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.870
and here's this
point at which you

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.840
want to hit at the sweet spot.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:35.390
And it's always Kappa
squared A over RGA.

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:38.540
Now how do you get
to Kappa squared A?

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.250
Well, you need to evaluate
Izz with respect to A.

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:45.770
But Izz with respect to A, you
can do parallel axis theorem,

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:51.883
Izz with respect with respect
to G plus M RGA squared.

00:58:51.883 --> 00:58:52.630
Right?

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:53.860
And then you have that.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.400
So if we were to do this--
I'll give you a quick example.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:13.980
If this were a uniform rod, Izz
G equals ML squared over 12.

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:27.960
Izz with respect to A ML
squared over 12 plus MRG

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.840
with respect to A squared.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:39.410
That is ML squared over
12 plus ML squared--

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.830
this is L/2 to RGA,
half the length,

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.130
if I put A right at the end.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:46.090
So I'm doing the simple rod.

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:50.040
I'm putting A right here,
G right in the middle.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:56.830
So this is L/2-- ML
squared over 2 squared, 4.

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:03.440
You add those two together,
you get ML squared over 3

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.150
equals M Kappa A squared.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.566
So Kappa squared A
is L squared over 3.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:24.940
And q equals L squared
over 3 divided by L/2.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:33.080
So you get 2/3 L. 2/3 of the
length puts you out here.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.650
Or at 1/2 the length--
so here's L/2.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:39.640
Here's P at 2L/3.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:51.650
So anytime you run into these
center of percussion problems--

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.810
tennis racquet, baseball bats,
whatever-- the right place

01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.671
to hit it is away from
the point of rotation.

01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:03.920
Now do you think this is--
now how good is this model?

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.220
You know, you start
thinking about, well,

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.000
what are the things-- if the
bat handles really moving.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.605
It's still actually
remarkably good.

01:01:21.605 --> 01:01:23.390
It's remarkably good.

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:25.504
In fact, the fact
these other things

01:01:25.504 --> 01:01:26.920
are happening,
like you're putting

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.160
some moment on with your
wrists, the fact that you still

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.610
have some speed down
here, all you're doing

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:36.680
is kind of maybe changing the
point it's rotating around.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.237
But you're still having to
exert forces with your hands

01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:41.820
at that point where
you're holding it.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.070
And you just want those
forces to go to 0.

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:45.842
All of these other
complications,

01:01:45.842 --> 01:01:48.300
you're still going to find out,
to make that force go to 0,

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.350
it's approximately that.

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.660
Really a pretty good answer.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.180
All right.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.710
Ah, let's go back.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.799
And we have another
piece of information

01:02:05.799 --> 01:02:08.090
that we developed in this
problem that we haven't used.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.430
We had another equation.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.080
We had the acceleration
in the i direction.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.763
And it's just equal to RX.

01:02:19.763 --> 01:02:24.015
The RX force is M times
the acceleration in the i

01:02:24.015 --> 01:02:24.515
direction.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:42.510
And that's minus RG with
respect to A theta dot squared.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:46.770
That's our old centripetal
force term, right?

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:48.655
Centrifugal force,
centripetal acceleration.

01:02:48.655 --> 01:02:50.910
Here's the centripetal
acceleration times

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:56.070
the mass is the force to make
the bat go in the circle.

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.763
You have to provide that force.

01:02:58.763 --> 01:02:59.263
OK?

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:11.420
So I want to finish
up by a loose end

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.524
that many people have--
continue to have--

01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:16.440
a little trouble with.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.250
Because I get questions
on Muddy cards about this.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.800
And it was on this
last homework.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.340
I don't know how that wheel
with the little bit missing--

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.240
if you all got that sorted out.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.684
If you're all perfectly clear
in your mind about that then

01:03:30.684 --> 01:03:32.100
I don't need to
say what I'm going

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.350
to talk about for a second.

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:36.040
But I thought I
would just tie that

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.920
up, the last little bit here.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.280
This problem is a
nice lead to it.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:54.380
This last force
that I computed is

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:58.760
the force required to swing
this thing in a circle.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.400
And I'm putting that
force right here.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.280
And I'm saying it's-- actually
the point of rotation is right

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.780
here.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.680
And that force is the mass times
the acceleration of that point.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.350
And that point is a distance
from my point of rotation

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.000
to the center of mass.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.230
No accident.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.180
You're accelerating
the center of mass.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.440
That times the
rotation rate squared

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.680
is the acceleration, the
centripetal acceleration.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.220
This is the force.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:46.250
So any time you have an
object-- maybe it's a wheel,

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:51.690
and maybe it has, stuck
on it, a little extra mass

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.800
you don't know about, a
rock stuck in your tire.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.600
This is the center of rotation.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.520
Your axle on your
wheel doesn't move.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.470
Tire doesn't move
relative to the axle.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.980
You've got this little
bit of mass missing

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.880
or added, doesn't much matter.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.370
The center of mass
of this system

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:15.230
is no longer at the
center of rotation.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.180
So I'll call the center
of rotation here A.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.560
That's what it's rotating about.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.280
This addition or loss
of a piece of mass

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.940
makes the center of mass of
the system move a little bit.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.100
So I have an extra little
bit of mass out here.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.150
The new actual center
gravity of this system

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:36.430
is a little distance away.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:41.093
And I'll call that
distance e, eccentricity.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.990
So now I have a system
whose center of mass

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.560
is not at the
center of rotation.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:06:01.260
And its distance, RGA, I'm
calling the eccentricity.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.960
And as this rotates-- and
I'll put a coordinate system

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.620
on here.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:11.330
i, x, y, rotating
with the system.

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:18.820
The force, it's going to
appear here on this axle.

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:26.390
It's going to have a
force that I'll call Rx.

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:36.310
Rx equals the mass times the
acceleration of the center

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:39.040
of gravity of the system.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.000
And the acceleration
of the center

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:52.090
of gravity in this system is
minus e theta dot squared.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.790
And it's inward in
the i hat direction.

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.180
Therefore, the minus sign.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.040
So the force-- this is the
centripetal acceleration

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.940
times mass-- the force
required to make it

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:14.750
do that is an inward force minus
M e theta dot squared i hat.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.080
OK?

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.370
I drew Rx in a
positive direction.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.530
The answer comes out minus.

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:23.054
It says it's going
the other way.

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.760
So this is always the case.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.620
If you have a system
that, for some reason,

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:40.450
does not rotate about
its true center of mass,

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:44.440
but in fact the center of mass
is off a little bit or a lot,

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.700
you will have to provide
a force that's inwardly

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.554
directed as that thing spins.

01:07:50.554 --> 01:07:51.850
OK?

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:57.650
Now a subtlety I want you to
know, to really go away with,

01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:02.900
is that we've talked quite
a lot about unbalance

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.640
due to these masses
that aren't concentrated

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.690
at the center, these
unbalanced masses.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:16.960
There are two kinds of
unbalance the engineers have

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.430
chosen to describe the
world with, two kinds.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:26.410
One is static imbalance and
the other is dynamic imbalance.

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:34.180
A statically imbalanced
system is one in which you--

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:45.609
I'm looking at a side view
of-- an edge view of this thing

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:51.680
as it's spinning,
maybe like this.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.510
And the center of
rotation is here.

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:57.189
And the G is here.

01:08:57.189 --> 01:09:00.029
That force is inward on it.

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:04.520
But really, it's
perfectly symmetric.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.270
So this force that
I'm having to provide

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:12.029
to keep this thing
from flying off

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:13.779
is perfectly inward directed.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:16.979
Does it generate any
moments about this point?

01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:17.710
None.

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:19.359
This is called static imbalance.

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:26.729
And here's an example
of static imbalance.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.340
This is my rotor.

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.370
I'm going to put it on its side.

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.597
Gravity says, I want
this to hang down.

01:09:32.597 --> 01:09:34.680
Because where's the center
of mass of this system?

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.350
Up here?

01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.280
Along here?

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.270
It's down here somewhere, right?

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:44.540
That center of mass, you do a
statics calculation, MG sine

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:48.017
theta, it's going to hang down.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.850
So that's why they call
it static imbalance.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:53.050
And the way you can correct a
statically imbalanced system

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:54.570
is just do the test.

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.630
Put the thing-- hang
the thing on an axle.

01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.810
And do I have a handy
axle here today?

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.770
Put it on an axle and
see if it rotates.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:12.292
And if it always rotates
to some point hanging down,

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:14.125
you know this thing's
statically imbalanced.

01:10:19.668 --> 01:10:21.910
Look in my kit of parts here.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.718
Just maybe do this.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.910
I don't know if this is
heavy enough to do the job.

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:34.330
But now I've put a little
bit of mass on here.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:41.270
And I presume that if I do
this with it, OK, it goes down.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.140
This system is
statically imbalanced.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:46.450
This system, now, is also
dynamically imbalanced.

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:46.950
Why?

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.180
It kind of depends on
where I do the calculation.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.020
But if I say that I
want to know-- this

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.520
is when put a force, a
mass, off-center here.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:10.950
And if I compute moments about a
point that's perfectly lined up

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:15.590
with it, this system will create
no moments about that point.

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:17.860
This system is
perfectly balanced now.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.170
The mass that I've
stuck on here is there.

01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:22.940
This system is
perfectly balanced.

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.610
It generates no
moments as it stands,

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:26.520
no matter where you
calculate this point.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:33.270
But this extra
little bit-- this is

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.320
A. If I compute H
with respect to A

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.700
here and do the
derivatives of it,

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.240
I get no torques except
in the z direction.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.720
But as soon as I
move away from there,

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.500
and there is a distance
here, and I compute moments

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.280
about that, do I get
some static moments

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.310
not in the direction of spin?

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.170
Yes.

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:58.360
So when you do that, this
system-- if this is my point A,

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.250
let's call it, over
here-- this system,

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.690
is it statically imbalanced?

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:04.190
Yep.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.700
Is it dynamically imbalanced?

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.010
Yeah.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:11.320
So how would you balance it?

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.340
Final question of
the term for me.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.696
How would you put this
system into balance?

01:12:20.696 --> 01:12:25.088
AUDIENCE: Put another
mass on the other side.

01:12:25.088 --> 01:12:26.552
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:12:26.552 --> 01:12:29.720
So if I put another mass
here, will that statically

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.350
balance it?

01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:36.550
Statically balance,
meaning if I let go,

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:39.520
will it have to rotate
around and find a low point.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.570
Is there any low
point-- if I put

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:46.720
one equal and opposite, equal
distance away, opposite side,

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.303
would it be statically balanced?

01:12:48.303 --> 01:12:48.886
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:51.219
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
gravity pulls down on this one,

01:12:51.219 --> 01:12:53.240
equal and opposite
down on this one.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.740
So it would be
statically balanced.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.480
Would it be
dynamically balanced?

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.345
The system, as you spin,
will try to twist like this.

01:13:00.345 --> 01:13:01.720
So it's not
dynamically balanced.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.886
What if I move it over here?

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.042
Is it statically balanced?

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:08.625
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:10.221
PROFESSOR: Is it
dynamically balanced?

01:13:10.221 --> 01:13:10.804
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:13:13.444 --> 01:13:14.069
PROFESSOR: Hmm.

01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:18.740
Compute the torques.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.820
You know?

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:24.050
Let's put A right in the center,
compute the angular momentum,

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:25.500
take its time
derivative, and you

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.350
will find that this
one, as it spins,

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:30.940
tries to create a
moment like that.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.170
And this one, as it spins tries
to create a moment like that.

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:37.360
And they're exactly
equal and opposite.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.143
This is dynamically balanced
and statically balanced.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:45.580
Hmm.

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.204
AUDIENCE: When there
was just one mass,

01:13:47.204 --> 01:13:50.855
was it dynamically balanced
about A, the axis of rotation.

01:13:50.855 --> 01:13:52.480
PROFESSOR: This is
not dynamic-- if you

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.740
put A right in the usual
center-- the original center

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.610
of gravity, we'll call A, at
this wheel-- this system is not

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:02.380
dynamically balanced with
respect to an A that's

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.990
right on the axle
and on the center.

01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:06.770
Because it has
this little offset.

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:08.320
OK?
