<i>This is my first real

It was when I first started
really getting into detail,

and I was getting a little bit
better at blacksmithing.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.830
So this bike, I pretty much
built around the motor.

made a sissy bar for it,

did all the turns

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.170
I fancied those up,
and then I made the seat.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.830
I actually took
a piece of metal,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.330
and I screwed it
to a telephone pole,

around the telephone pole

like, carpet padding,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920
put it on the seat, and then
I wrapped it in leather,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.790
and then I did
the--the lacing here,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.210

never do another one.

I--I really enjoyed doing it,
