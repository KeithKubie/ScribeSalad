00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.640
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.810
&gt;&gt; So just like last time we'll set
that the goal is to get the batter out

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.270
via pitching.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.810
And we'll add the necessary information
to our current working memory, but

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.450
when we get down here
something confusing happens.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.880
So we suggest
the throw-curve-ball operator

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.620
because our goal is to pitch and
the batter isn't out.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.980
But then, we also suggest they throw
a fast ball operator because the goal is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.880
to pitch, the batter's not out and
the batter bats left-handed.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.300
So, when we get down to rule seven,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.189
which is if only one operator has
been selected, it doesn't fire.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.530
So our current rules don't
actually lead anywhere.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.190
We never bottom out.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190
We never figure out what we want to do.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.750
&gt;&gt; Good David.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.740
That was the correct answer.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.080
So note what has happened?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.082
So far we had assumed that
the match between the percept and

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:51.234
the production rules captioning the
personal knowledge was such that, given

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:56.091
the percept we always have one rule
which will tell us what action to take.

00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.902
It may take some time
to get to this rule.

00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:00.135
Some rules may need to be established.

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:01.015
And then only so

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.885
the rules get established,
then only we get the action.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.055
But never the less,
the system would work.

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:07.685
The difficulty now is,

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.885
there is no rule which tells us
exactly what action to take.
