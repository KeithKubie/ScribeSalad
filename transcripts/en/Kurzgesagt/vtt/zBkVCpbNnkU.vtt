00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.410
Vaccines are celebrated for their part in fighting disease,

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.790
but a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger our health

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.320
instead of protecting it.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.920
The Internet is full of stories about allergic reactions,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.120
the onset of disability, and even death following vaccination appointments,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
and it's true. Vaccines can have side effects.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.340
Let's look at how they work and how dangerous they really are.

8
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.920
Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells, soldiers,

9
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.450
intelligence cells, and weapons factories every day.

10
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.220
You're attacked countless times,

11
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.140
but you're immune soldiers alone usually deal with that so you don't even notice

12
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.840
if an infection become serious though.

13
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.730
Our intelligence cells gather intel about the attackers and activate our weapons

14
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:01.564
factories,

15
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.930
you know the weapon antibodies then like targeted missiles produced specifically

16
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.930
to combat the invader. Unfortunately,

17
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:13.600
this process takes several days to complete.

18
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.170
That gives intruders a lot of time to do damage.

19
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.180
Contrary to popular wisdom. What doesn't kill you? It doesn't make you stronger.

20
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.380
Our bodies really don't want to fight serious wars over and over.

21
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.000
So our immune system came up with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger

22
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:31.834
over time.

23
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.160
If we find an enemy that is dangerous enough to trigger our heavy weapons,

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.520
our immune system automatically creates memory cells.

25
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.140
Memory cells remain in our body for years in a deep sleep,

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.800
they do nothing but remember when an enemy attacks for a second time,

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.640
the slumbering memory cells awakened and order coordinated attacks and the

28
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:55.990
production of antibodies.

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.620
This is so fast and effective that many infections you beat once will never make

30
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.350
you sick again. You might even be immune against them forever,

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.800
which is also why little kids are constantly ill.

32
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.200
They don't have enough memory cells yet,

33
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.170
and this beautiful natural mechanism is what we build on when we use vaccines,

34
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.140
how vaccines work.

35
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

36
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.560
<v 0>as great as memory cells are obtaining them,</v>

37
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.220
throat infection is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.

38
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.140
Vaccines are a way of tricking our bodies into making memory cells and becoming

39
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.800
immune to a disease. They pretend to be a dangerous infection.

40
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.230
One way of doing this is to inject invaders that can't do harm, for example,

41
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.940
by killing them or by ripping them into pieces and our immune systems deal with

42
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:48.980
these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.

43
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.350
Sometimes it's necessary to make our immune system work harder though to produce

44
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.240
even more than we cells. Live. Vaccines are the real deal.

45
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.920
An enemy, the company back is a bigger challenge than a dead one.

46
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.260
But this also sounds like a sort of horrible idea. What if the germs win?

47
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
To avoid that,

48
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.820
we breed a sort of weak cousin of the real gem and the lab just powerful enough

49
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.290
to annoy the immune system and creates enough memory cells. Okay,

50
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.490
so these are the basic principles of vaccine use.

51
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.390
They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune

52
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.160
against a very dangerous diseases.

53
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.590
Some like the flu virus mutates so often that we need a new vaccine every year,

54
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.730
but most vaccines protectors for years or even a lifetime.

55
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.440
But there's a catch like everything in life.

56
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.770
Vaccines have another side, side effects.

57
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060
What are they and what happens if your child develops one?

58
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.880
The risks of vaccines,

59
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.740
it's complicated to directly compare the side effects of vaccines with the

60
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.080
effects of diseases. For example,

61
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.980
hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated against measles in the west,

62
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280
but there were only 83,000 cases in Europe in 2018 so with numbers that

63
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:12.910
different,

64
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.710
even mild side effects can seem scary compared to the bad effects of a disease

65
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.480
that we don't see as much anymore.

66
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.440
Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963 virtually every single child

67
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.090
on earth contracted measles at some point,

68
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960
an estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s every single year,

69
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.840
but aren't measles ready that dangerous in the year 2019 with our advanced

70
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.700
healthcare and new technologies,

71
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?

72
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.350
Let's do a thought experiment based on real numbers.

73
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.480
Imagine a developed country in a parallel world. It has good healthcare,

74
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.170
but people stop vaccinating. In this scenario.

75
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.280
Let's say 10 million children called measles. What happens?

76
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.220
9,800,000 door,

77
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.970
98% will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.

78
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.640
Up to 800,000 of them or 8% will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.

79
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.380
700,000 or 7% we'll suffer from an ear infection,

80
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.600
which can lead to permanent hearing loss.

81
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.220
600,000 kids or 6% will suffer from pneumonia.

82
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.430
The most dangerous effect of measles is alone will kill 12,000 children up to

83
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.810
10,000 children or 0.1% will get encephalitis,

84
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.650
2,500 kids or 0.025% we'll contract SSV they disease where the measles virus

85
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.300
lingers in their brain and kills them. A few years later,

86
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
taken together around 2.5 million children will suffer from somewhat serious

87
00:05:55.451 --> 00:06:00.451
effects from Mesons and about 20,000 children will be killed by measles.

88
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.930
It doesn't stop here though.

89
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.520
The kids who beat measles are left with a severely damaged immune system that

90
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:12.521
needs a lot of time to regenerate time for other diseases to do further damage.

91
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.653
Aside from that,

92
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.160
what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really bad time for about

93
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:23.030
two weeks. Okay, but what about vaccines?

94
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.820
It's only fat and look at these risks too.

95
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.550
So let's repeat our thought experiment,

96
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.420
but this time we vaccinate 10 million children with MMR.

97
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.040
What would theoretically happen here after being vaccinated,

98
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.460
of our 10 million kids, around 10% get a fever.

99
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.180
500,000 or 5% will get a mild rash up to 100 or 0.001% might have a serious

100
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:54.881
allergic reaction and we'll have to be treated up to 10 boys or 0.0001% might

101
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:02.531
get inflammation of the Genitalia and up to 10 kids in total or 0.0001% might

102
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:10.181
get the most serious side effects and Cephalitis so we've accelerated 10 million

103
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:15.731
kids in total around 120 had side effects that were somewhat serious thanks to

104
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.260
good medical treatment in developed regions. Almost all of them will be fine.

105
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.480
What about autism?

106
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.440
The connection of autism and vaccines stems from one source that has been

107
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:31.310
disproven countless times.

108
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.730
We'll link to further reading and videos in the description,

109
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.390
but in 2019 it's fair to say that vaccines do not cause autism.

110
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.580
All right, but what about deaths?

111
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.260
It's really hard to say if even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated kids

112
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:49.094
would die.

113
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.750
We really did look hard and talk to a lot of different experts.

114
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.790
If we ignore self reporting,

115
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.320
we could only come up with a tiny handful of documented cases for all the

116
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:05.000
hundreds of millions of children who received the MMR vaccine since 1971

117
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.820
measles are many,

118
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:12.500
many thousands of times more dangerous for your child than even the absolute

119
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:15.020
worst case of vaccine side effects.

120
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.300
You have to search for lethal vaccine side effects with a huge magnifying glass,

121
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.463
and even then,

122
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.470
it's very hard to find confirmed cases while deaths from measles are real and

123
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.650
easy to find. In 2017 alone,

124
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.750
110,000 people died from measles worldwide. Statistically,

125
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.650
today, 300 children will die of measles. One.

126
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:44.630
Since this video started, you can compare vaccines to seatbelts.

127
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.890
Are they aware freak accidents where someone gets killed by their seatbelt?

128
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.270
Well, yes,

129
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.530
but do you personally think it's safer to not put a seatbelt on your kid?

130
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.380
Wait a second. What if your kid is actually allergic?

131
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.670
What if none of the things we've said applies to your specific situation?

132
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.620
In this case,

133
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.810
you need to become the greatest vaccination promoter of all because if your

134
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.680
children can't be vaccinated, only the collective can protect them.

135
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.420
This is called herd immunity and it's the only thing that can protect your

136
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:19.770
unvaccinated child.

137
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.510
Herd immunity means that enough people are immune to a disease that it can't

138
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.300
spread and dies before it reaches its victims.

139
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.480
But to accomplish this for measles alone,

140
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.140
95% of the people around you need to be vaccinated.

141
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.743
Conclusion.

142
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.910
The problem with the debate about vaccines is that it's not fought on a level

143
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:46.740
playing field. While the pro vaccine side argues with studies and statistics,

144
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.790
the arguments against them are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling,

145
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.060
anecdotes and information and feelings are often immune to facts will not

146
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:59.160
convince anybody by screaming at them,

147
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.680
but we can't hide from the reality of water.

148
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.681
Anti-Vaccine conspiracies do they kill babies too young to be vaccinated?

149
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.860
They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.

150
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.890
They bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction and the biggest

151
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.010
side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children.

152
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.680
Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have to eradicate the monsters

153
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:30.330
that most of us have already forgotten. Let's not bring the beasts back.
