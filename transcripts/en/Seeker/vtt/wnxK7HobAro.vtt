00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.699
You’d think you’d notice a gorilla right
in front of you, right?!

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:04.699
Maybe not.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:06.680
You're about to find out why.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.080
Hey everyone, I’m Sapna here for DNews.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.690
Your brain is pretty awesome.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.800
I mean that, congrats on a really amazing
brain.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
But I’m going to let you down gently: it’s
not perfect.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.330
You’d know this if you ever missed something
obvious hiding in plain sight, like a car

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.939
that came out of nowhere or a gorilla walking
through a basketball game.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.760
I’m not exaggerating, in 1999 Harvard psychologists
filmed two groups of people passing basketballs

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.840
to each other.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.380
Halfway in, a man in a gorilla suit walks
right into the middle of the game, looks directly

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.670
at the camera, beats his chest, and leaves.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.329
Before showing the video in their classes,
the researchers instructed the students to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.879
count how many times the people in white passed
the ball.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
With their focus on that, 50% of students
missed the gorilla.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.160
The findings were published in the journal
Perception in an article titled, “Gorillas

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.059
in Our Midst,” cuz apparently the researchers
have a sarcastic sense of humor

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.270
This study demonstrates a psychological concept
called “inattentional blindness” and it’s

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.659
your brain’s fault.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.920
It only has so much computing power so when
it’s focused on one task, it does it at

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.740
the expense of others.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.639
This means your brain has to be selective
about the visual information it pays attention

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.520
to or else it would be overwhelmed.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.770
A Georgia Institute of Technology psychologist
recently demonstrated where this filtering

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.709
happens in your brain using a functional MRI
machine.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:37.659
The psychologist found activity in the frontal
cortex while volunteers performed visual tasks.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.320
The frontal cortex is the part involved in
thinking and decision making.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.049
It’s job is not to process the information
coming from your eyes, that’s the visual

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.570
cortex’s job.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.569
The visual cortex runs the information through
several processing centers to distinguish

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.099
shape, color, distance, and movement.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.270
Things like object identification are also
handled somewhere else- in the inferior temporal

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.270
cortex.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.710
But the frontal cortex has the final say on
what you think you see, and according to the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.159
researcher, it decides that in three stages.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:14.170
Stage one is selection, where the back of
the frontal cortex picks out what to pay attention

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.170
to.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.020
The second stage is combination, where the
midsection of the frontal cortex takes the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.219
visual information it deemed important and
combines it with other information like expectations.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.689
Basically you’re more likely to see something
you’re expecting to see, and miss things

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.390
you aren’t looking for.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.819
And lastly there’s evaluation at the front
of the cortex, where you consciously make

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.810
a decision about what to do.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.310
The researcher demonstrated the hypothesis
by inhibiting the back and midsection of the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.290
volunteers’ frontal lobes.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.129
When he did, they had more trouble completing
the visual tasks.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.219
Conversely when he stimulated the front portion-
the part involved in evaluation- they performed

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.530
slightly better, picking up on things they
had missed before.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.870
The experiment demonstrates that before information
reaches the front of your frontal cortex,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.140
there are two gates it has to pass through
where things can go potentially go wrong.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.019
You can just miss important information, like
a person in a gorilla suit, because you believed

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.349
something else was more important.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.980
Or you can filter the gorilla out because
you weren’t expecting to see a gorilla because…

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.090
why would you?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.859
By the time you’re ready to make a decision,
the information you base it on could be faulty.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.879
These two missteps are usually harmless but
they can explain why for example a blockbuster

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.510
movie is full of editing mistakes.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.249
And sometimes there can be serious repercussions
like when you’re driving- If you’re too

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.459
focused on something else, say, a text message,
you might not notice the car in front of you

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.560
has stopped.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.950
By the way, did you know that If you get in
a crash and you’re NOT wearing your seatbelt

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.709
you only have a 50/50 chance of surviving?

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.709
No rewinds.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.709
No do-overs.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.260
So why do cops enforce seat belt laws?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.230
Because In real life, you don’t get a second
chance.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.900
And now you know your brain can make you miss
things that are there, but it can also make

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.680
you see things that aren’t.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:17.539
Trace and Julian have the scoop on hallucinations
here.

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.019
So did you spot the gorillas that popped up
during this video?

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.530
How many did you see and where do you think
you saw them?
