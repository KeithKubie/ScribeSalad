00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.800
I'm going to warm-up with
a couple of straight-up

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.280
multiplying fractions or
multiplying rational number

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.670
problems-- rational number is
just another way to say

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.360
fractions, it's just any number
that can be expressed

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.790
as a fraction.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.190
And then we'll actually do a
word problem that deals with

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.750
the multiplication
of fractions.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.280
Let's do part a.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.420
5 over 12 times 9 over 10.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.100
And the fun thing about
multiplying and dividing

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.750
fractions, at least in my mind,
it's easier than adding

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.300
or subtracting, you literally
just multiply the numerators

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.250
when you're multiplying and
multiply the denominators.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.740
So you could say that this is
the same thing as 5 times 9

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.450
over 12 times 10.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.730
And we could just multiply
these out, 45 over 120.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.170
But that won't be in
simplest form.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.970
We'd be multiplying
these big numbers.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.830
And before we do that we can
divide the numerator and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.020
denominator by numbers that will
simplify it a little bit.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.540
So let's do that.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.330
So if we divide the numerator
and the denominator by 5, then

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.790
this will become a 1, this
will become a 2.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.090
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3, this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.430
will become a 3, and this
will become a 4.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850
So the whole thing is simplified
to 1 times 3, which

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.250
is 3 over 4 times 2, 3/8,
which is a lot easier

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.020
than 45 over 120.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.600
All right.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.210
Let's just do part c here.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.690
3/4 times 1/3.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.880
We could do that exact
same principle.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
This is going to be 3 times
1 over 4 times 3.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.730
We can skip a step if we like
and cancel out the 3's in the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.110
numerator and the denominator.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.890
So you divide the numerator
and denominator by 3.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.270
You'd say that that's
a 1, and that's a 1.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.930
And you'd say OK, 1/4 times 1,
1 over 1, is equal to 1/4.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.000
And all I did there, I skipped a
step, but all I did, I said,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.950
OK, that's going to be the
same thing as 3 times 1

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.970
over 4 times 3.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.030
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.730
3 and you get 1/4.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.420
These are the exact
same thing.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.410
I'll do e and f just to
finish up things.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.780
So e is 1/13 times 1 over 11.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570
Well, we just multiply
the numerators.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.250
We get 1 over whatever
13 times 11 is.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.790
Let's see, 13 times 10 is 130,
and so we're going to have to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.690
get one more 13 in there.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.350
So it's going to be 143, if
I did that correctly.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.290
Yeah, 13 times 10 is 130.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.900
Yup.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.330
Looks good to me.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.230
All right, one more, get
us really warmed-up.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.570
All right.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.380
I'll do part f.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.660
7 over 27 times 9 over 14.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.890
We can do the same trick
we did over here.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
Divide the numerator and the
denominator by 7, so this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.080
becomes a 1, this becomes a 2.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.920
Then we can divide the numerator
and denominator by

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.220
9, this becomes a 1,
this becomes a 3.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.380
So this becomes 1 times 1
over 3 times 2 or 1/6.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.740
Or you could have said just 7
times 9, which is 63 over 27

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.040
times 14, which is a huge number
that I don't know the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.200
exact number to and it would
have taken you forever to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.560
actually put it in a
most simple form.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.030
But this way when you divide it
ahead of time it simplified

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.930
things a good bit.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.540
So let's do a word problem.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.860
And it involves monkeys.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.280
Three monkeys spend
a day gathering

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.820
this coconuts together.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820
When they have finished
they're very

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.750
tired and fall asleep.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.460
The following morning the first
monkey wakes up, not

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.590
wishing to disturb his friends,
he decides to divide

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.980
the coconuts into three
equal piles.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.630
There is one left over, so he
throws this odd one away,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.850
helps himself to his share
and goes home.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.000
So this is the third monkey.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
So he divides what he sees
into three piles.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.780
We don't know how many
are in each pile.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.200
Pile 1, pile 2, pile 3.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.660
And then he had one coconut
left over that he chucks.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.240
That's a coconut right there.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.290
That's with that first, he
divides the coconuts into

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.190
three equal piles.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.840
There was one left over so he
throws that away, helps

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.230
himself to his share
and goes home.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.200
So his share is, let's say,
he takes this share and

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.980
he throws this away.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.060
That's what this tells us.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340
He decides to divide the
coconuts into three equal

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.860
piles, there is one left over,
so he throws it away and he

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100
helps himself to his share.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.180
All right.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.880
Now a few minutes later the
second monkey awakes, not

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.830
realizing that the first has
already gone, he, too, divides

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.820
the coconuts into three
equal heaps.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.020
He finds one left over, throws
the odd away, and helps

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.740
himself to his fair share.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.280
So this is he finds one left
over, throws the odd away,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.550
helps himself to
his fair share.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.430
So this is the second monkey.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.510
So this is all he sees.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.350
He just sees these two
piles together.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.040
So he divides these into
three equal heaps.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.980
So maybe that's one heap right
there, that is-- let me make

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.930
it a little bit more equal.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.650
So this is one heap, that is
two heaps, and that is--

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.130
actually, he actually sees
one left over, too.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.180
So let me make that clear.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.600
He finds one left over, so he
finds one coconut left over,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.040
and then the rest of this--
remember, this is gone and

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.610
this is gone.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.550
So this is all we're dealing
with at this point.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.040
One left over and three
equal heaps.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.660
So one heap, two heaps,
and three heaps.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.810
And then he takes
one for himself.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.220
He takes one for himself, and he
takes the extra coconut and

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.310
he throws it away.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.130
So this is all we
have left now.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.690
And then you could guess
what happens.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.460
In the morning, the third monkey
awakes to find that he

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.530
is all alone.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.690
He spots the two discarded
coconuts and puts

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.700
them with the pile.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.420
Interesting.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.440
OK, so he puts them with
the pile, giving him

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.530
a total of 12 coconuts.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.720
So he spots that one
and that one, puts

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.000
them back in the pile.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.150
So that is the first-- or maybe
I should say-- yeah,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.490
this is the first monkey or
three monkeys-- actually, I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.870
should call this the
first monkey.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.150
The first monkey did this, the
second monkey, and now we're

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.980
dealing with the third monkey.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.650
He spots the two discarded
coconuts and puts them with

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.210
the pile giving a total of 12.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.770
So this is the third monkey,
the third one to wake up.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.190
Sorry if I confused you.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.560
This was the first one to wake
up, has one left over with

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.620
three equal piles.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.860
One left over, keeps
one for himself.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.010
Second monkey, he sees these
coconuts, he makes three equal

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.810
piles, has one left over.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.300
Then the third monkey wakes up,
sees these two coconuts,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.490
and then sees what's in
the pile and he has

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.960
a total of 12 coconuts.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.350
And so they're saying how many
coconuts did the first and a

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.660
second monkey take?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.630
All right.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.300
Actually, let me
be very clear.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.170
The total is 12 coconuts.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.690
This right here is 12 coconuts
after taking

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.120
the discarded ones.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.900
So this is 12, this right here
must be 10 coconuts.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.750
And so this is 10 coconuts, and
if you look at these two

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.010
piles that are left over, this
must be 5 coconuts, 5

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.070
coconuts, and he took
5 coconuts.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.760
So if you go to this point over
here, how many coconuts

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.710
were there?

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.560
Well, there must have been 15
plus this 1 coconut over here.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.520
So the first monkey must
have had 16 coconuts

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.000
in these two piles.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600
So this must have
been 8 and 8.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.630
And then he took an
equal share of 8.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.130
So to start off with we had 8
times 3, 24 coconuts plus 1.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.320
So we started with
25 coconuts.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.340
This guy took 8, then
we had 16 coconuts.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.940
He took 8, got rid of 1,
so he only had 16 left.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.960
The second guy comes along and
he said, OK, I'm going to

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.400
divide it into 3 groups of 5.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400
I have one left over.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.690
He took 5.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.940
Then you had 10 left over plus
the 2 discarded ones was 12.
