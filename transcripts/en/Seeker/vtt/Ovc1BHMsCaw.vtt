00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.790
For those of you who don’t know me very
well.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.620
My previous job was actually as a point guard
for the Los Angeles Sparx.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.120
Julian: I call shenanigans on that!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.289
You're way more of a power forward.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.709
L:Hello peddlers of ideas, Lissette

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.709
J:and Julian

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:17.759
L: here for DNews.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.130
BS is nearly everywhere, and now researchers
are making sure it’s got a place in science

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.460
journals too.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.279
Scientists from the University of Waterloo
even put together a Bullshit Receptivity Scale,

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.509
designed to gauge how likely people are to
fall for it.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.690
According to Princeton Philosopher Harry Frankfurt,
though BS can take many forms, there is one

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.030
particular type of bull-patty statement that
we seem to fall for the most; pseudoprofound-bullshit.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.900
This is made up of statements that lack true
meaning - empty statements that are designed

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.530
to impress, but don’t really get at anything.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.580
J: Manure peddlers of the pseudotype variety
may or may not be aware of the truth - they

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.900
may believe what they’re saying even though
they are totally clueless.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.480
This is different from liars in that liars
are aware of the truth and intentionally manipulate

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.230
it to deceive someone.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.000
Pseudo profound statements are also different
from nonsense, because nonsense statements,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
on their surface, are obviously not communicating
anything - they may lack proper syntax and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.320
structure.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.500
L: Whereas male bovine excrement seems - on
the surface - to make sense.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.760
In their article published in the journal
Judgment And Decision Making, researchers

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.930
give some examples of pseudoprofound-bullshit.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.550
I’m including one of them for you to test
if you can sniff it out.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.550
Reaaaady….

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.550
J: Yep, bring it on.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.240
L: Which one of these 3 statements is pseudo-profound:
1: Hidden meaning transforms unparalleled

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.850
abstract beauty.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.980
2: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.590
3: Unparalleled transforms beholder meaning
beauty

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.300
J; Ok I think I know but why don’t you go
first.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.750
Y’know, so I can make sure you’re right.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.780
L: Ok, so you may have immediately noticed
that there is definitely something wrong with

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.280
statement 3 - it’s easy to see that it’s
plain nonsense.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.590
It doesn’t even have a proper sentence structure.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.820
Statement 2 is a cliche, but it conveys a
fully formed idea.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.810
That leaves statement one.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.200
“Hidden meaning transforms unparalleled
abstract beauty.”

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.240
It sounds nice, but it’s going in circles
- it means nothing.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.920
But, if you didn’t catch that Statement
One is the culprit right away… you’re

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
not alone.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
Julian, did you get that?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.639
J: Yeah, that’s exactly what I got.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.639
L: Poppycock.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.670
J: Ok, you got me.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.610
But, detecting rubbish can be tricky - especially
when you’re not being prompted to look for

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.189
it - like we just did right now.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.470
In the real world, people fall for drivel
all the time - some of us more than others.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.969
Surprisingly, one of the things that seems
to be linked to our bull patty detector 5000

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.019
is our political views.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.269
I know all of you instantly thought you’d
be better at detecting flim flam, but half

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.779
of you aren’t going to be happy.

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.879
L: In a study of 196 people published in the
journal PLOS One, researchers used the Bullshit

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:49.609
Receptivity Scale to see how supporting democratic
versus republican candidates relates to BS.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.120
They found that participants who supported
this election cycle’s republican candidates

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.939
Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump were
more likely to fall for baloney than those

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.310
who supported the democratic candidates: Hillary
Clinton, Martin O’Malley, and Bernie Sanders.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.459
J: What’s more, they also found that the
participants who held more politically conservative

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.659
views had a greater tendency to see meaning
in moonshine compared to those who were more

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.049
politically liberal.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.590
And to clarify these are conclusions that
have been found in just one study.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.120
L: Another factor that makes people more susceptible
to falling for flimflam is their default when

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.069
receiving new information - according to researchers
like Gilbert and Spinoza some people have

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.370
a bias towards rating new information as true
as opposed to false.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.370
It’s their fallback.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.359
When we are mentally exhausted, we are more
likely to resort to this default.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.939
So people who lean towards believing new information
is true are more likely to fall for BS.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:44.230
J: In a 2015 study titled On the reception
and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit,

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.480
researchers found that claptrap receptivity
was positively correlated with believing in

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.930
conspiracies, in paranormal activity, and
the efficacy of alternative medicine.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.419
But all is not lost, researchers at The University
of Waterloo and Sheridan College, note that

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.169
there are certain things that can help you
spot flapdoodle.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.730
L: One handy tool is looking for vagueness.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.180
If a statement is vague - unclear or ambiguous
in it’s meaning - you should probably probe

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.180
deeper.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.090
They also note that certain mediums might
be more prone to BS than others Twitter, for

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.370
example, which limits statements to 140 characters
might be more likely to foster hogwash than

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.769
something like a textbook.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.669
And, of course, it doesn’t hurt to pay attention
to the source.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.629
But why does it make you so angry when your
relatives support candidates your hate?

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.780
Check out my other episode here for more on
Why Politics Make Us So Angry

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:44.789
What tools do you use to spot BS?

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.460
