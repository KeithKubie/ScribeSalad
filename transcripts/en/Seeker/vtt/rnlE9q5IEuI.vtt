00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.177
Look, we've always known that
Einstein was better than us.

00:00:03.177 --> 00:00:04.010
But now we know why.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:11.650
Anthony here from D News.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.280
And we are constantly hearing
about Einstein's brain.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.620
It was removed about eight
hours after his death,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.060
and we've just been
poking at it ever since,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.490
looking for the differences that
made it such a brilliant mind.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.130
And a study recently published
in the journal, Brain

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.690
thinks that they've
found the answer.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.270
And it's in the corpus callosum,
the body's largest bundle

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.680
of neuronal fibers
that sits underneath

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.110
your cerebral cortex.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.690
Among its functions
is making sure

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.640
that both halves
of the brain can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.860
communicate with each other.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.193
Now, we've talked about the
left brain, right brain myth

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:43.570
and lateralization before.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.600
Spark Notes version--
there's no such thing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.049
as a left or right brain person.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:48.590
You are a beautiful,
unique snowflake

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.390
that can do anything you want,
thanks to practice and neural

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.100
plasticity.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.807
However, the things
you do are controlled

00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:56.140
by different parts of the brain.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.430
And if those parts
are on different sides

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.230
and need to work
together, they've

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.810
got to go through the
corpus callosum to do it.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.480
Einstein's corpus callosum had
extremely thick connections

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.270
between the halves of three
very interesting brain

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.590
regions-- his
prefrontal cortex, which

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.970
controls abstract thinking
and decision-making,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.510
his parietal lobe, which is all
about sense and motor function,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.260
and his visual
cortex, for seeing.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.810
The thicker connections could
be responsible for lower

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.870
lateralization of brain
activity and at least partially

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.400
explain why he was so
brilliant, which is interesting,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.540
because lower
lateralization in the brain

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560
has also been linked to
schizophrenia and psychopathy.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.180
So how do you get
brain like Einstein's?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.520
Last week, I talked a little
bit about neural plasticity

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.570
and how the more you use
a part of your brain,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.070
the stronger it gets and the
thicker its connections become.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.500
So in theory, to
think like Einstein,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.200
you've got to do
activities that will

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.880
keep your corpus
callosum active and use

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.750
both hemispheres of
your brain at once.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840
Multiple studies have
shown that musicians

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.360
tend to use their
whole brain more.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.350
Einstein himself
was a violinist.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.370
So maybe taking up an instrument
or music lessons could help.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.610
Handedness is connected
to lateralization.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.960
So by being
left-handed, I'm using

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.800
the right part of
my motor cortex.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.840
A 2004 study in Nature
showed that juggling

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.240
could help me strengthen
up my whole brain activity

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.460
by requiring me
to use both hands.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.130
Just using your
non-dominant hand

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.380
throughout the day for things
like brushing your teeth

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.200
could potentially
do the same thing.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.340
Logic and math puzzles are
good, because number estimates

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.810
and comparison use both
halves of your parietal lobe.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.644
And if you're terrible
at them, like me,

00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:29.810
it means you also get to
work out your amygdala, yor

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.770
ventral medial prefrontal
cortex, and your limbic system

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.590
by flying into a rage.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.730
Just remember to
flip the desk over

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.430
with your non-dominant hand.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.240
I have some issues.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.100
Anyway, an unanswered
question here

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.520
is whether Einstein was
born with a more developed

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.430
corpus callosum to
begin with, which

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.610
would have given this sort
of thinking a head start.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.470
I also cannot tell you with
a straight face that brushing

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.424
your teeth with the wrong hand
or playing the ukelele is going

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:55.090
to turn you into the
next great thinker.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.010
But making conscious
decisions to learn, adapt,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.641
and be creative
every day can't hurt.

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:00.390
What do you think?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.510
Was Einstein born better, or
did he make himself that way?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.350
