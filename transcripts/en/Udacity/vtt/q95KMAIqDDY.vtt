00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] Let me now ask the same question about P3

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is the particle with the largest importance weight.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Please check yes or no.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Is it possible that P3 is never sampled in the resampling step?

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Yes or no?
