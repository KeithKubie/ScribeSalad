00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.481
We're asked to construct an
angle bisector for the given

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:03.980
angle.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.841
So this is the angle
they're talking about.

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:07.340
And they want us
to make a line that

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.460
goes right in between
that angle, that

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.450
divides that angle
into two angles that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.930
have equal measure,
that have half

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.890
the measure of the first angle.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.610
So let's first find
two points that

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.980
are equidistant from this
point right over here

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.880
on each of these rays.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:31.120
So to do that, let's
draw one circle here.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.920
And I can make
this of any radius.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.947
Wherever this intersects
with the rays,

00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:36.530
that's where I'm
going to put a point.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.460
So let's say, here and here.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.300
Notice both of these
points, since they're

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.180
both on this circle,
are going to be

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.780
equidistant from
this point, which

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.870
is the center of the circle.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770
Now, what I want
to do is construct

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.770
a line that is equidistant
from both of these points.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.600
And we've done that already
when we looked at perpendicular

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.260
bisectors for lines in
this construction module.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.800
So let's do that.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.319
So let's add their compass.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.985
And so what I want
to do, this circle

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.790
is centered at this point.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.800
And it has a radius
equal to the distance

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.860
between this point
and that point.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100
And then I do that again.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.690
So this circle is
centered at this point

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.160
and has a radius
equal to the distance

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.070
between that point
and that point.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.170
And then the two places
where they intersect

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.940
are equidistant to
both of these points.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.820
And so we can now draw our
angle bisector, just like that.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.360
And you might say,
well, how do we really

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.540
know that this angle
is equal to this angle?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.260
Well, there's a couple
ways we can tell.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.580
We know this distance
right over here

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.650
is equal to this distance
right over there.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.950
We know that this
distance over here

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.110
is equal to this
distance over here.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.060
And both of these
triangles share this line.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.450
So essentially, if you look
at this point, this point,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.080
and this point, that
forms a triangle.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.020
And if you look at this point,
this point, and this point,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240
that forms a triangle.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.480
We know those two
triangles are congruent,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.970
so this angle must be
equal to this angle.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.730
These are the
corresponding angles.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.300
So they're going
to be congruent.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.170
This is an angle bisector.
