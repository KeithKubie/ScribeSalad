00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.389
Onboard the spacecraft, 
the astronauts preset the timer,

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.601
enclose themselves in capsules,

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.940
and fall into a deep hibernation

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.879
that’ll carry them several 
hundred years into the future.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.780
This is a familiar scene 
in many sci-fi films,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.929
but could humans ever actually 
hibernate in real life?

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.700
Researchers interested in this question 
turn to the animal kingdom,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.780
where hibernation is commonplace,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.670
occurring in over 200 species 
that we know of.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.888
Take the Arctic ground squirrel.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:42.439
Native to the North American tundra 
and northern Russia,

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:44.951
this animal burrows 
beneath the permafrost

00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:47.663
and slips into a state 
of suspended animation,

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:53.809
its body temperature plummeting 
to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.740
Others, like the female black bear, 
can multitask,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.188
giving birth and lactating while they’re
hibernating through the winter.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:05.009
The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares 
for its long dormancy

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.889
by gorging on food and storing the 
majority of its fat reserves in its tail,

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:11.700
doubling its body weight.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.742
After hibernation, it emerges looking 
as svelte as ever.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:19.161
So why do these animals 
go to such extremes?

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:21.188
Hibernation is a necessity,

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:24.579
a survival tactic for making it 
through the harsh winter months

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.201
when dwindling food 
and water reserves threaten survival.

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.052
For many years, experts believed 
hibernation happened

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:33.689
only in arctic and temperate environments.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.470
But more recently, they’ve discovered 
animals hibernating

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.329
even in arid deserts 
and tropical rainforests.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.109
As hibernation kicks in,

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:48.049
animals’ heartbeats usually slow to
about 1 to 3% of their original speed,

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.579
like the dwarf lemur’s,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.540
which drops from its usual 
roughly 180 beats per minute

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.890
to just around four.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.688
Breathing also declines dramatically

00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:02.468
to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes 
in the lemur’s case.

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:05.282
And black bears, like most hibernators,

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:09.364
don’t urinate 
or defecate the entire hibernation season.

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:11.737
Hibernating animals appear to stay alive

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:15.720
by having just enough blood
and oxygen moving around their bodies.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.490
And scans of hibernating animals 
reveal that their brain activity

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.039
has just about flat-lined.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.449
But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.320
As far as researchers know,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.670
in lemurs and
ground squirrels anyway,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.878
the animals aren’t even 
sleeping for most of it.

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:37.330
Hibernation is actually made up of regular
bouts of reduced metabolic rate

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.830
and body temperature known as torpor.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.689
Animals can be in torpor 
for a few days to five weeks,

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.489
after which they resume normal 
metabolic rate and body temperature

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.093
for about 24 hours,

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.867
before going back into torpor again.

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:54.578
The phenomenon is known 
as an interbout arousal,

00:02:54.578 --> 00:02:57.951
and why it occurs is still a mystery.

00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.429
The behaviors inherent in hibernation,

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.859
like going five weeks without sleep,

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.230
or dropping to 
near-freezing body temperatures

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.769
would be potentially fatal 
to non-hibernating species like us.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.640
To find out how hibernators 
are able to do this,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.609
researchers turned their attention
to those animal’s genomes.

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.839
So far, they’ve discovered that
hibernation is controlled by genes

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.700
that turn off and on in
unique patterns throughout the year,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.360
fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology 
and behavior.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.230
For example, ground squirrel, bear 
and dwarf lemur studies

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.739
have revealed that these
animals are able to turn on the genes

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.300
that control fat metabolism

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.979
precisely when they need to use 
their fat stores

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.089
as fuel to survive 
long periods of fasting.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.879
And the genes in question 
are present in all mammals,

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.188
which means that researchers could
study hibernating mammals

00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:52.959
to see how their unique control 
of physiology might help humans.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.249
Understanding how hibernators deal 
with reduced blood flow

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.059
could lead to better treatments 
for protecting the brain during a stroke.

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:03.169
Figuring out how these animals avoid
muscle deterioration

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.051
might improve the lives 
of bedridden patients.

00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:09.319
And studying how hibernating animals 
control their weight with ease

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.020
could illuminate the relationship between
metabolism and weight gain in humans.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.589
And yes, more research in this area

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.480
might someday make 
human hibernation a real possibility.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.629
Imagine our surprise if the key to
intergalactic travel

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.689
turns out to be ground squirrels, 
black bears, and dwarf lemurs.
