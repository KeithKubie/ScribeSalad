1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
Okay.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.540
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.680
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.090
February 20th, 2017. What's going on? How, why Ya?

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.080
I am a recording off of my laptop. If this sounds a little, ah,

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.840
um, I'm in New York City. Came in town to do the, uh,

7
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.410
the Patrice O'Neal benefit, the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.653
<v 0>Um,</v>

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.100
<v 1>it's going to be going down tomorrow night at the New York City Center.</v>

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.500
And uh, it should be a great time. As you can tell. I'm a little jet lag.

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.790
I took a fucking red eye last night and there was this lady,

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.950
no, what's hilarious is when you have a kid, if you actually go on the road,

13
00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:48.610
the big thing when you go on the road now is not, you know, not the booze,

14
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:53.560
not the cigars, not hanging out with your friends. It becomes like, Holy Shit,

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.330
I'm going to get eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. So I get on the plane

16
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.220
<v 0>and um,</v>

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.860
<v 1>there's a woman not in my row,</v>

18
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.910
but the next row over she had a little baby and it was crying.

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
<v 1>And then the dude next to me fell asleep and started snoring. And,</v>

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
uh, I just started laughing. And, um, the, the poor woman,

22
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.540
like she was traveling alone with this baby. Right. And it was a baby too.

23
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.750
Maybe a little bit older than mine. I, I don't, I'm, this is my first kid,

24
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.080
so I can't judge. I don't know if this kid was two, three months,

25
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.940
I don't know if it was 26 years old and had that disease that that fucking baby

26
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.730
had in the Brad Pitt movie. Remember that?

27
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:43.290
Remember the old baby was just hanging around and um,

28
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.620
you know, that guy wanted to like bang the chick and he's like,

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.520
you got to get this old baby out of here cause it's weird me out. Which,

30
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:54.490
you know, I'd like to think that that guy later on,

31
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.180
once his dick wasn't hard and he was thinking clearly again,

32
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.670
he probably was thinking, you know, I probably shouldn't have said that.

33
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.720
You know, I probably shouldn't have trashed that old baby.

34
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.510
That was the name of a band. I used to play an old baby and uh, you know,

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.790
we got, we got a record contract and everything but uh, you know,

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.030
leasing a gun at appendicitis. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um,

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.540
anyway, so the baby's fucking crying and the poor woman,

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.600
like she falls asleep and the baby's like freaking out screaming and she can't

39
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.140
hear it because she's like, she's fucking exhausted. She's got a baby,

40
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:34.520
she's flying with it. So,

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.760
and I'm sitting there and I'm watching that thing squirming around in her hands

42
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.770
are like not really holding it anymore.

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.280
So now it's like this situation like is this,

44
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.570
is this lady going to drop that fucking baby?

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.310
So I'm staring over there.

46
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.660
I'm sure other people were looking at me thinking I was given or the evil line

47
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.040
cause a baby was crying but I wasn't, I was just,

48
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.150
I what the fuck I thought I was going to do, cause I still had my seatbelt on.

49
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.550
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.560
<v 1>Yeah. My safety first, then a baby's see that.</v>

51
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.180
That's why I'll never be a hero.

52
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.700
Because what a true hero does is he sees danger and without any sort of self or

53
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:21.530
an ECE and he's safe. You know what I mean? That's to me is a hero.

54
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.610
Like if you're, if you're in a fucking bank, right?

55
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.850
And these guys come in with guns and they go to rob the place and they said,

56
00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:32.810
we're going to blow everybody's fucking brains out and then you act on that.

57
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.060
You're not really a hero to me. Okay. Because at no point in that scenario,

58
00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:40.520
where are you safe? All right.

59
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.930
You were immediately in the situations to, no matter how you slice it,

60
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.580
no matter how many fucking people you say that the end of the day you were

61
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:54.110
motivated to save your own ass and everybody else getting saved along with you

62
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.000
is, uh, you know, that's just collateral damage.

63
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.320
That means positive. But if you're outside the bank, you're like, Holy Shit,

64
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.970
I'm out here. I mean the Bacon, Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, you know,

65
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.140
getting ready to go for a run, you know, fuel myself up.

66
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.370
You stretch your fucking hammies. And all of a sudden you see you,

67
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:18.890
I dunno if you look at one of those fucking giant bank windows,

68
00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:23.891
you see a robbery going down and then you go in there with you Larry Bird short

69
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.600
shorts. Right. And fucking try to stop the ride then to me, yeah.

70
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.670
That's like, do you want me, you know,

71
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.270
like there's like the hall of fame and then there's also, you know,

72
00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:39.200
people who literally have like their own wing of the hall of fame. Yeah.

73
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:40.370
To me that's like,

74
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.683
<v 0>you know,</v>

75
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.500
<v 1>that's when you get to your own way. But if you're already in the shit,</v>

76
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.200
I didn't, can't remember what the fuck I was talking about. Beyonce. Yeah. Okay.

77
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.360
Not a hero. Right. So

78
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.780
<v 0>yeah.</v>

79
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.160
<v 1>I finally sort of flagged down the stewardess and she goes, yes, you know,</v>

80
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:58.200
what can I get you? And I said,

81
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.020
I think what I have to fuck did I say? I said, I said,

82
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:08.550
can that baby fall? And she started laughing.

83
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

84
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.450
<v 1>Because she thought I was being sarcastic. Like,</v>

85
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:15.220
I was upset with the baby crying and she thought I meant like,

86
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.670
can that baby fall on the ground and shut the fuck up?

87
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.330
And she was like taken aback. But she also laughed,

88
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.950
which to me immediately made her really cool that she could laugh thinking that

89
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.620
some guy was just being sarcastic, being like an that baby,

90
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:31.140
please fall on the fucking floor of an airplane,

91
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.340
knock itself out so I can get some sleep. And I was like, no, no, no, no, no,

92
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:38.610
no. I, I mean, I was, I'm concerned that it's going to fall.

93
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.960
So she kind of went over there to make sure the baby was all right. But, um,

94
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.200
I dunno. I'm a changed man. My urge was to go over and hold the baby.

95
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.470
What's happened to me becoming a fucking softie. You know,

96
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.870
I actually, you know, I told you before,

97
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.020
I never got mad at babies crying on airplanes cause I always felt they were,

98
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.780
they were just expressing exactly what I was feeling.

99
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.190
<v 0>Um,</v>

100
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.160
<v 1>there's no way to get on an airplane and at some point, you know,</v>

101
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.830
and unless you go on some fucking great vacation,

102
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.200
but if you're getting on there and you know,

103
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:19.680
you're going back to see the relatives or some business trip or something like

104
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:21.090
that, you know,

105
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.030
and you just see some wide body coming down the fucking aisle and you're praying

106
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:28.190
to God, the person's not going to sit next to you, but you know, they got to,

107
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.360
you know, something's going to fucking happen.

108
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v 0>Um,</v>

109
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.980
<v 1>it'd probably be really good for you,</v>

110
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.760
for your life expectancy if you had access to your emotions that you could just

111
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:38.690
break down crying.

112
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.963
<v 0>Uh,</v>

113
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.580
<v 1>God, I would love to ski.</v>

114
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.490
Imagine you get up on a fucking plane and it was just the 300 adults in there

115
00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:50.090
just crying like babies. Yeah, I'd probably be a nightmare,

116
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.700
but there's a, part of me would think that that was awesome. Anyways,

117
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.450
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. So I, um, um,

118
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.550
I'm telling this fucking story in the wrong way. I actually, yesterday I did a,

119
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.120
I presented at an a Hollywood awards show, all freckles,

120
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.360
the big fucking phony himself. Um,

121
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
when all Hollywood rented a Tuxedo shout out to Mr Tux on Wilshire Boulevard,

122
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.173
<v 0>um,</v>

123
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.830
<v 1>wasn't going to say yeah, I had to, uh,</v>

124
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.710
had to do the presenting and I just sort of wrote something

125
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.930
and I quickly, when I got to the writer's guilt thing,

126
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:35.280
I immediately was like, wow,

127
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:39.660
I should have not just written what I'm gonna say once.

128
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.270
I should have gone over this a bunch of times.

129
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:46.650
So I just was kind of going over it in my fucking head and um,

130
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.020
you know, I thought I was just going to be a bunch of writers,

131
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:53.310
but there was some like actors there and shit,

132
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.950
like Denzel was there and uh,

133
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.830
who's the other guy? Yeah, uh, James Woods. It was a like,

134
00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:05.230
I dunno, it was like serious fucking people that,

135
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.050
that thing was when you go up in front of a bunch of writers,

136
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.230
like no matter what they've accomplished, you don't know what they look like.

137
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.580
So you can't get nervous.

138
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.600
Like someone could literally have been sitting there and they wrote the best

139
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:20.620
picture Oscar winner fucking nine years in a row, nine years.

140
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.660
I know what they look like, but whatever, you know,

141
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.400
they could accomplish shit like that.

142
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.710
You have no fucking idea who they like for the whole night.

143
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.370
They were just pulling people out of the crowd and I would be sitting there

144
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:31.900
going, I don't, I don't know who this guy is.

145
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:34.780
And then when they would say what the fuck they did, I was like, Jesus Christ.

146
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.880
<v 0>Um,</v>

147
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.640
<v 1>so with every person they pulled out of the crowd, like, I don't know,</v>

148
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:43.660
I just felt like the pressure was getting more and more and I just kept

149
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:46.540
muttering to myself, this is it. This is it one and done.

150
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:51.310
I'm never doing one of these fucking things again. This is not, this is not my,

151
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.940
uh, this is not my thing. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here. This is,

152
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.870
these people are, are smart. They are accomplished.

153
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.903
<v 0>Like,</v>

154
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.470
<v 1>like the shift that, you know, some of the fucking people in the crowd,</v>

155
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.460
there's stuff that they do.

156
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.200
You know what it takes to write a movie and actually get it made and then get

157
00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:16.201
that fucking giant rock up the fucking hill as opposed to me who just,

158
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.280
hey, here's a tis a shit show, but I think we'll try this. You know,

159
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:23.590
as I'm riding over on the subway to a club,

160
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.923
<v 0>um,</v>

161
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.110
<v 1>I don't know. It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and a patent.</v>

162
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.750
Oswald hosted it. Fucking murder. This monologue was great. Uh,

163
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.640
his mandala was so great. I kind of forgot that I had to go up.

164
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:42.641
I was just sitting there was a fan and joying for an hour person was there and

165
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.730
he went out and somehow gave his credit card information.

166
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.730
That's what he did before he said the nominees.

167
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:52.700
And somehow we made that fucking hilarious. And once again,

168
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.700
it just made me feel like, why am I here? I shouldn't be here.

169
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.620
So I'm finally waiting to go up. And, um,

170
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.150
James Woods is giving some sort of, um, lifetime achievement award

171
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.420
to a Oliver Stone. Thank God this shit wasn't televised.

172
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.720
<v 0>Um,</v>

173
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.300
<v 1>which is also fucking, somebody made a reference to that. Like,</v>

174
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.010
nobody works fucking harder than those guys.

175
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:21.650
And they wouldn't even put it on TV because nobody knows what they look like,

176
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:22.484
I guess.

177
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.383
<v 0>Um,</v>

178
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.520
<v 1>so he tells the whole fucking story of being best friends with Oliver Stone for</v>

179
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:34.150
35 years and I have to go on after this shit. And I just,

180
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.280
yeah, that's why I just kept thinking. I just kept,

181
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:41.930
I started looking at my watch the way I used to back in the day when I would do

182
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:44.360
newness, which, uh,

183
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.280
is an stand up expression for basically you're doing a college gig and the show

184
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:53.000
is essentially at 12 noon or one in the afternoon.

185
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.370
It's usually in a cafeteria and it is a fucking nightmare.

186
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.090
You go up there and you have to do an hour, you have to stand in front of it.

187
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.780
Just stand in public in a cat fucking college cafeteria in front of like God

188
00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:10.880
knows how many, three, four, five,

189
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:14.420
600 fucking college students who have no idea

190
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.880
that there's going to be any sort of performance, forget about a comedy show

191
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.050
and um, like the, the level of just fucking like, I don't even, I,

192
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:26.850
I think it's like,

193
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.590
it's really hard for me to be humiliated now after go doing enough of those.

194
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.690
Like you just get so walled off, you just, you just accepted you like, okay,

195
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:39.990
my life is going to suck. Like it's never sucked.

196
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.553
<v 0>Um,</v>

197
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.480
<v 1>starting in about three minutes, however, in an hour,</v>

198
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:52.340
in three minutes I'm going to be back in my rental car and I'm never going to

199
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:56.650
see these fucking again. That's what, that's what I,

200
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:58.420
that's the mindset I used to go into.

201
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.890
I used to go up there and I used to just psych myself up to be like,

202
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.930
how hard can I commit to these jokes?

203
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.050
How big of an ass can I make of myself?

204
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.353
<v 0>And</v>

205
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.530
<v 1>just to try and to not give into the horror slash negative vibe of the</v>

206
00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:21.630
situation. Because if you did that, I learned the hard way.

207
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:26.520
You were going to burn through an hour of material in like 17 minutes and you

208
00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:29.010
were going to be angry and, um,

209
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.110
your agent was going to get a call. Um, so anyways,

210
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.470
James Woods is going on and on and on. He brings up fuck it.

211
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:40.710
And I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that, um,

212
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.910
Oliver stone has accomplished so many things and all of their stone goes up

213
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:48.270
there. And after a night of fucking Trump bashing,

214
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.840
just so eloquently stated that all the countries we've invaded,

215
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:55.800
all of the stuff that we've done.

216
00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.500
And he said during all of our history of doing this,

217
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.860
there's been both Democrats and Republicans holding the office of President.

218
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.100
I thought I should have got more of an applause break, but um,

219
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.740
you know, I don't know.

220
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.490
The Trump thing is just such low hanging fruit at some points. Like we get it.

221
00:13:14.491 --> 00:13:17.580
Hollywood does not like Trump. Having said that,

222
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.410
this fucking guy went on stage and did the best Trump.

223
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:25.590
I should've gotten his name. I was so fucking nervous for what I had to do.

224
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.410
He did the best Trump impression, I,

225
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.520
the fucking nuance performance that he did.

226
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.133
<v 0>Uh, [inaudible]</v>

227
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.440
<v 1>it just, it was unbelievable. And then he did a lot of really,</v>

228
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.240
really fucking harsh jokes that like, even like writers,

229
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.530
they sit in fucking writer's room.

230
00:13:45.531 --> 00:13:47.510
You wouldn't think that you could get them to pull back.

231
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.950
It's just because they were in public. Um,

232
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.570
and he just totally fucking committed. So I got kind of inspired by that.

233
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:54.830
So long story short,

234
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.400
I'm sitting there waiting to go on. And, uh,

235
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.370
they had mentioned that Oliver Stone, I guess wrote Scarface, which I did know.

236
00:14:04.371 --> 00:14:08.540
And I remember my mother took us to go see that my youngest brother was nine at

237
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:09.374
the time.

238
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.880
So I thought that was pretty cool.

239
00:14:13.881 --> 00:14:18.710
So I just went out there and I sorta winged it,

240
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.770
told a story about how I used to think of pony was a small horse. And,

241
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.840
and I don't even, I can't remember what I said, but I think it went okay. And,

242
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.213
um,

243
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.020
I got off stage and I actually thought for half a second, like, you know what,

244
00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:37.640
that was actually kind of fun.

245
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.570
And I realized that a lot of my adversion to award shows is just my own social

246
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:49.100
anxiety of not knowing how to behave when there's a room full of people just

247
00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:50.840
saying positive shit to each other.

248
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.150
Like if that they'll give award shows, we're like, absolutely.

249
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.830
I'm not talking like roast. I don't like roasts either.

250
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.460
I don't know what happened to rose. Rose to me, used to be funny.

251
00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:05.850
And then it just became just like this, you know, Tourette's, the gay,

252
00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:10.800
I wouldn't fuck you with the, the dog, Dick Aides, Cock Shit cunt. You know,

253
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.730
it's just like, all right, so and so Z. I'm not saying any, we'll go, whoa,

254
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.140
whoa, go. But this Guy Bob, a dub a doable, I'd find them fucking mind.

255
00:15:19.141 --> 00:15:23.730
Numbingly boring. Um, but whatever,

256
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.370
somewhere in between there somewhat, somewhere short of that.

257
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.153
<v 0>Um,</v>

258
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.960
<v 1>if it was totally negative, I would have been comfortable.</v>

259
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:32.550
So I don't want the fuck that says about me.

260
00:15:32.551 --> 00:15:35.950
So I figured out what my hangup was with WWE. I will say though, um,

261
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:41.030
I still will never get past listening to fucking people talk politics in fucking

262
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.190
, uh, the environmental issues in all of that shit.

263
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.020
It's just like everybody knows we already know this shit. We already know it.

264
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.230
You're not going to inspire anybody. Like, you know,

265
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:55.450
I kind of gave a shit about the environment,

266
00:15:55.451 --> 00:16:00.451
but then when that guy from fucking a third rock from the Sun said that shit

267
00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:06.160
about Antartica I was like, wait a minute, this is an important issue.

268
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.030
<v 0>Um,</v>

269
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.360
<v 1>I dunno,</v>

270
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.690
maybe I'm just a negative con why am a negative con but I'll never be able to

271
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.420
again, I just, I just think that's just like some, like

272
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.230
it's like the Beyonce thing, you know what I mean?

273
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.950
Like I never would've thought that somebody could like

274
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.190
exaggerate the magnitude of creating life, but somehow she's done it.

275
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

276
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.920
<v 1>My wife gets so upset when I make fun. I don't, I mean,</v>

277
00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:39.160
I don't really have any feelings either. It's just fun to make fun of her.

278
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.640
Their fan base is just so fucking,

279
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.713
<v 0>I dunno.</v>

280
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.230
<v 1>I was like,</v>

281
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.920
I was driving me nuts when she was watching the grammys and stuff like that.

282
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:49.611
First of all, I don't get,

283
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:53.390
why does she get like a four hour performance and everybody else only gets like

284
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.860
fucking six seconds.

285
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

286
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.740
<v 1>You know, brutal, brutal. Mars is way around doing a bunch of costume changes.</v>

287
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:00.574
You know,

288
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.070
she comes out dressed like a Batman villain and fuck does like 45 minutes set.

289
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:09.760
I didn't think it was straight to the other performance, but you know what,

290
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.490
I gotta be honest with you. I don't think I could name one, so wow.

291
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.680
Bootylicious that was a,

292
00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:19.530
that's when she was with those other two girls that she kicked to the curb.

293
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.290
I gave you an an all girl group or if you're in a boy band,

294
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.760
you can't. At this point, people have to be so fucking educated that you know,

295
00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:32.490
at some point there's going to be

296
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.690
<v 0>okay.</v>

297
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.150
<v 1>Like one person is going to go solo,</v>

298
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.563
<v 0>you know,</v>

299
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:43.030
<v 1>it'd be extremely successful in the rest of you are just going to be sitting</v>

300
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:44.960
around working at staples.

301
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.400
Hoping that the person who left and is now wildly successful as a solo artist,

302
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.380
we'll eventually have a couple of shit albums so they have to come back to you

303
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:58.950
to do a reunion tour. You know what I mean? Like,

304
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:01.710
do you think Justin Timberlake's ever going to do the instinct thing?

305
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.510
Maybe he has. I don't fucking know.

306
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.933
<v 0>Um,</v>

307
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.163
<v 1>well I can say,</v>

308
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.030
I guess what I'm saying is if I was in a boy band way back in the day and I

309
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:14.310
still had my reddish orange hair,

310
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.353
<v 0>um,</v>

311
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.500
<v 1>I would save my money. I'd be like, you know what? Someone's going to break out.</v>

312
00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:21.910
I know it's not going to be making,

313
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.810
oh, whoa, whoa. Um, anyways,

314
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.240
how far into this podcast already? I gotta check.

315
00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:32.880
I gotta check the fucking title.

316
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.733
<v 0>Um,</v>

317
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.680
<v 1>hey, how about fucking, uh, the Boston Bruins? We,</v>

318
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.000
we are undefeated with our new coats coach. I don't even know who was it?

319
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.960
Bruce Cassidy of butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.

320
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.940
I already forgot his fucking name. I've been so God damn busy. Um,

321
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:52.211
hey.

322
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:55.970
You know what the best thing about having a baby is do you can watch so much

323
00:18:55.971 --> 00:18:59.600
fucking sports in the first three months before they learn how to crawl around

324
00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.310
and shit. Every morning

325
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.410
<v 3>my faith, my like my daughter is like my new best friend.</v>

326
00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:09.790
I mean I was going to happen anyway. Sorry for the extra noise.

327
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.320
Who was setting the laptop down? My daughters. My new best friend. Okay.

328
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:18.220
Aside from the obvious that she's my blood, she's my daughter and everything,

329
00:19:18.221 --> 00:19:22.120
but just like on a real level. She's my best friend.

330
00:19:22.121 --> 00:19:26.890
I probably have watched like 20 games with her already every morning.

331
00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:29.950
Right. The lovely Nia, you know,

332
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:32.560
she's exhausted cause she's still has to breastfeed at night.

333
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.150
Well I just have to wake up, you know,

334
00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:37.420
and change a diaper every once in a while. Sorry for the hiccups here.

335
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:43.770
So in the mornings I try to give my wife like three hours at least.

336
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.860
You know what I mean? Like I got it down where if she just feeds her,

337
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.230
I can take her and then I can have inch and you know, I have a, I have like,

338
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.150
I have a little fucking bottle, you know, to feed her. I can,

339
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.350
I can go three hours. I can keep her calm for fucking three hours while a,

340
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.660
my wife sleeps and all that type of stuff.

341
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:09.661
So what I do is I just tape games and every morning we come upstairs and I just

342
00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:16.600
put her on my chest and I just sit there and I watch games with her and um,

343
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.160
she starts to cry. You know what it is what's been working for me. You know,

344
00:20:21.161 --> 00:20:25.420
those giant exercise balls that people use for core strengths.

345
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.250
I just get on one of those and I just,

346
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.590
just fucking bouncing up and down on the thing.

347
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.870
It gives them the feeling of weightlessness or some shit.

348
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.420
And if they start crying when you're doing the bouncing thing,

349
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.300
cause it's killing my fucking back, right.

350
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.730
I just go fucking crazy big air. Then they just like, you know,

351
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.990
it makes them almost almost like when a dog wants to kill somebody and if you

352
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.740
make a loud enough noise and they fucking looks in the, in another direction,

353
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:53.740
it just, they, they completely forget that they wanted to kill somebody.

354
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.590
Babies are like that. They start to cry.

355
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.030
If you get this stomach to drop the kind of go make this face like Whoa,

356
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.301
you know,

357
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:05.110
the eyes get big and shit and then they just kind of get into that vibe and then

358
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.360
you slowly, you just slowly get it back down, two, three,

359
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.390
four repetitions back down to the robe level that you have and they don't cry

360
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.190
and um,

361
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.170
that eventually they fall asleep than I do. You know, that I got the,

362
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.840
I got the fucking game on and um,

363
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.830
I've watched more fucking college hoop so it's going to that Duke UNC game.

364
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:27.820
I've been, you know, obviously started taping all the Duke Games. Um,

365
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.810
I watched Duke, Virginia, I miss them against wake forest yesterday, but uh,

366
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.490
I got all the rest of the year.

367
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:36.880
I think they get like they got Syracuse on Wednesday.

368
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.260
Then they got university of Miami and then, uh, Florida state,

369
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:45.040
and then they play UNC again, March 4th. Even if you,

370
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:47.320
you're not a huge fan of fucking college basketball.

371
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.320
You've got to watch that one. I Watch Kentucky, Georgia,

372
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.190
southern Georgia lose another heartbreaker I'll watch Wisconsin, Maryland,

373
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.710
which was fucking so boring.

374
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.600
I went into my fucking Divia and I had tape, UNC, Virginia,

375
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:06.130
and I watched that one instead. And watch that. A fucking kid.

376
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:10.300
What's his name? Number 44 one UNC. The fuck is his name.

377
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.490
It's a literation Justin Jamison. No,

378
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.810
I can't remember his fucking name. I'm, how did I fucking sleep deprived here?

379
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.470
Um, totally got into that.

380
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.680
You've been watching the NHL and because of the all star break,

381
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.230
you know the Celtics gave me a break, you know, cause they, they,

382
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:31.900
they were on the all star break and I got to watch a bunch of college shit.

383
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.310
So anyways, uh, I landed here in New York,

384
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.380
slept the whole fucking flight head, my ims, cut my earplugs and I was all good.

385
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.310
That lady didn't drop that baby and um,

386
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.050
everything was fine. You know, nobody tried to hijack the plane,

387
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:50.950
everything was good.

388
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:56.000
And I get in a car taking a cab ride over to the hotel and, uh,

389
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.330
they had Trump on the radio and it's just a fucking guy, man. Jesus Christ.

390
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.450
He was talking about some terrorist thing that happened in Sweden. He goes,

391
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.390
I mean, this happened in Sweden. People swaying, he yells,

392
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.320
sweetened again. He just sounded like, I just, I cannot fucking believe,

393
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:24.030
I can't believe that this guy is president and I cannot believe that he's,

394
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:30.130
he's so successful out in that he is just implementing everything.

395
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.180
Like I didn't know you could just go around Congress with these fucking

396
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:38.710
executive orders. Man. It's fucking hilarious that he's found yet another,

397
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:43.690
this guy is like, if there's like a hall of fame for finding the loophole,

398
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.440
I mean, he really is like, guy's a fucking genius.

399
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.090
I just wish he was more stable because, um, you know,

400
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.540
Hillary would have scared the shit out of me and a much quieter,

401
00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.780
dignified way and not even dignify just as far as she knows how to ran.

402
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.070
I ran give a fucking speech, but, um,

403
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.530
I dunno, I dunno,

404
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.260
the day he stops reacting to people saying shit about them in award shows,

405
00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:16.230
I think I'll feel a little more comfortable with the fact that he's, uh,

406
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.870
you know, in power,

407
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.480
this is like the most simple and basic thought I've ever had in my life, right.

408
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.070
Is they keep talking about how the tensions, you know,

409
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.650
Ben of Russia was actually in communication with Trump in Europe.

410
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:36.690
So nervous because, uh, Russia's fucking doing whatever over there and blah,

411
00:24:36.691 --> 00:24:37.680
blah, blah, blah, blah.

412
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:40.320
And these guys are thinking this and these guys are thinking that.

413
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.170
And I just was thinking like, Hey, what, what is it?

414
00:24:43.171 --> 00:24:44.730
Everybody just fucking relax.

415
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

416
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.400
<v 3>Yeah. And I don't mean you, I don't mean me, we just regular,</v>

417
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.700
everybody's just walking around, you know, living your life,

418
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:58.570
getting a fucking newspaper. Why don't these cons up top?

419
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.460
Why don't you just fucking relax?

420
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.880
I know this is way too overly simplified, but like,

421
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.910
I would have no fucking idea what another country was thinking or planning to do

422
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.330
if you weren't yammering about it. All right?

423
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.660
If the other people on the other side weren't Yammer and about what the fuck

424
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:22.010
we're trying to do. You know, why don't we just stay?

425
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:25.520
Everybody just stays home. Where's your country?

426
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.670
You fucking stay there, right? I don't mean refugees.

427
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:31.520
I just mean leaders in your arms. Just fucking stay there.

428
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.110
We bring our guys back. Everybody just sorts out their own shit,

429
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.730
you know?

430
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.880
And when people come to your country to go to your fucking waterpark or

431
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:43.430
whatever, you'd given them Mickey Mouse ears. You get them.

432
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.020
You can be put on a show. What? Why can't it just fucking be like that?

433
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.100
You know why? Cause they want to get the fucking, you know,

434
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.690
it's natural resources and money. That's all the fuck it is. It's all it is.

435
00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:59.060
I don't give a fuck about any of that goddamn rhetoric.

436
00:25:59.061 --> 00:26:00.170
That's why the fuck they doing it.

437
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:01.700
And all they do is sit there scaring the shit.

438
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:05.450
I just wish everybody could like regular people just collectively all at the

439
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:10.280
same time be like and fuck it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

440
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:14.690
Fuck it. Fuck everything you're saying. Fuck wars. Fuck all of this shit.

441
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.060
If you fucking rich concept have a problem with each other,

442
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.380
why don't you sit down at your yacht clubs and try and fucking work it out?

443
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:26.300
You know, play a game of seven, seven fucking something stud,

444
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.470
whatever the final on car play,

445
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:32.210
whatever the fuck is he do you know enough with the blowing up of people in Shit

446
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.750
? Yeah. Adam,

447
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.350
I know it's completely oversimplified but Nike at sometime.

448
00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:41.570
But when I think about having mind control, like that's what I think of doing.

449
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.990
I yeah, you know,

450
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.250
we'd like people on the terrorist groups all the way to our country start saying

451
00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:51.760
we're going to go to war. It's just like, yeah, no, you know,

452
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.280
no we're not. Alrighty then and then just see what the fuck they would do.

453
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.250
I think they would literally lose their fucking minds.

454
00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:02.560
They wouldn't know what to do cause they'd just be like, well now what?

455
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.230
What am I going to do if I'm not out there trying to get more?

456
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.560
What am I going to do? Sit here alone with my own thoughts.

457
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.140
How many do you think would actually take their own lives? Like,

458
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.570
take that fatty over there in North Korea. I'm really in over my head.

459
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:18.931
By the way,

460
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:23.280
if you haven't realized that this is like meet the press with no press or

461
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.150
information, it's the same thing. I'll probably get sued by that program for,

462
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.100
uh, ruining their format. Um,

463
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.540
that fat cut there. You know,

464
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.910
all softy there doesn't have a whisker on his fucking face. Like,

465
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:39.540
you know what I mean?

466
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.000
Like you want to be able to grow a fucking crazy beard man. You know that,

467
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.130
that's one thing I'll have to commend that. I don't even know his name.

468
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.800
Kim Jong Il, is that his name? Was it

469
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.930
Kim Jong Il Jr Sonny boy. Um,

470
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.140
Frank Sinatra jr whatever the fuck his name is over there.

471
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.920
Like the fact that he can't grow a beard and he still has people scared

472
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:05.850
shitless. You know, like what if they could just collectively over there,

473
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.390
everybody just be like, yeah, dude, we don't give a fuck anymore. Right.

474
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:11.310
And everybody just goes about their business.

475
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.990
He still gets to live in that big fucking house, but nobody listens to.

476
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

477
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.620
<v 3>Like how, like nobody will kill for him anymore. No army will do anything,</v>

478
00:28:20.621 --> 00:28:23.140
but he still gets to keep the giant fucking house.

479
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:25.360
Like how fucking freaked out would he be?

480
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.980
<v 0>No,</v>

481
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.290
<v 3>nobody really goes over and talks to him or anything.</v>

482
00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:35.270
So eventually he has to come out and go to like a farmer's market, you know?

483
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.100
And then you don't talk to him.

484
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:41.480
You force him to acclimate himself socially. You know,

485
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.910
like anybody else would if they, when the new guy in town,

486
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.170
if I had mind control, that's what the fuck I would do. Um,

487
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.270
what I, I don't know what do I, I would probably do some evil,

488
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:58.400
shitty [inaudible] if you could control the entire world's fucking brains. Yeah.

489
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:02.480
I don't think I, I don't think I can handle that. All right. Fuck that. I,

490
00:29:02.481 --> 00:29:05.030
that was a dumb idea. All right, let's, let's read some, um,

491
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.010
let's read some fucking, uh, advertising here for this week. All right.

492
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.140
Uh, wince pronounced a wink, spelled wind.

493
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.510
So without the e w. I. N. C. Yeah. All right. We'll see. India,

494
00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:24.800
November. Charlie, finding new. Great. New Wine is tough. You know,

495
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:26.120
I can tell you I've got to agree with these.

496
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.810
I got agree with these fucking people. I'm a said consequent.

497
00:29:28.811 --> 00:29:30.530
I know they don't like what I say that during these reads,

498
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.340
I actually agree with these guys. Finding good wine is difficult.

499
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.580
It's like trying to find a good cigar, like where the fuck do you start?

500
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.400
There's so many of them. There's so many articles. There's so much fake news.

501
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.660
Fake news about the cigars. I'm finding new wine is tough.

502
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.210
That's why I've been telling you all about our sponsor club,W club,

503
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.710
JB Atlanta, not praising anymore.

504
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:58.570
I'd fly fish and paint and how they make it so easy to get wine personalized to

505
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:00.520
your palate and delivered right to your door.

506
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.160
And here's a little update free for you.

507
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.200
Club w is now called wince, spelled called wink,

508
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.980
spelled w. I. N. C. A new name and an improved look.

509
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.960
But here's the important part.

510
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.100
It's still the same amazing wine company introducing you to new wines that you

511
00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:18.580
love.

512
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.000
Why did they switch from club w to something that you'd really difficult to

513
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.990
pronounce and spell winked works directly. It's not,

514
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.610
I'm not saying it's difficult to pronounce,

515
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:30.820
but like if you looked at w I n C I mean you're not thinking wink.

516
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.690
What does that stand for?

some guy will start crying. It's just wine, right?

550
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.230
I hope this isn't making too much noise as I'm moving this thing around,

551
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:33.090
but like I can only sit in one position for so long. It's part of it.

552
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:33.540
We're getting

553
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.620
<v 3>old. Alright. Oh look.</v>

you're not saying your dick out, Yo,

560
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.190
I hope you drank some fucking white wine or your balls will be purple.

561
00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.053
Me undies,

562
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.950
picture of will picture a world we're putting on a new pair of underwear isn't

563
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:08.780
just fresh is stepping into a better day. So you got to take a shower first.

564
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:11.750
You can't just put it on a fresh pair on underwear. You gotta take a shower.

565
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.390
Then you put it on a fresh pair of underwear that you combine that with a fresh

566
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:18.590
pair of socks telling you right now your energy is going to be crazy. Like,

567
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:23.390
do you realize that there's this women out there that married guys because the

568
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:24.320
first time they met them,

569
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.860
they were wearing a fresh pair of underwear and socks and they just felt this

570
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:29.630
amazing energy from them, you know?

571
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.500
And then now they're stuck in this lovely loveless marriage wondering where it

572
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:41.030
all went. And what they have to understand is that like, you know, ladies,

573
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:45.140
if you, if you want your guide to treat you nice, okay?

574
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.530
Every once in a while you got to go out and you got to make sure you update his

575
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:51.800
fucking underwear and sock drawer. You put them in a better mood.

576
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.550
You know what I mean? You don't have to cower in the corner anymore.

577
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.800
All right? Think about it. Underwear.

578
00:33:57.801 --> 00:34:00.380
It's the first thing you put on in the last thing you take off. Unless you,

579
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:01.220
Matthew mcconaughey,

580
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.790
why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the

581
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.180
planet? Um,

582
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:10.280
Yonnie's focuses solely on producing the most comfortable underwear you've ever

583
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:13.670
experienced. This is all they fucking do. 24, seven.

584
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.920
My friends at me undies, I don't know.

585
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.270
You cons sent me a few pairs awhile back and now I can't imagine wearing

586
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:23.300
anything else I wear. I wear you only gave me fucking two.

587
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.490
Okay. And I am a man over the age of 45,

588
00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:30.860
which means I can't figure out the fucking Internet.

589
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:34.700
So even if I wanted to order some underwear, which I desperately need to do,

590
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.500
most of my underwear is at least from two presidents ago. Um,

591
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.150
I'm everything in this ad.

593
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.020

Not to mention his size because, oh, I'm sorry.

661
00:38:40.741 --> 00:38:42.140
I want to thank everybody, uh,

662
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.720
the night before the Patrice O'Neal benefit for everybody that is, uh,

663
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.300
bought tickets once again. Um,

664
00:38:48.301 --> 00:38:52.770
and we've been able to keep this benefit going and I cannot even begin to tell

665
00:38:52.771 --> 00:38:56.670
you how much this has helped his loved ones. Um,

666
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.250
it's just been such a great thing and uh,

667
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.980
his sad and tragic is it always will be that he passed away too soon.

668
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.500
Um, just all you guys stepping it up every year and seeing like,

669
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.480
just how much that has changed, uh,

670
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.620
and help the people that he was helping out when he was alive. It's just,

671
00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:20.700
I can't thank you enough. All right. Okay. Uh,

672
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.000
Friday the 13th. Bullshit. Oh, this is, um,

673
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.530
this is in regards to what I was talking about that like why is Friday the 13th

674
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.480
unlucky rather than Monday the 13th so this person comes to me with this.

675
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:39.070
It says built with regards to your podcast involving Friday the 13th.

676
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.550
The main superstition that's spread was amongst sailors during the late 17th

677
00:39:44.891 --> 00:39:49.660
century who considered setting sail on any Friday to be a bad omen.

678
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.010
And given that most people, including pirates, were god-fearing Christians.

679
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:59.310
The 13 the 13 relating to the last supper being the night before Jesus died,

680
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.640
according to historical hearsay,

681
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.090
the 13 relating to the last supper,

682
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.840
the night before Jesus died,

683
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.740
were there 13 apob there was 12 apostles plus Jesus. That was 13

684
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.380
if the 13th fell on fry. Well first of all,

685
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:23.130
I don't understand why didn't sailors wait until the 17 hundreds

686
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:24.570
<v 4>yeah,</v>

687
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.690
<v 3>they waited 1700 years, minus 32 years.</v>

688
00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:32.640
So they waited 1,600 and fucking 68 years.

689
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.050
People have been sailing for fucking ever.

690
00:40:37.051 --> 00:40:40.110
They were sailing back in Jesus's Day, right? Well,

691
00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:42.450
I guess there was no fucking social media.

692
00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:46.200
So it took a while for the story to get out. I Dunno. Anyways,

693
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.700
if the 13th fell on Friday,

694
00:40:47.701 --> 00:40:51.120
most dogs imports would be emptied out as sailors believe this to be the

695
00:40:51.121 --> 00:40:55.500
greatest ill home and there could possibly be and for reason and reason enough

696
00:40:55.501 --> 00:40:59.850
not to work on the day or get out of bed for that matter.

697
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.840
As most people of that time hung crucifixes over their bed and believed it to be

698
00:41:03.841 --> 00:41:07.710
the safest place in the house. Now I'm going to say most people didn't do that.

699
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.960
You know what I mean? I would just say like if back in the day,

700
00:41:12.961 --> 00:41:14.910
if TV news existed,

701
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.080
those were the people's houses that they would go to and they would try to scare

702
00:41:19.081 --> 00:41:23.080
the shit out of everybody about Friday the fucking 13th but I think that,

703
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.790
I think that there was a lot of fucking people back then, even back then.

704
00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:29.190
Then we're just like, dude, are you fucking you a fucking,

705
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.980
it was people back then that said, Jesus Shit never happened.

706
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.680
They would say [inaudible] it's a couple of pieces of wood.

707
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.140
It makes the shape of a cross. It's, it's,

708
00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.170
it's not like some holy fucking thing. I have to,

709
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:43.790
I'm imagine it was plenty of people.

710
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.760
Granted they probably got lit on fire if they said some shit like that.

711
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.760
I have no idea. So anyways, it sounds pretty

712
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.170
<v 4>okay.</v>

713
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.630
<v 3>Uh, basic now. But back in the day, people simply didn't know any better.</v>

714
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.410
If you fell sick around a Friday, you were unlucky around, uh,

715
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.950
around a 13th of a month. Also unlucky.

716
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:06.930
But the two together somehow was much worse. Dipshit ancestors,

717
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.350
um, oh, they just lack the information. Jesus Christ. What about us?

718
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.580
We're the smart ones ruining the fucking oceans. The Great Barrier Reef is dead.

719
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.830
You don't, they didn't fucking go.

720
00:42:19.831 --> 00:42:22.220
They would've killed it if they had the fucking opportunity. You know what?

721
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.350
They're the same dip shits we are right now. All right. Canadian, uh,

722
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.290
bus B header. Oh, you know what I, I meant to look this up.

723
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.780
So did you hear about this guy who beheaded and eight another guy and they set

724
00:42:36.781 --> 00:42:37.614
free?

725
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.320
How the fuck is he allowed free and why wasn't he executed?

726
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.860
How do they know he won't relapse into another murder slash dinner?

727
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.040
Am I crazy by saying, if you murder someone, you should be murdered yourself.

728
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.190
Um, well, yeah, if, if people didn't lie, you know,

729
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.870
if they weren't people wrongly convicted, I mean, I just, I feel like though,

730
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:05.300
if it's beyond a shadow of a fucking doubt,

731
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.313
<v 0>uh,</v>

732
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.690
<v 3>you know, if you do some of the animals kids,</v>

733
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.580
or if you eat somebody's head on a bus, I w I would have to say, you know, yeah,

734
00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:19.230

<v 3>I'm sorry guys. This is usually what I'll try to hit. Fucking pause.</v>

749
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.320
You don't have to go through the torture of this. All right, Garrett is,

750
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.210
there it is. Okay. Here we go.

751
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:24.400
Canadian man who be headed bus passenger.

752
00:44:24.401 --> 00:44:28.490
Granted total freedom. Winnipeg,

753
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:31.920
Manitoba, Aka winter pig.

754
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.530
Homer the jets.

755
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:40.100
I'm a Canadian man who was found not criminally responsible for beheading and

756
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:44.040
cannibalizing a fellow passenger on a Greyhound bus.

757
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.750
Has been granted his freedom.

758
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.470
He cut somebody's head off, fucking ate it and wasn't criminally responsible.

759
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:53.663
Well, who was

760
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.450
Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board announced Friday. It will give.

761
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.980
It has given. Will Baker formally known as Vince Lee. Well,

762
00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:08.630
thanks for fucking up his identity. Um, and a,

763
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.790
an absolute discharge. Meaning he is no longer subject to monitoring

764
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.920
man who thought roommate was a Zombie. Pleads guilty to murder. Okay.

765
00:45:18.921 --> 00:45:22.040
What the fuck is going on in Canada? That's a completely different story.

766
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.870
Here's a rabbit hole. I'll read that one. Next. Baker a diagnosed schizophrenia,

767
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.710
killed him. McLean, a young carnival worker.

768
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.330
Jesus Christ. See, this is why you never take buses, Carney workers,

769
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:38.150
schizophrenia x. It's just, you know,

770
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.460
you've taken your life in your hands.

771
00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.820
A young carnival worker who was a complete stranger to Baker in 2008 a year

772
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.720
later, he was found not criminally responsible due to mental illness. Okay?

773
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.730
McClain's mother, Carol,

774
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.380
whatever has been outspoken against granting bakers for her eyes own mother is

775
00:45:57.381 --> 00:45:57.621
saying,

776
00:45:57.621 --> 00:46:02.150
don't set this guy free saying there'll be no way to ensure he continued to take

777
00:46:02.151 --> 00:46:03.530
his meds. She declined.

778
00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:08.450
Comment in a F in a post on Facebook Friday saying, I have no words.

779
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.630
Baker was initially kept in a secure wing of a psychiatric.

780
00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:13.850
Costco was given more freedom every year.

781
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.120
He's been living on his own and Winnipeg apartment since November,

782
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.940
but we're still subject to monitoring, turning to insured.

783
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.960
He took his medication, bakers, docker, dude,

784
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.140
this is fucking insane. You let a head eat or go free.

785
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.610
Um, I dunno, Dude.

786
00:46:33.611 --> 00:46:37.640
Do you think that they should kill people who are mentally insane? I mean,

787
00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:39.890
what are you going to do? You're going to stick them in a room and beat them.

788
00:46:39.891 --> 00:46:42.460
For instance, Flintstone vitamins for a still life, right?

789
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:46.040
Madam thought roommate was a Zombie pleads guilty of murder.

790
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.970
These are all just mentally ill people here, man.

791
00:46:49.971 --> 00:46:54.971
A 38 year old man who said he beat his roommate to death because he thought she

792
00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:58.880
was a Zombie, pleaded no contest. The secondary murder.

793
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.330
Now I'm sitting there wondering,

794
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.070
maybe he just beat her to death and now he's just trying to act like he's

795
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:09.150
fucking insane. Um, the guy entered the plea Friday,

796
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.090
the strangling and beating death of 35 year old Jennifer Lopez.

797
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:19.620
Not the same. I want to obviously, uh,

798
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.220
the Kansas City Star reported Wallace told police he had fallen asleep after

799
00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:25.440
taking a methamphetamine court.

800
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:29.350
Documents said he began beating Lopez when she woke up because he thought she

801
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:34.090
was a Zombie. He told police he kept being Lopez until something made him stop.

802
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.850
Wow. This is not a funny podcast anymore. Now is it? Um,

803
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:40.343
<v 0>yes.</v>

804
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.020
<v 3>Uh, should you be murdered if you murder somebody? Uh,</v>

805
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:46.700
I think without a fucking doubt, if they know you did it.

806
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.023
<v 0>Um,</v>

807
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.120
<v 3>and uh, yeah. Yeah.</v>

808
00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:58.680
I don't know. I mean I saw, you know,

809
00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.860
I saw it so I don't want to say what this fucking person didn't do a kid,

810
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.290
but the kid died and like I was just like,

811
00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:05.910
why is that person still walking on the earth?

812
00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:08.640
There's definitely times where I feel that and I don't think that that makes us

813
00:48:08.641 --> 00:48:09.570
as bad as they are.

814
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.823
<v 0>Um,</v>

815
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.710
<v 3>but prison is a big business, so you know, they want that fucking guy in a cell.</v>

816
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:20.960
All right. Ministry of truth. Hey there Billy. Hey there.

817
00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.960
Bill you of rights. I'm sorry guys. I'm so fucking jet lag too.

818
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:29.830
This podcast is really just fucking lagging here. Dragging I should say.

819
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.420
Lots of people are comparing Trump to Hitler. Uh, but back in December,

820
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:38.530
Obama tried to quietly pass a bill that would allow the government. Yeah,

821
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:42.580
I saw this have jurisdiction over news and outgoing information on all channels.

822
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:45.370
I. E. TV, Internet, radio. That includes you.

823
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.680
You can read the fine print in the article below.

824
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:52.060
Also fuck all the people listening who haven't read the legislation but are

825
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.560
already up in arms because it goes against who they cheer for. Amen to that.

826
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.560
Amen to that. Everybody, like, like last night,

827
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:01.660
all these fucking guys at this fucking awards show,

828
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.340
everybody trashing and Donald Trump,

829
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.350
nobody brings up the fact that Obama basically signed something that is going to

830
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.130
implement and in front of the level of fucking censorship like there,

831
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:16.030
they're basically going to decide what is real news and what is fake news.

832
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.840
I mean, I'd like to think, because I openly admit that I don't read

833
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.200
and the shit that I say is just fucking absurd that I would be,

834
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:29.950
you know, exempt. But who knows.

835
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.630
But like people with blue ties do this shit all the fucking time. And that's,

836
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.670
that's what kills me about people who wear red ties and watch Fox News and the

837
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:43.950
Hollywood people. Like they just cannot see the bullshit all out there.

838
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.960
The only six, it's like,

839
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:48.680
it's like listen to what a fanatic red sox and Yankee Fan,

840
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.110
you know what I mean? You know,

841
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.070
give each other's shit for buying titles and fucking abusing steroids.

842
00:49:55.071 --> 00:49:57.740
And it's like, no, we, we both did it. We both did it.

843
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.920
We should hang our heads in shame collectively. Um,

844
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.930
all right. Let me see if I can find this. This are, I,

845
00:50:06.931 --> 00:50:10.310
I don't really even want to fucking read this because this is just so fucking,

846
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.713
uh, let's see.

847
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

848
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.140
<v 3>Today I sign into law S. Dot. Two nine four three,</v>

849
00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:24.141
the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2017 this act

850
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:29.750
authorizes fiscal year 2070 appropriations principally for the Department of

851
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.900
Defense and the Department of energy national security programs provides vital

852
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:36.440
benefits for military personnel families. Okay. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

853
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:40.280
blah, blah. And where do we get to the,

854
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.000
<v 4>okay,</v>

855
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.740
<v 3>yeah. Dude, I can't read all of this.</v>

856
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.500
I can't read all of this on a fucking,

857
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.090
this will take me fucking three hours to read out to this. What's,

858
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.920
this would have to be a part of a, a mini series for me to read all of this.

859
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.480
Okay. A, the, here's some bull in bold.

860
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:03.830
The first priority is developing a whole of government strategy for countering

861
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:08.831
the foreign propaganda in disinformation being wage waged against us and our

862
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:13.940
allies by our enemies. Now that reads great, but it's basically,

863
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.360
you know, they want, yeah. Listened to our propaganda,

864
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.240
not their fucking propaganda. You know,

865
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:23.840
our version of what's going on is right and their version is wrong.

866
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.670
We're all fallible. We're all fucking human beings, but we don't make mistakes.

867
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:32.270
They do. So, I dunno, it just gets back to all of that shit. And you know what,

868
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:33.350
sir? You're never going to solve.

869
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:35.750
And even everybody's sin starts fucking screaming at each other.

870
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:37.250
And if you ever bring up something like that,

871
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:40.280
people call you a socialist and tell you to get the fuck out of the country.

872
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:40.941
If you,

873
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:45.350
if you would ever even remotely suggest that this government would ever fucking

874
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:50.390
lie, they all lie to their fucking people. Uh Oh God, they'll shut up. Okay,

875
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.970
dear Billy beer thighs. Um,

876
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.690
forgive my poor English. Well,

877
00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.140
the fact that you come on Billy beer thighs in a fucking second language is

878
00:52:00.141 --> 00:52:03.870
pretty amazing. So I, yeah, I think you're in, which she's fucking great. Um,

879
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.400
I am a native Berliner but I have family across Germany.

880
00:52:08.401 --> 00:52:13.080
One of my female cousins was harassed on the way to work by some people who are

881
00:52:13.081 --> 00:52:13.914
different.

882
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.230
I didn't want to s I do not want to say just a different race or religion,

883
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.810
but also a different way of thinking.

884
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:27.270
They are not native to Germany and are not acclimating well to western life.

885
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.900
I am not a racist and I find the issues very sensitive,

886
00:52:30.901 --> 00:52:35.901
but I believe that reality has to play a part in one subjective view.

887
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:41.250
I'm not against refugees or anyone displaced because of terrible political and

888
00:52:41.251 --> 00:52:45.450
military situations. But I also have a new opinion because of my cousin.

889
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.590
She is okay,

890
00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:51.591
but it had 19 stitches in the back of her neck and head from a bottle thrown at

891
00:52:52.261 --> 00:52:54.720
her because she was a woman walking alone at night.

892
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:58.380
This is not the first time this has happened in our town.

893
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.093
<v 0>Um,</v>

894
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.260
<v 3>that was good enough to show good graces to refugees. Uh,</v>

895
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.770
if countries are going to let people in,

896
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:11.520
they have to at least be okay with women having certain rights.

897
00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:16.500
Should they not forget about religion or relace that's just good and bad.

898
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:16.770
Um,

899
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.420
I think am I a bad person from becoming a more cautious person when it comes to

900
00:53:21.421 --> 00:53:26.100
refugees? Thank you. And cheers on your new child. Uh, no, not at all.

901
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.430
<v 1>I mean, a lot of that and also people's prejudice because you're German,</v>

902
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.510
they're gonna fucking think a certain way. But like, you know,

903
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.850
if one of the elements that comes into play is that from wherever these other

904
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:39.870
people are from,

905
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.430
that a woman walking alone at night is suggesting that she's fucking, I dunno,

906
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:49.170
I dunno what loose or having sex or whatever the fuck it is that's gonna make

907
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.290
them throw a goddamn bottle. Like how do you not address that?

908
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:58.100
Um, and also to me,

909
00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.560
it's like what kind of a fucking person, you know,

910
00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:05.950
when I go to another country, like whatever I see, I just go, oh,

911
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:10.330
I guess that's how they do it over here. I don't think like, you know, well,

912
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.990
I'm from someplace else. And this is the way we do it.

913
00:54:13.991 --> 00:54:17.530
So I'm gonna act like we're still in my country. I think that's ignorant, but,

914
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.060
um, never underestimate the power of religion. You know,

915
00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:26.560
when people really get into it when they really fucking get into it.

916
00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:28.773
Um,

917
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.550
<v 4>okay.</v>

918
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:30.690
<v 1>I don't, you know, there's,</v>

919
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:34.290
there's something where your brain goes on like autopilot and you just let

920
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.570
religion make decisions for you.

921
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:40.710
And rational thought kind of goes out the fucking window and you just start

922
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.990
breaking one commandment after another. Uh,

923
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.380
like you tell me one religion out there,

924
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:51.060
if you could find it in whatever book it is that you read that say it's,

925
00:54:51.061 --> 00:54:55.290
that says it's fucking okay to throw a fucking bottle at a woman

926
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:00.150
walking alone at night. I mean, it shouldn't you, I mean, if you think it's,

927
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:05.970
you should've walked her home if you were concerned about like, I don't know.

928
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:10.770
I don't understand. Like, um, but yeah, one of the things,

929
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:16.230
um, I think refugees should, like, if I fuck I say this,

930
00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:20.490
this country goes to complete shit and there's a big war and all of a sudden

931
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:25.440
they're hunting down fucking bald red heads and I need to seek political asylum

932
00:55:25.441 --> 00:55:28.170
or some shit in another country. When I go there,

933
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.800
the first thing I'm going to do is try to learn the fucking language and then

934
00:55:31.801 --> 00:55:34.920
I'm going to try to figure out, okay,

935
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.910
how do they do shit over here? You know what I mean?

936
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:42.450
So I don't fucking offend anybody. And so I don't get the shit kicked out of me.

937
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:47.160
But I would say the type of people that throw a bottle like that,

938
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.330
um, you know,

939
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.380
they're also the kind of people that if they were in a higher up in a corporate

940
00:55:54.381 --> 00:55:55.910
thing that they would be a

941
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.530
pilfering the coffers as they say or whatever.

942
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:03.920
Like there's just certain people out there that just, they're not good people.

943
00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:07.640
There's certain people that are just not smart people. Um,

944
00:56:07.641 --> 00:56:12.230
that's one of the fucking problems with human beings is just a lot of mouth

945
00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:16.880
breathing morons. And, uh, when you accept a bunch of refugees,

946
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:18.140
you know,

947
00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.750
you're going to get some fucking super smart people all the way down to mouth

948
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.860
breathing morons. Um, I don't think you're,

949
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:27.694
you know,

950
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:31.150
why wouldn't you be more cautious when it came to refugees if something like

951
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:34.570
that happen? I mean, now having said that, within your own country,

952
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:36.850
you also have neo Nazis.

953
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:38.180
<v 4>Okay.</v>

954
00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.890
<v 1>You know what I mean? So, you know,</v>

955
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.590
a few suggesting getting rid of all refugees,

956
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.700
then you should also do something about Neo Nazi. So, um,

957
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:50.630
the hard fucking thing when people go to a new country is they don't look like

958
00:56:50.631 --> 00:56:51.650
the people that are there.

959
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:55.580
So they stick out like a fucking sore thumb and people stop looking at them as

960
00:56:55.581 --> 00:56:58.610
human beings. They just look at them as just one giant group.

961
00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.270
Whereas if you look at a fucking neo Nazi, he's still a fucking white dude.

962
00:57:02.271 --> 00:57:06.110
I'm assuming you're white German, right? And you're like, yeah, that guy,

963
00:57:06.111 --> 00:57:08.270
he's a fucking moron. You know what I mean?

964
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.520
You just looking at him like he joined a stupid club,

965
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:15.140
despite the fact that those people can do some really horrific shit too. So, um,

966
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.123
but I don't think,

967
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.160
<v 4>okay,</v>

968
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.510
<v 1>you know, you're a bad person for becoming more cautious. Um,</v>

969
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.260
but I would also remain open minded that there's going to be some really great

970
00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:28.650
people that were lucky enough to get out of those bad situations.

971
00:57:28.651 --> 00:57:31.770
And that's the hard part. The easy thing is to just say,

972
00:57:31.771 --> 00:57:36.660
fuck all of these people. And uh, you know, that's, that's the basic,

973
00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:41.370
let's sit down and eat some fritos and cake. Um, or you can actually

974
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.340
do the crunches

975
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:50.520
<v 3>in your cardio and actually try to look at people as individuals.</v>

976
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:55.230
Now having said that, when the sun goes down at night, all bets are off.

977
00:57:55.290 --> 00:58:00.120
You have to look at people, you know, the most cautiously, eh,

978
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:02.340
as cautiously as you possibly can,

979
00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.090
because I guarantee you that even if they had a fucking rule about that during

980
00:58:06.091 --> 00:58:08.130
the day, if there was a bunch of people walking around,

981
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.700
but the chances of them doing that during the day would have been much less. So,

982
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:12.170
um,

983
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:17.040
I'm sorry that happened to 'em you one of your cousins.

984
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:20.130
Uh, I hope it doesn't turn you into a hateful person.

985
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.130
You seem like you're trying to be measured. I Dunno,

986
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.400
but it would suck if you became another hateful person because uh,

987
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.180
it's just going to add fueled all of this shit. Blue Tie, red tie. Shit.

988
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:35.070
All right, dear Billy Butkus on Valentine's Day,

989
00:58:35.071 --> 00:58:39.210
my ex who I love, people who know how to use whom,

990
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.190
you know, who and whom. I'd looked up to definition fucking a hundred times.

991
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:46.140
I believe I've read it on this podcast.

992
00:58:46.141 --> 00:58:49.890
I still for the life of me cannot figure it out. I'm on Valentine's Day.

993
00:58:49.891 --> 00:58:54.660
My ex who I had been dating for three years,

994
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:59.661
came to my job at a bar with a new much younger date,

995
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.560
sat with her for hours and proceeded to get a cab home with her.

996
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:08.520
My coworkers obviously told me and I was devastated.

997
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.230
Well that's why he did it.

998
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.830
We've been broken up for two and a half months and it was a really tough

999
00:59:13.831 --> 00:59:15.660
breakup. I know I deserve better,

1000
00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.320
but I feel like he's driving me out of a small town that I generally love.

1001
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:23.930
This isn't the first time he's a public show with a woman with women.

1002
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.191
Um,

1003
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:29.000
at this point I just want them want to move and start over what it should take.

1004
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:32.210
Uh, my take is that you, uh,

1005
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:36.600
you're a lucky woman that you, you,

1006
00:59:36.601 --> 00:59:41.390
you didn't hit your wagon to someone that's dead fucking petty. Um,

1007
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.690
then yeah, I don't, I, yeah, I like that. Like that's,

1008
00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:48.260
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1009
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.240
<v 3>I just liked the way you described it.</v>

1010
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:53.600
I look at that guy as though he's pathetic and I feel like,

1011
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.650
and I feel bad for the woman that he brought there because I feel like he was

1012
00:59:57.651 --> 00:59:59.960
barely listening to her in pretending to be smiling,

1013
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:04.070
having a good time as he was trying to look around to see if he could catch you.

1014
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.700
I mean, he basically went out of his way to hurt you when obviously when you're,

1015
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.310
you, you're going to break up with somebody.

1016
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:11.720
There's going to be that awful pain.

1017
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.900
Cause usually somebody wants it and the other person doesn't.

1018
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.200
So it's bad enough that that went down. Now if you dumped him.

1019
01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:23.320
But I feel like if you dumped him, you wouldn't be that upset about it. Um,

1020
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.990
and you did say it was really tough. So, uh,

1021
01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.010
what I would say is have you do yourself a Salvatore glass of fucking wine,

1022
01:00:30.011 --> 01:00:32.890
whatever your poison is that, um,

1023
01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:37.930
you didn't marry this count. And, uh,

1024
01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.030
I dunno, I think at some point, I mean if you really love, be ashamed, if,

1025
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.400
if,

1026
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.820
if you really loved living where you were at that you would move just because

1027
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.990
some shallow con is bringing some woman. I mean,

1028
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:57.290
he obviously does not give a fuck about that one. Cause I have to tell you this,

1029
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:02.480
if that guy in two and a half months found the one and found true love,

1030
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:07.820
Liz, petty shit with you would not even be an issue. So

1031
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.650
maybe a new way of looking at it is feeling bad for the woman that he's with.

1032
01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:18.720
Um, because he's wasting her time. And I mean,

1033
01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:20.490
I can guaran fucking tee you.

1034
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:25.830
She has no idea who you are. And if she does,

1035
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.890
then the two fucking psychos that deserve each other,

1036
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.880
that should both be sterilized because they're going to make an evil baby.

1037
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.420
So there you go. That's what you walked away from. Um,

1038
01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.330
but as far as like, you know,

1039
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.810
at this point you want to move and start over and all depends on what you got

1040
01:01:42.811 --> 01:01:47.550
going on in your town. That's a pretty a big move. Uh,

1041
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.510
you know, let a few days go by, see if you feel that again and just,

1042
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:51.961
I don't know,

1043
01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:55.240
just really focused on the type of person that would do something like that to,

1044
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.380
to really just go out of your way to hurt somebody and know,

1045
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.240
say I've heard a bunch of people in my life but to like go out of your fucking

1046
01:02:00.241 --> 01:02:03.540
way. Like that's like the deaths.

1047
01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:07.740
Like the difference between first degree in second degree continuous, there

1048
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.940
was, you know, second degree. It's just spontaneously happens. You know,

1049
01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:15.270
you guys got all this history and you just said something fucking horrible or

1050
01:02:15.271 --> 01:02:17.190
starts chatting up some shit there at the bar,

1051
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.670
but to fucking sit there and like methodically plan it out like that,

1052
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:24.510
that guy's a fucking psycho and congratulations to you,

1053
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:27.600
the east on your fucking life anymore. Um,

1054
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.110
yeah. And don't fuck with this food. That's a petty thing too. That's bad con.

1055
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.510
Fuck all that. All right, that's the podcast for this week.

1058

1064
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:03.450
I'll do a video of something at the Patrice O'Neil, um, comedy benefit, um,
