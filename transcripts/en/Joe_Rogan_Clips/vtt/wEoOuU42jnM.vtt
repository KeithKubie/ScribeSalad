00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.560
he knows people that teach Jujitsu and they've taught them a couple of things.

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.490
We're at the rainbow one night where we were holding court,

24
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.550
I'm just smoking like it's Amsterdam down there.

25
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
And we were having a conversation and he kept hearing some dude across cross a

26
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:46.280
couple of tables over,
kept saying Everlast this Everlast that and he,

27
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.100
he,
your money saved my day and one more time.

28
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.020
And he goes,
Everlast

29
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.540
and he went back to talking to his people because he did the Everlast was good.

30
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.900
Come up.
And Dude that the d Everlast went and walked over to this table,

31
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.830
look to his face,
turned them around real quick and start choking him.

32
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.160
Say My name again.
