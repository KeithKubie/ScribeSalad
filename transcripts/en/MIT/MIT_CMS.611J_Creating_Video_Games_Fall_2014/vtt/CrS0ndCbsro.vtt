SARA VERRILLI: So
the course evolution

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.020
has actually been
more a refinement

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.720
than any really big evolution.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.670
We've always had the
four project structure.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.760
We have done some juggling
of the amount of time

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.450
allotted to each project,
and what we're asking

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.230
for the goals for each project.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960
The first year we
ran the course we

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.550
were kind of asking for
a full game prototype

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.670
from each of the iterations.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.550
And we were asking
them to do everything

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.070
for every project, which was
a little much to ask them,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920
although they did it.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.540
I mean, they did it.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.160
We've been refining
each of the projects

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.057
as it goes to try to emphasize
a particular thing we're

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.390
trying to teach, especially
in the first three projects.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.410
So the first project
is prototyping,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.900
and the second project
is project management,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.520
and the third project
is now user interface

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180
and interactions,
feedback especially.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.220
And then the fourth project
remains tie it all together

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.330
into one overall synthesis.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.240
Also, I think that our
use of guest lecturers

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210
has gotten better
over the years.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.170
We've been able to
reach out to more people

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.630
and we've realized
more and more the value

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.790
that they bring into the
course, having people

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.875
to come in and talk, often
agreeing with what we've said,

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.360
but giving a
different perspective

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.459
and rooting it back
into the game industry.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.000
The students really like to hear
that this is actually what's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.980
going on in the game industry.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.440
They're not just being taught
this stuff in a course.

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:39.670
PHILIP TAN: When we first
started teaching this class

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.780
we were primarily
looking at the skills

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260
that MIT students
had and didn't have

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.560
when they came and joined our
lab as undergraduate research

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.620
assistants.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.850
And we found that there was
a certain skill gap of things

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.530
that we had to teach every
single new student who came.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.210
Even though they may have
been very skilled programmers,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.980
they didn't understand what
it was like to work in a team.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.020
And so a lot of the genesis
of this particular course

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.990
comes from just us trying to
increase that pool of students

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.949
that we could hire as
undergraduate researchers.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.990
And of course, in the
process of teaching a class

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200
about making video games,
a lot of the students

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.030
taking the class
were also interested

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.060
in working professionally
in the game industry.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.300
And so we expanded the
content on the skills

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.550
that you're going to
need outside of MIT.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.280
But we've always been
very, very careful

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.990
to make sure that a student
who comes out of that class

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.850
is in good shape to be able to
get a research internship here

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.720
in our lab.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.680
RICHARD EBERHARDT: So this
semester, product three

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920
is different than last year.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.470
Last year the focus was
on the aesthetics, so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.160
think about how art and sound
and visual combine to make it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.730
an aesthetic experience.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.310
That's not as important this
year for our final project.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.811
So we changed it
to something that's

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:02.351
actually going to help them with
their final project a little

00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.050
better.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.800
So this case it's
user interface.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.080
We're asking them to make
these decision making

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.260
strategy-like games.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.540
There's going to be a lot
of elements on the screen

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.770
that a player is going to
have to understand immediately

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.960
what they do and how they
interact with each other.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.959
So focusing on that user
interface and that user

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.030
experience is important
for us, and in

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.640
particular, feedback systems.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.730
So because our theme is
meaningful decision making,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.230
if I'm making a
decision, part of it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.060
is I should know what the
decision was that I just made

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.850
and how it affected
the rest of the world

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.070
and how it affected my own play.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.742
So that kind of reinforcement,
that kind of feedback loop

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:40.950
is going to be very important
for that third project.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.824
PHILIP TAN: We've also
brought back something

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:45.740
that we temporarily
departed from,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.430
and that's the idea of having
a client, a real client who

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.070
has a need for the games
that need to be made.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.500
In reality, if you go out and
work in the game industry,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.750
you're not making games for
yourself most of the time,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.540
you're making games
for someone else.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.998
So in this case, we're going
to be working with the Climate

00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:03.900
Center and the
Humanitarian Response Lab

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.860
here at MIT to talk about
issues of climate change,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.441
and more importantly about
preparing for disasters.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.660
We feel this kind
of topical relevance

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.240
will make this class
additionally more interesting

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.160
for certain students
who aren't just

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.235
enamored with the technical
challenges of making a game.

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.330
But I think this might
also be the first time

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.240
that we specifically
had the client give us

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.631
a design theme as opposed to
a technology to work with.

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:39.630
RICHARD EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.980
PHILIP TAN: So it's a
departure, but in many ways

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.910
it's taking what we've
learned from the previous two

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.390
iterations of this class
when we didn't have a client

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.690
or when we had students working
on a design theme rather

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.280
than a technology and putting
it together this year.
