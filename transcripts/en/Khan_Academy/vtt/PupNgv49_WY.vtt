00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
 

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.585
Welcome to this presentation
on logarithm properties.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.970
Now this is going to be a
very hands-on presentation.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.580
If you don't believe that one
of these properties are true

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.840
and you want them proved, I've
made three or four videos

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.930
that actually prove
these properties.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.000
But what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.620
you the properties.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.900
And then show you how
they can be used.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.520
It's going to be
little more hands-on.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.770
So let's just do a little
bit of a review of just

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.000
what a logarithm is.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.540
So if I say that a-- Oh
that's not the right.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.930
Let's see.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.950
I want to change--
There you go.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.260
Let's say I say that
a-- Let me start over.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.710
a to the b is equal to c.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.660
So if we-- a to the b
power is equal to c.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.420
So another way to write this
exact same relationship instead

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.970
of writing the exponent, is
to write it as a logarithm.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.550
So we can say that the
logarithm base a of

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.040
c is equal to b.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.000
So these are essentially
saying the same thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.750
They just have different
kind of results.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710
In one, you know a and b and
you're kind of getting c.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.020
That's what exponentiation
does for you.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.250
And the second one, you know
a and you know that when

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340
you raise it to some
power you get c.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040
And then you figure
out what b is.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.540
So they're the exact same
relationship, just stated

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.090
in a different way.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.910
Now I will introduce you
to some interesting

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.970
logarithm properties.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.480
And they actually just fall
out of this relationship and

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.740
the regular exponent rules.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.865
So the first is that the
logarithm-- Let me do

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:39.350
a more cheerful color.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.260
The logarithm, let's say, of
any base-- So let's just call

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.190
the base-- Let's
say b for base.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:57.820
Logarithm base b of a plus
logarithm base b of c-- and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.770
this only works if we
have the same bases.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.800
So that's important
to remember.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:12.790
That equals the logarithm
of base b of a times c.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.660
Now what does this mean
and how can we use it?

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.320
Or let's just even try it
out with some, well I

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.630
don't know, examples.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.860
So this is saying that-- I'll
switch to another color.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.390
Let's make mauve my--
Mauve-- I don't know.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.730
I never know how to
say that properly.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.470
Let's make that my
example color.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:40.920
So let's say logarithm of base
2 of-- I don't know --of 8

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.570
plus logarithm base 2 of-- I
don't know let's say --32.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.210
 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.410
So, in theory, this should
equal, if we believe this

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.500
property, this should equal
logarithm base 2 of what?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.910
Well we say 8 times 32.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:17.660
So 8 times 32 is
240 plus 16, 256.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.510
Well let's see if that's true.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.740
Just trying out this number and
this is really isn't a proof.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.860
But it'll give you a little bit
of an intuition, I think, for

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.990
what's going on around you.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.340
So log-- So this is-- We
just used our property.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.480
This little property that
I presented to you.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.890
And let's just see
if it works out.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860
So log base 2 of 8.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.520
2 to what power is equal to 8?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.960
Well 2 to the third power
is equal to 8, right?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.310
So this term right here,
that equals 3, right?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.810
Log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.400
2 to what power is equal to 32?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.790
Let's see.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.580
2 to the fourth power is 16.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.300
2 to the fifth power is 32.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.410
So this right here is 2 to
the-- This is 5, right?

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.750
And 2 to the what power
is equal to 256?

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.890
Well if you're a computer
science major, you'll

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.210
know that immediately.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.470
That a byte can have
256 values in it.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.440
So it's 2 to the eighth power.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.520
But if you don't know that, you
could multiply it out yourself.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.710
But this is 8.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.495
And I'm not doing it just
because I knew that 3

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:19.470
plus 5 is equal to 8.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.230
I'm doing this independently.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.300
So this is equal to 8.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.530
But it does turn out that
3 plus 5 is equal to 8.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.170
This may seem like magic to
you or it may seem obvious.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.560
And for those of you who it
might seem a little obvious,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.320
you're probably thinking, well
2 to the third times 2 to the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.510
fifth is equal to 2 to
the 3 plus 5, right?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.800
This is just an exponent rule.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.670
What do they call this?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.750
The additive exponent
prop-- I don't know.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.220
I don't know the
names of things.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.920
And that equals 2 to
8, 2 to the eighth.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.160
And that's exactly what
we did here, right?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.830
On this side, we had 2
the third times 2 to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.000
the fifth, essentially.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.780
And on this side, you have
them added to each other.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.850
And what makes the logarithms
interesting is and why-- It's

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.970
a little confusing at first.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.620
And you can watch the proofs
if you really want kind of

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.450
a rigorous-- my proofs
aren't rigorous.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.940
But if you want kind of
a better explanation

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.360
of how this works.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.480
But this should hopefully give
you an tuition for why this

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.330
property holds, right?

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
Because when you multiply
two numbers of the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.270
same base, right?

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.720
Two exponential expressions
of the same base, you

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.560
can add their exponents.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.050
Similarly, when you have the
log of two numbers multiplied

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.710
by each other, that's
equivalent to the log of each

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.530
of the numbers added
to each other.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.810
This is the same property.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.940
If you don't believe me,
watch the proof videos.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.380
So let's do a-- Let me show
you another log property.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.230
It's pretty much the same one.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.400
I almost view them the same.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:10.450
So this is log base b of
a minus log base b of c

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.040
is equal to log base b
of-- well I ran out.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.290
I'm running out of space
--a divided by c.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.540
That says a divided by c.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.240
And we can, once again, try
it out with some numbers.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.620
I use 2 a lot just because
2 is an easy number to

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.790
figure out the powers.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.750
But let's use a
different number.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:41.200
Let's say log base 3 of-- I
don't know --log base 3 of--

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.820
well you know, let's make it
interesting --log base 3 of

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:56.930
1/9 minus log base 3 of 81.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.500
So this property tells us--
This is the same thing as--

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.180
Well I'm ending up
with a big number.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:12.990
Log base 3 of 1/9
divided by 81.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.890
So that's the same thing
as 1/9 times 1/81.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.710
I used two large numbers
for my example, but

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.320
we'll move forward.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.750
So let's see.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.700
9 times 8 is 720, right?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.190
9 times-- Right.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.580
9 times 8 is 720.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.036
So this is 1/729.

00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:37.860
So this is log base
3 over 1/729.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.160
So what-- What does-- 3 to
what power is equal to 1/9?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.340
Well 3 squared is
equal to 9, right?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.070
 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.250
So 3-- So we know that if 3
squared is equal to 9, then we

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.950
know that 3 to the negative
2 is equal to 1/9, right?

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.190
The negative just inverts it.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.160
So this is equal to
negative 2, right?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.120
And then minus-- 3 to
what power is equal 81?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.870
3 to the third power is 27.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.390
So 3 to the fourth power.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.870
So we have minus 2 minus 4 is
equal to-- Well, we could

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.710
do it a couple of ways.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.530
Minus 2 minus 4 is
equal to minus 6.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.280
And now we just have to confirm
that 3 to the minus sixth

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.080
power is equal to 1/729.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.890
So that's my question.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:34.430
Is 3 to the minus sixth power,
is that equal to 7-- 1/729?

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.900
Well that's the same thing as
saying 3 to sixth power is

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.110
equal to 729, because that's
all the negative exponent

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.760
does is inverts it.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.590
Let's see.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.880
We could multiply that out,
but that should be the case.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.480
Because, well, we
could look here.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.320
But let's see.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.630
3 to the third power-- This
would be 3 to the third power

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.450
times 3 to the third power
is equal to 27 times 27.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.540
That looks pretty close.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.900
You can confirm it with
a calculator if you

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.340
don't believe me.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.940
Anyway, that's all the time
I have in this video.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.500
In the next video, I'll
introduce you to the last

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.680
two logarithm properties.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.490
And, if we have time, maybe
I'll do examples with

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.440
the leftover time.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.120
I'll see you soon.
