00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.870
 Developer doesn't just mean encoding. 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.480
 It's about finding out and creating new things. 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.589
 You must put something of yourself, 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.640
 make it personal, and I think it's an art form. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.250
 I'm Vincento Colucci; I am twenty-five years old; 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.630
 and I am a developer here in Manfredonia, Italy. 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.270
 Being a developer gives you the same power 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.829
 as an inventor, and my dad always taught me 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.710
 If you need something, you can build it. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 That's what I'm trying to do as a developer, but with other tools. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.410
 For the first time I realized that developing for Android can be a real job 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.240
 when I made my first program, Scratch Card. 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 A few days later I looked at my AdMob console and saw my first five dollars. 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.880
 It was incredible. It felt like I would be rich! 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 With the money I made, I could pay for my studies 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.869
 And that was a great goal for me. 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.820
 Then I created Smart Launcher which was a new UI for Android devices. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 It has a lot of cleanliness 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.229
 home screen to draw your attention to the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.820
 main features of your phone. And the other programs 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.400
 is automatically ranked in categories. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.220
 Android is the only platform that could work for me, because 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 Android is the only platform you can really do just what you want. 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970
 I can work in another city; I can work on a cruise ship, 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.659
 but I decided to stay here in manfredonia, because here 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.790
 do I have my friends; 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.690
 I have my family; I have my girlfriend. I can work here - me 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.299
 just need a laptop and internet connection. 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.130
 When I published, my brother Daniele said 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 It's going to be your biggest failure. It's funny because if you are the one now 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.739
 see figure, 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.269
 I think no one will say it. I have more than that now 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.019
 15 million downloads for the free version 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.540
 and 200,000 for the professional version. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
 My program is downloaded all over the world. It's really popular. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370
 It's very popular in India, America, and Japan. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.519
 I think Smart Launcher is actually the biggest export product of Manfredonia 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.230
 To grow further is not something I expected. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.250
 I work closely with other people and it is very exciting, because now I can think of other products. 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.590
 I think the future will be very exciting. 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.590
 For me, success means doing what you want with your life. 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.360
 To me it is to live in my city with my parents, 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.900
 with my girlfriend, and to be happy. 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.890
 And I can do this by being a developer.
