00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.940
Being someone who pleases people sounds, on
the face of it, like a very good idea. But

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.740
it is a pattern of behaviour riddled with
problems, as much for the perpetrator as for

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.140
their audience; the people-pleaser is someone
(who might at times be oneself) who feels

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.270
they have no option but to mould themselves
to the expectations of others, and yet, harbours

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.600
all manner of secret and at points dangerous
reservations and resentments. They act like

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.600
the perfect lover when their real feelings
are far darker; they give their assent to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.140
plans they hate; and they confuse everyone
around them by failing to express, in due

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.539
time, with the requisite courage, their authentic
needs and ambitions. Putting it bluntly we

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.170
could say that the people pleaser is a liar.
It sounds brutal, but the people-pleaser is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.500
lying for poignant reasons: not in order to
gain advantage, but because they are terrified

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.240
of the displeasure of others. To understand
– and potentially sympathise with – the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.110
people-pleaser we need to look at their past
which almost invariably involves an early

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.710
experience of being around people – usually
a mother or a father – who seemed to be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.380
radically and terrifyingly incapable of accepting
and forgiving certain necessary but perhaps

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.079
tricky facts about their child. Perhaps our
father flew into volcanic rage at any sign

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.750
of disagreement. To present an opposing political
idea, to suggest we wanted something different

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.590
to eat, to be frank about our tiredness or
anxiety, could threaten us with annihilation.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.600
To survive, we needed to be acutely responsive
to what others expected us to do and say.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.409
The very question of what we might really
want became secondary to an infinitely more

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.490
important priority: manically second-guessing
the desires of those on whom, at that time,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.250
our lives depended. We didn’t always lie
out of fear; it was also often out of love

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.010
for someone we were profoundly attached to
but who was vulnerable in some way. We lied

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.680
out of a longing not to set off another marital
row, a desire to keep a depressive parent

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.290
in a good mood and to avoid adding a further
burden to what seemed like an already very

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.090
difficult or sad life. Who were we to make
things even more complicated for a fragile

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.060
person we cared for? However understandable
the origins of our behaviour, in the more

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.760
reflexive moments of adulthood, we might find
three paths out from these difficult patterns

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.890
of people-pleasing. The first relies on reminding
ourselves that our colleagues, partners and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.930
friends are almost certainly very different
from the people around whom our anxieties

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.769
evolved in childhood. Most humans can cope
quite well with a bit of contradiction, a

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.349
dose of unwelcome information or an occasional
rejection, delivered with requisite politeness.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.980
The other is not going to explode or dissolve.
We learned a very particular habit of relating

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.690
to the world around a group of people who
were not representative of humanity as a whole.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.070
Secondly, we need to acknowledge the inadvertently
harmful side-effects of our behaviour. We

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.010
may genuinely have good intentions, but we
are endangering everyone by not speaking more

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.959
frankly. At work, we aren’t doing anyone
a service by withholding our doubts and reservations.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.180
And in love, there is no kindness in staying
in a relationship simply because it seems

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.129
the other might not survive without us. They
will, but we will have wasted a lot of their

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:56.269
time through our sentimentality. Finally,
we can acquire the confidence to be artful

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.370
about the difficult messages we have to impart.
As a child we couldn’t nuance the messages

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.420
we wanted to send out. We didn’t know how
to craft our raw pain and needs into convincing

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.860
explanations. Now, it is open to us to be
firm in our own views – but extremely genial

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.250
as well. We can say ‘no’ while indicating
that we feel a lot of goodwill; we can say

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.660
someone is wrong without implying that they
are an idiot. We can leave someone, while

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.280
ensuring they realise how much a relationship
meant to us. We can – in other words – be

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.800
pleasant without being people-pleasers.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.460
