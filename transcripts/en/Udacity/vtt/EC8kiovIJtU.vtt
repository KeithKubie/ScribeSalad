00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When travelling in a city, it can often be faster to use a bicycle than to take a bus.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One reason for this is that bikes are able to accelerate faster than buses can.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, let's say that a bike and a bus both stopped at a red light,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
take off at the exact same time when the light turns green.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The bike can accelerate at 1.2 m/s² but only to a top speed of 12 m/s.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The bus on the other hand can accelerate at 0.8 m/s² to a top speed of 20 m/s.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, since the bike has a higher initial acceleration,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it will be in front of the bus for some time.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want to know how much time elapses before the bus catches up with the biker.
