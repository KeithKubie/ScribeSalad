“This episode of DNews is brought to you
by the Toyota Prius. Let’s lead the way.”

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.280
Teenagers don’t get enough sleep, because
they’re up late making bad decisions, right?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.849
But what if it’s the other way around? But
could their lack of sleep lead to partying?

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.790
Hey everyone, julia here for DNews

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.220
Teenagers don’t get enough sleep, some studies
say almost half of American teenagers don’t

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.790
get enough sleep. But maybe that’s because
they’re forced into a schedule counter to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.710
their biological clocks. Their internal clocks
tick a little later than full grown adults.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.160
They sleep longer and stay awake later. Yet
thanks to early start times for high schools,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.910
they often get less than 7 of their recommended
9-9 ½ hours of sleep.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.820
A recent study published in the journal Alcoholism:
Clinical and Experimental Research, suggests

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.511
that sleep problems in teenagers mean more
than just an attitude and poor grades. Trouble

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.940
sleeping or not getting enough sleep strongly
predicted not just alcohol use, but associated

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.680
problematic behaviors, like binge-drinking,
driving under the influence and risky sexual

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.710
behavior.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.680
Previous studies show a relation between sleep
problems and substance abuse in high risk

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.510
populations, but this study controlled for
that. These were kids who, for whatever reason

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.680
weren’t sleeping enough.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.470
The researchers looked at data collected from
interviews and questionnaires from The National

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.900
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health. The data was collected in three waves,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
1st wave 1994 to 1995; second wave: 1996;
third wave: 2001 to 2002. Controlling for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.000
previous substance abuse, those sleepy high
schoolers in the mid-90s, were more likely

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.820
to have drinking problems 6 or 7 years later.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.979
The researchers found that having trouble
sleeping or not getting enough sleep in the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
1st wave strongly predicted alcohol problems
in the 2nd wave, the prediction for alcohol

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.510
issues in the third wave was less strong but
still significant.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.799
While some of sleepiness can be attributed
to an unfriendly schedule, the rates of insomnia

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.299
and sleep issues reported in this study were
about the same for adults. One in ten reported

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.380
chronic insomnia while three in ten report
occasional insomnia. This points to a biological

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.060
basis for sleeping problems.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.880
This isn’t the first study to show a correlation
between being tired and making bad decisions.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.229
Studies often show not getting enough sleeps
inhibits self-regulation, something teens

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.810
already struggle with.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.590
Why do teens struggle more than the rest of
us? Well mainly because their pre-frontal

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.900
cortex isn’t fully developed yet. This part
of the brain sits just behind the forehead

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.260
and it’s important for what’s called “executive
functioning”. Things like planning, memory,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.930
organization and mood. More importantly in
the case of the sleepy teens, this part of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.110
the brain helps you weigh the cost and benefits
of your choices.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.370
Studies show that a lack of sleep reduces
activity in this part of the brain, this disruption

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.670
increases risk taking behavior. It’s easy
to see how poor sleep and the teenage brain

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
combine and can lead to bad decisions. Being
a teenager and being sleep deprived is a double

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.890
whammy for the prefrontal cortex.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.990
So if you’re a teen, get more sleep. Seriously.
If you’re a parent of a teen, help them

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.849
get the sleep they need. You might try to
talk to them about how important sleep is

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.660
for the developing brain. Keep them on a regular
sleep schedule and cut out electronics like

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.920
phones and laptops before bed. It could help
curb some of the more dangerous of adolescent

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
behaviors.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.941

So, throwing it back to you commenters, is
partying late really that excellent? Do you
