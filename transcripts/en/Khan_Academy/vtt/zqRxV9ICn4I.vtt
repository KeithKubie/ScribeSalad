00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:02.187
Let's say Pete over here

00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:04.476
thinks that he's a pretty good investor.

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:06.938
What he does is, he has an idea that says,

00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:08.272
"Look. I'm going to create a corporation

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:10.472
"and I'm going to get a
bunch of people to contribute

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:11.802
"money to that corporation.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.817
"Then I'll manage that money

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:15.738
"and maybe I'll take a
little fee for myself

00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:18.267
"so that I can maybe hire some analysts

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.139
"or get some computers or
get some office space."

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:23.264
So what he does is he
sets up a corporation.

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:28.524
Let's say he sets up a
corporation right over here.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:30.000
The way he first sets up the corporation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.603
let's say just has 4 shares

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:33.337
and I'm making the number really small

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:35.804
just to make the drawing and math easy.

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:36.919
This wouldn't be realistic.

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:38.703
Normally it would be
something in the hundreds

00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:40.124
or thousands of shares

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:41.452
or maybe even more than that.

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:42.868
Let's say he has 4 shares

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:44.590
and let's say all of the 4 shares

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.117
are owned by P initially

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:49.713
just to simplify the explanation.

00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:55.870
He puts in $400 into this corporation.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.987
Another way to think about it,

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:59.844
in exchange for him putting
$400 into this corporation

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:06.715
he gets 4 shares or each
share is worth $100,

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:09.456
each of these shares right over here.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:12.124
What he does is he
registers this corporation.

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:15.383
I'm talking about a U.S. specific case

00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:17.258
but there's similar types of organizations

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:18.539
in other countries.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.316
He registers this
organization right over here

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:25.540
with the U.S. SEC, Securities
and Exchange Commission.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.051
He also registers himself with the SEC

00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:31.870
or even better, he registers
a management company

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.384
that he runs with the SEC.

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.119
Let's call it Pete Inc.,

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.705
is a corporation he starts off

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:40.048
that he also registers with the SEC.

00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:42.717
When he registers with the
SEC he tells them that,

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:44.618
"Look. This company right over here,

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:46.049
"we're going to issue more shares,

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.125
"it's for more people to contribute money.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.716
"I'm going to manage this
money right over here

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:52.121
"and I'm just going to take a percentage

00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.667
"of the total assets under management."

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.399
Sometimes you'll see AUM,

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.616
that just means assets under management.

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:00.475
That will go to Pete Inc. every year

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:04.133
for figuring out the best
place to invest this money.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.805
It's usually on the order of about 1%,

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.538
sometimes a little bit less,

00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:10.278
sometimes a little bit more. 1% per year.

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:14.696
Right now with only $400 under management

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.540
it would only be about $4 per year.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.401
Since he registered with the SEC

00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.407
he can call himself a mutual fund

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:25.279
and he can solicit funds from the public.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.742
It is a mutual fund.

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:29.868
He has jumped through all of the hoops

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:31.471
that the SEC sets up for him

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:35.201
so he can market himself

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:37.203
as some type of great fund manager.

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:38.612
We don't know if that's true or not,

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:44.716
and he can solicit funds from the public.

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:46.380
We're going to see in future videos

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.219
there are other funds,
especially hedge funds

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.402
that one; they can't market

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.135
and they can't take funds from the public.

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:53.266
Those can only take funds

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.739
from certain types of
sophisticated investors.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.060
What happens in Pete's fund

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.969
and this is going to be
an open-ended mutual fund

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.274
that we're showing here

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:02.734
and most mutual funds are like that.

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.069
Let's say that Sal comes along,

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.799
he likes Pete's marketing
materials and he says,

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.666
"Hey, I want Pete to manage my money too."

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:13.332
So Sal goes and he gives $100 and says,

00:03:13.332 --> 00:03:14.738
"Pete, give me a share."

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:17.222
So Pete creates another
share right over here,

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:20.467
he creates another share
and he gives it to Sal.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.427
He gets 1 share, that's me. I get 1 share

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.838
and in exchange I gave $100 to the fund.

00:03:26.838 --> 00:03:31.077
Now the fund has $500.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.441
This is $100 right over here.

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:35.106
Now Pete's annual fee

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:38.274
is going to be 1% of this
whole thing or $5 a year.

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:40.185
If this whole thing grows,

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.130
let's say this whole thing doubles

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.774
from $500, let's say it doubles to $1000

00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:47.871
then that $1000 is essentially split

00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:50.183
amongst these 5 share now.

00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:53.690
All of the people will essentially
have their money doubled

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.770
minus whatever Pete's expenses are.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.871
Let's say that a year goes by

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.602
and ten even after paying Pete the 1%.

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.493
We had $500 of assets under management.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.939
This whole assets under
management a year later

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.077
goes to, let's say it goes to $1000.

00:04:10.077 --> 00:04:12.831
Pete either is really good or really lucky

00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:14.536
or a little bit of both.

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:17.868
It goes to $1000.

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:19.747
Let me draw it like this.

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:22.000
Now it is at $1000 and
it still has the same

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.035
5 investors here and I'm lucky
enough to be one of them.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.088
Here are the 5 investors.

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:30.498
Let me draw the shares.

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:37.335
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shares.

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:39.467
Now, each of these shares, well,

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:41.964
this thousand dollars is called the NAV

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.403
or the net asset value.

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:46.056
Let me give you that piece of terminology,

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.934
just means net asset value.

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.268
There's an NAV per share.

00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:53.883
The NAV per share right over here is $200.

00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:55.202
I just took the total NAV

00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:57.220
and I just divided it by the shares.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.882
What's special about an
open-ended mutual fund

00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:03.220
is that the close or the end of every day,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.470
either new shares can
be removed from the fund

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.737
or it could be created before the fund.

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:10.720
In the first video I showed how

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.135
I wanted to buy into the fund,

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:13.402
so I bought a share

00:05:13.402 --> 00:05:14.883
and that increased the NAV

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:16.555
and it also increased
the number of shares.

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:18.807
He had to create a share for me to buy.

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:20.970
He didn't sell me a share
that already existed.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.972
You could imagine, after
this type of a performance

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:25.072
more people would want to buy shares.

00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:28.135
Now, they would have to
buy in to make things fair

00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:29.970
at $200 per share

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.467
because that's the current NAV per share.

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:34.550
Let's say that 5 more people

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.275
want to buy in at $200 per share.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:40.138
What Pete would do or
what this mutual fund,

00:05:40.138 --> 00:05:42.201
it's not Pete really,
it's the corporation,

00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:46.405
it would create 5 new shares.

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:50.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.204
If there's only one person that day

00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:53.339
it would create 1 share that day.

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.555
If there was 10 people that day

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.267
it would create 10 shares that day

00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:57.268
and it could keep doing this.

00:05:57.268 --> 00:05:59.970
The NAV of each of these are $200.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.135
It gives these shares
to each of these people

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:04.943
and they had to contribute $200.

00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:09.740
Essentially it puts
another $1000 into the pool

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.552
that Pete can now manage.

00:06:11.552 --> 00:06:16.538
Now, the total NAV for
the fund is $2000 now

00:06:16.538 --> 00:06:19.265
and Pete will get his 1% management fee

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:23.002
off of this entire $2000.

00:06:23.002 --> 00:06:28.113
Let's say that we
fast-forward a little bit

00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:31.284
to, let's say Pete starts
having a not so good year.

00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:33.469
Let's say we fast-forward a year past that

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.136
and Pete has a -10% return.

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:41.024
If you started at $2000
and that's when you include

00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:43.405
taking his management fee out.

00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:47.139
You started $2000, you lose 10% in 1 year

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.947
so it goes down to $1800.

00:06:49.947 --> 00:06:51.471
Let me do this in a new color.

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.282
Now he's at $1800.

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:56.535
It's not completely drawn to scale

00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.278
but hopefully you get the idea.

00:06:58.278 --> 00:07:05.249
Now he has at $1800

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:10.440
but you still have a total of 10 shares.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.736
Let me do my best to draw the 10 shares.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:21.706
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:23.469
These should be of equal size,

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.549
and now the NAV per share

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:32.299
is going to be 1800 divided by 10 or $180.

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:34.879
Let's say that I get a
little bit freaked out

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.548
by this recent performance

00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:38.405
and I have some other
commitments with my money.

00:07:38.405 --> 00:07:42.795
I said, "Pete, you need to
buy a share back for me."

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:46.472
What Pete does is he
would give me back $180.

00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:51.801
The total NAV would lose
$180, it'd go down $180.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:54.021
We would take this out of it.

00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:58.357
1800 - 180 = 1620

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:02.805
Now it is 1620 and they would
buy back a share for me.

00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:05.279
They would cancel one of the shares.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.522
Notice, the NAV per share does not change.

00:08:07.522 --> 00:08:09.139
By me redeeming my share,

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.944
it does not change what
happens to everyone else.

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:15.278
You have 1620 divided by 9 shares,

00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:21.135
that should still get
you to be $180 per share

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:22.363
if I did my math right.

00:08:22.363 --> 00:08:25.199
1800 - 180 gets you 1620.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:28.696
It should still be $180 per share.

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.202
This is the nature of an open-ended fund,

00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:32.275
you can keep creating shares

00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:34.345
and selling them to the
public to raise more money

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:36.537
or when someone wants their money back,

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:39.137
you essentially buy the
share back from them,

00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.198
give them their money when you buy it back

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:42.535
and you remove that share.

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:44.356
So an open-ended fund, really,

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:45.692
at the close of every trading day

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.535
can keep growing or shrinking.

00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:49.532
It could keep adding
more and more investors

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:51.868
or their investors can
take their money back.

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:53.192
What's difficult about this

00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:55.738
from the fund manager's point of view

00:08:55.738 --> 00:08:56.986
is that they have to manage this.

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:58.329
They have to manage this constant

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.580
buying and selling with the public.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.861
They have to management the paperwork.

00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.001
If you think about it,

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.262
they can't have all of
their money invested

00:09:05.262 --> 00:09:08.261
in relatively [iliqiud] assets

00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:09.266
or even in regular stocks.

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:10.927
They have to keep some
amount of their money

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:13.083
and it's usually like 3% to 5%.

00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:15.750
They have to keep some of these $2000

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.860
before he lost my money.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.160
They have to keep some of it in cash.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.726
From an investor's point
of view they would say,

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.118
"Well, if I'm good investing

00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:24.850
"I should try to minimize the
amount of cash that I have

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.188
"because I'm not getting return on cash,

00:09:26.188 --> 00:09:27.672
but because it's open-ended.

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.595
Because investors might come by and say,

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:30.917
"Hey, I want my money."

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:32.443
You have to have a little bit of cash

00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:34.938
as part of the asset pool

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:38.938
in order to be able to
buy people's shares back.
