00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.210
NARRATOR: Edgewood Arsenal,
Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, 1952.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.880
As part of a secret government
program termed Project Penguin,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.000
medical doctor and
psychiatrist Andrija Puharich

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.330
set up a special
laboratory where

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.000
psychics and military
personnel gathered

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.750
to investigate
psychological manipulation

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.210
and hallucinogenic drugs.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.380
Perhaps one of the most
compelling and controversial

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.170
aspects of Puharich's research
was channeling, which involved

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.420
making contact with
non-physical beings

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.710
through the use of psychics.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.580
It's very important that
we understand that this was

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.000
a serious scientific endeavor.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.880
No candles or holy water,
any of that was used.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.750
Puharich used the Faraday
cage, a copper room

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.710
that was especially insulated
according to US Naval standards

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.040
that would prohibit mid-level
electromagnetic waves

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.120
and electrostatic.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.250
In this Faraday cage
individuals would

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.620
relax and allow the mind over
matter signal to take place.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.250
In December, 1952,
Puharich invited

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.120
Hindu mystic and
doctor DG Vinod to one

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.210
of these channeling sessions.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.120
During the experiment, Vinod
went into a deep trance

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.620
and made contact with a group
of entities called The Nine.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.580
At the very
beginning, they just

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.790
announced themselves as nine
principles of the universe.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.790
Well, that's pretty
to big to start with,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.750
but nevertheless, they said
they were extraterrestrials.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.830
There were forces from beyond.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.170
The Nine said that they were
an eternal presence that they

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.580
had been watching humanity
from the very beginning,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.000
and that they were gods, guides,
and this was what particularly

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.080
interested Puharich, the
idea that if they are gods,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
they of course have
wisdom and Puharich

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500
wanted to ask for guidance.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.290
The Nine came up with a
number of different messages

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.580
involving they're being
guardians for the human race,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.830
creators even.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.040
Puharich, he said
what is your name?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.710
Who are you?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.790
And that was the great
revelation because the being

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.540
said, I am Atum, and
Atum was the great father

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.330
god of ancient Egypt.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.210
And introducing
not only the nine

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.620
principles, but
the Nine Great Gods

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.710
or the Ennead of ancient Egypt.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040
NARRATOR: Is it
possible that Puharich

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.330
actually made contact with
the Nine Great Gods of Egypt?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.880
Could this be evidence
of a long standing

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.000
federation of extra terrestrials
overseeing earthly affairs?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750
But if so, just who
were these beings?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.540
Heliopolis, Cairo,
known as the Sun City.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.500
This is one of the
oldest and most

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.710
sacred sites of ancient Egypt.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.580
Although mostly
destroyed, an obelisk

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.920
remains marking the spot where
the Temple of the Sun god Atum

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.040
once stood.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.210
Here, the ancient pharaohs
would connect to the Ennead,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.250
a council of nine
deities who were

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.380
said to have brought technology
and knowledge to mankind.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.620
According to
Egyptian hieroglyphs,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.460
consultation with the Ennead
was chief among the pharaoh's

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.460
duties and critical to
the success of the nation.
