00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's create a new app
using Android Studio.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.890
We'll create a basic Android application
that has a single empty activity.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.890
I'm just going to call it Location1,
and it's in this location.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860
The company domain,
you can put whatever you like.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.885
I'm just going to keep
that Android.example.com.

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:19.445
I'm going to make it a Jelly Bean
application for phone and tablet's.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.675
And like I said earlier, it's
going to be a single blank activity.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.229
I'll keep the defaults and continue.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.576
Now once this has been created,

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:35.450
I'm going to edit the activity
to add a single text view.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.360
When you run the app, location services
will start getting updates and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780
it will write details about
them to this text view.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.770
To edit the text view in the activity
editor, just select the Text tab and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.460
you can see what your
layout would look like.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.540
So, here's the basic layout
that has been built for

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.030
you in the default in Android Studio.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.760
You can see, it already has
a text view and the text for

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
this is held in a string refered to
in strings.xml called hello world.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.810
I'm just going to change that
to something hardcoded for now.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.860
I'll just say location goes here and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.630
then I'm going to give
this control an ID.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.595
So, I'm going to give
it the ID like this,

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:23.305
android:id=@+ID/txtOutput.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:26.565
So when I refer to this control
in code in a few moments,

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:29.995
you will see that the control
will be called txtOutput.

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:33.705
So this control is where the location
is going to get written.

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:37.190
So when we get details from
location services, in this case,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.830
the latitude of the phone, we'll write
it into this control called txtOutput.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.670
And if I look at the design,
you can see location goes here.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.180
It's faint, but
you can see it's there in this one.
