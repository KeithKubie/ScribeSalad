00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.760
The effects of alcohol:

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.140
all too familiar to some of us brings about a merry night of fun and laughter

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.720
climaxing in a seemingly joyful sleep and then when you

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.120
think it couldn't get any better -
a lovely whack in the face, followed by

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.980
the famous last words, "I will never drink
ever again."

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.800
The feelings are all too familiar

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.120
You've been here before

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.100
But what on earth is going on in your body to make you feel this way?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.130
In a previous
video, which you can click here, we

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
describe the effects of alcohol on the
brain and why it dehydrates you.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.060
Apart from just water, your body is also excreting
many components such as salt, potassium,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.760
and glucose which are required for
normal muscle coordination and brain function.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.300
But there is more to it.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.300
The site of detoxification in your body is located within your liver.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.930
Everything
that you ingest is broken down in your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.420
digestive system to become small enough that the nutrients are released into the bloodstream.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.370
These nutrients had to
deliver for a sort of quality control

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
In the liver, something called enzymes
are used to help break down and process

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.540
nutrients but also remove any toxins
when need be.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.100
After being processed by

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
the liver the products are now safe to
enter the whole body's bloodstream.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
Alcohol, otherwise known as ethanol, is
absorbed in the stomach and makes its

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.980
way to the liver to pass this clearance
test.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.920
First, the enzymes turn alcohol into

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.610
acetyl aldehyde. Then a different enzyme
plus a compound called glutathione

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.580
changes the acetyl aldehyde into
acetate, which is easily excreted by the body.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.979
Problem is, there's not a lot of
glutathione in the liver. Therefore as

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
you drink more the glutathione stores
start to run out, leaving more acetyl

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.260
aldehyde to circulate your body.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.760
So, what's so special about acetyl aldehyde?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
Well, it happens to be 10 to 30 times
more toxic than alcohol itself and can

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.640
lead to headaches and feeling nauseous.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.600
So, while your liver is working extra

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.470
hard to produce more glutathione, the
acetyl aldehyde is now free to roam your

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.260
body and is most likely what is making
you feel like a non-functioning member of society.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.670
In fact, suffering alcoholics are often

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.119
given a drug called antabuse
in order to stop the conversion of a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.920
acetyl aldehyde to acetate.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.259
This causes
them to feel the pain of their hangover

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.916
much more severely and hopes to
have them stop drinking.

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:06.100
So, is there anything we can do about it?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
Stay tuned for our next video about how to help cure your hangover.
