00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.711
Did you ever notice how many
jokes start with, "Did you ever notice?"

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.056
And what's the deal with, 
"What's the deal?"

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.695
There's a lot of funny to be found

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:18.143
by simply noticing the ordinary, 
everyday things

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.979
you don't ordinarily notice everyday.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.888
So if you'd like to add a little humor

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:25.930
to that story, or speech, 
or screenplay you're writing,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.089
here are a few tips and tricks
for finding the funny.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.898
All great storytelling, 
including comedy writing,

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:36.299
consists of a handful 
of basic ingredients:

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.107
who,

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:37.810
what,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.590
when,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.545
where,

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:40.419
why,

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:41.928
and how.

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:45.701
Writers have been asking these questions
since at least the 1st century BC,

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:48.536
yet none can be answered 
with a simple yes or no.

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.107
They demand details,

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:54.231
and the more specific the details,
the funnier the story.

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:58.152
Let's start with the who,
the comedic character.

00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:01.687
Think about the books, TV shows,
and movies that make you laugh.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.366
They're usually filled with funny types,
or archetypes.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.203
The know-it-all,

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:07.258
the loveable loser,

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:08.286
the bad boss,

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:09.386
the neurotic,

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:10.906
the airhead.

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:15.629
Incidentally, these are all stock 
characters found in Commedia Dell'Arte,

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:19.492
or the artists comedy 
of late Renaissance Italy,

00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:21.456
and they have yet to get old.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:26.108
The Commedia rule for creating comic 
characters is find the flaw,

00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:28.249
then play it up.

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.562
Or you can try playing with opposites.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:33.334
When the smartest guy in the room
does the stupidest thing,

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.980
or the doofus outwits the brainiac,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.619
we tend to laugh because
we didn't see that coming.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.803
Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle
is said to have said,

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:47.111
"The secret to humor is surprise."

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:51.292
This surprise, 
or incongruity theory of humor,

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:54.417
says we laugh at things 
that seem out of place

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:57.039
or run up against our expectations,

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.981
like a frog dating a pig,

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.597
or a lizard selling insurance,

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:03.658
a baby disco dancing,

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:05.617
a nun disco dancing,

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.942
a cat disco dancing.

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:11.958
Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat
doing pretty much anything,

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.957
especially involving disco.

00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:19.469
One fun way to find incongruities
is by drawing connections.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.775
Actually drawing them with a mind map.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.874
Start small.

00:02:23.874 --> 00:02:24.874
Pick a word,

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.727
I choose pickle.

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:29.512
Jot it down, then quick as you can,
try making connections.

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:31.147
What do pickles make me think of?

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:32.086
Who eats pickles?

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:35.322
What treasured pickle memories
do I have from childhood?

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.104
Another great way to generate
comedic material

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:42.246
is to shift from observation
to imagination.

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:45.216
Try going from "what is"
to "what if?"

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:48.557
Like, what if instead of a horse,
for example,

00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:51.053
you just had a pair of coconuts?

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:53.960
Okay, let's think of some other
memorable moments in history,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.735
literature,

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:55.832
or film.

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:57.855
Now, what if they featured coconuts?

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.238
Get wild, let it go.

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:02.724
Even if an idea seems overdone,

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:03.652
or too obvious,

00:03:03.652 --> 00:03:05.141
or just plain dumb,

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.320
try jotting it down, anyway.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.313
What's obvious to you
may not be to the next person.

00:03:11.313 --> 00:03:16.207
And the opposite of the dumbest idea
might just turn out to be the smartest.

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.454
What about all that dumb stuff
that happens in real life?

00:03:19.454 --> 00:03:22.323
Have you ever noticed how much comedy
revolves around things

00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:25.648
that irritate, frustrate, 
and humiliate us?

00:03:25.648 --> 00:03:31.466
Will Rodgers said, "Everything's funny
as long as it happens to somebody else."

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:33.395
So if you're having a crummy morning,

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:36.134
imagine it happening to a character
you're writing about,

00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:41.179
and by afternoon, you may at least
get a funny story out of it.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.497
Once you've got your characters
and story,

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:48.072
here are a few quick and easy comedy
writing tricks to make them zing.

00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:49.389
The rule of three,

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.160
or zig zig zag.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.730
Try setting up an expected pattern,
zig zig,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.691
then flip it, zag.

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.284
A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a bar.

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:03.553
The punchline rule says put your punch
at the end of the line.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:07.767
A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a disco.

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:09.988
That brings up the rule of K.

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:13.857
For some reason, words with a k-sound
catch our ears

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:15.849
and are considered comical.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:16.850
Coconut,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.687
disco,

00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:19.061
pickles,

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:20.674
crickets?

00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:23.925
Okay, so we don't always get the laugh.

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.575
Humor is subjective.

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:27.336
Comedy is trial and error.

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:28.958
Writing is rewriting.

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.302
Just keep trying.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.490
Find the flaws,

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.743
discover the details,

00:04:32.743 --> 00:04:34.066
insert incongruities,

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.325
incorporate k-words,

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.970
and remember the most important rule
of writing funny:

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.806
have fun.

00:04:40.806 --> 00:04:42.151
As Charles Dickins said,

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.534
"There is nothing in the world so
irresistibly contagious

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:48.330
as laughter and good humor."

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.798
And disco.
