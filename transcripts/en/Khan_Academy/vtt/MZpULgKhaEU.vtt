00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
Most liquids, when cooled,
will simply shrink.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.340
Water, on the other
hand, actually

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.620
expands when it is frozen.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.910
Its volume will
increase by about 9%.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.350
Suppose you have 1/3 of a gallon
of water that gets frozen.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.670
What is the volume of the
ice that you now have?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.380
So you're starting with
1/3 of a gallon of water.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.740
They tell us that when it gets
frozen, when it turns into ice,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.230
its volume is going
to expand by 9%.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.010
So the new volume is going
to be your existing volume.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.800
So this is the original
volume, 1/3 of a gallon,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.010
and it's going to expand by 9%.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.420
So your frozen volume is going
to be your original volume

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.290
plus 9% of your original volume.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.050
So you could say
it's 9% times 1/3.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.897
So this right over here is
going to be the expanded volume.

00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:03.980
Now, there's a bunch of
ways we can figure it out.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.470
We could turn things to
decimals or whatever else,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.590
but they tell us to express
your answer as a fraction.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.840
So let's make sure that
everything here is a fraction,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.567
and then we'll just
try to simplify.

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:18.025
So the one thing that's sitting
here that is not a fraction

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.320
is our 9%.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.020
Well, what does 9%
actually represent?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.200
Well, 9% literally
means 9 per 100.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.140
So we could rewrite
this as-- so this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.980
is going to be equal to 1/3
plus, instead of writing 9%,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.470
I'll write that as 9 per 100,
and then once again times 1/3.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.720
And we can simplify this
expression right over here.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.270
We have a 9 in the numerator,
a 3 in the denominator.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.810
If we divide both of them
by 3, we get a 3 and a 1.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.741
And so we're left with
1/3 plus 300 times 1/1.

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:01.240
Well, that's just
going to be 3/100.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.440
So this is just going to
be equal to 1/3 plus-- I'll

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.250
write this in orange
still, or maybe I'll

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.690
do it in a new
color-- plus 3/100.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.554
And now we have to add
something, or two numbers that

00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:19.720
have different denominators.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.110
So let's find a
common denominator.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.840
So this is going to be equal to,
well, the least common multiple

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.594
of 3 and 100.

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:31.010
And they share no common factor,
so it's really just going

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.160
to be the product of 3 and 100--
the least common multiple is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.820
300.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.574
So it's going to be
something over 300

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:42.000
plus something over 300.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.040
Now to go from 3 to 300, in
the denominator you multiply

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.710
by 100, so you have to multiply
the numerator by 100 as well.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.700
So 1/3 is the same
thing as 100/300.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.990
And to go from 100
to 300, we have

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.800
to multiply by 3
in the denominator,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.350
so we have to multiply by
3 in the numerator as well.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.276
So 3/100 is the
same thing as 9/300.

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:07.400
And now we're ready to add.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.480
This is going to be 100 plus
9/300, which is 109/300.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.680
So this is the volume
of ice that I now

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.398
have expressed as a fraction.
