00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Narrator] The Second
Industrial Revolution

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.350
in the United States

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.420
ushered in new technologies

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.510
and new ways of living and
working during the Gilded Age.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.790
Steel, electricity, and the telephone

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.240
allowed railroads to
crisscross the country,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.130
skyscrapers to rise out of cities,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.900
factories to hum along long after sunset,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.730
and business transactions
to take place instantly

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490
over hundreds of miles.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.040
This was the time when
the United States began

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.830
its transition from a
nation of rural farmers

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.280
to a nation of city
dwelling factory workers.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.400
So, at a glance, the Gilded
Age seems like a time

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.720
of radical change for the country.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.600
But, as historians,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.270
how can we tell just how much change

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.500
really occurred from 1865 to 1898?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.270
One way we can do this
is to track over time

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.810
what changed and what stayed the same

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.520
from the beginning of the
Gilded Age to its end.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.280
Historians call this process

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.610
examining continuity and change over time.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.560
When we study history,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.110
it's important to look at continuities,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.320
or things that continued on
the same as they were before,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.300
because it's really easy
to focus on how one aspect

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.130
of society really transformed

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.770
during a certain period of time

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.780
and then forget to account for the fact

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.280
that almost everything
else didn't change at all,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.050
but it would be practically impossible

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.230
to track the changes in
every aspect of society.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.150
So let's dial in on a few areas.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.760
Since the major
transformations came through

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.590
technology and business
in this time period,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.840
and those are both aspects of work,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.450
I'm curious about how the
kind of work that people did

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.080
and the way that they did it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.490
changed over the course of the Gilded Age.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.150
And since I know that cities grew a lot

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.430
during this time period,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.190
let's also look at changes
in living patterns.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.160
Where people migrated to and from

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.310
and how they lived.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.020
I'm also curious about the extent to which

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.860
these changes in work and living patterns

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.400
affected the major ideas
and culture of the time.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.370
Did people's beliefs
about society change much

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.560
during the Gilded Age?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.400
Or was the culture of the United States

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.120
at the end of the 19th century

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.780
pretty much the same as it was at the end

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.820
of the Civil War?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.280
So let's look at the major trends

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.700
in each of these areas at
the beginning and the end

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.800
of this time period

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.590
so we can try to answer the question

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.350
how much change did
industrialization really bring

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.760
during the Gilded Age?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.640
By the way, I'm not
gonna go into a whole lot

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.100
of detail on these trends

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.940
because we're doing a really big overview

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.170
of the Gilded Age here.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.610
So if you find that you're not familiar

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.730
with something that comes up,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.520
just make a note of it
and you can look it up

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.470
when you have time.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.900
Okay, first, let's compare
the changes in work

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.980
and business from 1865 to 1898.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.690
Well in 1865, the United States was still

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.240
a primarily a nation of farmers,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.960
although there were a
good number of people

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.790
in the North and the
West who worked in mills,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.610
and mines, and on railroads.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.130
Many African Americans
had transitioned from

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.600
working as slave laborers
on plantations in the South

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.880
to working as sharecroppers,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.130
where they would work
portions of plantations

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.700
in return for a pretty
measly share of the profits.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.680
In fact, most work in the United States

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.460
was segregated by race.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.500
It was pretty uncommon for
whites, African Americans,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.480
Chinese laborers, or
Mexican American laborers

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.600
to work side by side anywhere.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.870
In terms of the way
businesses were organized,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.000
the Civil War had sowed some initial seeds

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.190
of business consolidation.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.090
The industrial might
that had helped the North

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.960
win the Civil War

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.800
made it easy for some
large companies to begin

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.140
turning natural resources
into infrastructure.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.700
How did that compare to
the state of work in 1898?

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.790
Well there were still plenty of farmers

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.010
and sharecroppers,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.240
although the mechanization of agriculture

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.620
in the late 19th century

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.200
had a negative effect on many farmers,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200
sending them to the city looking for work.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.650
By the end of the century

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.250
more people worked for
someone else for wages

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.610
than worked for themselves
for the first time

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.890
in American history.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.370
A lot of this factory growth was driven by

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.610
new business practices like

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.140
mass production on the assembly line,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.520
which broke complex tasks
down into tiny steps

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.700
so that no one required much training

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.020
to work in a factory.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.400
A process known as deskilling.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.490
Women and children began
working in factories as well,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.680
but as at the beginning of the Gilded Age

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.650
work places still tended
to be racially segregated

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.190
and by the end of the 19th century

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.420
businesses undergone major consolidation.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.470
Often using monopolistic
practices to dominate industries

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.350
and fix prices and wages.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.890
In response, many workers
began to organize labor unions,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.590
but they had pretty limited success.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.600
So overall, I would say
that industrialization

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.140
led to some pretty major
changes in the world of work,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.860
although work generally
remained segregated

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.260
and the process of transitioning

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.710
from farms to factories
wasn't entirely complete.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.210
During the Gilded Age
there was a huge shift

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.690
towards unskilled wage
work and big corporations.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.380
Next let's look at living
and migration patterns.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.220
In 1865 only about 20% of the
population lived in cities.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.700
Most of the migrants to cities were

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.350
Irish and German immigrants coming from

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.920
Northern and Western Europe.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.820
Most African Americans
continued to live in the South

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.440
in the immediate
aftermath of the Civil War

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.230
and the cities themselves had pockets

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.170
of density and poverty,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.820
like New York City's
Five Points neighborhood,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.300
but they weren't yet incredibly crowded.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.000
What about in 1898?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.260
Well, the percentage of the
population living in cities

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.070
nearly doubled, up to 40%.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.570
Several cities grew to more
than one million people

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.890
for the first time during the Gilded Age

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.870
and who was coming to the
cities changed as well.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.200
Political and economic trouble at home

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.060
led many Southern and
Eastern Europeans to head

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.240
for the factories in American cities

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.380
and African Americans also began to

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.725
slowly trickle northward
in order to escape

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:14.450
sharecropping and Jim Crow.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.450
This massive influx of people meant that

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.330
cities were very dense

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.960
and many people had to
crowd into tenements,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.950
unsafe, unventilated,
ramshackle apartment buildings.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.230
In 1900, the Lower East Side of Manhattan

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.060
was the most densely
populated neighborhood

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.220
in the world.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.500
So I would say that
industrialization also led

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.560
to quite the transformation

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.830
in living and migration patterns.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.920
The factory jobs available
in American cities

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.040
drew new people to them
from all over the country,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.740
and the world, and also changed
the standards of living.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.262
Last, let's map the
changes and continuities

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:56.150
in prominent cultural ideas

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.900
over the course of the Gilded Age.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.980
Although there are lots of different ideas

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.610
and forms of cultural
expression we could talk about,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.490
I'm gonna focus on ideas about

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.540
the economy, and race, and immigration

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.470
since those are so closely tied
to the other two categories

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.010
of analysis we've got here.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.010
Immediately after the Civil War,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.010
there was an intense push in Congress

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.980
and in the North to ensure racial equality

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.400
for African Americans

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.450
with the passage of the 13th,
14th, and 15th Amendments,

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.410
but there was also a very strong nativist

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.740
or anti-immigrant sentiment

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.150
among white native born Protestants

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.430
who especially objected to the immigration

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.740
of Irish Catholics.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.430
As far as the economy went,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.200
there were many people
who argued in favor of

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.955
laissez faire economics,

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:47.710
that the government should engage in

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.140
little to no regulation of the market

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.240
and that was pretty much the prevailing

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.930
government approach of the day.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.310
Alright, how does that compare to 1898?

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.600
Well unlike in the
immediate post war period,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.900
racial equality for African Americans

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.050
had been abandoned as a mainstream idea

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.560
with the rise of Jim Crow and rulings like

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.520
the 1896 Supreme Court case,
Plessy versus Ferguson,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.300
which approved segregation.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.870
Nativism was also still
a force in American life

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.541
and it had even intensified

00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:22.020
thanks to the flawed racial pseudo-science

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.100
known as Social Darwinism,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.050
which suggested that people
who were in high positions

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.230
in society, both in
terms of race and wealth,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.100
belonged there because
they were the fittest.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.750
But there were a few
reformers who were beginning

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.260
to question the effects
of industrialization

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.280
like settlement house founder, Jane Addams

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.140
or early muckraker Jacob Riis.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.418
So in terms of ideas and culture,

00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:50.350
it looks like there was
actually more continuity

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.160
than change over the
course of the Gilded Age.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.950
There may even have been
an overall regression

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.490
in ideas about race and immigration

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.730
in this time period.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.450
There were a few efforts
to soften the pains

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.150
of industrialization and urbanization,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.190
but they weren't yet widespread.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.100
Let's return to our question then

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.840
and see if we can formulate
a thesis statement

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.050
to address the extent to which

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.050
industrialization brought
change from 1865 to 1898.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.790
From the evidence we've gathered,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.590
I'd say that the technological
and business advancements

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.670
of the Second Industrial Revolution

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.510
brought enormous changes to the ways

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.690
that people lived and
worked in the United States,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.620
transforming the country
from a rural farming nation

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.940
to an urban industrial one,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.330
but the major ideas about
immigration, race, and the economy

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.830
didn't change as much.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.090
Segregation and nativist
sentiment intensified

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.200
over the time period

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.270
and efforts to reign in the excesses

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.570
of industrial capitalism
were just getting started.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.330
The major social efforts to
improve the lives and work

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.200
of this new urban population
would have to wait

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.753
until the Progressive Era.
