00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.807
--fundamental frequency,
here, nu.

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:25.961
Now, I should tell you that the
model that we used to get these

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:32.307
vibrational energies for a
molecule is actually called a

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:36.000
harmonic oscillator model.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.194
It is a model.
And it predicts that the

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:55.345
spacings between these energies
are all equal.

00:00:55.345 --> 00:01:01.359
The reality is,
that the spacings are not all

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.145
equal.
The reality is that this

00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:08.364
molecule is an anharmonic
oscillator.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:13.728
And that although way down here
in the well, the spacings are

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:16.410
just about equal,
v equal zero,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.556
v equal one,
v equal two,

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:23.384
as you get further up in the
well they do start to come

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:26.781
together.
And they actually converge to

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:32.148
the dissociation limit.
You don't have to know that,

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.910
right now.
You will see that in later

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.900
courses, but I just wanted to
make you aware of that,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.196
that the harmonic oscillator
model works pretty well down

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:45.652
here.
But the harmonic oscillator

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:48.951
potential function actually
looks like that.

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:52.097
A real potential function looks
like that.

00:01:52.097 --> 00:01:56.317
This becomes anharmonic.
So those spacings do get closer

00:01:56.317 --> 00:02:00.000
together.
That is for the future.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.881
Now, you can also put enough
vibrational energy into the

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:09.230
molecule to break a bond.
When you get up to here,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.514
you can put enough vibrational
energy.

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:17.573
And this hydrogen and the
chlorine, as they oscillate out,

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:22.100
they will just keep going,
If you put enough energy.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.473
You get up here,
and when they stretch,

00:02:25.473 --> 00:02:30.000
they will just keep on their
merry way.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.180
They won't come back.
There won't be a restoring

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.760
force.
So, by putting a lot of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.653
vibrational energy into the
molecule, you can break your

00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:43.165
bond.
And in fact,

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:47.079
that is what happens when you
break the bond.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.438
You have a lot of vibrational
energy in that bond,

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:54.996
and the two atoms just keep
flying apart.

00:02:54.996 --> 00:03:01.406
That was our diatomic molecule.
What I now want to just talk

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:06.392
briefly about are polyatomic
molecules because we said in a

00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:09.315
polyatomic molecule,
such as water,

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:13.011
we have several different
vibrational modes.

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:18.083
And each of those vibrational
modes actually has a different

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:22.467
fundamental frequency.
And each of those vibrational

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:27.022
modes can be represented with
this sort of interaction

00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:31.422
potential.
Sometimes it is not as simple a

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:36.034
coordinate system because you
have some bends so you have to

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:40.255
plot this as a function of
angles, which is not easy to

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:43.068
draw.
But each one of the vibrational

00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:46.586
modes in a polyatomic molecule
can, in effect,

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:50.650
be represented by some kind of
energy of interaction,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.089
like we drew here for this
diatomic molecule.

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.154
It is just a little bit more
complicated because your

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:03.000
coordinate system is a little
more complicated.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.366
Particularly when you start
talking about bends.

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:15.326
But let's take a look here on
the side walls.

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:22.912
What I am showing you is a
vibrational spectrum of water.

00:04:22.912 --> 00:04:30.498
And, again, this is some
infrared radiation that is being

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:37.000
directed at a sample of water
molecules.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.987
And we are measuring the
intensity of that radiation at a

00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:47.421
photo detector as a function of
the frequency of the radiation

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:52.230
going through our sample.
And when the molecule absorbs

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.396
radiation at that frequency,
that intensity at the detector

00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:00.285
goes down.
What you see,

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:04.931
here, is just a hypothetical
spectrum for water.

00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:10.171
You see that the molecule is
absorbing some radiation,

00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:16.003
here, at 1,595 wave numbers.
Well, that 1,595 corresponds to

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:21.342
the fundamental frequency of
vibration of this hydrogen

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:25.000
bending mode.
That is 1,595.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.311
That is the frequency in
wavenumbers with which that

00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:37.869
hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen bond is
bending or vibrating.

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:45.665
This is also the energy between
the v equal zero and v equal one

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:50.120
mode.
This represents excitation from

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.307
v equal zero to v equal one.
And then, way up here,

00:05:56.307 --> 00:06:02.000
you see another transition at
3,652.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.833
Well that, we know to be the
symmetric stretch.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.583
That is, both hydrogens moving
in or out at the same time.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:15.166
3,652 wave numbers is the
fundamental frequency for that

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:19.500
particular vibration.
It also represents a transition

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.166
from v equal zero to v equal
one.

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.416
And then, finally,
at 3,756, that is the

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:29.750
anti-symmetric stretch,
where one of the hydrogens is

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.000
moving out and one of the
hydrogens is moving in.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.803
Anti-symmetric stretch.
It also is the v equal zero to

00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:44.607
v equal one transition.
And so, that is what you would

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:48.232
measure on an infrared spectrum
of water.

00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:53.398
Actually, infrared plus Raman,
but we will leave that out.

00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:58.655
And what is interesting is that
any molecule that has an OH

00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:02.643
stretch in it,
or any molecule that has an OH

00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:06.864
group in it --
If you take an infrared

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:10.351
spectrum of it,
what you are going to see is

00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:14.810
that it has a transition
somewhere in between 3,400 wave

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.729
numbers and about 3,800 wave
numbers.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.108
If you had an unknown compound
and you put it into your

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:27.135
infrared spectrometer and saw a
transition somewhere in between

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:30.702
3,400 and 3,800,
immediately that is going to

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:35.000
clue you in that you have an OH
stretch.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.452
Because now other molecules
that are at all common are going

00:07:40.452 --> 00:07:44.610
to have a fundamental frequency
in that range.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:50.062
You can see how this infrared
spectroscopy can be used as an

00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:54.867
analytical tool to figure out
what molecule you have.

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:58.379
And, of course,
the actual frequencies,

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:03.000
then, are a fingerprint of the
molecule.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.298
But, just in general,
if you did not know anything

00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:12.035
about the molecule and you saw a
stretch in this range,

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:16.859
you know you got an OH bond,
there, that is undergoing a

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:21.771
symmetric or an anti-symmetric
stretch if you have two OH

00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.085
bonds.
Likewise, say you had a

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:29.800
carbon-hydrogen bond,
what you would find is that all

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.696
carbon-hydrogen bonds have
fundamental frequencies from

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:38.867
about 2,800 wave numbers to
3,100 wave numbers.

00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:44.489
If you see a transition in that
range, you know that you have a

00:08:44.489 --> 00:08:48.388
hydrogen bonded to a carbon.
Because, again,

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:53.556
there really isn't anything
else that is common that has a

00:08:53.556 --> 00:08:58.000
vibrational frequency in that
range.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.701
When you get to a little lower
frequencies, well,

00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:06.019
then it is a little more
difficult because there are lots

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:09.490
of different other modes that
have vibrations,

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.420
which are a little bit lower
frequency.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.124
But, again, the specific number
will identify the molecule for

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.823
you.
One other thing is that just in

00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:24.218
general, bending modes have
lower frequencies than stretch

00:09:24.218 --> 00:09:26.763
modes.
That is a general statement

00:09:26.763 --> 00:09:31.391
that is true.
Also, generally symmetric

00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:37.324
stretches have lower frequencies
than anti-symmetric stretches.

00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:41.342
That is true.
And you will see more of this

00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:45.935
infrared spectroscopy used as an
analytical tool,

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.570
essentially,
when you take some organic

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.493
chemistry.
Well, what I want to talk about

00:09:53.493 --> 00:10:00.000
now is the other internal degree
of freedom in molecules.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.191
That is molecular rotations.
Well, molecular rotations are

00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:11.079
quantized, just like molecular
vibrations are.

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:16.728
Let me take my HCl again and
draw this intermolecular

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:22.376
interaction potential.
And let me put my v equal zero

00:10:22.376 --> 00:10:26.830
level down here.
Then, just for ease of my

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:34.000
diagram, I am going to put my v
equal one level up here.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.879
Rotational levels,
they are quantized.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:43.645
And the rotational quantum
number is given the symbol J.

00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:47.943
For example,
if you have a molecule in the

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:53.290
first rotational state,
that first rotational state,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:11:00.000
then, will be right here.
We will call that J equal one.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.125
And then, if you have it in the
second excited rotational state,

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.138
that is going to be right
there.

00:11:09.138 --> 00:11:14.777
We will call it J equal two.
And the third rotational state

00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:20.319
is going to be right there.
We will call it J equal three.

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.138
And the fourth,
J equals four.

00:11:23.138 --> 00:11:28.777
Now, if you have a molecule in
the ground rotational state,

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:35.000
that ground rotational state,
here, is J equal zero.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.692
And it is sitting here right on
top of the v equal zero level

00:11:39.692 --> 00:11:43.681
for the ground rotational state.
The bottom line is,

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:48.530
you can have a molecule in the
ground vibrational state and the

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.972
ground rotational state.
If that is the case,

00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:56.430
this is how much energy it has.
When you are in the ground

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.324
rotational state,
that is zero energy,

00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:03.000
as we are going to see in a
moment.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.099
You can have a molecule in the
ground vibrational state in the

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:10.526
first excited rotational state.
If that is the case,

00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:13.819
that is the energy.
You can have a molecule in the

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:18.120
ground vibrational state and the
second excited rotational state.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.750
Then it has that energy.
You can have a molecule in the

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.916
ground vibrational state in the
third excited rotational state.

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:29.748
It has that energy.
But you can also have a

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:33.320
molecule in the first excited
vibrational state,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.437
right here, and in the J equal
zero state.

00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:39.857
Well, if that is the case,
it has that energy.

00:12:39.857 --> 00:12:44.570
You could also have a molecule
in the first excited vibrational

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.914
state and the first excited
rotational state.

00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:52.247
Well, then it has that energy.
Or, a molecule in the first

00:12:52.247 --> 00:12:56.579
excited vibrational state and
the second rotational state.

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:02.907
Well, then it has that energy.
Each one of these vibrational

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:07.821
states has, on top of it,
a manifold of rotational

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:11.430
states.
The rotations and vibrations,

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.639
for our purpose,
are not coupled.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:20.054
You can have so much in
vibration, so much in rotation.

00:13:20.054 --> 00:13:25.769
I want you to also notice,
that the difference in energies

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:31.785
between rotational states is
much smaller than the difference

00:13:31.785 --> 00:13:37.000
in energies between vibrational
states.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.652
That is a general statement
that is correct.

00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:46.845
Now, we have a nice analytical
expression, again,

00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:52.039
for the allowed rotational
energies of molecules,

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:57.124
and that analytical expression
is the following.

00:13:57.124 --> 00:14:03.399
E sub J is equal to h squared
times J, J plus one over 8 pi

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:08.268
squared times I.

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:13.176
I is the moment of inertia.

00:14:13.176 --> 00:14:17.411
I will explain that in just a
moment.

00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:23.294
What does this say?
It says that when J is equal to

00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:30.117
zero, the rotational energy,
here, is equal to zero because

00:14:30.117 --> 00:14:36.225
it makes this all go away.
So, the molecule has no

00:14:36.225 --> 00:14:39.419
rotational energy in J equal
zero.

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:43.774
When J is equal to one,
we put in J equal one,

00:14:43.774 --> 00:14:47.838
we calculate that,
and it comes out to be h

00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:53.645
squared over 4pi squared times
the moment of inertia.

00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:57.419
This is J equal one.

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:01.580
For J equal two,
the molecule has 3h squared

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.838
over 4pi squared amount of
rotational energy.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:11.781
For J equal three,

00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:17.126
it has 3h squared over 2 pi
squared times the moment of

00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:20.788
inertia.

00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:25.638
The energies go up.
Suppose I have a molecule in v

00:15:25.638 --> 00:15:30.883
equal zero, J equal zero,
and it makes the transition,

00:15:30.883 --> 00:15:35.832
here, to J equal one,
what is the energy difference

00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:42.191
between those states?
Well, J equal one minus energy

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:46.340
J equal zero.
That is h squared over 4pi

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.765
squared times I minus zero.

00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:59.000
That is just h squared over 4pi
squared I.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.960
How do we make that transition?
Well, to make this transition

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.919
right here, we are going to need
a photon, and that photon is

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:13.301
going to have to have an energy
exactly equal to this.

00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:17.682
Our photon E equal h nu,
that has got to be equal to h

00:16:17.682 --> 00:16:22.559
squared 4pi squared times I.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:27.272
I can solve for the frequency
of the photon that I need to

00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:33.120
make that transition.
The frequency of that photon

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.910
then is h over 4pi squared times
I.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:43.931
That is
the frequency of the photon that

00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:47.386
I need.
Now, in the case of HCl,

00:16:47.386 --> 00:16:51.956
we said that HCl has two
rotational modes.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:58.309
It has a mode rotation around
this axis, and it also has a

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:06.000
mode rotation around this axis,
in the plane of the board.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.942
These two rotations are
degenerate.

00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:14.811
If you put in a photon with
this frequency,

00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:21.536
here, it will excite either
this rotation or that rotation.

00:17:21.536 --> 00:17:25.826
Now, let's look on the side
wall here.

00:17:25.826 --> 00:17:32.288
How do we do the experiment?
Again, just like we do it in

00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:35.722
the infrared,
except that the energy of the

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:39.318
photon we now need is in the
microwave range.

00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:43.978
Microwave spectra measure
rotational spectra of molecules.

00:17:43.978 --> 00:17:47.493
And so, again we have a
microwave radiation,

00:17:47.493 --> 00:17:51.008
monochromator,
coming out, going through the

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:55.177
sample, photo detector,
look at the intensity of the

00:17:55.177 --> 00:18:00.000
photo detector as a function of
the frequency.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.400
At some frequency here,
you see a dip in that

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.700
intensity.
Well, that is where the

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.299
molecule absorbs.
And, in the case of HCl here,

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:17.599
the frequency of that
absorption for J equal zero to J

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:21.599
equal one, well,
that frequency occurs at

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:26.200
6.3x10^11 hertz.
That would be the frequency of

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:32.000
the photon that you would need
for absorption.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.276
Yes?
I'm sorry?

00:18:33.276 --> 00:18:37.745
We got into the microwave
range, here, because the

00:18:37.745 --> 00:18:43.309
spacings between the rotational
states are much lower than the

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:46.866
spacings between the vibrational
states.

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:50.970
And I just actually wanted to
make that point,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.980
here.
We can calculate in terms of

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.446
the energy, here,
what this spacing is.

00:18:57.446 --> 00:19:00.000
Let's do that.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.882
If we want to know the change
in energy from J equal zero to J

00:19:11.882 --> 00:19:19.102
equal one, that change in energy
is just h times the frequency of

00:19:19.102 --> 00:19:24.292
the photon, that photon,
there, that makes that

00:19:24.292 --> 00:19:30.356
transition happen.
You can plug that in,

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:37.549
there, so we have 6.6261x10^-34
joule seconds,

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:43.622
times the frequency
6.3479x10^11 hertz.

00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:50.815
When you do that,
you should get 4.2062x10^-22

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:55.770
joules.
Or, if I convert that to

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:03.442
kilojoules per mole,
it is 6.25330 kilojoules per

00:20:03.442 --> 00:20:08.772
mole.
In general, the difference in

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:12.884
the spacings here,
the energy difference for

00:20:12.884 --> 00:20:18.717
vibration, we said is something
between three to 40 kilojoules

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:22.446
per mole.
That is the difference between

00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:28.183
v equal zero and v equal one,
generally, for a large range of

00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:32.763
molecules.
The difference in the

00:20:32.763 --> 00:20:40.131
frequencies here for rotation,
delta E, that is more like

00:20:40.131 --> 00:20:47.631
something on the order of 0.01
to about 1.0 kilojoules per

00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:51.447
mole.
That is what is typical.

00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:58.289
So, rotations are much more
closely spaced in energy.

00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:02.142
Yes?
Well, in the case of the

00:21:02.142 --> 00:21:06.160
rotational spectra,
there is a little bit more

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.017
diversity in what units are
used.

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:13.660
And the reason is this.
They are more closely spaced.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.303
And the whole wavenumber came
into use in vibrational

00:21:18.303 --> 00:21:23.928
spectroscopy when the way people
would analyze the spectra would

00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:30.000
be to take a photographic plate
with the light coming in.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.933
And you would see the lines
separated in space.

00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:38.893
And people would take a ruler
in centimeters to measure the

00:21:38.893 --> 00:21:43.596
spacings between the lines.
That is historically how the

00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:48.299
wavenumber unit came to be.
The problem is that does not

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:51.634
work so well in rotational
spectroscopy,

00:21:51.634 --> 00:21:56.080
often, because the spacings are
much closer together.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.211
And so, depending exactly on
what kind of diffraction grading

00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:06.000
used, the wavenumbers are not
always used.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.747
Sometimes they are the
frequency.

00:22:08.747 --> 00:22:13.213
We go back and forth.
And, in your homework problems,

00:22:13.213 --> 00:22:15.274
I go back and forth,
too.

00:22:15.274 --> 00:22:19.396
You really have to deal with
both kinds of units.

00:22:19.396 --> 00:22:23.689
But now, one of the
usefulnesses of this rotational

00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:28.069
spectroscopy in getting,
say, this frequency for the

00:22:28.069 --> 00:22:31.074
transition, one of the
usefulnesses,

00:22:31.074 --> 00:22:37.000
there, is to calculate the bond
length of the molecule.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.635
To determine the bond length of
the molecule really very

00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:46.836
accurately.
Because what we said over here

00:22:46.836 --> 00:22:51.856
is that the frequency for that
transition is this.

00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:57.286
The frequency of that
transition is h over 4pi squared

00:22:57.286 --> 00:23:02.000
times I.
And I is a moment of inertia.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.742
The moment of inertia is the
following.

00:23:05.742 --> 00:23:09.780
Maybe you have had this 8.01.
No, not yet?

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.818
Oh, you will.
The moment of inertia is the

00:23:13.818 --> 00:23:19.136
reduced mass times the distance
between the two masses.

00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:22.386
In our case,
for the HCl molecule,

00:23:22.386 --> 00:23:28.000
it is equilibrium bond length,
r sub e squared.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.011
The reduced mass is what I gave
you before, m1 m2 over the sum

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.626
of the two masses.

00:23:36.626 --> 00:23:41.556
Again, it is a way to reduce a
two-body problem to a one-body

00:23:41.556 --> 00:23:46.568
problem, where the one-body is
this fictitious body of reduced

00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:48.293
mass. But it is exact.

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:51.908
There are no approximations.
This is correct.

00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:55.605
That is the moment of inertia
of the molecule.

00:23:55.605 --> 00:24:00.042
It is a property of the
molecule, depending on the mass

00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:05.003
and the bond length.
You can see that if I

00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:10.155
substitute that in there,
h over 4pi squared times nu r

00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:15.689
sub e squared, 
and then I go and

00:24:15.689 --> 00:24:20.077
solve for r sub e,
well, r sub e is (h over 4pi

00:24:20.077 --> 00:24:23.512
squared mu times nu) to the
one-half.

00:24:23.512 --> 00:24:28.759
In the case of HCl

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:32.983
--
Actually, I think this is all

00:24:32.983 --> 00:24:37.922
in my slide, here.
If I go and stick in the value

00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:42.141
for nu, the equilibrium bond
length, here,

00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:48.109
is really 1.2748x10^-10 meters.
We can really measure these

00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:53.151
frequencies with high precision
and high accuracy.

00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:58.090
All bond lengths,
really, come from measurements,

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:05.176
now, of rotational spectra.
All bond lengths in the gas

00:25:05.176 --> 00:25:12.117
phase, wherever we can measure
the rotational spectra of the

00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:16.470
molecule.
That is one of the main uses

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.941
for rotational spectroscopy.
Questions?

00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:28.117
If not, what I am going to do
is leave the subject of internal

00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:32.903
motion.
I want to talk for the rest of

00:25:32.903 --> 00:25:38.322
the hour, and a little bit on
Friday about another topic,

00:25:38.322 --> 00:25:42.000
which is intermolecular
attraction.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.040
Interactions.
Or, I am going to write it here

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.163
as attractions.
The bottom line is,

00:25:54.163 --> 00:25:58.846
I want to try to understand,
on a microscopic scale,

00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:05.000
deviations from the inner gas
law, PV equal nRT.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.072
You know PV equal nRT,
that if I made a plot of the

00:26:17.072 --> 00:26:23.159
volume versus the temperature
and kept the pressure constant,

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:28.739
say the pressure is at one
atmosphere, and the number of

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:34.217
moles in my gas is constant,
well, you know that what I

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:40.000
should see from that equation is
a straight line.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.420
But suppose I took a balloon
filled with air and started to

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:51.121
cool down that balloon--in that
case, the atmospheric pressure

00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:57.009
is essentially constant--in that
case, what would happen is that

00:26:57.009 --> 00:27:02.423
the volume would decrease.
It would decrease in a linear

00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:06.935
manner with temperature;
everything would be fine until

00:27:06.935 --> 00:27:11.113
at some low temperature,
this volume would start to

00:27:11.113 --> 00:27:16.043
deviate from the straight line
dependence, start to go down.

00:27:16.043 --> 00:27:20.555
And then, all of a sudden,
the volume would go very low

00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:24.566
because, of course,
at roughly 77 degrees Kelvin,

00:27:24.566 --> 00:27:29.161
which is the boiling point of
nitrogen, the liquid would

00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:34.005
condense.
So, the volume gets very small.

00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:37.108
I could also do that with
helium.

00:27:37.108 --> 00:27:41.470
If I took a helium balloon and
cooled it down,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.997
the volume would decrease.
But then, as I got pretty cold,

00:27:46.997 --> 00:27:52.329
the volume would start to
decrease faster than predicted

00:27:52.329 --> 00:27:57.274
by the inert gas law.
And right at 4 degrees Kelvin,

00:27:57.274 --> 00:28:02.703
the boiling point of liquid
helium, the volume would then

00:28:02.703 --> 00:28:09.103
just kind of plummet.
And so you can understand what

00:28:09.103 --> 00:28:14.275
happens right here,
but we also want to understand,

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:20.482
why does the PV equal nRT start
to deviate before we get to a

00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:26.482
boiling point of the liquid?
The reason is because of these

00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:31.067
intermolecular attractions.
For example,

00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:35.873
if I had in my gas this
nitrogen molecule headed toward

00:28:35.873 --> 00:28:40.145
the wall of my container,
and it has some initial

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:44.416
straight trajectory,
it is going to hit the wall,

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:49.667
where it is going to exert this
force, which will lead to my

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:53.850
macroscopic pressure.
But, if there is an oxygen

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.765
molecule around,
that nitrogen molecule could

00:28:57.765 --> 00:29:02.393
indeed be deflected by these
attractive interactions,

00:29:02.393 --> 00:29:08.000
circle around it,
and then finally hit the wall.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.466
So the nitrogen would be
delayed in hitting the wall.

00:29:12.466 --> 00:29:16.331
If it is delayed,
then my force is going to be

00:29:16.331 --> 00:29:19.938
not as great,
because it is momentum change

00:29:19.938 --> 00:29:25.349
over the change in time between
collisions, my pressure is going

00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:28.527
to be lower if,
in fact, this nitrogen

00:29:28.527 --> 00:29:33.509
experiences some attractive
interaction that delays it from

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:37.460
hitting the wall.
And, therefore,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.964
the pressure is lower,
or vice versa.

00:29:40.964 --> 00:29:45.150
In this case,
if I kept the outside pressure

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.946
constant, then the volume would
go down.

00:29:48.946 --> 00:29:54.398
Now, why is that the case?
Why should nitrogen and oxygen

00:29:54.398 --> 00:30:00.487
actually attract each other?
In order to talk about that,

00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:05.639
we have to think a little bit
more carefully about what the

00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:10.258
electron distributions are
around nitrogen molecules,

00:30:10.258 --> 00:30:13.989
oxygen molecules.
We treated, in the sodium

00:30:13.989 --> 00:30:19.053
chloride, lithium chloride,
those things as point charges.

00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:24.027
We have to be a little more
sophisticated now in thinking

00:30:24.027 --> 00:30:28.913
about what the electron
distributions are in these kinds

00:30:28.913 --> 00:30:33.000
of molecules,
nitrogen or oxygen.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.062
And let me, for the ease of
just drawing this,

00:30:37.062 --> 00:30:40.402
talk about the inert gas,
here, argon.

00:30:40.402 --> 00:30:44.194
As you may or may not know,
on the average,

00:30:44.194 --> 00:30:48.798
the electron distribution
around argon is spherical.

00:30:48.798 --> 00:30:54.305
But, although quantum mechanics
does not allow us to see this,

00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:59.000
this electron distribution does
fluctuate.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.908
And, at some momentary time,
it could be that the electron

00:31:03.908 --> 00:31:08.988
distribution here is a little
bit larger on one side of this

00:31:08.988 --> 00:31:12.174
argon.
And then the argon nucleus here

00:31:12.174 --> 00:31:16.825
is a little bit deshielded,
so we kind of have a charge

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:19.580
shift here, positive here,
minus.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.422
When we do that,
this is a dipole.

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:25.263
We have separated charge in
space.

00:31:25.263 --> 00:31:30.000
That is what a definition of a
dipole is.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.769
And then, of course,
if there is another argon atom

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:40.500
around, well,
this dipole then is going to

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.384
induce the charge distribution
around another argon,

00:31:46.384 --> 00:31:51.000
so that now,
the positive end is going to

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.807
attract or distort the electron
distribution around argon in

00:31:57.807 --> 00:32:02.761
this way.
And this will be the positive

00:32:02.761 --> 00:32:04.857
end.
And so, we have an

00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:09.333
instantaneous dipole which has
induced a dipole,

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:14.285
an instantaneous dipole,
in a neighboring argon atom.

00:32:14.285 --> 00:32:20.000
Now we have these two dipoles
together, and they are oriented

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.571
in opposite directions.
And that is an attractive

00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:27.714
interaction.
The next result is an

00:32:27.714 --> 00:32:32.142
attraction.
And, of course,

00:32:32.142 --> 00:32:38.428
we call that an induced
dipole-induced dipole

00:32:38.428 --> 00:32:42.714
interaction.
We also call that,

00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:49.000
sometimes, the London
dispersion force.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
This is not a permanent dipole.
This is a momentary dipole.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.206
This is an instantaneous
dipole, which induces,

00:33:06.206 --> 00:33:11.601
then, an instantaneous dipole
in the neighboring molecule or

00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:13.705
the atom.
The result is,

00:33:13.705 --> 00:33:18.825
because you have these two
dipoles now, align in opposite

00:33:18.825 --> 00:33:22.117
directions, a lowering of the
energy.

00:33:22.117 --> 00:33:26.415
There is a net attraction.
That is a reason why,

00:33:26.415 --> 00:33:33.000
in this nitrogen and oxygen,
there might be some attraction.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.155
The nitrogen may,
in fact, be deflected from its

00:33:37.155 --> 00:33:42.637
trajectory and hang around the
oxygen a little longer before it

00:33:42.637 --> 00:33:46.173
hits the wall.
Therefore, the pressure is

00:33:46.173 --> 00:33:51.390
lower than you would expect,
or the volume is lower than you

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.573
would expect,
if you were keeping the

00:33:54.573 --> 00:33:57.932
pressure constant.
And we can draw that

00:33:57.932 --> 00:34:02.000
interaction energy for two
argons.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.685
Here are two argons separated.
Argon limit,

00:34:06.685 --> 00:34:12.374
we draw the energy of
interaction, there is some net

00:34:12.374 --> 00:34:15.051
attraction.
This is zero.

00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:20.964
And that net attraction,
here, as they come closer and

00:34:20.964 --> 00:34:26.095
closer together,
is a whopping 0.996 kilojoules

00:34:26.095 --> 00:34:30.000
per mole.
Not very large.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
But there is a net attraction.
You can also see that there is

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.199
a value of r at which that
attraction is the maximum.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:46.599
And that is the equilibrium
bond length of the molecule

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:51.500
argon two.
Can you form a molecule between

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.000
inert gases?
You sure can.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And sometimes we call this a
van der Waal's dimer.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.340
You can make these molecules.
There is the bond length.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.506
In the case of argon,
that bond length is 3.8

00:35:11.506 --> 00:35:15.263
angstroms.
But the origin of that

00:35:15.263 --> 00:35:20.781
attraction is this induced
dipole-induced dipole

00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:25.477
interaction.
You can make two argon atoms

00:35:25.477 --> 00:35:32.222
stick to each other.
But now, I do want to compare

00:35:32.222 --> 00:35:39.333
this energy of interaction right
here between two argons with the

00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:45.555
energy of interaction between
two hydrogen atoms that are

00:35:45.555 --> 00:35:50.333
covalently bonded.
The energy of interaction

00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:56.222
between two hydrogen atoms that
are covalently bonded,

00:35:56.222 --> 00:36:03.867
what does that look like?
Here are the two hydrogens

00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:12.495
separated, and the bond length,
here, is 432 kilojoules per

00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:17.851
mole.
Look at how much stronger the H

00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:26.925
two bond is in the case
of a covalently bound molecule,

00:36:26.925 --> 00:36:36.000
432 as compared to the 0.996 in
the case of the argon.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.438
Look at what the equilibrium
distance is, here,

00:36:40.438 --> 00:36:45.166
in the case of H two.
It is 0.74 angstroms,

00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:49.605
compared to 3.8 angstroms in
the case of argon.

00:36:49.605 --> 00:36:54.815
This is not a covalent bond,
the induced dipole-induced

00:36:54.815 --> 00:37:01.061
dipole, but it is a bond.
But now, you might say that was

00:37:01.061 --> 00:37:06.987
not really a fair comparison
because hydrogen is much smaller

00:37:06.987 --> 00:37:11.333
than argon and,
of course, the bond length in

00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:17.061
hydrogen is going to be much
smaller than that in two argon

00:37:17.061 --> 00:37:20.716
atoms.
Therefore, if the two hydrogens

00:37:20.716 --> 00:37:26.148
are much closer together,
then the energy of interaction

00:37:26.148 --> 00:37:32.993
has got to be much stronger.
Well, to show you that isn't

00:37:32.993 --> 00:37:37.696
really the appropriate way to
think about it,

00:37:37.696 --> 00:37:42.506
look at this diagram,
here, on the side board,

00:37:42.506 --> 00:37:47.851
where what I am plotting for
you is the argon-argon

00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:51.379
interaction potential.
Here it is.

00:37:51.379 --> 00:37:55.334
It is this light kind of
reddish line,

00:37:55.334 --> 00:38:01.000
argon-argon.
Versus the chlorine-chlorine.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.232
Here is chlorine-chlorine.
Argon and chlorine are about

00:38:05.232 --> 00:38:08.602
the same mass.
They are about the same size.

00:38:08.602 --> 00:38:12.051
What do you see?
Well, you still see that the

00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:15.029
argon-argon interaction is much
weaker.

00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:17.772
You can hardly see,
in this drawing,

00:38:17.772 --> 00:38:22.083
the attractive part of the
interaction potential on this

00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:23.964
scale.
Chlorine-chlorine,

00:38:23.964 --> 00:38:26.394
on the other hand,
look at that,

00:38:26.394 --> 00:38:32.372
minus 200 kilojoules per mole.
And chlorine-chlorine is much

00:38:32.372 --> 00:38:35.480
closer in.
The equilibrium bond length,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.670
what is it?
1.9, or something like that.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.432
Whereas, we have 3.8 over here
for argon-argon.

00:38:42.432 --> 00:38:46.358
In that covalent bond between
two chlorine atoms,

00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:51.511
that is a different interaction
than this induced dipole-induced

00:38:51.511 --> 00:38:56.501
dipole where we have overlaps of
electrons, the wave functions

00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:01.000
constructively,
destructively interfering.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.441
That is different than the
induced dipole-induced dipole

00:39:07.441 --> 00:39:11.774
interaction.
Now, it turns out that we

00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:17.162
actually do have a nice
analytical form for the

00:39:17.162 --> 00:39:23.720
interaction potential due to
these induced dipole-induced

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.000
dipole interactions.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.425
Let's take a look at that.
They are sometimes called

00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:41.024
dispersion interactions.
We leave off the name London.

00:39:41.024 --> 00:39:45.363
We have a nice analytical form
for these dispersion

00:39:45.363 --> 00:39:49.181
interactions.
And the name of that analytical

00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:53.000
form is the Lennard-Jones
potential.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.526
Lennard-Jones was way ahead of
his time, a gentleman in England

00:40:06.526 --> 00:40:12.842
in the late 1800s who decided
when he got married that it was

00:40:12.842 --> 00:40:18.842
not really fair for his wife,
whose last name was Lennard,

00:40:18.842 --> 00:40:23.578
to take his name.
So, they both had hyphenated

00:40:23.578 --> 00:40:27.473
last names, Lennard-Jones.
That is Mr.

00:40:27.473 --> 00:40:32.030
Lennard-Jones.
And that potential function

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.563
looks like this.
We are going to call it capital

00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:38.195
U, LJ, Lennard-Jones.

00:40:38.195 --> 00:40:40.902
It is going to be as a function
of r.

00:40:40.902 --> 00:40:45.112
R is the distance between,
I am going to use argon as the

00:40:45.112 --> 00:40:49.548
example, the two argon atoms.
That is going to be equal to 4

00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:52.932
times epsilon,
I will explain what epsilon is,

00:40:52.932 --> 00:40:57.518
times (sigma over r) to the 12
power, I will explain was sigma

00:40:57.518 --> 00:41:00.000
is in a moment,
--

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.086
-- minus (sigma over r) to the
6 power.

00:41:07.554 --> 00:41:11.616
That is my potential form.
Now, when I plot it,

00:41:11.616 --> 00:41:16.652
it is going to look like every
other interaction potential that

00:41:16.652 --> 00:41:20.633
we have drawn here because I
cannot, on the board,

00:41:20.633 --> 00:41:24.938
draw things very accurately.
This is argon plus argon,

00:41:24.938 --> 00:41:29.000
way out here.
This is a function of r.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.807
We are going to start out at
zero, this is going to go down

00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:37.703
and then come back up.
That is the general form,

00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:42.179
and this is the actual
expression for that interaction.

00:41:42.179 --> 00:41:44.748
What are these parameters,
here?

00:41:44.748 --> 00:41:47.732
Well, the epsilon is this well
depth.

00:41:47.732 --> 00:41:52.788
It is measured from the bottom
of the well, although the argon

00:41:52.788 --> 00:41:56.187
atoms are never at the bottom of
the well.

00:41:56.187 --> 00:42:00.000
They have the zero point
energy.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.611
This epsilon,
here, is this energy,

00:42:03.611 --> 00:42:08.391
from the bottom to the
dissociated atom limit.

00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:13.597
What is this sigma?
Well, this sigma is related to

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:19.864
the equilibrium bond length.
In the Lennard-Jones potential,

00:42:19.864 --> 00:42:25.813
here, the equilibrium bond
length is equal to 1.12 sigma.

00:42:25.813 --> 00:42:31.359
That is a parameter.
To get it, you would take the

00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:36.078
derivative of the potential
function, set it equal to zero,

00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:40.553
calculate the value of r,
and that would give you a zero

00:42:40.553 --> 00:42:44.622
in that derivative.
That is a maximum or a minimum.

00:42:44.622 --> 00:42:48.608
And it will turn out to be a
minimum in this case.

00:42:48.608 --> 00:42:52.839
That is what sigma is.
What are these two components,

00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:54.955
right here?
This component,

00:42:54.955 --> 00:43:00.000
this (sigma over r) 
to the 12.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.884
What this describes are the
repulsions in this interaction.

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:13.769
It is a good description of the
core electron-core electron

00:43:13.769 --> 00:43:18.280
repulsion.
Not the repulsion due to the

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:25.046
outermost electrons in argon,
but the repulsion due to the

00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:28.726
core electrons,
the n equal one,

00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:35.521
the n equal two electrons.
And it describes the

00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:42.582
nuclear-nuclear repulsion.
It is a (one over r) to the 12

00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:47.752
dependence. If I plot that,

00:43:47.752 --> 00:43:51.913
it would look something like
this.

00:43:51.913 --> 00:43:57.839
It is repulsive everywhere.
It is what we call a

00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:04.207
short-range interaction.
And this is important.

00:44:04.207 --> 00:44:10.428
What do we mean by short-range?
Well, short-range means that it

00:44:10.428 --> 00:44:16.247
only has a value when r is small
because it is a one over r

00:44:16.247 --> 00:44:19.959
raised to the 12 power.

00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:24.274
If r is large,
and you put a large number in

00:44:24.274 --> 00:44:28.688
the denominator and raise it to
the 12 power,

00:44:28.688 --> 00:44:34.949
the result is nothing.
The result is something close

00:44:34.949 --> 00:44:38.813
to zero.
This first term is zero when r

00:44:38.813 --> 00:44:42.677
is very large.
That is why we call it a

00:44:42.677 --> 00:44:47.661
short-range interaction.
And you can see that this

00:44:47.661 --> 00:44:52.949
really starts taking on value
when r is pretty small.

00:44:52.949 --> 00:44:58.542
But then there is this part,
the (sigma over r) to the 6

00:44:58.542 --> 00:45:04.039
term. That is the attractive

00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:07.377
interactions.
If I were to plot that,

00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:11.364
it would look like that.
That is the induced

00:45:11.364 --> 00:45:14.423
dipole-induced dipole
interaction.

00:45:14.423 --> 00:45:19.337
We could actually write down
the energy of interaction

00:45:19.337 --> 00:45:24.437
between these two induced
dipoles and find out that this

00:45:24.437 --> 00:45:30.000
is a one over the r to the 6
power.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.144
We are not going to do that,
but we could do that.

00:45:34.144 --> 00:45:38.119
These are always attractive.
The sum of the two,

00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:42.771
of course, gives us the actual
shape of that interaction

00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:45.393
potential.
But this interaction,

00:45:45.393 --> 00:45:49.537
here, is longer range,
or we call it longer range.

00:45:49.537 --> 00:45:54.696
It is longer range because it
is only one over r to the 6.

00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:57.825
And so r does not have to be

00:45:57.825 --> 00:46:04.000
that small in order for this
term to make the contribution.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.967
As r has a larger power here in
the denominator,

00:46:08.967 --> 00:46:12.455
that is shorter range
interaction.

00:46:12.455 --> 00:46:17.211
As it gets a smaller power in
the denominator,

00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:20.910
that is a shorter range
interaction.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:26.512
The other thing that is
interesting and important here

00:46:26.512 --> 00:46:33.033
is this value of sigma.
And I said that r sub e was

00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:37.865
1.12 times this sigma.

00:46:37.865 --> 00:46:44.831
The value of sigma is actually
the definition of what we call a

00:46:44.831 --> 00:46:50.561
van der Waal's radius.
That is, in the case of argon

00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:55.842
here, the equilibrium bond
length is 1.12 sigma.

00:46:55.842 --> 00:47:00.000
And so, r sub e,
1.12 sigma.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.255
For argon that parameter is 3.4
angstroms.

00:47:08.255 --> 00:47:16.107
And so the bond length is 3.8
angstroms.

00:47:16.107 --> 00:47:28.389
But the van der Waal's radius
is given by this 1.12 sigma over

00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:32.617
2.
The van der Waal's radius,

00:47:32.617 --> 00:47:37.751
in this case 1.9 here,
is the radius that you use in

00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:42.181
these space filling models.
On the side wall,

00:47:42.181 --> 00:47:46.107
that top model is a space
filling model.

00:47:46.107 --> 00:47:51.442
And somehow you have to decide,
how large should those

00:47:51.442 --> 00:47:57.684
hydrogens be that are sticking
out in space that are not bonded

00:47:57.684 --> 00:48:03.117
to anything?
And the radii that are used are

00:48:03.117 --> 00:48:08.750
these van der Waal's radii,
because that is the radius at

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:14.784
which you have this attractive
interaction due to the induced

00:48:14.784 --> 00:48:20.115
dipole-induced dipole.
And that is how those sizes are

00:48:20.115 --> 00:48:21.115
determined.
