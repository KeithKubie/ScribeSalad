JUSTIN BOYAN: Hi.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.147
I'm Justin, a product
manager in Google Search.

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:05.730
In the next few
minutes, I'll show you

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.440
an easy way for event
organizers, performers, venues,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.840
and ticket sellers to promote
their events in Google Search

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.187
through the Knowledge Graph.

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:16.770
The Knowledge Graph
is Google's system

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.770
for organizing
information about millions

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.670
of well known people, places,
and things in the real world.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.510
The better we
understand these things,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.900
the better we can understand
what web pages are really

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
talking about, and what users
are really searching for.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.930
The information in
the Knowledge Graph

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.750
comes from lots of
sources, like Wikipedia,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.530
Google Maps, the
FDA for drug data,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.262
Music Brains for
album data, and so on.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:43.720
But in the case of
events, we think

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.900
the best source of
event information

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.070
is the event
organizers themselves.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.240
For example, when people ask
about Keith Urban's upcoming

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.190
concert dates, we'd like to give
them an authoritative answer

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.825
from Keith himself or
from his official website.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.450
Likewise, when people
search for what's

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.920
going on at a local
venue-- whether that's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.880
a music club, a stadium, a
theater, or the local library--

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.070
we think that venue's website
is the best source of answers.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.000
So that's the basis
for our new approach

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.920
to events in Google Search.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.880
We're asking event organizers to
take charge of their own events

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.160
in the Knowledge Graph by
adding structured data markup

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.460
to their official websites.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.780
Google can then read this
markup as it crawls the web,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.410
add it to the knowledge graph,
and show it to users in search.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.910
So I'm going to
show you how easy it

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.030
is to add that markup thanks
to the new JSON-LD format.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.130
But before I get to
the technical details,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.870
let's take a quick peek at one
way events from the knowledge

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.760
graphs show up in search.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.140
We'll start with a song
someone told me about.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.896
It's called "Alligator Strut."

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.650
All right.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.860
Going to Google that song.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
And I learn it's
by Anton Schwartz.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.530
Hmm, who's he?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.370
All right, he's a saxophonist.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.380
He's got a few albums out.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.850
He's well educated.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120
And he's got upcoming events.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.080
Let's take a look at those.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.550
All right, here's a
nice rich list of events

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.470
that I can swipe through.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.950
I can discover one near me.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.850
When I click on it, I get
more details, including a map.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.480
And I get the ability
to click right

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.810
through to his
official website, where

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.690
I can get all the details.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.530
Let's learn about this event.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.450
Right on, with the
Boston Symphony.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.760
I'm getting a ticket.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.120
[MUSIC - ANTON SCHWARTZ,
 "ALLIGATOR STRUT"]

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.770
All right.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.960
And that's just one example of
how the Knowledge Graph helps

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.690
people discover events.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.440
In addition, the
Knowledge Graph powers

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770
event rich snippets
in search results.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.890
It powers event
listings in Google Maps.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.530
And it powers
notifications in Google Now

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.030
to automatically inform people
of interesting nearby events

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.220
and when their favorite
bands are coming to town.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.270
So again, to be eligible
for all these cool features,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.480
event organizers have to
markup their websites.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.250
We pay special attention to
data on the official websites

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.090
of touring performers-- like
musical artists and comedians--

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.670
to venues official
websites, and soon

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.800
to the official websites of
annual events like festivals

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.570
and conferences.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.920
Finally, for any event
where tickets are sold,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.220
we'll also look to the
primary ticketers official

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.850
website for ticketing details.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.710
So a request for markup on all
these websites is the same.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.720
Use the schema.org
vocabulary to label

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.160
the key properties
of each event.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.870
Schema.org is just a set
of standard property names

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.900
for structured data agreed upon
by the major search engines.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.440
When Google
processes a web page,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.650
it can recognize
schmea.org properties

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.820
in several different
markup formats,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.557
including microdata and RDFa.

00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:13.390
However, in this talk,
I'm going to tell you

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.019
about a new format, JSON-LD.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.779
Unlike the other
formats, JSON-LD

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.860
doesn't require you to
interweave your structured data

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.560
with the HTML displayed content.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.010
That makes it the most
developer friendly format yet,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.490
and Google is embracing it.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.600
All right, let's
take a closer look.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.610
Here's what JSON looks like
when embedded in a web page,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.990
in this case Keith
Urban's tour page.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
As you can see, it's just
a block of JSON data.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.060
The JSON keys highlighted
in yellow, like start date

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.130
and location, are
schema.org property names.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.330
The whole JSON block should
be wrapped in a script tag.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.640
And then you can insert
anywhere in the web page,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.180
either the head or the body.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.050
OK, let's go through some of
the interesting properties here.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.410
First, the @type.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.780
You should use the most
specific subtype of event

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.220
that applies to your event.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.070
Popular subtypes include comedy
event, festival, food event,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.900
music event, theater
event, and sports event.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.510
This helps search engines
categorize your event,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.150
and in some cases
lets you specify

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.670
extra fields relevant to that
type of event such as home team

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.280
and away team on a sports event.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.030
Next, the start date.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.960
This needs to be
in ISO 8601 format.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.684
The time is included
in the field.

00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:30.350
And it's assumed to
be in the local time

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.110
zone of the event location.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.320
If the event has a
definite ending time,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.140
you can specify that using a
separate end date property.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.640
Next, location.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.190
The value of this property
is a nested sub-object

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.770
of type place.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.630
In our experience, this type
of hierarchical data nesting

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.020
was really easy for
developers to mess up

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.160
in the microdata RDFa format.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.457
But in JSON-LD,
it's very natural.

00:05:54.457 --> 00:05:56.290
You can see that the
place sub-object should

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.890
have a name property, that's
the name of the venue,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.520
and an address property.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.000
The address can be given as
a single string, which Google

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.570
is good at picking apart, or
as a set of individual fields

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.440
in another nested sub-object
of type postal address.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.090
There's another interesting
property on the place here.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.430
Same as fiddlersgreenamp.com.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.970
This property is
designed to help

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.300
you connect your data
to the Knowledge Graph.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.940
The value of the
same as property

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.280
should be a URL
that unambiguously

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.660
indicates the items identity.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.210
For example, the venue's
Wikipedia page, Freebase page,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.540
or official homepage.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.610
In this case, the
homepage of Fiddler's

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.900
Green Amphitheater
the theaters provided

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.540
which helps Google understand
that Fiddler's Green refers

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.440
to the amphitheater
in Colorado, not

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.630
to the mythical location in the
afterlife where fiddlers fiddle

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.440
and dancers dance
for all eternity.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.960
So, moving back to the code.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.160
We're up to the event's
performer markup.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.010
Again, note the same
as link, this time

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.300
to a Wikipedia page ensuring
that Google can understand

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.290
exactly which real world artist
is performing at the event.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.910
The same as URLs,
by the way, don't

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.350
have to appear in the user
visible portion of the web

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.050
page.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.780
They're only a hint
to search engines

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.220
about how to understand
the user visible text.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.950
If there are multiple
performers at the event, great.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.840
Use the JSON array
to list all of them.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.952
Finally, the last key
property is offers.

00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:25.410
This is where
ticketing information

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.140
goes within an offer sub-object.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.830
For a ticketed event, the
key property to specify

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.010
is the URL of the web
page the user should

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.900
visit to purchase a
ticket to the event.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.370
If you specify a ticket link,
then behind the scenes Google

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.440
will also visit that
web page and try

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.680
to gather more ticketing
details from whatever

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.130
structured markup we find there.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.910
So let's look at what we might
find on the ticketers web page.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.320
The rest of the markup
should basically be the same,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.530
but on the ticket
offer, we should

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.160
expect some extra properties.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.800
The category of ticket, such
as primary or secondary,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.670
the price of admission,
the availability status,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.770
which should be set to sold
out if the event is sold out,

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.420
and the valid from
date, which specifies

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.920
when these tickets go on sale.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.400
So that's how you markup
an event using JSON-LD.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.140
Are you done?

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.582
Just one step left that every
developer knows-- testing.

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:23.040
To make sure your
markup is correct

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.380
before you deploy it
on the web, copy it

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.270
into Google's newly updated
Event Markup Tester.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.930
It provides detailed
error messages

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.500
on both syntax problems, like
a missing comma, and data

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.230
problems, like a missing
required property

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.357
or wrongly formatted date.

00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:42.190
You can also see a
summary of all the markup

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.640
we've found on your website in
the Structured Data Dashboard.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.020
That's available
in Webmaster Tools.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.740
And that's all there is to it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.451
When Google next
crawls your site,

00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.700
we'll read the marked up
events to verify that they're

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.061
consistent with what
users see on the web page

00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.060
and then import them
directly into the Knowledge

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.960
Graph for use across
Google products.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.930
For more examples
and documentation,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.430
please visit our help page
at g.co/strutureddata.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.167
And after you've got
the markup deployed--

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.000
[MUSIC - ANTON SCHWARTZ,
 "ALLIGATOR STRUT"]

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.810
Why not celebrate with
a night out on the town?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.560
Thank you.
