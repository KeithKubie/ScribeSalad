00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.200
&gt;&gt; So Spencer, now that we went through

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.340
this process and, I'd just like to hear

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.090
whether you enjoyed it, whether you think it

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.640
was useful. What are your thoughts?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.661
&gt;&gt; Well, ti was very interesting. I not only

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:16.541
learned something about computers and about how you design information systems

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.713
in UML, but I, it was interesting. I also learned something

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:25.290
interesting about the library. And things that, that I knew but

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.920
I never really, explicitly written down.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.099
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.280
&gt;&gt; Came up during the course of doing this. And I think I now

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.800
much better understand what this information system that you're

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.590
going to build for us, is really all about.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I mean, I'm very happy that you say

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.040
that, because I really believe that, you know, doing this kind

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.870
of analysis and design exercises really helps you figuring out whether

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.480
there's any issues with the requirements. So for example, you can find

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.580
out whether there's any missing information, or maybe conflicting

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.820
information. And I think that's exactly what happened today.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.120
So I'm very glad to hear that it worked for you. That you enjoyed it. I hope you

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.690
enjoyed it as well. And I strongly encourage you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.000
to do this kind of exercises for different kinds

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630
of systems. So as you can become more familiar

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.410
with analysis and design techniques. So, any final thoughts?

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.440
&gt;&gt; I look forward to receiving your delivered software.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
&gt;&gt; All right. Will do.
