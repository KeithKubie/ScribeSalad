KATHERINE MILLER:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.650
And welcome to today's Google
Developers Live session on the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.920
Udacity HTML5 Game Development
Course.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.020
My name is Katherine Miller.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
I'm a member of the Developer
Marketing Team here at Google.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.920
And I'll be your moderator
today.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.970
And I'm very excited to be
joined by four incredible

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.800
guests who are going to be
talking about this program.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.070
We have Sean Bennett, Course
Architect from Udacity.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.560
Sebastian Thrun, who is the CEO
of Udacity, as well as a

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.880
Google Fellow.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.420
We have Peter Lubbers, who is
a program manager for Chrome

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.530
Developer Relations.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.600
And Colt McAnlis, who is a
developer advocate for Chrome.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900
Little bit of background
on this course.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.280
It launched about nine days
ago and already has over

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.960
46,000 people enrolled.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.140
And to give you a little bit of
context, that's about three

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.030
times the size of the current
Stanford student body.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.620
So over the course of nine days,
three times the size of

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.280
Stanford has enrolled and
started taking a course which

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.400
is pretty incredible.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.710
So I'm really excited to be here
today to share with you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.260
and have them share with you
a little bit about how this

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.560
course came to be, as well as
the power of massively open

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.000
online courses.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.230
And so to get started, I'm going
to turn to my left and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.485
have Sean and Sebastian
introduce themselves.

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.050
And then we'll move
over to the right.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.300
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Sean,
you start.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.850
SEAN BENNETT: I'm
Sean Bennett.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.450
I started at Udacity almost
a year ago now, I think.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.930
I've been working on this course
with Colt and Peter and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.040
Calvin Hu, who isn't here today
but is probably the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.520
single person most responsible
for getting it out.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:55.268
SEAN BENNETT: Go ahead.

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:55.900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.030
And I'm Sebastian.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.100
At Google I do work like Google
self-driving cars and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.310
involved in Google Glass.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.370
Little small projects.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.950
But I really care about
changing education and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.270
bringing high quality
education to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.090
everybody in the world.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.389
And I think no better place
to start than Google.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.160
KATHERINE MILLER: Wonderful.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.715
Thank you.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:11.990
PETER LUBBERS: I'm
Peter Lubbers.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.460
I'm Program Manager at Google
in the Chrome Developer

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.280
Relations Team.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.030
Been with Google for
about a year.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.610
And prior to that, I did a
lot of HTML5 training.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.700
And been really excited just
working with this team and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.570
taking the HTML5 training to
a huge scale that we're

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.080
seeing right now.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.170
KATHERINE MILLER: And you really
live and breathe and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.504
drive HTML5, don't you?

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:35.070
PETER LUBBERS: And drive, yes.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.610
PETER LUBBERS: We have the
HTML5 license plate.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:38.500
PETER LUBBERS: And Sebastian
here has the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.677
Udacity license plate.

00:02:39.677 --> 00:02:40.671
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:41.680
PETER LUBBERS: So we
came together.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.520
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.470
Excellent.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470
COLT MCANLIS: And I'm
Colt McAnlis.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.640
I've been with Google almost
two years now.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.960
Wow.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.110
Time flies.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.130
In my previous life, I was
actually a game developer for

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.840
about 10 years, making tons of
fun stuff, as well as an

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.290
adjunct professor at Southern
Methodist University Guildhall

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.610
School of Video Game
Development.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.670
So it's really kind of nice to
be able to take all of that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940
expertise and find a
new place for it.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.322
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

00:03:02.322 --> 00:03:02.450
Excellent.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.910
Excellent.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.720
It was the--

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.070
I don't know what the word is.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.320
It's not a trifecta--
quadfecta?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.620
KATHERINE MILLER: Has come
together to make this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.390
incredible thing happen.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.050
So Sean, I'm actually going to
start and turn it over to you.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.290
So what is this?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.890
What has just launched?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.810
SEAN BENNETT: So this is our
course on HTML5 game

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.070
development.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.150
And really what it's about
is how do you take game

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.930
development principles that
we've learned over the past 20

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.450
or 30 years and port that to
building an amazing experience

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.950
on the web?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.360
And we started this--

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.990
six, nine?

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.230
PETER LUBBERS: About
six months ago.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.200
SEAN BENNETT: Six months ago?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.950
PETER LUBBERS: Somewhere
around there.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.976
COLT MCANLIS: Wow.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And I met
Colt in a cafeteria here.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.624
And he started spewing game
development stuff at me.

00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.058
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:56.280
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And
he still is.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.890
SEAN BENNETT: Yes.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.682 --> 00:03:59.880
COLT MCANLIS: It was funny too,
because Sean's eyes just

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.425
went blank.

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.855
Just like, hey, we we're
thinking about a course.

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:03.920
And they're like cool--
blah, blah, blah.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.240
And he just blanks.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.930
SEAN BENNETT: Yep.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.170
KATHERINE MILLER: And it really
goes to show you the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.510
power of connectivity at
Google cafes as well.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.660
SEAN BENNETT: It does.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.300
PETER LUBBERS: Absolutely.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.175
COLT MCANLIS: Good food
brings good times.

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:11.725
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:12.000
Excellent.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640
Well, that's really exciting.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.079
And this course has come
together on Udacity.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.930
And it really has, in many
ways, a folkloric story.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.520
When Peter came to
me and said--

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.800
I'm like, oh, I've
heard that story.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.550
So I think we'd really to hear
from the horse's mouth.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.910
So can you tell us a little bit
about how Udacity came to

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.410
be and what it really is?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.480
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I give
you the Cliff Notes.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.790
About two years ago, Peter
Norvig-- who's a director here

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.510
at Google-- and I tend to teach
this class, Artificial

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.570
Intelligence, at Stanford.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.810
And we listened to Sal Khan
talk about how his Khan

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.130
Academy reached tens of
millions of kids.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.930
And honestly, we got jealous
and inspired.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.580
So we took our class online.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.020
We sent out one email.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.950
And we got 160,000 students.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.350
And we were blown away.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.590
But more so we were blown away
by the type of students.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.700
These are people from
all trades of life.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.560
Kids as young as 11 years old.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.710
People really old.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.240
Soldiers in Afghanistan.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.980
Mothers raising kids alone.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.660
So we felt we could reach
a huge number of people.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.520
And we've taken this to a great
new level at Udacity.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.500
We've been working with a number
of companies, Google

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.210
being one of them, to really
bring to people the type of

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.540
skills that they need in the
work force to really get ready

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.240
for jobs in this space.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.750
If you look at HTML5, it's
singly the most exciting thing

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.310
happening in computer
science today.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.700
And no college teaches it.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.990
So you can't get that skill
in a university.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.735
And why don't colleges
teach it?

00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:32.840
Well, it's so new that Google
cares about it.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.260
And many other companies do.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.880
But college professors haven't
quite caught up.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.420
So we try to fill that gap.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.490
KATHERINE MILLER: That's
really incredible.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.690
And as I was chatting with
Peter yesterday, he said

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.440
there's actually a technology
tie in to how Udacity was

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.420
built, a connection
with Google.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.240
So with our audience where we're
trying to inspire them

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.580
to be using Google technology,
we'd love to hear a little bit

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.557
about the underbelly
of Udacity if

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:57.830
you'd like to share.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.010
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We would not be
alive without Google's App

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.270
Engine, without Google's
amazing expertise.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.160
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Starting a
company that basically spans

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.450
all the way from instructional
design videos, quizzing, to

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.810
learning management, which is
the kind of [? source ?] that

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.370
keeps track of your progress.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.230
To teach our portals and
[INAUDIBLE] teach us to

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.560
understand what's going on.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.880
All within a year?

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.560
It would have been completely
impossible.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.080
So now it's possible because
Google is just such an amazing

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.300
company with so many
amazing services.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.010
But specifically excited that
we're also working with Google

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.550
in my home country on educating
the world and

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.855
bringing that content.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:33.070
KATHERINE MILLER:
That's amazing.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.970
And Peter, now, the other
side of that.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.230
You had this amazing idea for
a course and needed to bring

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.436
that to life.

00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:40.960
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960
When I joined Google,
I'd come from a

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.840
background of HTML5 training.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.820
But this was instructor-led,
fly to some other country,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.860
teach 10 people for two days.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.590
And when I joined Google, one
of, of course, the main things

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.260
is we do things at
a large scale.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.327
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:04.150
PETER LUBBERS: So it was like,
how do you scale that up to--

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.240
SEBASTIAN THRUN: 40 people.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.810
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.060
PETER LUBBERS: How do
you double that?

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.650
And so the other thing at
Google, we're very interested

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.490
always in metrics.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.150
And so one of the things about
a lot of the typical classic

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.610
online learning is you don't--

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.250
people go to a page.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.090
They maybe look at a tutorial.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.830
But we can't really tell whether
they've tried it.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.050
A page view, ultimately,
is a vanity metric.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.930
You can have 100,000
page views.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.200
And nobody's learned anything.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.170
So really it was kind of great
luck to kind of run into each

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.920
other in that space.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.830
But we were really looking
at, how can we scale?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.300
And how can we get
deeper metrics?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.590
And now we can see who's
done a certain video.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.660
But right after the videos--
and we'll talk a little bit

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.620
more about it later--

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.920
you get a challenge.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.710
And you actually have
to do some coding.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.250
And so with that in mind,
you really have--

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.180
we can see, hey, everyone was
able to pass this challenge.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.210
But this one is really bad.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.464
Probably reflects bad
on us as teachers.

00:08:03.464 --> 00:08:04.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:08.523
PETER LUBBERS: But the deeper
metrics, the scale, it's a

00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:09.910
match made in heaven.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.440
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.730
That's really incredible.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.990
And it's, in many ways, kind of
the philosophy of Google in

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.740
terms of trying new things,
building new things, getting

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.610
it out there.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.830
Maybe having an amazing
moment.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.390
Maybe having an oops moment.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.442
And just kind of, what can
we learn from this?

00:08:23.442 --> 00:08:24.306
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.540
KATHERINE MILLER: From a
pedagogical perspective for

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.980
teachers to have that instant
feedback is really powerful.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.120
Is really powerful.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.870
So Sean, a question for you.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.179
And maybe for Colt as well.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.340
You talked a little bit about
the importance of it being an

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.530
HTML5 course.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.890
And really that this is
something that's so new and

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.760
innovative that it just
hasn't seeped into

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.990
standard curricula yet.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.536
But why games?

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:56.590
SEAN BENNETT: I just wanted to
teach a game development

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.340
course, honestly.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.472
KATHERINE MILLER: Fair enough.

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:02.891
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:04.900
SEAN BENNETT: It's actually--

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.220
I think I proposed this
to you about seven or

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.200
eight months ago.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.520
And I was just talking about,
you know, it'd be really cool

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.230
to teach an HTML5 course.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.565
And so we were trying to think
of motivating examples.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:18.890
And we're like, well, let's
build some games.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.300
And then we got in contact
with Peter and Colt.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.620
And it's like, well, how do we
go about building games?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.740
I mean, we're not
game developers.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.140
We don't know how this works.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:29.660
COLT MCANLIS: You've got one.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:31.444 --> 00:09:32.740
SEAN BENNETT: And more
importantly, how

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.400
do you teach it?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.880
And I think one of the big
things here that we've learned

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.200
is that it's really important
to have code that you're

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.320
teaching around a project
that you're building.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.650
A lot of our teaching is built
around, OK, they're going to

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.030
build this entire section
of the code base.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.640
And they're going to understand
how it works at a

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.410
deep level.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.730
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.420
COLT MCANLIS: Growing up, I
had to teach myself how to

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.210
write video games.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.340
This has been a passion of mine
since I was 12 years old.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.400
I'm not gonna say how
old I am now.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.090
But anyhow.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.300
And early on--

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.190
imagine how much curriculum
you find now for

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.490
making video games.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.610
It's in a lot of places.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.310
Back then it was not.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:14.100
And all through that sort of
toil coming up to becoming a

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.270
professional in the industry,
I always remembered, man, I

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.900
wish I could give something
back, which is why I got

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.960
involved with education
at SMU.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.080
And one of the things that
always bothered me about

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.210
having something more standard
like that is that it's so slow

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:25.910
to turn around.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.275
And that's why I love
getting involved

00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:28.590
with the Udacity stuff.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.130
We were able to take from
concept to first bits on the

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.730
screen in six months a full
course that's touching almost

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.270
50,000 users across the world
with a brand new technology

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.560
that everyone wants to know
and everyone wants to be a

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.660
part of that's literally on
the cutting edge of game

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.810
development.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.870
Day-to-day, we get emails and
comments and people coming to

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.720
us asking about, how do we
make great HTML5 games?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.590
And the fact that we have
a solution for that and

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.370
education for these people,
it's really--

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.335
it's mind blowing.

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:02.440
KATHERINE MILLER: And it really
seems, as well, that

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.150
the games is many ways the
mechanism that they're using

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.120
to learn the HTML5.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.850
So it can in many ways serve
both of those purposes, both

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.530
creating something cutting edge
but actually creating

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.420
cutting edge games.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.135
So it has kind of those
dual purposes.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.170
PETER LUBBERS: I think one
additional thing to add to

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.500
that is the games tend to push
the boundaries of what's

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.980
possible on any platform.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.820
That's true for desktop
applications or anything.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.032
They demand so much
from the platform.

00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:35.280
And it's a great way-- if it
works for games, then it will

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.090
probably work for--

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.794
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.794 --> 00:11:39.490
PETER LUBBERS: Less
intense sites.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.960
And just to add to that as well,
this course is built

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.705
around an actual
existing game.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.450
And so it's a full-blown game
that Colt actually worked on

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.640
for months with a small team.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.190
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.690
That's actually worth
pointing out.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.400
So having almost 10 years in
game development background,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.250
the first thing what I did
when I came to Google was

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.310
said, hey, HTML5
is a big thing.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.213
Let's actually take game
developers' view and apply it

00:12:04.213 --> 00:12:05.220
to the technology.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.380
Until that time, we'd heard a
lot of web developers trying

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.920
to make games.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.280
And of course, they're coming
to that skill set from a

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.630
completely different
viewpoint.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.990
So we actually got two or
three other [? x ?]

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.520
[? game ?] developers who
are working at Google.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.830
And we sat down for about 120
days and said, let's make a

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.900
game in HTML5.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.720
Let's take our viewpoint
and how we do it.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.542
And that's where the GRITS
game came from.

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:28.850
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And
it's actually

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.780
funny because I view--

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.960
this is a course so
close to my heart.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.820
I think all of education
should be games.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.350
And being educated should be a
gaming experience where you do

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.980
something and you get
to the next level.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.890
And before in Angry Birds,
you learn how to operate

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.780
slingshots.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.860
And now you can play the game
of how to learn how

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.540
to program a game.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.072
Which is really cool.

00:12:48.072 --> 00:12:49.420
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.250
That's really incredible.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.470
And Sean, what we'd love to do
now is actually turn it over

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.450
to you to show the website and
what it's actually like to

00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.150
take the course.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.850
SEAN BENNETT: Sure.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.050
We can go ahead and look
at the site right now.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.550
I've got it pulled up here.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.720
So this is the main
Udacity site.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.090
It's got a number of
courses up on here.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.600
And you can see HTML5
game development.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.420
KATHERINE MILLER: And with that,
can you actually just

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.900
use that as a chance to talk
about what type of courses you

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.765
do offer through Udacity?

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:17.570
SEAN BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:17.750
Yeah.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.430
I think the main differentiator
with our

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.770
courses at Udacity
is interaction.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.785
It's not about passive
learning at all.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:31.360
And so if we go in here to
our classroom, which the

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.910
instructor is currently
setting up.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.630
And you can see that
we come to a video.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.355
And it looks like Peter is in
the middle of a canvas unit.

00:13:38.355 --> 00:13:41.480
He hasn't finished it yet.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.610
And there's a short video.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.510
But then after that, you
immediately get taken to a

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.190
coding section where the
student has to--

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.458
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's kind
of flashing right now.

00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:51.286
SEAN BENNETT: Oh,
it's flashing?

00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:51.700
OK.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:51.770
Oh.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.030
Is it good?

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: No.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.645
SEAN BENNETT: No?

00:13:54.645 --> 00:13:54.950
OK.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.060
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's
a flashing game.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.920
SEAN BENNETT: Flashing game.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.470
It's a flashing game
apparently.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.110
COLT MCANLIS: We're
not using Flash.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.740
COLT MCANLIS: It's HTML5.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.985
I can guarantee you.

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.790
SEAN BENNETT: We're having
some technical issues.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.310
So go to the site.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.800
But like I was saying, I think
the main thing is student

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.630
interaction.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.090
That's the primary difference, I
think, that our pedagogy has

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.800
that other platforms
don't necessarily.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.540
And that's certainly
more traditional.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.671
Lecture halls do not have.

00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:22.500
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.670
I guess the wisdom here is the
only way to learn how to be a

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.280
game developer is
to write games.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.800
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.340
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So anything
else is secondary.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.580
You can have an instructor
that helps

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.670
you and assists you.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.250
But if you don't write games,
you're not going to become a

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.690
game developer.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.580
And that's what we're
tyring to do.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.380
So if you go there, you
will write games.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.850
COLT MCANLIS: And game
developers, in all of my time,

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.620
I've found that they are the
most impatient developers I've

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.000
ever worked with.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.390
COLT MCANLIS: Because they see
Angry Birds and they see

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.280
Temple Run 2.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.940
And they go, I can make that.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.940
And they want their
game in the store

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.280
in like three months.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.030
And that's what I love about the
Udacity format, is that it

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.200
literally puts them in the
driver's seat and says, learn

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.260
it by doing it.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.030
And that's the way game
developers work.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.490
We're very impatient.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.495
We want it done and we
want it done now.

00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:05.290
SEAN BENNETT: And I think
project-based education is

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.570
just very powerful for, not only
teaching you what to do,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.550
but also giving you kind of a
portfolio at the end of things

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.620
that's like, this is something
I've built

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.310
that I can point to.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.820
It's not a piece of paper
that is maybe worth

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.200
something, maybe not.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.840
It's, I've done this.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.785
And that's a really
powerful feeling.

00:15:21.785 --> 00:15:23.720
KATHERINE MILLER: And actually,
that leads in

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.290
beautifully to the next
question, which was actually

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.520
going to be not just the
pedagogy behind this game, but

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.000
really behind Udacity
as a whole.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.480
And the massive online
open courses.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.880
So I think you started to hit at
that, that there's kind of

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.570
something consistent in all of
your courses, which is kind of

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.750
being program, problem-solving
based around.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.650
That people aren't just
passively learning, but

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.540
they're actually going to be
creating something throughout

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.940
the course.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.025
Would you say that that's--

00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:55.220
SEAN BENNETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.060
Do you want to add to that?

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.580
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.880
Obviously, all my own learning
has been by trying something

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.330
and failing and then getting
up and trying it again.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.820
And I've never gotten much out
of listening to professors.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.540
Myself included.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.210
SEBASTIAN THRUN: But
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.550
Rather than thinking about like
online MOOCs as taking

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.980
the lecture and putting it
online, we think of it as

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.720
taking the exercise and
putting those online.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.200
Because those are
much more fun.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.585
And we want this kind of--

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:22.130
we almost want this
gamification

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.150
effect on our students.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.570
Like they get into a challenging
situation and it's

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.120
really hard and they spend
hours trying to solve it.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.830
But when they solve it, they
solve it themselves.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.970
And they can fall asleep
saying, wow.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.995
I did this.

00:16:32.995 --> 00:16:36.230
These are, for me, the most
powerful moments of life, when

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.070
I succeed in solving
a problem.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.985
And I think the same should
be true for our students.

00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:42.400
SEAN BENNETT: To me, it's
actually pretty similar to

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.180
puzzle design and games.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.050
Is that you have to make the
player actually figure it out.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.950
You can't tell them
how to do it.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.730
But there's a right level.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.480
You can't be too easy.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.500
It can't be too hard.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.490
It has to have that
part where, oh.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.810
Yeah.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.910
I get it now.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.552
And that's a hugely
powerful moment.

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:01.830
PETER LUBBERS: I think a lot of
people approach any sort of

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:06.119
online class, also, with what
they know from the past.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.349
So they say, oh, yeah.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.250
It's just a video.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.900
And then when they actually
look at it

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.720
they're like, oh, wow.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.980
This is actually completely
different.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.609
This may actually
be even better

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.119
than what they expected.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.230
So it's a mind shift for many
people as well to just get

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.655
into this for the first time.

00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:21.880
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.930
And I think that you did touch
upon this a little bit, the

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.580
distinction between a MOOC
environment versus it being a

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.010
more traditional environment.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.910
But especially for those of you
who have been professors,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:39.000
have you seen a shift towards
this type of instruction in

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.710
classrooms?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.190
Or do you still see that right
now, these online courses are

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.820
the place that this innovation
in pedagogy is happening?

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.360
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well, to be
fair to traditional colleges,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.090
a lot of professors
try to do this.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.260
Like if you go to humanities,
you get your homework

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.805
assignments and you spend the
in-class experience discussing

00:17:57.805 --> 00:17:59.380
it rather than lecturing.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.870
In engineering, lecturing
is the dominant mode.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.865
And it's the only way you can
manage maybe 30, 100 students.

00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:07.050
It's just the best you
can do in class.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.943
The nice thing about the online
is we can do stuff you

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:10.600
could never do in a classroom.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.990
Online can wait for you.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.660
You can watch the same
video twice.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.510
Or five times.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.490
Or 10 times.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.770
You're given as much time as it
takes to become a master.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.710
There's no December 14 final
exam comes along and if you

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.640
aren't prepared, tough luck.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.350
We give you like a
failing grade.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.900
No, no.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.760
You have another month.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.860
And just take your time.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.190
And get to the point where
you know how to do it.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.700
That's something you
just cannot do

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.600
in a physical classroom.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.702
And that's what you
get at Udacity.

00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:35.830
KATHERINE MILLER: And I think
there also, you mentioned

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.070
this, about one of your
passions is the

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.670
accessibility piece.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.100
And I was having fun with this
question beforehand, because

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:50.170
some of our guests have fears
of alien ants and zombies.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.750
And my thought is, wow.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.710
This is amazing.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.250
If they're holed up in their
houses avoiding zombies, they

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.820
could still access
this course.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.780
But I think there's probably
a deeper nugget there from

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.470
accessibility as well.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.145
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:03.170
You can do game development
even under zombie attacks.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.690
SEAN BENNETT: What else
are you going to do?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.180
COLT MCANLIS: Udacity should
definitely be part of

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.910
everyone's emergency
zombie kit.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.270
COLT MCANLIS: You can use
that, by the way.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:20.846 --> 00:19:22.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:24.610
KATHERINE MILLER: But
there is something

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.050
deeper to that as well.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.610
SEAN BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.520
Yeah.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.510
I think the most powerful
way to point

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.550
this out is that almost--

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.480
actually larger than 70% of our
student population in this

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.270
course right now is
international.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.390
They're not US students.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.470
And they're from all over.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.480
It's not a few countries here
that really stand out.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.630
It's India.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.400
It's Eastern Europe.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.970
It's everywhere.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.870
PETER LUBBERS: The
Netherlands.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.510
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.900
We have a lot of people
in the Netherlands.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.900
We actually have a number of
people in Ghana, I think.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.360
It's really, really impressive,
just how

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.990
widespread it is all
over the world.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.790
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:01.990
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.910
And if you look at it, 7 of the
10 most fastest growing

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:05.850
economies are in Africa.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.510
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.740
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's an
amazing place to be, an

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.960
amazing continent to be.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.850
And there, I think traditionally
education is

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.420
much harder to get by.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.696
And I think what's going to
happen is they're just going

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:16.540
to leapfrog us and
everybody else in

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.360
their education medium.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.020
And obviously, with an enormous
distribution of cell

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.740
phones and mobile, there's an
opportunity to really go out

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.480
and educate those people.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.300
KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.550
That's really incredible.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.360
Switching gears a little bit.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.920
So Colt, you have had the
experience of teaching at SMU

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.010
as you mentioned.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.510
And now you're teaching with
Udacity in this is much

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.650
larger, more scaled
environment.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.920
What's that experience
been like?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.050
COLT MCANLIS: It's
been fantastic to

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.690
be honest with you.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.110
Teaching at SMU was great.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.620
The fact that they have an
entire school dedicated to

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.610
game development curriculum
was fantastic.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.540
There was always a little
bit of sort of a focus

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.420
issue for me there.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.750
Because you always walk this
line about what data you're

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:05.180
serving that has to deal with
the curriculum for getting the

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.990
piece of paper at the
end of things versus

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.900
what's super relevant.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.650
And I'm still actually
in contact

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.550
with a lot of my students.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.680
During my time there I probably

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.510
had about 120 students.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.130
And they'll still send me
messages and ask me questions

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.000
and say, I'm having this
problem in my career.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.510
And that's been amazing.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.810
What we're seeing-- and the
reason for that is because

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.440
they allowed me to come to the
table and give them these

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.400
stories about game development,
and teach in a

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.640
way that fit that setup.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.740
And the great part about
Udacity is it's

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.430
like that on steroids.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.920
If you actually take our canvas
courses, you'll get

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.850
sort of our cool little nuggets
of information about

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.900
the games industry.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.770
Dangerous Dave and copyright
infringement.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.880
COLT MCANLIS: Loading times
in [? Detroit ?]

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.040
Prime.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.780
That's really just, at the
heart of it, so cool.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.355
And the fact that there's
already so many students that

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.370
are on the message boards
finding the problems, fixing

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.360
issues, answering
each other's--

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.130
don't take this the wrong way.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.810
But as an instructor, that
makes my job really easy.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:02.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.636 --> 00:22:04.910
COLT MCANLIS: When you've got
40,000 students answering each

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.460
other's questions, you
never feel alone.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:08.860
That's great.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.060
SEAN BENNETT: And there's
more to that, too.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.010
When you're answering another
student's questions, in my

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.565
experience learning how this
course works and the code base

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:19.080
and everything, you learn
more by teaching than

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.760
any other way probably.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.160
I'm not a game developer.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.740
And part of the challenge here
for me was learning how this

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.680
code actually works, how
this game works.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.640
And why it works the way it
does, I think is probably the

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.236
thing that took the longest.

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:37.140
COLT MCANLIS: You and Calvin
had the hardest job.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.080
Because you had to translate
all this gobbledygook in my

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.380
head and put it into
normal human speak.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.040
So hats off to these guys.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.245
They worked overtime on
being translators.

00:22:49.245 --> 00:22:50.940
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.120
One thing that I think is really
interesting from what

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.290
you've said, though--
especially the

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.430
interactivity piece--

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.220
I actually have a background
in higher education.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.370
And when this massively open
online coursework started

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:09.690
coming out, my first reaction
was, how does that work with

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.250
some of the benefits or
potential perceived strengths

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.510
of a more traditional
environment?

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.190
Kind of the infrastructure of
the student body and academic

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.470
affairs and all of those things
that can, hopefully,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.230
drive people to success.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.150
But it sounds like,
in many ways--

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.050
I think the word somebody had
mentioned was self-governing.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.480
It seems like these people
have actually created

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.480
communities that are keeping
them enrolled in the courses

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.115
and moving forward.

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.180
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We live
in the 21st century.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.520
And it's time for us to go
to the 21st century now.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.830
KATHERINE MILLER: I know.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.960
When I was studying, it was
right on the border of that

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.820
21st century.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.935
So we hadn't quite tipped the
balance in my classes yet.

00:23:47.935 --> 00:23:49.560
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I had this
painful experience.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.220
I'm trying to partially cover
curriculum with the way it's

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.640
being taught.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.205
And do some crazy great
things like just go to

00:23:55.205 --> 00:23:57.050
HTML5 and just do it.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.170
And in the class curriculum,
there's something called

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.710
factoring polynomials.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.860
It's like you take a long
polynomial and you have to

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.020
break it into pieces.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.440
And I'm a Stanford professor.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.960
I've done math all my life.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.550
And I've never ever factored a
polynomial in my entire life.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.930
And I know nobody in the planet
who would know-- anyone

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.735
who should care about factoring
polynomials.

00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:16.150
So I got together a whole bunch
of educators and said,

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.230
let's make a video on motivating
to students why

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.180
they should care about factoring
polynomials.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.110
And there's no answer.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.810
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's like, some
mathematicians wrote it

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.330
into the books a long time ago
and said this is part of it.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.220
And you'll be foregoing all
these other opportunities.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.680
I think if I had a choice and
go to a 16-year-old and

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.530
[? say ?] learn about factoring
polynomials or learn

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.950
HTML5, you should learn HTML5.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.944
Because that's so much cooler.

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.030
PETER LUBBERS: In fact,
I can attest to that.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.556
I have a 15 and a
17-year-old son.

00:24:43.556 --> 00:24:44.472
They'd agree.

00:24:44.472 --> 00:24:44.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.830
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I think there's
a lot to be done.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.610
I think everybody should be
able to be a teacher.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.340
Everybody should be able
to be a student and a

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.480
teacher at the same time.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.940
Being a teacher is the best
way to be a student.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.970
We should discover what makes
teaching go well.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.420
I just refuse to believe that a
lecture class with like 500

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.290
and kids and a professor
lecturing chemistry is the

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.960
best that society can do.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.840
It's probably the best you
could do 300 years ago.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.660
But guys, wake up.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.235
We live in the 21st century.

00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:10.560
KATHERINE MILLER: Fair enough.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.610
Fair enough.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:19.070
So with that, an interesting
thing that we are doing with

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.550
this is a little bit
of a hybrid model.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.040
There actually is an
in-person component

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.750
to this, isn't there?

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.890
SEAN BENNETT: That's right.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:25.053
Yeah.

00:25:25.053 --> 00:25:26.700
So we're trying something
new out.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.480
And really excited about it.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.750
It's basically a study group.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.270
So we are launching,
basically, a

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.470
unit or two per week.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.510
And what we figured is there's a
lot of people-- for example,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.350
I run the San Francisco
HTML5 user group--

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.300
there's a bunch of Udacity
Meetups in the Bay Area.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:54.100
And we said, why don't we get
together a nice room-- like

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.150
100 people can fit
in this room--

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.450
and do like office hours
or study group?

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.560
And so what was interesting
about that is, we will also be

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.760
live streaming that.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.690
So starting next week, on
Wednesday-- and we'll put the

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.940
link to that--

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.530
we're going to have, basically,
a series of-- well,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.310
it starts on Wednesday.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.130
But it's going to be
every Monday night.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.374
And we're going to be--

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:16.771
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:18.882
SEAN BENNETT: Well,
Presidents' Day.

00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:19.800
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.010
Yeah.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.560
Because of the holiday.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.040
So we're going to be doing this
for about eight weeks on

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.250
Monday nights.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.745
And so we'll be there--

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:30.350
Colt, Sean, myself
will be there.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.130
Maybe Sebastian will be there.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.220
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I hope so.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.220
PETER LUBBERS: And we'll
actually deal

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.750
with people's problems.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.600
So the idea is people would
take the course.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.050
They will do everything
in a unit.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.605
And then bring all their
questions to the live stream,

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:48.580
to the room.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.720
And we'll deal with
all the questions.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.240
And we'll have a Moderator
up like we had for today.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.010
So really trying to couple
that a little bit.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.760
At least for the first
eight weeks.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.560
We're not going to keep doing
that indefinitely.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.740
And of course, after that, it's
completely self-serve,

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.310
the same as everything else.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.316
But it'll be an interesting
experiment.

00:27:07.316 --> 00:27:11.230
KATHERINE MILLER: And have any
of your other courses had this

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.180
hybrid component to them?

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.440
SEAN BENNETT: The closest we've
come, I think, is Office

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.040
Hours when we originally
started, where we would just

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.790
have videos that we
would put up.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.320
Students would ask questions
in the forum.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.080
And then the most popular
questions, we would answer in

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.850
a short segment and put
them up on a more

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.860
or less weekly basis.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.450
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.860
So Peter and I had
a Google Hangout.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.130
It was also broadcast
over YouTube.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.080
And we had 12,000 students at
the same time online just

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.500
listening to their
conversation.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.910
And we picked student
questions.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.350
And we didn't pick all
12,000 obviously.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:41.570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We used a
Google Moderator to have

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.240
people brought [? up ?]

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.790
[? all these ?]

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.280
questions.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.640
And even 12,000 students don't
have 12,000 questions.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.690
They have maybe 20,
30, 50 questions.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.050
PETER LUBBERS: Well, that's
precisely the huge

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.895
benefit of the scale.

00:27:50.895 --> 00:27:52.330
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And the
interesting thing was, half

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.430
the questions were
technical and the

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.280
other half were personal.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.250
Like, what does it mean
to work at Google?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.690
What does it mean to work
in the United States?

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.180
As a German-- or
as a European--

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.780
how to get there.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.170
And it was really interesting
to see how much people

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.240
benefited from that
discussion.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.040
KATHERINE MILLER: I see.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.660
It really does seem like
they're just really

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.420
interesting, innovative ways
to be making it scalable,

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.835
accessible.

00:28:12.835 --> 00:28:16.910
And yet at the same time really
addressing the benefits

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.880
of what it is to be
in a classroom.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.750
That while the lecture format
may no longer be as relevant,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.150
there's still the benefits
of interacting with the

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.110
professor, interacting with
your fellow students.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.350
And it sounds like you've
come up with some really

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.750
interesting ways of doing that
without removing the human

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.800
element, if you will.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.310
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.490
We didn't want to just, OK.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.120
It's finished.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.850
Goodbye.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.920
We'll move on to the
next project.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.620
We want to really also
learn from--

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.560
clearly there's ways that
we can improve.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.750
And we can get a much closer
look if we keep the finger on

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.450
the pulse of what is
actually happening.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.230
COLT MCANLIS: And I was very
excited because there was a

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.840
lot of crazy game developer
stories that we had to leave

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.352
out of the course that
I now have a medium

00:28:54.352 --> 00:28:54.725
to give to the people.

00:28:54.725 --> 00:28:55.619
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:58.700
COLT MCANLIS: So if you want
more crazy developer stories,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.480
come to these study groups.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.550
SEAN BENNETT: Don't do it.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.504
Don't do it.

00:29:02.504 --> 00:29:06.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:12.390
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.330
Excellent.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.310
And with that, I'm not sure if
these are statistics that you

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.950
can share or address,
but success rates.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:24.400
So kind of x% of students enroll
and over a certain

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.120
percent of time there's
a certain

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.680
completion rate with classes.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:27.900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.680
The completion rates.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.990
They waver between
20% and, say, 8%.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.000
And they're to be taken
with a grain of salt.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.790
Because it's so easy
to enroll.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.250
You just go to the
site and enroll.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.160
And in fact, in the past, half
of all classes were taken by

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.190
people who didn't even enroll.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.960
And we didn't count them
in the statistics.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.450
But staying through
a class is effort.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.480
Learning is not easy.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.000
It's like weight loss.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.800
A lot of people sign up for
the gym and don't go.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.210
And they think they're going
to lose weight that way.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.945
And if you really want
to learn HTML5, you

00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:54.640
have to come to class.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.390
And have you participate.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.110
And that's hard.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.590
KATHERINE MILLER: It's
not just osmosis.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.860
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And these are
real, challenging classes.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:07.198
These are not watching YouTube
animated comic strips.

00:30:07.198 --> 00:30:08.430
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:13.690
So, Colt, many of the people who
are on the stream now are

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.930
maybe enrolled.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.040
Some may not.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.860
For those who haven't gotten
started yet or maybe partway

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.300
or even are considering,
why should

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.875
someone take this course?

00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:24.440
COLT MCANLIS: Ah.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.930
Great question.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:25.640
KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.150
COLT MCANLIS: So this all, in my
opinion, goes back to what

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.550
does a degree say about
your skill set?

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.760
And for game developers, any
time you've been in an

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.610
interview, the person looking
at your resume says, do you

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:38.220
have a degree?

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.520
OK.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:38.840
Check.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.130
Then you go to the interview
process.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.540
And you realize that you get
questions that have nothing to

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.610
do with your undergraduate
curriculum or anything.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.980
You actually get yjr
in-the-trenches questions.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.270
And that's what we've tried to
present in this course, is

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:55.240
what does it really take
to write an HTML5 game?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.890
Not write an HTML5 app
or an HTML5 webpage.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.940
Write a game leveraging the
power of HTML5 technologies.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.980
And so the students that are
in this class, if you're

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.090
interested in writing games
and you want to make HTML5

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.030
your primary method of choice,
this is the right place to be.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.280
Because you're going to get
that in-the-trenches

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.310
experience, that in-the-trenches
technology

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.510
that you can't find in
tutorials, you can't find in

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.710
standard academia.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.260
This is really the primary
place to get it.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.430
And Udacity's done a great
job of actually

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.070
exposing this to the users.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.610
So if you want to make
games, start here.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.750
KATHERINE MILLER: Got it.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:32.610
And Sean, there's a little bit
of an incentive built into

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.350
this as well, isn't there?

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.250
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.150
There is.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:36.810
SEBASTIAN THRUN: For
us or for them?

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:38.582 --> 00:31:39.911
KATHERINE MILLER: Everyone.

00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:40.990
SEAN BENNETT: Everyone.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.850
So, yeah.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.730
We're running a contest that
we'll be announcing and

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.990
putting a link up to where
you build your own game.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.220
And we'll be voting on them.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.430
We'll have students vote on it
and we'll also be judging

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.030
games that people make by
the end of the course.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:01.880
And the winners get some fairly
interesting prizes.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.750
Do you want talk about that?

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.570
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:03.980
Sure.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.530
So I worked on getting at least
one ticket to Google I/O

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.600
this year, which as anyone
that's been trying to get a

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.330
ticket knows, that's really,
really hard to get.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.240
COLT MCANLIS: I'm not
even sure I'm

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.040
allowed to go this year.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:16.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:18.295
PETER LUBBERS: Probably not.

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:19.200
SEAN BENNETT: That's
a good thing.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.300
PETER LUBBERS: It
was your ticket.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.070
KATHERINE MILLER: We'll
talk offline.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.895
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:32:24.895 --> 00:32:26.440
PETER LUBBERS: And
then, of course,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.820
the other grand prize--

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.870
SEAN BENNETT: And the other part
of the grand prize is a

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.140
future cameo appearance
in a Udacity course.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.790
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.140
KATHERINE MILLER: Very cool.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.460
PETER LUBBERS: Full trip
paid and everything.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.055
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:32:40.055 --> 00:32:40.830
We'll get you out here.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.113
We'll put you in a course
for a [? bit. ?]

00:32:43.113 --> 00:32:44.990
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And if
I happen to be with a

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.920
self-driving car--

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.815
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah, who knows?

00:32:46.815 --> 00:32:48.270
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Take
you for a ride.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:48.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:50.160
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's
really cool.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.830
SEAN BENNETT: But the thing I
like about this contest is

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.110
it's not actually about
completing the course.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.030
That's not the goal.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.980
The goal is actually
building something.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.460
Building your own game or
building a game with a group

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.630
of your friends.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.040
And that's, I think, the power
of this course and the power

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.790
of what we can do with this.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.780
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.220
Those are the questions
that I have.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.820
Before we move over
to the moderated

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.360
questions, any final comments?

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.282
Have I hit them all?

00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:20.638
PETER LUBBERS: I think so.

00:33:20.638 --> 00:33:21.540
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.860
Well, we've had a very, very
active Q&amp;A board going on.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.450
So I'm really excited to
jump right into those.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.490
So that the first one that
we have is for Colt.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.190
And the question is, is a game
like the one we are building

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.280
during the course--

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.140
one that uses canvas
and Box2D--

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.520
is it portable to a native
mobile app using PhoneGap or

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.460
similar technologies?

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.300
COLT MCANLIS: Ah.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:46.640
Absolutely.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.790
This is one of the great things
about writing in HTML5

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.040
technology is, at its core,
it's really built to span

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.540
devices and a number
of mediums.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.300
Now, when you're using PhoneGap
or sort of web view

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.240
components, you have to do
some modifications to the

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.180
source code, especially dealing
with the fact that

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.140
PhoneGap doesn't have
WebSocket support.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.000
So you actually have to go get
the socket.io plug-in and

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.409
install that for PhoneGap.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.190
There's tutorials on how
to do this online.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.300
But the core principles
are there.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.310
The core principles work.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.560
The standard source
code works.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.409
Besides there's some
modifications you have to do

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.730
with the native wrappers.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.400
But other than that, that's one
of the great things about

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.270
HTML5, is the technology.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:22.100
It definitely is there.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.810
And it's definitely usable.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.540
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.310
And we'll continue
with you for the

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.344
questioning for the moment.

00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:27.994
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

00:34:27.994 --> 00:34:31.260
KATHERINE MILLER: The Udacity
HTML5 game programming course

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.780
content, will it have basic or
advanced content such as

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.000
Physics, HTML5 database,
WebSocket, additional

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.840
JavaScript libraries?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.429
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:39.900
Absolutely.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.280
So what we did when we took the
GRITS framework as a game,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.769
we actually split it into
two components.

00:34:45.769 --> 00:34:48.090
There's the server side
and the client side.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.520
And this first class is actually
just all the client

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.710
side components.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.250
Hopefully we'll get a chance to
do a server side soon, you

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.870
guys on that side
of the table.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.890
So the client side stuff
actually involves a lot of

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.040
things like canvas rendering,
physics, of course with Box2D,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.040
as well as other principles
that are needed for game

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.050
development specifically.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.480
So talking about object oriented
patterns, entity

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.580
patterns, how to load maps, how
to use editors properly,

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.660
how to actually get your
sounds playing.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.630
Really, this first class is
everything you need to do to

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.520
get pixels on the screen, sound
in your ears, and things

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.320
bumping into each other
in awkward manners.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.450
Hopefully the next course, we
can actually talk about things

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.740
like WebSocket, Node.js,
how to host things.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.820
How to actually get player
versus player environment,

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.640
real time networking, collision

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.020
detection that's all networked.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.420
There's many good things
to come out of it.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.160
KATHERINE MILLER: OK.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.600
Excellent.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.250
Thank you.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.530
Peter, this is a broader
question.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.410
Could you please post a roadmap
of web development the

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.220
way you see it?

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.200
There are endless--

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.180
SEAN BENNETT: Wow.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.630
SEAN BENNETT: Glad
you got that.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.146
KATHERINE MILLER: Maybe
this is good

00:35:55.146 --> 00:35:55.950
feedback for marketing.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.770
[? Think I'm ?] asking
you and then you.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.730
There are endless resources
for education

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.760
all over the internet.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.940
One might get lost quickly
without a guide.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.485
PETER LUBBERS: Wow.

00:36:04.485 --> 00:36:05.860
That's a great question.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.680
Yeah, so--

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.580
well, we're doing our part.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.540
I think, as Sebastian mentioned,
we're really

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.640
excited to build more.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.120
And the exact details of when
the next course and all that,

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:20.880
we don't have that yet.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.976
But we're very excited.

00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:29.340
And clearly, it's not going to
be just this course or a

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.630
series of courses on Udacity.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.550
We're actually working on a lot
of different initiatives

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.510
around this.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:39.300
Things like WebPlatform.org to
sort of have the one canonical

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.800
reference for all of the
documentation of the web.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.170
Great courses like this.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.570
There's other web development
courses.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.790
Yeah.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.500
If you follow us along,
we'll try to come

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.330
up with this roadmap.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:56.750
SEAN BENNETT: It's
a big question.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:58.676
SEAN BENNETT: That's
a big undertaking.

00:36:58.676 --> 00:36:59.510
KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.910
It is.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.000
Any additional thoughts?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.790
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I
completely agree.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:04.195
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.195 --> 00:37:05.157
PETER LUBBERS: Nice.

00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:06.510
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.240
And Sean, this is a
question for you.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.850
What do you think about using
TDD or unit testing--

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.780
actually, maybe it's a
question for Colt.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.510
Either can jump in.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.240
Using TDD or unit testing
for game developing?

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.130
I have seen you use Jasmine
at the tests.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.230
Do you have plans to introduce
this technology at the course?

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.980
SEAN BENNETT: OK.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.320
We are using--

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.660
well, we were using Jasmine.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.590
We're switching over because
there have been a number of

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.010
technical issues with some of
the grading, which we're

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.780
working on fixing.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.110
Thanks for sticking with us.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.110
SEAN BENNETT: But I would
love to do that.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:49.650
I think doing TDD or BDD is a
course, at least, in itself.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.210
So I don't think interleaving
it with this is really the

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.746
right way to do it.

00:37:53.746 --> 00:37:57.030
Colt, I leave it to you for
its bigger role in game

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.395
development.

00:37:57.395 --> 00:37:58.270
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.290
So let's put it this way.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.290
Is that debugging is sad.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.750
Testing is awesome.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.220
So it's really bad to actually
have to drill through a

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.450
million lines of code
to figure out

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:09.580
why something's broken.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.730
It's really nice when a unit
test tells you it is.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.330
That being said, it
is not done in

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.190
game development enough.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.620
Because a lot of the
game development

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.250
process is very iterative.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.680
You have to imagine that you've
got designers and

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.920
artists and programmers and
producers and business people

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.130
all pouncing on top of you to
create this amazing piece of

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.050
content that's going to
touch millions of

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.310
people across the world.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.095
And because of that, you
have to iterate.

00:38:31.095 --> 00:38:32.160
You got to be really quick.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.350
You got to put in code,
put in content.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.510
Rip it out because
it's not fun.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.940
Evaluate that feedback loop.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.790
And with that, there's not a
lot of testing done in unit

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.850
systems and automation.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.140
And that's wrong, I think.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.330
I think we should add
a lot more of that.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:43.750
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.570
What you just described is true
for Google as a company.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.180
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.660
Right.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.830
SEAN BENNETT: It actually sounds
like building a course.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:49.960
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.260
And that's why I think a lot
of it should be adopted.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.920
A lot of game developers take
the incorrect view that, hey,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920
I'm going to write this code and
put it up there and make

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.580
$1 million.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.950
And that code base is done.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.180
Well, that's incorrect.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.500
I've worked for companies that
were using code bases that

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.320
were almost 12 years old and
still did not have unit tests

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.140
anywhere in that code.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.230
So as a game developer,
learning this

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.400
is a very good strategy.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.120
Not necessarily as a game
developer, just as a good

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:12.960
software engineer.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.000
So I think there should be
more of it in game dev.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.580
If you're out there and you're
listening, definitely take

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.888
advantage of it.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:19.200
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:19.900
Good message.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:21.394 --> 00:39:24.860
KATHERINE MILLER: And you seem
really, really enthusiastic so

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.960
I'm gonna throw you
another one.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.975
COLT MCANLIS: Sweet.

00:39:26.975 --> 00:39:29.350
It's the caffeine, really.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.570
KATHERINE MILLER: Will you
also use some HTML5 game

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.090
developer framework
like Crafty.js or

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.570
LimeJS during the course?

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:41.650
I know that these are the
basics with Vanilla JS.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.110
Maybe some framework
usage could be

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.915
applied in SQL courses.

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:45.570
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.080
So our goal for this course
is to give you as much

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.550
to-the-metal processing
as possible.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.900
We don't want to teach
you how to use

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.860
someone else's framework.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.910
We want to teach you how to
write things from scratch.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.940
Because that's the difference
between teaching a man to fish

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.800
and teaching a man
how to be a fish.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.630
I think that works.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.930
COLT MCANLIS: Does that work?

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:05.380
I don't know.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.280
SEAN BENNETT: Maybe.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.540
COLT MCANLIS: So the only actual
other library we use is

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.500
Box2D.js, which is an entire
physics and collision library.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.310
And the reason we do that is
because we really didn't have

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.640
enough time to teach
you everything

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.070
about physics and collision.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.790
Besides that, we try
to keep any other

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.040
frameworks out of it.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.380
In the future, like I said, if
we do get a chance to do some

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.870
service side courses we're
gonna be talking about

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.920
Node.js, Socket.IO.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.630
Basically these tack on
components that are really

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.360
easy to drop in and provide
functionality that aren't part

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.930
of your core game development.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.280
So maybe we'll see
a little bit more

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.220
of that in the future.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.340
KATHERINE MILLER: Now a question
for you, Peter.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.690
HTML5 seems to have no solution
for protecting code.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.850
Are there any upcoming
technologies that look to

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.780
protect my code from
unauthorized use?

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.610
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.520
That's definitely one of the
classic things that people

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.020
will raise.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.670
That's like, all right, that's
a problem for my game.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.400
Of course, you have the standard
ways to obfuscate

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.020
your code and things like that
and compress and so on.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:07.610
But that remains a little bit
of a point for people.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.190
Not sure if there's a lot of
immediate things coming out in

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.080
the near future.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.740
SEAN BENNETT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.160
PETER LUBBERS: I don't think
that's changing.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.180
In a way, the beauty of a lot
of the web is that you can

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.200
view the source of it.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.340
That also has the downside
of viewing source on it.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.900
COLT MCANLIS: I've talked to a
lot of game developers about

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.400
this problem.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.490
They're very hesitant about
protecting their assets when

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.140
they move to HTML5.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.170
And there's a couple different
ways you can take it.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:37.480
First off is, you can view all
the source code for Gmail.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.340
Yet reverse engineering
Gmail is actually a

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.180
pretty daunting task.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.670
And the code that actually ships
to the client, as far as

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.310
game development is concerned,
is really just

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:46.520
the tip of the iceberg.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.400
Like if you've ever done game
development, you realize the

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.420
massive part of code and content
you generate is all on

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.560
the back end with tooling and
setting up user databases and

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.700
understanding content
creation pipelines.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.700
Compression, texture
generation.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.320
The tools involved are
monumental in scope.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.560
What the user actually
gets on the client

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.660
side is really small.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.050
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So we
need another course.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.850
A back end course.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.200
PETER LUBBERS: That's right.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:08.820
COLT MCANLIS: I like
your style.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.016
SEAN BENNETT: Or maybe
a few courses.

00:42:11.016 --> 00:42:13.890
PETER LUBBERS: But I mean,
really, what you get is

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.190
there's so much rich
interactivity now on the

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.600
client, the code that's doing
that is really not sort of the

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.750
business logic.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.420
That doesn't have to
be shipped down

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.090
to the client either.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:27.300
So, yeah.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.840
It's like Colt said.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.810
You have what you need.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.060
You're probably not going to
find a lot of secrets in there

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.672
that people don't want
to give away.

00:42:35.672 --> 00:42:37.480
KATHERINE MILLER: I see.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.700
And I think we're going to
continue speaking with you.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.670
Lots of game-oriented
questions.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.790
But others, please jump in
as you have responses.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.060
With the recent improvements
to WebRTC, do you think it

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.370
would be possible to
create multi-person

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:53.440
MMO voice chat systems?

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.850
Thoughts?

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:55.700
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.425
SEAN BENNETT: Yes.

00:42:56.425 --> 00:42:57.010
PETER LUBBERS: Yes.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.060
PETER LUBBERS: In fact, I'm
thinking it might be good for

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.710
the Udacity platform.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:08.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.957 --> 00:43:12.080
KATHERINE MILLER: The main thing
holding back web based

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.100
games in my mind is a lack
of controller support.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.080
Do you know of ways either being
considered or already

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.135
being worked on to
solve game input?

00:43:20.135 --> 00:43:20.920
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.470
SEAN BENNETT: Gamepad.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.950
COLT MCANLIS: Gamepad support
was actually added to Chrome

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.710
as of Chrome 18, I believe.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.710
This will actually support your
Xbox 360, as well as PS3

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.500
style controllers.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.200
And I do believe this was part
of the spec and actually is

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.440
inside of WebKit too.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.010
So that means you'll have
that access inside

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.670
of Firefox as well.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.730
I don't know if there's any
other controller support APIs

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:41.850
that are available there yet.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.860
I know there's some
neurocontrols that are sort of

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.640
making their way around.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.130
And also connect controls
and things like that.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.880
But I know that the spec as it
is, you do get access to

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.660
handheld controllers.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.540
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.480
So this, I think, probably
would love

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.910
comments from both sides.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.900
Can you offer a certificate or
college credit or employer

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.610
credit from Google for student
[? achievements? ?]

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.966
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:04.966 --> 00:44:07.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.300
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well, so
Udacity has gotten involved

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.120
heavily in college credit.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.770
Not at the HTML5 class because
it's not a class that's being

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.920
taught right now.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.510
But I would encourage everybody
who completes this

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.680
class and is in colleges, go
to your college and say, I

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.570
want this for credit.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:22.630
And see what happens.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.190
Because the skill you'll learn
is probably better and

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.940
stronger than most computer
science classes

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.050
I've seen in my life.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.080
And that's the way it
should be going.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.910
Employer credit.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.740
Udacity has helped students
find jobs, if you

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.330
look student profiles.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.930
We have profile pages
and so on.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.360
We have about 300 or so--

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.810
350, I think-- companies right
now look at those CVs.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.780
And they've been actually asking
for the kinds of skills

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.660
that this course gives
to students.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.360
A lot of companies go to the
web right now and need

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.250
interactive skills for
their products and so

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.100
on for their websites.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.010
And they're becoming more
and more game-like.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.870
So it's a great skill to have.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:57.815
Is there guaranteed employment?

00:44:57.815 --> 00:44:59.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.490
PETER LUBBERS: No.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.360
But I think it's definitely
shifting.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.360
In the past, it was really
resume based.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.320
And now it's much more
like, OK, so you're

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.460
a JavaScript coder.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.190
Well, where's your GitHub
repository?

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:13.330
Like how are you-- if you're
not known in the community,

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.420
then that's already
a red flag.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.490
And you can have all the resume
you want for that.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.930
So it's definitely shifting.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.700
Again, there's no guarantees.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.920
Take the class, get a job.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.650
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:28.460
I think the employer credit is
much more portfolio based,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.460
essentially.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.940
I think if you have that,
then you're going to

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.350
get employer credit.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.680
SEBASTIAN THRUN: The other
thing we've found is in

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.810
talking to employers, that the
skills that are non-obvious

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:37.740
that really make a difference.

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.790
Usually the soft communication
skills.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.430
So in every class we find these
like 10 or 20 or 30

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.130
students who are just immensely
good in helping

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.430
other students.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.050
And that's something that
employers care about.

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.420
Because no problem in real life
is ever solved with a

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:49.985
single individual.

00:45:49.985 --> 00:45:52.610
They're always solved with teams
of people that involve

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.580
multi-disciplinary business
people and legal

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.020
people and so on.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.510
So those are even [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.040
So if you're engaged in the
class, I recommend to you,

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:00.690
help others.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.010
That's actually a good thing for
yourself, for others, and

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:03.870
for employability.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.850
SEAN BENNETT: We've actually
hired a few of them.

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.746
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.746 --> 00:46:08.570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So
there you go.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.273
SEAN BENNETT: It works.

00:46:10.273 --> 00:46:11.820
SEBASTIAN THRUN: They're
awesome people.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.321
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:12.525
They're amazing.

00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:15.520
KATHERINE MILLER: It's
kind of the contest.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.920
Really, we addressed in some
of this as well in terms of

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.740
the incentive to create
something that could go into a

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:27.250
portfolio, as well as the
opportunity to guest star.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.270
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Or you
start your own company

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.980
and make the next--

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.970
KATHERINE MILLER: Exactly.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.390
SEBASTIAN THRUN: --Angry Birds,
and buy the company

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.370
that didn't want to hire you.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.300
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.770
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.616
A Udacity question here.

00:46:41.616 --> 00:46:45.360
Does Udacity also have plans to
host collaborative projects

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.140
and maybe include top
students in the

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.410
classes into those projects?

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.200
Think this can be a significant
experience for

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.940
students and may attract
more employers.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.590
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We
would love to.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.245
And I'll leave it at that.

00:46:56.245 --> 00:46:59.700
SEAN BENNETT: We have a
secondary website that's

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.840
Udacity projects.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.530
I forget what the
exact URL is.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:05.400
But where we've created for the
web development course,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.890
the basic one, where students
would host their blog or their

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.330
project that they made after the
had completed that course.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.160
And a lot of them had really
cool ideas that were just

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.650
little things that were
useful to them.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.530
It wasn't necessarily something
that they wanted to

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:22.830
build for someone else.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:24.360
They're like, now I know
how to build this.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.150
So I want to.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.870
And I'm going to.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:27.340
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.770
That site-- it wasn't
collaborative.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.520
But one student from Germany
built a search engine for

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.300
video games-- sorry, videos.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.610
And I showed it to the executive
team at YouTube and

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.180
said, look.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.445
This is how your search or
[? access ?] of YouTube videos

00:47:38.445 --> 00:47:40.230
should look like and this is
what we're doing right now.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.750
And without going into too much
detail, that specific

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.360
piece of work was just
blow away amazing.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.780
It had a way to index many
videos at the same time.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.140
You could type in a keyword
like George W. Bush.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.780
And then it would find the
mentioning of all these names

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.040
and all these videos.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.890
And then make a new
video that just

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.280
superimposed all these mentions.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.510
And it was a really
cool experience.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.770
KATHERINE MILLER: Very cool.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:08.020
Shifting back to HTML5
and games.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.370
Little of an opinion question.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.788
The good and bad parts
of HTML5 games.

00:48:12.788 --> 00:48:15.511
COLT MCANLIS: I'm gonna let
you take that one first.

00:48:15.511 --> 00:48:16.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.590
PETER LUBBERS: Well, of course
the good part, also a couple

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.850
of other questions raised
is like the portability.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.130
Just having a link to a place
and being able to

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.830
instantly play that.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.080
That's really the good part.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.410
The incredible reach
you would have.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.300
Bad part.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.880
Right now, there are certain
things, let's say we're

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.360
talking towards everything
is moving to mobile.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.640
There are certain lower level
APIs like the device access

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.330
APIs and things that are not
completely there yet.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:50.500
But it's moving very fast.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.350
Here at Google, we're working
really, really hard to make

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.020
that happen.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.050
Getting closer and
closer to that.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.170
Sometimes you see a
specification for an

00:48:59.170 --> 00:48:59.820
[INAUDIBLE] that then
needs to, of

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.980
course, be an older browser.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.470
So it takes a little longer.

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.210
But that might be a
bad part I guess.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:06.470
SEBASTIAN THRUN: The velocity
has been fast.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:07.130
It's quite amazing.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.510
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.950
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I used to think
that you had to have

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.620
lower level machine access to
do something interesting.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.584
And that's really
changing now.

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:15.230
COLT MCANLIS: And it's
getting a lot closer.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.230
And that's one of the pros and
cons I have for web game

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.670
development.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.990
Is that you can and do a lot of
amazing things with HTML5.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:26.480
But you kind of hit the top of
the limit when you try to

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.170
reach a certain experience.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.390
When you try to do more than
about 300 to 500 draws on a

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.930
canvas per frame, you actually
kind of max out, even on

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.330
desktop machines.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.890
So getting above that, getting
more of that performance, is

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.540
going to be your cap.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.840
And game developers are
constantly demanding more.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.160
So if you're kind of doing a
2D environment type game,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.210
HTML5 works really well.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.950
If you're really trying to do
something 3D and immersive,

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.740
you got to kinda go
over to WebGL.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.120
And that's got a whole
different suite of

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.550
[? performance ?]
environments.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.470
One of the other bad sides is
that because the web is

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.200
fantastic--

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.720
or Chrome specifically
is great at

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.010
actually being very secure--

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.690
we reduce your ability
to get access to

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.050
lower level file systems.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.440
Which means that we kind of get
rid of the ability that

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.940
games need to actually
cache local content.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.810
So if you actually looked at
the latest statistics, most

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.460
mobile games nowaday are
anywhere between one and four

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.110
gigs worth of content.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.644
As you see this curve start
moving towards the web, you're

00:50:17.644 --> 00:50:19.547
going to try to start
transferring four gigs through

00:50:19.547 --> 00:50:23.470
a Wi-Fi connection to someone
in a coffee shop?

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.100
This actually doesn't
work very well.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.660
And so I'm very concerned
moving forward about the

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.870
ability to decompress content,
store content, game developers

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:33.390
getting that content, first
pixel to screen.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.360
Getting rid of load bars has
been something that I've spent

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.190
a lot of my career
trying to do.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.660
And now we're seeing all of
these same problems come back

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.560
in HTML5 web development.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.040
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Do you think
there's gonna be solution for

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.140
this for HTML5?

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:48.170
That your phone just caches
vast amounts of data?

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.800
COLT MCANLIS: So there are
some solutions in flight.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.590
Things like AppCache and index
storage and file system.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.580
And I think those
are good starts.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.050
I think I AppCache actually has
a lot of problems because

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.300
it tries to obfuscate too
much from the developer.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.030
Game developers, we're used to
having control of the native

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.870
file system.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.950
And because of that, we've got
30 years of technology that

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:12.590
show us how to properly segment,
cache, flow, things

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.770
along those lines.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:17.770
Until we get that level of
control in HTML5, I think

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.820
we're going to have problems.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.860
So I hope we get
there one day.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.600
I really hope that web
developers realize that,

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.360
again, games push the limits.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.400
And if we want to make web apps
great, we should support

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.500
game development, because
that's really

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.550
where you want to be.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.190
So I think--

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.490
if you believe this too, email
your congressman or

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.370
international political
representative

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:39.070
or something else.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:39.590
SEBASTIAN THRUN: About HTML5?

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:40.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:41.720
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.370
Absolutely.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.270
Absolutely.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:45.440
KATHERINE MILLER: You could put
a platform up about the

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.130
Death Star.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.600
So--

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.710
COLT MCANLIS: There you go.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:48.040
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.540
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We have
remedial classes in math on

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.148
the web as well for
congressmen.

[LAUGHTER]

00:51:53.124 --> 00:51:57.340
KATHERINE MILLER: Just the
guests today have been

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.940
incredibly generous
with their time.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.700
Wanted to do a quick
time check.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.670
We're coming up on
about 11:30.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.070
We have some additional
questions to ask.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:07.560
If people have a little bit more
time, maybe take a couple

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.410
more questions?

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:09.240
PETER LUBBERS: Sure.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:10.250
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.500
PETER LUBBERS: Just want to
mention, we will go through--

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.980
we're not going to get
to all the questions.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.010
There's been a just
incredible amount.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.290
We will go through afterwards
and answer all of them.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:19.650
Don't worry.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:21.930
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.030
So why don't we take two or
three more questions?

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.670
That work?

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:25.305
PETER LUBBERS: Sure.

00:52:25.305 --> 00:52:25.530
Sure.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.110
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.960
I think you guys have hinted
at thoughts around this

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.450
already, but what is the chance
of a part two course or

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.310
other platform dependent
content?

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:37.570
SEAN BENNETT: So I
think everyone

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:38.630
would love to do that.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:39.360
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yep.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.190
SEAN BENNETT: I think everyone
is ready to go ahead.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.200
The question is what
more do we do?

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.760
Really, from my end,
I would love to--

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.310
like you were talking
about PhoneGap

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.630
and porting to mobile.

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:53.570
I would love to do some content
on how do you actually

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.270
port to a mobile?

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.206
Because that's a huge market.

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:58.070
I don't know.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.455
What would you guys--

00:53:00.455 --> 00:53:04.460
PETER LUBBERS: We're actively
thinking about it.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.140
We don't have any
firm plans yet.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:10.370
But really, mobile
performance.

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:11.410
The server side--

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.670
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.222
COLT MCANLIS: Really, step one
is everyone take a nap.

00:53:16.222 --> 00:53:19.340
Because a lot goes
into this course.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.330
Calvin, go to the gym.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.120
Do some rock climbing.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.760
Get some sleep.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.090
SEAN BENNETT: He climbs a lot.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.630
COLT MCANLIS: He does
climb a lot.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.970
Huge hands.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.100
One of the interesting things is
that if you guys loved this

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.240
course and you want to see more
of it, then definitely

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.740
make your voice known.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.020
Get your friends to
take the course.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.080
Let's make this a smashing
success so it's a slam dunk

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.210
that more people are interested
in it and that we

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.380
should definitely do
a second course.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.750
So email your friends,
email your family.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.180
Get your grandma to
take the course.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.170
She needs to know how
to program HTML5.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:45.480
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I have to admit
I'm actually impressed

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.650
that you guys can talk about
the second course at this

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.510
point in time after
all the pain--

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.490

[LAUGHTER]

00:53:53.595 --> 00:53:54.974
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Having a baby,
there's a certain period

00:53:54.974 --> 00:53:56.650
where you just don't want
to talk about it.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.060
And you're talking about a
second course already.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.810
I think all of Google is kind
of looking at the experience

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.340
of this one class, see how
it comes together.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.640
How good it is.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.140
What's the [? impression ?]
from the community.

emphasize for you on the

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.060
online, there's a lot of
flaws in the course.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.270
We have grading difficulties
and so on.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.080
We're redoing some videos.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.790
I got stuck in the course,
I should openly admit.

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.190
But I'm not a very
good [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.560
So send us suggestions.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.540
And be somewhat patient with us
as explore this new medium.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.830
It is going to be so much better
the next time around.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.800
And that's what we're
really shooting for.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.390
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.680
I think that's one of the most
powerful things about these

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.540
online courses, that we can
constantly iterate.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.860
If there are problems--

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.736
and people have been amazing
about pointing

00:54:36.736 --> 00:54:37.490
them out in the forums.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:38.790
They're sending the
emails about it.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:39.690
They really have.

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:41.930
And they've been mainly positive
and like, hey.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.350
We know you've got a lot on your
plate and you've got all

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:47.000
these things that you're
trying to do.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.740
I'd really like it if you added
this or changed this or

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.590
I wasn't sure what you meant
when you said this.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.310
And that's been amazing.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.360
And I think, going forward,
iterating and improving this

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.236
course is going to be
really powerful.

00:54:59.236 --> 00:55:01.680
KATHERINE MILLER:
That's great.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.080
One more quick question
before we wrap it up.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.260
And I think that this is quite
a pragmatic question.

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:09.830
I would like to know, in this
course or another, different

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.440
ways on how to monetize
a game.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.140
Which is actually something very
top of mind for work that

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.490
I'm doing within marketing,
which is not just bringing

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.260
technology and training.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.370
But what do you do with
it once you build

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:25.820
that amazing portfolio?

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.750
So any thoughts on that?

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.272
SEAN BENNETT: That's an
additional course.

00:55:30.272 --> 00:55:32.924
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:32.924 --> 00:55:34.300
COLT MCANLIS: So
I'll say this.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.060
One of the reasons I've always
loved game development is you

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.200
have to be great at everything
to be successful.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.650
You have to bring great content
with great technical

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.690
chops with great marketing and
great reach and exposure.

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:47.860
And all of these things have
to come together in this

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.080
minute little, little
potential orb.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.120
And if this potential orb
doesn't get out to the masses,

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.880
it just all fails apart.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.660
Marketing and monetization
are at the core

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.540
of every game developer.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.260
Especially since 2009 when we
saw the indie developer

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.990
explosion when smartphones came
on and when we saw the

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.510
boom of social gaming come on.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.000
Everyone wants to leave their
big company right now, start

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.640
their own company, and
do monetization.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.590
At its core, it's a very
difficult process.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.550
That being said,
there's tons--

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:23.140
probably more now than ever--
of research in this area,

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.220
documents in this area, people
specializing in this area.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.420
Understanding the tricks, the
nuances, should you use this

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:30.880
word or that word?

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.190
There is better statistics out
right now on the web about how

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.720
to monetize your game and the
things you need to do than

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.590
there are how to program
your game.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:40.530
So take that into account.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.300
And that's actually a
great suggestion.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.410
I think that's something worth
looking at moving forward.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.080
KATHERINE MILLER: OK.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:45.500
Excellent.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.420
And final question.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.365
Zombie apocalypse
or space ants?

00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.140
COLT MCANLIS: Listen.

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.400
So I, for one, welcome our
new insect overlords.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.400
May the crush the zombie hoard
under there tentacley grasps.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.350
SEAN BENNETT: The zombie hoard
will just [? overrun them. ?]

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:00.200
KATHERINE MILLER: Pete?

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.184
PETER LUBBERS: I have to
go with the zombies.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.486
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:04.490
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Zombies.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.420
SEAN BENNETT: Zombie
space ants.

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.260
COLT MCANLIS: You know what?

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:08.970
Always bringing people
together.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:09.410
SEAN BENNETT: I know.

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:10.170
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Diplomat.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:14.213 --> 00:57:14.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:14.702 --> 00:57:15.680
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.130
Well, I would just like
to give a huge

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.360
thanks to our guests.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.420
Sean Bennett.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.460
Sebastian Thrun.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.600
Peter Lubbers.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.260
And Colt McAnlis.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.610
And again, I'm Katherine Miller
from the Developer

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.260
Marketing Team.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.510
This has been a really engaging
conversation.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.330
I hope the audience enjoyed
it as much as we all did.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.360
That's all the programming
we have for today.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.440
And definitely encourage you to
continue tuning into Google

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.930
Developers Live for Office
Hours, incredible programming

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.680
on Google technologies, as well
as original inspirational

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.210
programming.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:48.832
Thank you for your time.
