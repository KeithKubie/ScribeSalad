00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.040
Hello, I’m Craig and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and today I’m going

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.800
to talk a bit more about economic policy.
Ran into the table there a little bit. Whoo!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.440
Economic policy can be dangerous.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
Specifically, we’re going to look at some
of the broad goals of economic policy and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.530
some of the things that the government does
to try to accomplish those goals.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.900
And we may even provide some examples of times
when the government DID accomplish them, so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.350
take that, skeptics. But, I have to admit,
a lot of the time the goals are just goals.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.250
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.080
So all people have goals and aspirations (except
me) and the government, since it’s made

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.660
up of people is no different. Well I do have one goal:
to punch the eagle again. And I did it. Accomplished.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.840
Well, actually the government's different
because it’s economic goals are much bigger

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.890
and more important than, say my goal of punching
the eagle again. Although I would argue my

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.070
goal is pretty important. So what are these,
goals of economic policy?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.530
The first goal is promoting stable markets.
We talked about how the government structures

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.730
the market system in the last episode,
so I probably don’t need to repeat it.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.280
At least I hope I don’t. You should’ve been
paying attention.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.490
But since nobody wants a malfunctioning market,
most of the things the government does to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.030
create a market system also work to make the
system stable and predictable.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.640
Maintaining law and order and minimizing monopolies
are examples of government actions that make

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.120
the market system stable. I didn’t know the government
maintained Law and Order – oh not the tv show, OK.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.780
One of the more interesting ways – ok interesting
to me – that the government keeps markets

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.760
predictable is through national regulations
of things like automobile fuel efficiency standards.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.060
If there were no national regulations, and
states were allowed to set the rules, then

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.280
it might be possible for car makers in Detroit
to build cars that live up to the mileage

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.290
standards in Michigan, but not in California,
and that would be anarchy.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.170
Well, maybe not anarchy exactly, but it wouldn’t
be good, and it’d make it much more difficult

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.890
for manufacturers to know what kind of cars
to make. Also, do you really want California,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.710
the state with the biggest population, making
rules for the rest of us? Of course you don’t.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.440
The second major goal of economic policy is
promoting economic prosperity. Here’s another

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.960
example of a situation where many people will tell
you that the best way for the government to promote

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.160
prosperity is to get out of the way, and they may
have a point, but the government doesn’t stop trying.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.020
So what does the government do to promote
prosperity? For one thing, it tries to keep

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.119
a positive investment climate and build
confidence in the economy.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.060
One way the federal government can accomplish
this is through regulating financial markets

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.670
through the Securities and Exchange Commission
since people won’t want to invest in the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.439
securities markets if they think the game's
fixed.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.650
Another thing the government can do, if it’s
feeling particularly Keynesian, is to spend

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.010
money on public investment in things like
highways and the internet. While not actually

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.719
built by Al Gore, it did begin with a government
program out of the Defense Department.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.840
The government also pays for research through
the National Institutes of Health and the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.349
National Science Foundation, and enhances
the workforce through education policy and

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.379
immigration policy, all of which contribute
to national prosperity.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.329
Another, and by no means the last, way that
the government can try to make the country

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.840
more prosperous is by keeping inflation low.
You can find out more about inflation from

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.349
Crash Course: Economics, but the main tool
the government uses to control inflation is

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.799
the Federal Reserve, which is so complicated
that it gets it’s own episode.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.879
A third goal of government economic policy, one
closely related to the first two, is promoting business development.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.300
Many people would probably argue that promoting
business development and promoting prosperity

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.779
are the same thing but policies aimed at helping
businesses are slightly different and more

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.889
focused than those targeting the broader goal
of promoting prosperity.

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.579
The main ways that the federal government
promotes business development are through

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.279
tariffs and subsidies. Since the Great Depression,
the U.S. has pretty much pursued a policy

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.469
of free trade, which means lowering tariffs
on most things, which by forcing them to compete

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.379
can hurt businesses, at least in the short
run.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.900
In the past, however, high tariffs allowed
American businesses to develop free from foreign

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.340
competition and this helped to make the U.S.
the most powerful industrial nation in the world!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.840
Can we use that Libertage from US History?
I think Yes!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.780
[Libertage]

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.560
Subsidies are very controversial and they
come in two forms. Grants in aid for things

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.800
like transportation – building those superhighways
again – provide an indirect subsidy to businesses

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.709
who don’t have to pay for the roads they
use to ship the goods they make.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.489
Most people don’t complain about this type of subsidy,
because they can also be looked at as a public good.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.240
Direct subsidies are another issue. These
include direct assistance to businesses through

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:53.150
the Small Business Administration and government
investment in firms like Sematech and, more

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.049
recently and more controversially, Solyndra.

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.480
Many people don’t think that the government
should be in the business of investing in

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.380
business and that these subsidies provide the
businesses that receive them with an unfair advantage.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.419
Farm subsidies are probably just as controversial.
They were put in place to help farmers during

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.539
The Great Depression, but these days, critics worry
that most of the subsidies go to corporate farms.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.449
The fourth goal of government economic policy
is to protect consumers and employees. A lot

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.620
of people will tell you that the federal government
doesn’t do much to protect employees these

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.909
days, and those people are probably right,
but in the past it certainly did.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.590
The government made unionization easier with
the National Labor Relations Act and setting

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.910
labor standards, especially overtime
rules with the Fair Labor Standards Act.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.190
Both of these were passed in the 1930s, by the way.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.440
Probably the most notable thing that the government
does to protect workers these days is set

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.409
the federal minimum wage, but since that topic
is being hotly debated as this episode is

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.960
being produced in 2015, I can’t really comment
on how it’s going to turn out.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.569
On the other hand the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration does set up regulations

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.129
to prevent workers from breathing in hazardous
fumes and protect them from other potentially

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.780
life threatening workplace conditions, and
that’s a good thing.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.949
As far as consumers are concerned, there are
thousands of regulations that protect us to

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.440
make sure that the things we buy don’t kill
or maim us. The Food and Drug Administration

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.919
makes sure that our medicines aren’t poison,
and the Department of Agriculture inspects

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.569
meat, which I think is really good a idea,
actually.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.030
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act of 1966 made cars safer, and the Consumer

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.240
Products Safety Commission helps keep lead
paint out of our toys and saves us from exploding

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.970
toasters. I like explosions as much as the
next guy, but not with breakfast.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.580
All of these goals of economic policy, promoting stable
markets, promoting economic prosperity, fostering

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.540
business development and protecting employees
and consumers are interrelated and important.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.740
I’ll leave it up to you to decide if one
is more important than the other three, because

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.240
that makes for excellent dinner conversation.
If your dinner parties are mostly about the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.229
role the government plays in our economy.
Please invite me to those dinner parties.

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.689
I’m hungry, for roast beef and political
debate.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.210
So, to shift gears a little, let’s talk
history, and how the government’s role in

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.699
regulating the economy has changed in the
last 240 years or so.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.599
So you probably remember from back when we
talked about the transition from congressional

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.020
to presidential government that began with
Teddy Roosevelt and really came into its own

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.099
with Franklin Roosevelt, that before the 20th century
the federal government didn’t really do that much.

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.060
A lot of that has to do with fiscal policy
and taxation, which we’re going to discuss

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.069
in another episode, and maybe that dinner
you’re going to invite me to, but some of

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.440
it was certainly because of the way that the Supreme
Court had interpreted the Commerce Clause

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.400
to mean that government regulation was suspect,
and by suspect, I mean generally not allowed.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.939
But by the end of the 19th century the Federal
government’s regulatory power had begun

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.659
to change, and a lot of that has to do with
one of my favorite subjects - no not Star Wars.

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.800
And no not the protection of endangered species.
(punches eagle)

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.580
I’m talking about railroads (Yeah!).
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.460
So, with the completion of the transcontinental
railroad in 1869, travel and communication across

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.300
the U.S. became much easier and it was possible
for the first time to have a national market for goods.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.280
If you raised cattle in Kansas, you could now
easily ship beef to New York or San Francisco.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.620
Railroads were, almost by definition, interstate
entities, so it was pretty clear that Congress

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.029
could regulate them. And they needed regulation
because railroads had a nasty habit of discriminatory

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.220
pricing, charging much, much more for some
shippers than for others. Something had to

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.629
be done and Congress stepped in with the Interstate
Commerce Act in 1887, which created the

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.880
Interstate Commerce Commission
to regulate railroads.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.189
The period of time around the turn of the
20th century in the U.S. is known as the Gilded

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:58.110
Age and is associated with runaway capitalism
and the creation of modern corporate structures

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.699
and industrial capitalists like Andrew Carnegie
– or Carnegie, if you will – and John

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.539
D. Rockefeller who are heroes to some and
villains to others. In response to some of

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.629
the abuses of the Gilded Age, Congress passed
its first wave of regulatory legislation.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.280
In addition to the ICC, Congress created the
Federal Trade Commission to regulate trade

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.080
and the Sherman and Clayton Acts to try to
counter the problem of monopolies. These anti-trust

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.840
laws are the basis of modern anti-trust regulation and
have been used against Standard Oil and Microsoft.

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.520
This first wave of economic regulation didn’t
have huge effects on the economy, certainly

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.180
not greater than the effects of, say World
War I. In the 1920s the federal government

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.729
returned to a more traditional laissez faire
approach, which lasted until the Great Depression

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:36.329
swept Herbert Hoover and the Republicans out
of office and Franklin Roosevelt into it.

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:40.020
And with Franklin Roosevelt came the New Deal
and the advent of what law schools sometimes

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.499
like to call the administrative and regulatory
state.

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:44.999
Thanks Thought Bubble. We’re not going to
get into details about the various laws and

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.300
regulations of the New Deal here, but luckily I think
John talked about them in Crash Course: U.S. History.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.080
John, he talks about stuff.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.830
But in general, those regulations meant that
the federal government would take an active

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.930
role in regulating certain sectors of the
economy, like agriculture and transportation.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.180
Sometimes technology played a part. There
really wasn’t a need for a Federal Aviation

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.620
Administration until there were airplanes.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.560
The next big wave of government regulation happened
in the early 1970s under, of all people, president Nixon.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.920
These new regulatory laws were different from
their New Deal predecessors in that they focused

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.550
on the economy as a whole. For example the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.210
dealt with ALL occupations, or at least most
of them, and the EPA was created to protect

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.770
the whole country’s environment.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.300
Beginning in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan,
or actually before him under Carter, the federal

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.840
government has undertaken various initiatives
to de-regulate the economy, but we already

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.720
talked about deregulation in our episode on taming
the bureaucracy so we don’t need to re-hash that here.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.599
The point to remember is that, despite attempts
at deregulation, the administrative regulatory

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:36.370
state appears to be here to stay.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.810
So why do we have an administrative regulatory
state now, even though so many people complain

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.640
about it? Part of the reason has to do with
the remarkable staying power of bureaucracies,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.320
which are harder to kill than Wolverine.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.070
Nowadays the federal government not only has
economic goals, goals like increasing prosperity

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.630
that most of us agree upon, it also has a
sense, maybe even a belief that it should

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.990
try to achieve those goals.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.320
This is a long way from the view of the federal
government that persisted through the 19th

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.210
century, one which many people say was handed
down by the framers. But times change, and

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.750
the world and the U.S. has gotten much more
complex.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.260
Economic concerns take up an increasingly
large part of our lives and many of them,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.900
especially big macroeconomic policies require
big solutions. And for many Americans, but

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.000
certainly not all of them, the best solution
we have is government.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.650
Thanks for watching. See you next time.
