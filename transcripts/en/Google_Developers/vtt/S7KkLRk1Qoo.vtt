KIM GORSUCH: Weeva is a place
to tell your stories online,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.290
together with other people.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.600
And then what we do is we
help you preserve them,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.570
so you can keep them
in a book form forever.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.570
We just finished a birthday
book for a 21-year-old boy.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.510
And I was thinking,
well, we didn't really

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.710
design this for 21-year-olds,
and we definitely

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.440
didn't design it for boys.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.530
And yet his family and
his friends came in,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.480
and they wrote these beautiful
stories-- three, four,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.430
five paragraphs long.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.040
They put in the pictures
that they loved best.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.610
They took pictures of
things that he'd made.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.030
And the book is beautiful.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.650
And he was as deeply
touched, at 21,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.060
as we've seen with our couples
who are more in their 70's.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.470
It occurred to me being
in four hospitals in a row

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.520
and watching so many
people who are critically

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.540
ill and basically by
themselves, that there

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.010
had to be a better
way for people

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.860
to provide the emotional support
that pulls people through that.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.030
And so Weeva lets you contribute
memories and stories no matter

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.850
where you are in the world, no
matter how much time you have,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.620
and no matter what
your skill level.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.710
Just write a story about what
this person means to you,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.490
and that all by itself
gives emotional support.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640
And it matters enormously.
