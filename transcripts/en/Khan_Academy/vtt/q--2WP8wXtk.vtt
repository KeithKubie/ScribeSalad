00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.815
Voiceover: Let's think a little bit about

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.092
the notion of atomic size

00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:07.744
or atomic radius in this video.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.450
At first thought, you might
think well this might be

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.719
a fairly straight-forward thing.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.585
If I'm trying to calculate the radius of

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:16.896
some type of circular object

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.928
I'm just thinking about
well what's the distance

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:21.987
between the center of that circular object

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.394
and the edge of it.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.555
So the length of this
line right over here.

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:27.331
That would be the radius.

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:30.004
And so a lot of people
when they conceptualize

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.610
an atom they imagine a positive nucleus

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.766
with the protons in the
center right over here

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.320
then they imagine the
electrons on these fixed orbits

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.399
around that nucleus

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.063
so they might imagine some electrons

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:45.225
in this orbit right over here,

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.740
just kind of orbiting around

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.562
and then there might be a few more

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:53.265
on this orbit out here orbiting around,

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:54.628
orbiting around out here.

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.365
And you might say, "well okay,
that's easy to figure out

00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:57.906
the atomic radius.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:00:59.411
I just figure out the distance

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:02.879
between the nucleus and
the outermost electron

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.025
and we could call that the radius."

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:06.704
That would work except for the fact

00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:09.986
that this is not the
right way to conceptualize

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.451
how electrons or how they move

00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:16.893
or how they are distributed
around a nucleus.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.575
Electrons are not in
orbits the way that planets

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:22.154
are in orbit around the sun

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:24.034
and we've talked about
this in previous videos.

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:25.917
They are in orbitals

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.787
which are really just
probability distributions

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.440
of where the electrons can be,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.399
but they're not that well defined.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.069
So, you might have an orbital,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.514
and I'm just showing you in 2 dimensions.

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:38.455
It would actually be in 3 dimensions,

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:39.934
where maybe there's a high probability

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:43.106
that the electrons where I'm
drawing it in kind of this

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:44.050
more shaded in green.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.708
But there's some probability
that the electrons

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.538
are in this area right over here

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:49.434
and some probability that the electrons

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:52.510
are in this area over here,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.379
and let's say even a lower
probability that the electrons

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.831
are over this, like this over here.

00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.765
And so you might say,

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.417
well at a moment the electron's there.

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:04.222
The outermost electron we'd say is there.

00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:05.656
You might say well that's the radius.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:06.385
But in the next moment,

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:08.482
there's some probability
it might be likely

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:09.395
that it ends up here.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.771
But there's some probability

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.470
that it's going to be over there.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.799
Then the radius could be there.

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.125
So electrons, these orbitals,

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.956
these diffuse probability distributions,

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:20.857
they don't have a hard edge,

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:22.939
so how can you say

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.038
what the size of an atom actually is?

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:28.621
There's several techniques
for thinking about this.

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:30.644
One technique for thinking about this

00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:35.674
is saying, okay, if you
have 2 of the same atom,

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:39.103
that are- 2 atoms of the same element

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:41.018
that are not connected to each other,

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:42.806
that are not bonded to each other,

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:45.081
that are not part of the same molecule,

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.724
and you were able to determine somehow

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:49.322
the closest that you could
get them to each other

00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:51.939
without them bonding.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.952
So, you would kind of see,

00:02:52.952 --> 00:02:55.213
what's the closest that they can,

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:57.892
they can kind of get to each other?

00:02:57.892 --> 00:02:59.203
So let's say that's one of them

00:02:59.203 --> 00:03:01.758
and then this is the
other one right over here.

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:04.980
And if you could figure out that distance,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.282
that closest, that minimum distance,

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:09.857
without some type of, you know,

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:15.140
really, I guess, strong
influence happening here,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.544
but just the minimum
distance that you might see

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:21.286
between these 2 and then
you could take half of that.

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:22.537
So that's one notion.

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:24.873
That's actually called
the Van der Waals radius.

00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:26.960
Another way is well what
about if you have 2 atoms,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.816
2 atoms of the same element

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.197
that are bonded to each other?

00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:34.295
They're bonded to each other
through a covalent bond.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.669
So a covalent bond, we've already-

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:37.859
we've seen this in the past.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.038
The most famous of covalent bonds is well,

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:46.399
a covalent bond you
essentially have 2 atoms.

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:47.484
So that's the nucleus of one.

00:03:47.484 --> 00:03:48.860
That's the nucleus of the other.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.728
And they're sharing electrons.

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:55.346
So their electron clouds actually,

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:59.307
their electron clouds actually
overlap with each other,

00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:01.187
actually overlap with each other

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:02.564
so the covalent bond,

00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:04.669
there the electrons in that bond

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.248
could spend some of
their time on this atom

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.644
and some of their time on
this atom right over here.

00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:12.958
And so when you have a
covalent bond like this,

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.038
you can then find the distance

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:17.550
between the 2 nuclei

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.670
and take half of that and call that

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.502
call that the atomic radius.

00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:24.462
So these are all different
ways of thinking about it.

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:25.923
Now, with that out of the way,

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:29.387
let's think about what
the trends for atomic size

00:04:29.387 --> 00:04:33.457
or atomic radii would be
in the periodic table.

00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.448
So the first thing to think about is

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:38.493
what do you think will be
the trend for atomic radii

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.283
as we move through a period.

00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:43.086
So let's say we're in the fourth period

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:48.505
and we were to go from
potassium to krypton.

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:50.285
What do you think is going
to be the trend here?

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:52.556
And if you want to think
about the extremes,

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:55.473
how do you think potassium
is going to compare

00:04:55.473 --> 00:04:59.236
to krypton in terms of atomic radius.

00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:00.458
I encourage you to pause this video

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:03.102
and think about that on your own.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.845
Well, when you're in the fourth period,

00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:06.821
the outermost electrons

00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:11.673
are going to be in your fourth shell.

00:05:11.673 --> 00:05:14.668
Here, you're filling out 4S1, 4S2.

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:19.212
Then you start back filling
into the 3D subshell

00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:23.060
and then you start filling
again in 4P1 and so forth.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.692
You start filling out the P subshell.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.654
So as you go from potassium to krypton,

00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:31.661
you're filling out that
outermost fourth shell.

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:33.137
Now what's going on there?

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.429
Well, when you're at potassium,

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:39.115
you have 19- 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:40.891
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:42.763
You have 19 protons

00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:44.644
and you have 19 electrons.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.921
Well I'll just draw those.

00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:47.399
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.995
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.535
but you only have 1
electron in that outermost,

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:55.237
in that fourth shell, so let's
just say that's that electron

00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:57.105
at a moment, just for visually.

00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:58.231
It doesn't necessarily have to be there

00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:00.251
but just to visualize that.

00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:02.159
So that 1 electron right over there,

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.273
you have 19, yeah, you have 19 protons.

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:09.720
So, you have some, I guess you could say

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.602
Coulom force that is attracting it,

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:13.281
that is keeping it there.

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.743
But if you go to krypton,

00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:16.665
all of a sudden you have
much more positive charge

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:19.970
in the nucleus.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.189
So you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.569
I don't have to do them all.

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.513
You have 36.

00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:26.330
You have a positive charge of 36.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.039
Let me write that, you have plus 36.

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.557
Here you have plus 19.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.207
And you have 36 electrons,

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:35.353
you have 36 electrons-

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.306
I don't know, I've lost track of it,

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:39.034
but in your outermost shell,

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:41.275
in your fourth, you're
going to have the 2S

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:42.829
and then you're going to have the 6P.

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:44.315
So you have 8 in your outermost shell.

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:49.025
So that'd be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:50.089
So one way to think about it,

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.218
if you have more positive
charge in the center,

00:06:52.218 --> 00:06:54.669
and you have more negative
charge on that outer shell,

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.504
so that's going to bring
that outer shell inward.

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:00.069
It's going to have more

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:01.559
I guess you could imagine one way,

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:04.509
more Coulomb attraction right over there.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:05.352
And because of that,

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.302
that outer most shell
is going to drawn in.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.524
Krypton is going to be smaller,

00:07:09.524 --> 00:07:13.139
is going to have a smaller
atomic radius than potassium.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.235
So the trend, as you go to the right

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.599
is that you are getting,

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.194
and the general trend I would say,

00:07:20.194 --> 00:07:21.855
is that you are getting smaller

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:23.978
as you go to the right in a period.

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:29.497
That's the reason why
the smallest atom of all,

00:07:29.497 --> 00:07:31.065
the element with the smallest atom

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.718
is not hydrogen, it's helium.

00:07:33.718 --> 00:07:36.632
Helium is actually smaller than hydrogen,

00:07:36.632 --> 00:07:37.810
depending on how you,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.032
depending on what technique
you use to measure it.

00:07:40.032 --> 00:07:42.462
That's because, if we
take the simplest case,

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:49.334
hydrogen, you have 1 proton in the nucleus

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:53.518
and then you have 1
electron in that 1S shell,

00:07:53.518 --> 00:07:56.204
and in helium you have 2,

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:58.710
2 protons in the nucleus

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.298
and I'm not drawing the neutrons

00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:01.722
and obviously there's different isotopes,

00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:03.427
different numbers of neutrons,

00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:08.047
but you have 2 electrons now
in your outer most shell.

00:08:08.047 --> 00:08:10.448
So you have more, I guess you could say,

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.487
you could have more
Coulomb attraction here.

00:08:12.487 --> 00:08:15.054
This is plus 2 and then these
2 combined are negative 2.

00:08:15.054 --> 00:08:18.624
They're going to be drawn inward.

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:20.274
So, that's the trend
as we go to the right,

00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:21.815
as we go from the left to the right

00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:23.815
of the periodic table,
we're getting smaller.

00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:25.522
Now what do you think is going to happen

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:28.351
as we go down the period table?

00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:31.854
As we go down the periodic
table in a given group?

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:35.079
Well, as we go down a group,

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:37.258
each new element down the group,

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:38.914
we're adding, we're in a new period.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:40.211
We're adding a new shell.

00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:41.958
So you're adding more
and more and more shells.

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.173
Here you have just the first shell,

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:44.660
now the second shell and each shell

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.903
is getting further and
further and further away.

00:08:46.903 --> 00:08:49.430
So as you go down the periodic table,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.407
you are getting, you are getting larger.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.746
You're having a larger atomic radius

00:08:54.746 --> 00:08:57.212
depending on how you are measuring it.

00:08:57.212 --> 00:08:58.833
So what's the general trend?

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:00.606
Well if you get larger as you go down,

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.453
that means you're getting
smaller as you go up.

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:10.562
You get smaller, smaller as you go up.

00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:12.922
So, what are going to be,

00:09:12.922 --> 00:09:15.177
what's going to be the smallest ones?

00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:17.469
Well, we've already said
helium is the smallest.

00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:19.603
So what are going to
be some of the largest?

00:09:19.603 --> 00:09:21.306
What are going to be some
of the largest atoms?

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:22.723
Well that's going to be the atoms

00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:24.305
down here at the bottom left.

00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:25.371
So, these are going to be large,

00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.754
these are going to be small.

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:31.141
So, large over here, small over here

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.010
and the general trend,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.819
as you go from the bottom
left to the top right

00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:38.357
you are getting, you are getting smaller.
