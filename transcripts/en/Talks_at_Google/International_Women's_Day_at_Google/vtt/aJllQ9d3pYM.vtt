00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.100
&gt;&gt;Leslie: Thank you everybody for coming today.
This is obviously the latest in our electoral

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.280
series of candidate visits.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.640
I am honored to have Kamala Harris here with
us. She is running for State Attorney General.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.270
She is San Francisco's District Attorney and
has held that office since 2003.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.860
Prior to that she worked in San Francisco
both for the City and District Attorney's

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.500
Office, as well as Alameda.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.790
She is the Democratic nominee and after a
hard fought campaign with-with a number of

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.020
folks it's nice to see her here. And we are
going to have Steve Cooley on campus next

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.080
week. We wanna make sure that we are fair
to both sides.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.240
And I just wanna say really quick before I
pass this over to David.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.990
For some of you who may wonder does-does the
AG in California matter or impact our work.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:04.680
And yes, the AG does. So when you think of
topics: anti-trust; piracy; privacy; patents;

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.950
we are always involved in interacting with
the AG and it's my hope that our next AG will

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.299
actually become a very strong ambassador to
the Attorneys General in a number of other

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.600
states. It's something where we have growing
relationships there, but to have our home

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.710
state AG speak on the industry's behalf will
be very important to us.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.030
And with that I pass it over to David.
&gt;&gt;David: Well thanks Leslie. And thanks everybody

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.389
for coming. I'm really, really honored to-to
have Kamala Harris here at-at-at Google. She's

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:43.840
someone I've known for some time and is one
of our-our State's really fabulous public

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.610
servants and officials.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.689
And so we're, we really wanna get a chance
to let her share her vision about the State,

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.420
the race that she's currently in and to give,
I've got a few questions and I'll-I'll try

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.729
to do my Charlie Rose routine here --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.570
&gt;&gt;David: but we really wanna hear from you
guys

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.719
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: too, so-so why don't we just kick

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.760
it off.
Fir, you're a native Californian. You're-you're

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.360
running for Attorney General. Some people
might see the Attorney General's Office as

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.210
 -- well it's that lawyer thing.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Uh-hum.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.160
&gt;&gt;David: But it-it really is an important
position, right and has remarkable influence

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.670
on what-what goes on in our State. So I-I
wanted to ask you first off, why are you running?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.260
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs] 'Cause I wanna do
the job.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.710
&gt;&gt;David: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I actually really wanna do

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.050
the job.
And why I'm running, another part of the answer

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.550
is-is the same reason that I became a prosecutor.
&gt;&gt;David: Um.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.310
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I'm one of two daughters
of parents who met when they were graduate

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.180
students at the University of California Berkeley
in the 1960's.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.510
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.350
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Not your peers. And-and they
met when they were actively involved in the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.940
Civil Rights Movement.
So that meant that my sister and I grew up

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
pretty much surrounded by adults who spent
full-time marching and shouting about this

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.340
thing we call justice. And growing up in that
environment, the heroes for me were the architects

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.320
of the Civil Rights Movement. And-and they
were the lawyers.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.900
So it was Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood
Marshall and Constance Baker Motley who were

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.930
taking the skill of this great profession
of law and translating the passion from the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.840
street to the courtrooms of our country.
And reminding the people, who unfortunately

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.770
needed to be reminded, of that great promise
we articulated in 1776, which is that we are

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.310
all and should be treated and seen as equals.
So I decided I wanted to be a lawyer at a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.310
very young age. Went to Howard University
and then I came back home to San Francisco

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.460
and attended UC Hastings. And out of law school
I made the decision to become a prosecutor.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.750
And you can imagine if you any sense of who
my family is that that was a --

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.750
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Yeah,
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: curious decision. [laughs]

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.630
&gt;&gt;David: exactly.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: In some ways I had to defend

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.630
 --
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.230
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: the decision like one would
a thesis.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.270
But what I said then is what I absolutely
maintain today after a career as a prosecutor

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.890
which is that law enforcement has such a profound
and direct impact on the most vulnerable among

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.230
us, and has as its responsibility, as its
job, to be a voice for the voiceless. And

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.040
in the process of giving voice also give dignity.
And so that's the work that I decided I wanted

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040
to do.
&gt;&gt;David: Uh-hum.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.420
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And-and I have prosecuted
many cases. From the ground up I've been in-in

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.730
many courtrooms talking with juries about
why in a civil and-and just society, there

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.670
will be severe and swift consequences when
one human being kills another human being

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.660
or if a woman is raped or a child is molested.
And talking about why that work is important

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.720
if we are going to be committed to justice,
which is the work of defending and being a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.670
voice for our most vulnerable.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.480
So-so again this is-this, you're running for
a really important position --

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.550
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes.
&gt;&gt;David: in our, in our State so why don't

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.920
you tell us a little bit about what you think
are California's biggest challenges --

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.370
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Sure.
&gt;&gt;David: and biggest opportunities right now?

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.850
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Sure. The general point that
I'd make about our challenges is that I think

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:17.500
for-for too long we in government and in public
offices have-have not embraced what you have

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.660
embraced which is the importance of innovation.
You know if you look at any elected who's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.760
up for reelection, they will not take a political
knock for doing things the way they've always

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.650
been done. "Good for you Bob, you're doing
things the way they've always been done."

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.100
To engage in innovation in a position such
as mine means to engage in what you all do

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.780
which is by definition to bring to bear some
new idea or method or device.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.410
Well what we all know about that process is
that when one is engaged in innovation, no

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.540
matter how well thought out, well planned,
well conceived your idea may be, when you

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.740
roll it out for the first time there will
probably be a glitch.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.630
But when you hold a position such as mine,
you will read about that glitch on the front

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.250
page of the newspaper, which means that when
you hold these positions there is a great

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:23.060
assumption of risk to take on innovation.
And unless you have the courage combined hopefully

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.050
with some political capital there are seemingly
few rewards for engaging in innovation, which

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.270
is, which is really unfortunate.
My mother was a scientist. There is this wonderful

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.230
word that has a great meaning and it's called
"hypothesis", [laughs] which means that you

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.030
have an idea and then it is well accepted,
it will be tested --

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.060
&gt;&gt;David: Uh-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and then you will learn whether

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.180
it was correct or not but there will be no
pride associated with the hypothesis because

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.510
after all it was a hypothesis [laughs] --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.580
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and then you will reconvene
and then create a new hypothesis.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.160
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: But in government --

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.840
&gt;&gt;David: We like to call it iteration --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: in law enforcement --

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.100
&gt;&gt;David: at Google.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right, right exactly. Right.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.900
&gt;&gt;David: It's how we operate.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: But in-in government you

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.010
know when you have that idea you better stick
with it and defend it at all cost. And there

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:23.220
is also part of the culture that suggests
that you are doing a good job if you are strictly

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:30.460
adhering to tradition as opposed to measuring
effectiveness with the infusion of metrics

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.820
to look at whether we are actually producing
what we all have the desire will be produced.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.439
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So if I can just keep going

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.439
 -
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah, no, please, please. No this

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.720
is great.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: An example of-of-of-of what

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:51.509
I am talking about in practice is in California
on an annual basis, we release 120,000 prisoners

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:56.740
because they have served their time. Within
three years of their release, 70 percent reoffend.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.330
The word for that is recidivism. Seventy percent
recidivate. It's the highest recidivism rate

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.310
in the country.
So I think what is obvious about this is that

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:12.410
anything with a seven out of ten failure rate
is demanding some reconfiguration.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:18.220
But the other point is that it is extremely
expensive this failure. In terms of what it

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.220
is costing us in a state that is on the verge
of bankruptcy, it's a $10 billon dollar slice

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:28.610
in the annual budget. It is also extremely
expensive in terms of what it is costing our

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.959
public safety.
So knowing that, I decided to create a re-entry

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.860
unit in my office which is one of the only
re-entry units of a DA's office; and decided

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:44.190
to focus on the 18 through 24 year old, first
time, low level, non-violent drug sales offender;

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.060
called it "The Initiative Back on Track".
Why that population? Well, when I was at Howard

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.920
University when we were all in college, we
were 18 through 24, and we were called "college

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.180
kids".
But when you're 18 and you turn 18 and you're

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.150
in the system, you are considered an adult.
Period. Regardless of the fact that is the

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:11.750
very phase of life in which we have invested
billions of dollars in this world in those

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.440
places called colleges and universities, knowing
that as the prime phase of life, during which

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.730
we mold and shape and direct a human being
to become a productive adult.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.950
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So what I did is I called

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.200
up a bunch of friends in the business community,
the Chamber of Commerce, I called up other

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.160
folks in the building trades unions, and called
up some of our faith based and community non-profits.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.320
And we addressed the fact that in this population
which is a very large population in the criminal

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.100
justice system, a lot of them needed to get
a GED and be enrolled in city college. Almost

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.160
none of them have employable skills. So we
enrolled them in the apprenticeship programs

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.491
offered by the carpenters and the plumbers.
And David, I'm gonna ask you if you --

00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:48.590
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: can create an apprenticeship

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.170
program for [ ]too.
&gt;David: Right. [chuckles]

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:55.330
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: We-we-we dealt with the fact
that they also many of them are parents who

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.750
have a natural desire to parent their children,
but not necessarily the skills. So we brought

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.350
on board community based folks to work on
that.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.990
Over the course of the last five years this
Initiative Back on Track has reduced the re-offense

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.870
rate for this population from 54 percent to
less than 10 percent.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.140
It's been so successful that the National
DA's Association and the United States Department

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.170
of Justice have designated it as a model of
innovation for law enforcement in the United

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.740
States.
But there are risks associated with that.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.470
&gt;&gt;David: Sure.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I will tell you it was on

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.850
the front page of a newspaper when one of
the offenders a couple years into the program

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.590
went out and committed a horrendous crime.
And he happened to also be an undocumented

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.590
immigrant.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.590
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.010
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so then someone wrote
an article and said, "Kamala Harris has created

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.680
a program to shield undocumented immigrants."

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.220
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right? These are the risks
one --

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.220
&gt;&gt;David: Sure.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.450
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: assumes when they do something
differently in government.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.529
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: But I think that we are at

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:56.690
a place in time and especially in this great
state where we cannot afford to do business

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.200
the way it has been done. We cannot afford
to maintain status quo because we are really

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.209
looking at a lot of broken systems and this
is where the culture of Google --

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:07.100
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and-and the work that you

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.740
all do is so very important and has to be
shared with a, with a much bigger audience

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.231
and in particular with people who hold offices
like mine. Which is that the best way that

00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:19.240
you become excellent --
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.330
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and-and create models and
improve the lives of people is when you are

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:32.970
willing to invest in innovation and-and encourage
a standard of business that is not based on

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.279
an adherence to tradition, --
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:36.420
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: but instead based on what
is your reason for being.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.160
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Right.
Well in some, in some of your answers, you

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.990
were touching on some of the-the themes of-of
your book that --

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.660
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes.
&gt;&gt;David: that-that came out last year, "Smart

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.810
on Crime". And can you expand a little bit
more on-on some of this? I mean your-your

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.060
,one of your basic points was that law enforcement
is not the only answer --

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.361
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Correct.
&gt;&gt;David: to reducing crime. Can you talk a

00:11:55.361 --> 00:12:00.220
little bit more-more about that?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So the public health model

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:06.110
is a tested, try and true model. That tells
us about a health epidemic. What I think we

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.430
should think about when we think about a crime
epidemic.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.560
Public health model tells us this: health
epidemic; best way to deal with it, prevention.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:24.650
If the sniffles take hold, early intervention,
but if we're at the point of dealing with

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.029
it in the emergency room, it's too late and
it's too expensive.

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:29.310
So too for criminal justice policy.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:35.560
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: We have to recognize that
we have been I think misguided for a long

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:42.400
time in terms of how we categorize one's criminal
justice policy perspective. We have suggested

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.500
there are only two. You are either tough on
crime or you're soft on crime. Instead of

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.240
asking, "Are we smart on crime?" Thus, the
title of my book.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.980
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Which means let us recognize

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.720
absolutely, let's react with certainty and
swiftly after a crime has occurred. I've raised

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.000
the conviction rates in my office to the highest
they've been in 15 years, in particular for

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.630
serious and violent crime. I have personally
prosecuted homicide cases. I am all about

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:15.149
lockin' up somebody who rapes a woman, molests
a child, or murders a human being.

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:22.530
That being said, I took an oath to be concerned
about public safety and your safety. And if

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:28.980
I'm gonna be most effective that way, I cannot
be limited to reacting after a crime occurs.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.860
We must also be equally invested with the
equal amount of passion in preventing a crime

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:40.200
before it occurs. But status quo has suggested
that the way that one is effective in these

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.459
positions is to talk tough.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:47.960
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Talk tough around reacting
and then if you talk about other issues that's

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.360
soft.
Well I would suggest to you that's misguided

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.240
and incorrect. So the book I wrote divides
it into, they're two halves. And-and so the

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.670
first half I have several chapters that address
which I believe are myths about the criminal

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.860
justice system that have impeded better and
smarter criminal justice policy.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.970
In the second half of the book I talk about
best practices from around the country.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:18.450
So an example of a myth. It's a, the, a myth,
children are resilient.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:24.610
So we have public policy that has been built
up around the idea that whatever happens to

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:30.250
a child, they'll grow out of it. Or-or look
at little Johnny&gt; He's playing in the playground;

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.040
he's fine. Instead of recognizing that whatever
especially traumatic event happens to a child

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040
 --
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.760
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: will ever be imprinted in
the life of that person if we don't take seriously

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.700
what is happening with that child when they
are a child.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.810
But you see we have marginalized issues that
impact children. We have decided I guess because

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.270
they're small people, those are small issues.
Or we have decided that's something women

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.980
care about or parents care about or people
who care about cute, cuddly things care about.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:05.170
Instead of recognizing it is smarter, it is
more effective, and it is cheaper to address

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.709
an issue that impacts a child while they are
a child than to wait until they become the

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:14.850
adult who everyone's knocking on my door about.
When what happened when they were six would

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.560
have absolutely predicted what they're doing
when they're 16.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.870
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So an example of that is

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.060
an initiative that I started, I'm just just
goin' --

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.310
&gt;&gt;David: No, no. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.950
&gt;&gt;David: I'm gonna stop you in a minute.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs] Okay.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.709
An example of this is I did an assessment
of who the homicide victims were in San Francisco

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:37.040
who are under the age of 25 when they were
killed. 'Cause we had a rash of homicides

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.110
and I wanted to know what's going on here?
Who are they? Let's not just accept this.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:45.350
Well, I learned the data came back 94 percent
of them are high school drop-outs.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.200
So then I went over to the school district
and I asked the superintendent, "What's going

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.089
on?" She said, "Well Kamala of the few of
number of children we have in the public school

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:58.490
system in San Francisco, 5500 have been designated
as habitually and chronically truant and of

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:04.370
the 5500, 2400 are elementary school students;
missing, by the way, 60, 70, 80 days of a

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.579
180 day school year.
So I asked the superintendent to convene a

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.660
meeting for me with all the principals and
administrators of the San Francisco Unified

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.880
School District and she did. And I stood before
them in a high school auditorium, a local

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.269
high school auditorium, and I shared with
them a fact about myself. I'm a product of

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:27.890
California Public Schools and my first grade
teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.240
soul, attended my law school graduation.
&gt;&gt;David: Hum.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.170
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I would not be standing here
or sitting here were it not for the education

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:41.660
I received. And I believe a child going without
an education is tantamount to a crime. So

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:48.360
I declared that I've decided I'm gonna start
prosecuting parents for truancy. Well if you

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360
all know --
&gt;&gt;David: [chuckles]

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: anything --
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.180
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: about San Francisco politics
you'll know half the room booed and the other

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.920
half stood up and clapped. And let me tell
you, but and my staff went bananas because

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.560
it was before we knew if I was gonna have
an opponent in my re-election race, they were

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.140
like: "Can't you wait. Everyone's gonna be
mad at you."

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.500
&gt;&gt;David: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I said: "Look. I'm done.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.110
And I've got some political capital and I'm
gonna spend some of it." And this is what

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.540
we did.
Well one of the things about my job is the

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.770
job comes with a badge and there is an artistic
rendering of said badge on my stationary.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:22.319
So on my letterhead I sent out to every parent
in the San Francisco Unified School District

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:27.050
a letter outlining the direct connection between
elementary school truancy, high school dropout

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.290
rates, who will be a victim of crime, who
will be a perpetrator of crime.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.810
So a friend of mine called me up, he said:
"Kamala my wife got the letter. She freaked

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.419
out. She called all the kids into the living
room --

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:39.900
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: held up the letter, said:

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.220
"If you don't go to school --
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.880
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Kamala's gonna put you and
me in jail."

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.880
[laughter]
Intended effect.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.500
And then what we also did, my friend, is we
set up what we call the DA Mediation Program

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.350
where I assign prosecutors to go and meet
with the principals when they were meeting

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.240
with these hundreds of parents.
Now remember this had never been done in my

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.970
office before. So when I created it, I had
to take volunteers from my office. You know

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:10.390
the prosecutors who volunteered? My gang prosecutors
and my homicide prosecutors. And so I'd say,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.419
"When you go over there look really mean"
which wasn't hard 'cause they look like they're

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:14.419
mean dudes.
&gt;&gt;David: [chuckles]

00:18:14.419 --> 00:18:17.550
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so they were standing
there and the parent was like, "Well who's

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.690
the mean lookin' dude?" And there's like,
"That's someone that mean DA Kamala Harris

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.330
sent over here 'cause she said she's gonna
start prosecuting you if we can't work this

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.130
out."
And this is what we found: we found cases

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:33.630
like the case of the woman who by herself
was raising her three children, holding down

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.930
two jobs, and homeless. She just needed some
help.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:43.020
But by shining this infrared light of our
public safety on the fact that her children

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.290
are not in school --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.510
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and asking the question about
why her children aren't in school, we were

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.620
able to figure it out and get her access to
services that exist. Of course her children's

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:58.590
attendance improved. We dismissed the charges
against her and over the course of this initiative,

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.260
we have improved attendance for this population,
which has been the elementary and middle school

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.360
population, by 30 percent.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.240
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So I would suggest that there
are many approaches that we can take recognizing

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.799
the power of these offices and also recognizing
that-that we can have some impact if we are

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:20.559
willing to have the courage to reconfigure
so that we don't, we don't run away from our

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:24.570
core function, but also realize how we can
actually do better.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.350
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Great.
Well I wanted to-to, I'm sure that issue's

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.690
going to come up again in --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.130
&gt;&gt;David: the Q and A period, but --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.919
&gt;&gt;David: and-and I wanna get back to issues
again in a minute, but I wanna talk for a

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:39.940
minute about the race, a little bit.
So your opponent, you're the, you're the DA-DA

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.000
of San Francisco, your opponent's the District
Attorney of Los Angeles.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:53.460
Some might say similar resumes and so-so what-what
are the differences? I mean, how do you, how

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.520
do you, what's, how's the State gonna be better
if-if you're the Attorney General and-and

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.760
not Mr. Cooley?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Well I know that I read that

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.309
at the Republican Convention he called me
a radical. So I guess that's one difference

00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:09.179
[laughs] between us. And yeah, I am a radical.
[chuckles]

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:11.510
&gt;&gt;David: [chuckles] Okay.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I do believe that we need

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.760
to get radical about what we are doing --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.480
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and take it seriously.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.919
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I'd say the difference between
us is really the difference between the defense

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:23.790
of status quo.
&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.250
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And-and what we should be
willing to do to be critical of existing systems

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:35.370
and then adopt innovation and move forward.
So, for example, one of my key areas of focus

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.289
which will not be the subject of any television
commercial we do because it, this is the other

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:45.720
thing about politics of running for office.
It's, it can be very frustrating as a candidate

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.740
because the public appetite is and-and the
way the system is set up is that the most

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.210
people I can talk with will be. I will be
able to talk with them through television,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.460
right?
When I ran for DA in San Francisco I was at

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.679
bus stops shakin' hands at six o'clock in
the morning. This is the largest geographically

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:06.510
and by population size, largest state in the
country. I -- the only way that I will shake

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.590
the hand of every voter is through television,
at a cost of two million dollars a week, by

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.590
the way. It's-it's crazy. And we need to talk
to them for at least six weeks.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:20.350
So that being said, television commercials
become the key and-and way that we speak with

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:26.740
voters. Well those television commercials
are exactly 30 seconds. And so its gonna,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:32.070
it's a challenge for someone like me because
there's a lot I obviously wanna talk about

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.310
to-to be able to communicate with voters around
the priorities. That being said, that's a

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.870
long way of saying.
One of my priorities that will probably not

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:46.940
be the subject of any television commercial
because it probably falls under the category

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.789
of the mundane, seemingly mundane, is this
important issue of the adoption of technology

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:55.510
by law enforcement in particular and government
in general.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.230
When I was elected District Attorney of San
Francisco in 2004, San Francisco, the first

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:07.990
cousin to Silicon Valley, two-thirds of my
lawyers did not have email. We are still rolling

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.799
out email in the San Francisco Police Department.
This is the reality of it.

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:17.320
The reality of it is when you pull back the
way government works, pull that curtain back,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.340
it's like watchin' that little guy in the
Wizard of Oz. It's an amazing thing anything

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:28.230
gets done. It is extremely obsolete in the
way that our systems are functioning and there

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.560
has to be change.
And the Attorney General of the State of California

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.549
can provide that kind of leadership and change.
And why is that important? It's obvious, the

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:42.190
obvious point is-is that we -- anything should
be upgraded from the 20th to the 21st century.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.740
But-but let's make a more practical reason
for why it's important. I'll give you two

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.250
reasons specifically that I think most people
would appreciate.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.570
One, police officer is pulling someone over
for a broken tail light. Well that person

00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:00.860
is wanted in another jurisdiction for an armed
robbery. That police officer probably won't

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:07.350
know that. So that presents the challenge
of: one, police officer is risking his life

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:12.140
when he gets out of the car to write that
ticket 'cause that driver knows what he's

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.290
wanted for. Two, God willing the police officer
goes back. He's safe. Armed robbery's just

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:22.280
gone free.
Another side of that coin is one of the biggest

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:31.669
and most prevalent crimes that is occurring
in our state and in our country and going

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:32.669
without consequence is identify theft.
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah

00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:35.280
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And you know why it's going
without consequence? Because the infrastructure

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.530
has not the skills to do all of the work that
is necessary to put those crimes together.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:47.660
It's that basic. It's that basic.
There has to be an adoption of technology

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.380
by law enforcement and government in general
if for no other reason because we know that

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.390
the best tool that we have in most systems
and particular in govern, in government and

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:03.179
law enforcement, is-is our ability to communicate.
And isn't that the very core reason for being

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:07.620
of technology which is to allow us to communicate
effectively and efficiently and with speed

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.620
 --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.409
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and accuracy?
So that's another priority for me. I don't,

00:24:13.409 --> 00:24:16.980
you can ask him what he thinks about these
things, but I haven't heard him talk about

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.140
it.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.090
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: You know there's another
issue that would be a very big difference

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.230
between us.
I-I, and I've challenged him for the last

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.870
six months. He's not taken a position in terms
of AB 32, which is a law that we passed with

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.870
bipartisan support in California --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.299
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: to say that we want high
standards around greenhouse gas emissions.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:41.490
That we want to be a leader and that we wanna
hold our self, as a, as a State strictly accountable

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.440
so that we can reduce and we can encourage
green technologies and we can en-encourage

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.110
all of the work that you all are doing here
around, in-in this area and other parts of

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.110
the State --
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.710
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: around solar panel tech,
and-and building economies and all of this,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.450
right? Well this is what AB 32 would encourage
and-and-and facilitate.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:04.220
There is a proposition on the November ballot
called Proposition 23 which would push as

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.860
it purports a pause button on AB 32, but I
will tell you, it will kill AB 32.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.710
My opponent has failed --
&gt;&gt;David: People should know Google is-is-is

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.640
on record against the-the --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's great.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.530
&gt;&gt;David: Prop 23.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's great.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.651
And my opponent refuses to take a position
on that.

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:22.380
When I was first elected DA, I created an
environmental justice unit --

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.429
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: for the same reason. We have

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:29.750
to upgrade the way we think of our-our-our
responsibility. My job is to absolutely protect

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:36.120
my constituency from all the crimes we've
already discussed, but as important and imminent

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.080
a threat to your health and safety as is any
crime we've discussed, so too are crimes being

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.780
committed against our environment.
And so we have to create a-an institutional

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:51.400
commitment to that issue. And that means creating
units where there is a special, specialization

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.420
that is cultivated and enhanced and-and grown.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.520
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I've done that.
&gt;&gt;David: Right, right.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.460
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: He has dis, decimated --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.120
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: his unit in his office --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.050
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and has not taken a position
on AB --

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.179
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: 32.

00:26:01.179 --> 00:26:02.471
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I think that's a problem.

00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:04.419
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I think it's a problem that

00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:10.450
he has said that he will join with southern
states attorneys general and join the suit

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.679
challenging the administration's health care
reform.

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:15.450
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Which of course I think is

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.429
an absolute misuse of limited resources in
this state and not in the best interest of

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:24.580
the people in this state, a lot of whom are
uninsured and-and who need access to affordable

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.030
health care.
And-and when the Attorney General in the State

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:34.610
of California starts weighing in on these
very, very important issues that have national

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.750
implication, when the Attorney General weighs
in of California, that's the big dog.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.809
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And it can be a game changer.

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:46.570
So all of those issues I think are very much
at play in this election and differences between

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.490
he and I.
&gt;&gt;David: Now I assume that-that you-you probably

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.539
also differ on Prop 8 and --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:51.539
&gt;&gt;David: and --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And, but he has said --

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:52.830
&gt;&gt;David: whether or not that should be defended?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Thank you.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.059
&gt;&gt;David: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And he's said, he has said

00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:55.990
he would defend Prop 8.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:00.190
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I have been very clear in
my opposition to Prop 8 and at this point

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:07.110
in time I think it is, it is, it is inappropriate
at best for anyone running for Attorney General

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.460
in the State of California to say they would
do anything other --

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.870
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: than stand down when a federal

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:16.919
judge has said that it is unconstitutional.
Again with limited resources in a state that

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:20.970
is on the verge of bankruptcy, one should
not be using the resources, the limited resources

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.410
and power of that office to defend a law that
has been found by a judge to be unconstitutional.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:31.211
A law that, by the way, the current Attorney
General and current Governor have agreed are,

00:27:31.211 --> 00:27:34.340
is-is an unconstitutional law.
So --

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.420
&gt;&gt;David: So let me, let's talk about the politics
of the --

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.371
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [unintelligible]
&gt;&gt;David: race for a second. Yes. So-so a lot

00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:42.049
of differences pretty clear choice here, but
a little bit about the politics of the race.

00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:46.190
So he's from L.A., L.A. elected official,
in L.A. County, the biggest county --

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.890
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: in the state. You've got a statewide

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.760
at the top of the Republican ticket. You have
a candidate who's spending lots and lots of-of

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.990
money, what-what do you need to do to win?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It's so crude, David. I need

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.830
to raise a ton of money.
&gt;&gt;David: Um.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.950
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It's-it's-it's just, it's
the reality of-of running statewide and there

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:13.789
is no other way to talk with voters other
than talking with them through television.

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:16.299
&gt;&gt;David: Um.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And it's so extremely expensive.

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:21.450
And-and for all I have said about my disagreements
with my opponent, I will say this, I take

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.700
him very seriously and he's ab-absolutely
formidable.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.880
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: He's in his third term as

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.409
District Attorney of Los Angeles.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:32.950
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It is the county with the
largest population in the state and so he

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:37.780
is a very significant opponent. We are neck
and neck in the polling. Right now there is

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:43.919
one poll that shows him about three points
ahead of us which means statistically we're

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:44.919
in a dead heat.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:47.340
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: We're neck and neck in fund
raising. And-and there is a lot at stake.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:53.550
And I should add because the commercials will
start airing soon anyway, so he's gonna start

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:58.840
adding all these, running all these hit pieces
against me as he's been talking about in all

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.340
these meetings.
I am personally opposed to the death penalty,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.250
but as I've said I will follow the law and
my position on the death penalty is the same

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.470
as four of the last nine Attorneys General.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.900
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: My opponent will use that
as a soft on crime card to suggest that I

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.799
am not committed to doing the work that needs
to be done by law enforcement, which is absolutely

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:21.549
incorrect as evidenced by the fact that I
have the highest conviction rates that we've

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:22.549
had.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:27.090
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So there are a lot of issue
that are gonna come up that are gonna be red

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.070
herrings in this campaign because I will tell
you that among the many important issues that

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:38.410
people are facing right now, at the top of
that list, is jobs, is, they want more efficient

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.039
systems. I've done a whole body of work around
mortgage fraud.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.390
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Let's talk about that for

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.200
an example.
There are all these families in this state

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.080
who are doing everything they were supposed
to do to live the American dream.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.440
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And the American dream tells

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:59.070
us and told them, "Go out and buy a home.
Pay your bills on tack, on time, you taxes

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.630
on time, your mortgage on time." And they
did all that. And then they found they were

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:08.049
out of work. And there are predators who have
come in in the form of brokers to financial

00:30:08.049 --> 00:30:13.320
institutions who have literally stripped these
folks of their few remaining assets and all

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.490
their dignity. And this is another crime that
has gone absolutely without consequence based

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.500
on its prevalence.
I have a whole body of work in my office doing

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.919
that. It's been so successful that we applied
for a very competitive grant from the Federal

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:30.059
Government which we brought home to San Francisco
to create a stand-alone mortgage fraud unit;

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:31.480
a million dollar grant.
&gt;&gt;David: Um.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.082
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So I've done that work. I
would suggest to you that's a priority. I

00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:36.500
would suggest to you the-the conversation
we're having about the environment is a priority.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:42.340
I would suggest to you that there is a huge
priority around making clear the connection

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.679
between public safety and public education
and using the power and the bully pulpit of

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:50.409
the office to say, "You care about your personal
safety. Well then you really should care about

00:30:50.409 --> 00:30:56.120
the education of other people's children."
These are very, very important issues and

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.690
I promise you that the way that you will see
the attacks come at us will be to bait people

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:08.590
into extreme ideological ends instead of to
talk about what is just practically --

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.830
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: what we should be discussing

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.919
and be concerned about. And in this way I
do see most of these issues as non-partisan,

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:15.919
to be honest.
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Right.

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:19.039
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I, and I think for too long
we have suggested that they-they-they are

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:23.620
partisan or ideological issues, when they're
not. I've never seen anybody go up and-and

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.821
before they rob somebody ask them what-what
party they're registered to.

00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:29.821
Just doesn't happen.
&gt;&gt;David: No. Fair enough.

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:34.580
So before we open it up to audience questions
I wanted to cover a couple of-of other basically

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.990
non-partisan issues.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.059
&gt;&gt;David: that we, that-that address some of
the things we do around-around --

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:41.060
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.
&gt;&gt;David: the shop here at Google.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.290
One of those is on-line privacy.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.230
&gt;&gt;David: Now in the primary I know you had
criticized your opponent --

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.559
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes.
&gt;&gt;David: for-for sort of bein' lax and-and

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:53.309
not sufficiently concerned, if you will --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:57.510
&gt;&gt;David: about on-line privacy or violations
of on-line privacy with social --

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.179
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;David: networks and so forth. So we wanna

00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:02.580
hear from you a little bit about how-how you
think about that issue --

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.070
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Sure.
&gt;&gt;David: and given how quickly the technology's

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.340
moving how, given how-how powerful a lot of
these tools are, if you have a vision for

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.299
regulating it or doing something to enforce
a law around it. How do you do that? How do

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:18.390
you think about that and how do you do that
without stifling the kind of innovation --

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.559
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.
&gt;&gt;David: that-that you're seeing in this whole

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.430
area?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So as a lawyer you know we

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:31.010
all know the Constitution of the United States
has a Fourth Amendment and that is the-the-the-the

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:36.659
law that surrounds what is reasonable and
unreasonable search and seizure.

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:40.890
And so underlying all of the, any analysis
about would be what would be a reasonable

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.270
or unreasonable taking of your stuff by government
or anybody else, is the concept of what is

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:54.409
a reasonable expectation of privacy.
So the laws that have been written and are

00:32:54.409 --> 00:33:01.690
on the books to deal with this issue of privacy
are laws that developed primarily, and this

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.341
gets back to the 20th century versus the 21st
century --

00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:05.950
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: world, right? The laws are

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.100
still very much grounded in the 20th century
 --

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.230
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and-and before.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:18.600
So the laws that came up around privacy were
developed around literally the structure of

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:25.039
a house. Well what can you see from the street
if you were looking through the window of

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:29.580
that house versus what you would be able to
see or take if you opened the door of that

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.590
house versus what -- right? What is your reason,
what, versus what you're doing in the front

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.750
yard of that house.
&gt;&gt;David: True.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:42.090
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so what expectation of
privacy do you attach to whatever is placed

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.840
in that particular place as it relates to
that house?

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.240
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So given where we are now,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.710
so you're now, no longer are you necessarily
keeping those private files in some file cabinet

00:33:53.710 --> 00:34:03.220
that's locked in the basement of the house.
It's on your laptop and it's then therefore

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.330
up here in this cloud that exists above us,
right?

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.990
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It's no longer in a physical

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:19.409
place. And so we have to, lawyers, judges,
government, realize that ti-times are changing.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.950
&gt;&gt;David: Sure.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And we have, we're gonna

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:26.019
have to figure out a way to adapt. And-and
adapt to the realities of where we are.

00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:32.440
Other laws that-that deal with, for example,
copyright, existed in theft, let's use theft

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.979
as an example. Well theft was always and-and
our laws regarding theft were-were always

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:41.209
based on the idea that I would take something
from you --

00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:42.899
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and deprive you of-of possession

00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:45.139
of that thing.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:51.329
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Well now because of technology
I can take something from you because I copy

00:34:51.329 --> 00:34:52.329
it, but you still have it. Right?
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah. So you're takin' the value

00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:55.129
of it. Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:57.660
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so but we haven't adjusted

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.660
and-and-and ?
&gt;&gt;David: [unintelligible]

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.499
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: frankly part of the problem
I think is also that-that there's a-a lack

00:35:02.499 --> 00:35:07.119
of understanding of what you all do, by me
and many others.

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.119
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And-and that's some, that's

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:11.089
a gap that has to be recognized and we have
to do something consciously --

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:12.400
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: to close that gap.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.119
&gt;&gt;David: I mean 'cause one of the concerns,
I mean you go – back to privacy you-you

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:19.089
said times are changing and it's 21st century
is very different than --

00:35:19.089 --> 00:35:20.190
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: the 20th century. Well one of the

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:24.930
ways in which its different is people have
a lot more interest or a lot, a lot less concern

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.329
about making information that heretofore was
private either because they wanted it to be

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:30.390
private or because it was simply obscure right
 --

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.390
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's right.
&gt;&gt;David: and hard to find.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.390
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's exactly right.
&gt;&gt;David: And now --

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.390
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's right.
&gt;&gt;David: technology makes it easy to find

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.390
 --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's right.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.609
&gt;&gt;David: and in a lot of cases the culture
there are arguments about whether the culture

00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:37.839
really is changing.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.200
&gt;&gt;David: But people wanna --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's a --

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.269
&gt;&gt;David: wanna share more.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yep.

00:35:40.269 --> 00:35:45.729
&gt;&gt;David: So it, so the concern of-of a lot
of folks in the Valley and who-who work in

00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:51.759
this area is that law enforcement, government,
policy makers are going to do things to protect

00:35:51.759 --> 00:35:52.782
users --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:56.569
&gt;&gt;David: and people from themselves because
there's some sense of 20th century privacy

00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:57.569
that has to be protected.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:35:57.569 --> 00:36:00.151
&gt;&gt;David: How do you, how do you respond to
that?

00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:02.270
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That there's a balance that
has to be struck.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.900
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So one of the issues that

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:12.119
has come up that-that is a kind of high profile
issue on this point, it-it-it relates to children

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:17.180
and their use of technology in a way that
may harm them. And so I would suggest to you

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.099
based on the work that I've done that the
best way to deal with that is prevention --

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:22.670
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: which means educating the

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:26.359
parents and teachers and the community that
is raising that child to understand the technology

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:31.079
in a way that they can teach the child what
we otherwise teach children when we cross

00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:35.779
the street: "Don't just look at the light,
look both ways before you cross. Don't talk

00:36:35.779 --> 00:36:39.969
to a stranger and-and the stranger is someone
you've never seen before." But "stranger"

00:36:39.969 --> 00:36:44.779
is defined a little differently when you're
interacting with someone on a social networking

00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:45.779
site.
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Right.

00:36:45.779 --> 00:36:46.779
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So that's part of it.
&gt;&gt;David: Right:

00:36:46.779 --> 00:36:52.339
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And I think the other part
of it is just also having some commitment

00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:57.779
to an understanding that the technology that
is coming right out of our backyard, and this

00:36:57.779 --> 00:37:03.469
is where I have a certain bravado about being
a California kid. I mean I do. Which is its

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:10.709
right here and the next Attorney General of
California should be the-the-the go to person

00:37:10.709 --> 00:37:14.589
for how we should be handling these cases
 --

00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:17.279
&gt;&gt;David: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: in the country and-and in

00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:23.319
that way I approach my thoughts about this
with a deep understanding that we're just

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:24.730
at the beginning --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.640
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: of-of where this can go ?
&gt;&gt;David: [unintelligible]

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.049
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and we really don't wanna
stand in a, in-in the way of its potential

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:33.439
and its development.
You know like what's happening now with broadband

00:37:33.439 --> 00:37:34.439
 --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:41.230
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and how that's gonna change.
The potential and the expanse and-and availability

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:49.180
it's profound. And-and so there has to be
come balance struck between what is an immediate

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.520
issue that is literally causing harm to the
lives of people --

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.829
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: versus to your point changing

00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:59.430
laws to adapt to those points that you've
made.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.421
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
Well let-let me actually, I wanna open it

00:38:01.421 --> 00:38:07.089
up in a minute. I'm gonna ask one more question
and then people can, we've got mics on either

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:11.950
side, so as I'm asking this question and-and-and
Kamala's answering, maybe you could get up

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.069
and prepare yours.
But one other question re-re-related to that.

00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:16.819
So anti-trust.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes.

00:38:16.819 --> 00:38:22.559
&gt;&gt;David: Competition law. So that's obviously
in an area that is not unknown to Google --

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:25.789
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: and you're seeing state attorney

00:38:25.789 --> 00:38:30.400
generals have become much more active in that
area. And to your last point about not standing

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.300
in the way, about making sure there's a balance
 --

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.959
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;David: a lot of us are concerned sometimes

00:38:34.959 --> 00:38:41.819
that in, given how quickly our-our industry
moves, how quickly things, there was when

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:47.130
I was first hanging around, hanging out with
Larry and Sergey 12 years ago, everybody thought,

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.959
"Search. Why are you doing a search start-up?"
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:38:49.959 --> 00:38:51.969
&gt;&gt;David: That business is done, it's over.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:54.979
&gt;&gt;David: There's nothing more to do there
and of course when in a few years people saw

00:38:54.979 --> 00:38:56.529
it was very, very different.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:38:56.529 --> 00:39:02.650
&gt;&gt;David: And so things move so quickly. Mere
success at a given point at a snapshot in

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.650
time --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.650
&gt;&gt;David: does not mean --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.670
&gt;&gt;David: dominance or --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.549
&gt;&gt;David: monopoly power and all those kinds
of things --

00:39:07.549 --> 00:39:08.549
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Or an era or anything [laughs]
 --

00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:09.549
&gt;&gt;David: or any of those things --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:39:09.549 --> 00:39:10.549
&gt;&gt;David: because these things can go away
 --

00:39:10.549 --> 00:39:11.650
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.
&gt;&gt;David: in a heartbeat and that's why we

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.349
live sort of in fear of the-the --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:15.180
&gt;&gt;David: the other folks in a garage somewhere.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.180
&gt;&gt;David: So --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.640
&gt;&gt;David: So what, how-how-how do you think
about that? I mean it's-it's --

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.909
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;David: it's, how do you think about enforcing

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:23.259
 --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:39:23.259 --> 00:39:28.410
&gt;&gt;David: anti-trust and again you-you're,
if-if as you said it's happening here so there's

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:33.499
a-a-a big interest in the government state,
Government of California to make sure that

00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:34.660
this industry is thriving --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.069
&gt;&gt;David: So, I --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Absolutely right.

00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:40.720
&gt;&gt;David: How do you strike this balance?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I think you've articulated

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.720
it. I mean it's-it-it really is, we cannot
be short-sighted --

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.299
&gt;&gt;David: No.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so that's part of it

00:39:46.299 --> 00:39:55.209
and-and so it is to recognize that we have
to allow the-these businesses to develop and

00:39:55.209 --> 00:39:58.060
grow because that's where the models will
be created.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.680
And-and it's also it's-it's incremental in
many ways to your point. This then grows to

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:10.209
its maximum potential and is the-the board
from which another thing leaps. And-and so

00:40:10.209 --> 00:40:14.160
we have to understand these systems and how
they [unintelligible ].

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.719
And-and not do it again despite to save our
nose to spite our face because the other aspect

00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:24.469
I think to your point, is this is a very significant
source of-of California's economy --

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:28.170
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And if we, a state on the

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:32.780
verge of bankruptcy, want to do something
about that fact we're gonna have to recognize

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.729
we cannot stand in the way of business growth
and development.

00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:37.960
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And that we don't have to

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960
accept false choices. That doesn't --
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: have to be to the exclusion--
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.079
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: for example, of protecting
consumers.

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:44.279
&gt;&gt;David: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It doesn't have to the exclusion

00:40:44.279 --> 00:40:48.509
of going after bad businesses because bad
businesses are not good for good businesses.

00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:50.630
&gt;&gt;David: Right. Right. Fair enough.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:54.609
&gt;&gt;David: Good. Well we've got some questions.
Why don't we start on this side of the room?

00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:59.079
&gt;&gt;Justin Lieu: Sure. My name's Justin [Lieu]
and I was wondering if you thought three strikes

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:05.029
was Constitutional given that non-violent
offenders could get life sentences, and also

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:09.880
if you think it needs to be reformed in how
 -- in either the law or how it's implemented

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.640
and, if so, how?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's a great question Justin.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.069
Thank you.
So it, three strikes is a law that came about-about

00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:20.930
now 12 years ago in California. It was based
on that baseball analogy: third strike, you're

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:24.279
out. And it was, it came out of a horrible
case involving a little girl by the name of

00:41:24.279 --> 00:41:32.359
Polly Klass who was horribly killed and turned
out the guy who did it had prior incidents

00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:34.589
and so everyone said, "Well how could he have
been left to be on the street to do this one,

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:41.039
when he had done that kind of thing before?"
And there was an appropriate kind of emotional

00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:47.440
response to her case but it ended up being
 -- good public policy should not be driven

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:54.859
by emotion. And what ended up happening was
that a law was created and passed based on

00:41:54.859 --> 00:41:59.039
an appropriate emotional reaction to what
happened to her, but it was written in such

00:41:59.039 --> 00:42:08.220
a way that if a person had a serious and violent
first offense they'd do that time. If they

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.700
had a second one, they'd do twice the time.
And then if they had a third one, but the

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.819
law was written third of any kind of felony,
to your point even a non-violent, they would

00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:23.229
do 25 to life.
I disagree with that. My policy in my office

00:42:23.229 --> 00:42:28.039
is on my Website. It hasn't changed, which
is that we will not seek a 25 year to life

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:33.930
sentence unless the third offense is of a
serious or violent nature, with very few exceptions.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:40.619
And-and-and there have been a number of case
law, cases that have come down to kind of

00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:42.299
restrict the application of that one.
&gt;&gt;David: Great. Next question over here.

00:42:42.299 --> 00:42:44.519
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah, so obviously California
is pretty cash strapped at the moment and

00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:51.289
will continue to be for the, in the years
ahead and I mean I recently learned that we're

00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:54.329
also spending 11 percent of our budget on
prisons --

00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:55.910
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: in keeping people incarcerated.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.980
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And, I mean, United States

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.359
also has one of the highest incarceration
rates in the world. I was wondering your thoughts

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:06.369
on the Attorney General's --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.

00:43:06.369 --> 00:43:08.480
&gt;&gt;male in audience: role in-in that issue
especially in the-the short term.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.160
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So I talked about Back on
Track, my initiative, which was absolutely

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:21.349
designed to deal with your point. We have
a seven out of ten rate of failure in terms

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:25.640
of the recidivism rate, 70 percent recidivate
within three years of their release in California.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.162
Everyone would read about it on the front
page of the paper for the last several months:

00:43:29.162 --> 00:43:33.859
"Oh my God, prisons are overflowing, they're
over crowded. Oh my God, there's gonna be

00:43:33.859 --> 00:43:35.900
early release of prisoners." Problem, problem,
problem.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:41.880
I would suggest to you that's not true. It's
a symptom of the problem. The problem is we

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:49.209
have a revolving door of crime in California
that we need to shut. So what am I talking

00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:53.079
about?
The average prison sentence in California

00:43:53.079 --> 00:44:01.020
is 24 months. You can infer two facts from
that: one, the average person being sentenced

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.769
to prison is not being sentenced for a-a serious
or violent crime because as we have discussed

00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:11.410
with the three strikes question, it, that's
gonna be 10, 15, 25 to life. The other thing

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:16.079
that tells you, the other fact, they're all
coming out.

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:21.370
And we have no meaningful criminal justice
policy for dealing with that fact. So we're

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.299
just ostriches. So we lock 'em up. Good were
done with that guy. Well seven out of ten

00:44:23.299 --> 00:44:26.700
of them are gonna go right back in and we
have no plan when they get out of prison after

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.739
serving their time for re-entering them.
So they do the predictable because, by the

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:35.839
way, since they committed the last crime,
the only changed circumstance is that they've

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:38.529
been in prison with a bunch of other folks.
[laughter]

00:44:38.529 --> 00:44:39.529
Right?
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:44:39.529 --> 00:44:44.190
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: So we have to have meaningful
criminal justice policy to deal with this

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:49.750
issue of recidivism to reduce the burden on
our criminal justice system which is costing

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:54.369
us to your point 10 billion dollars a year
in California, in a state that's on the verge

00:44:54.369 --> 00:44:57.930
of bankruptcy.
So I believe one very discreet and specific

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:03.890
area of focus which would yield huge rewards
is to focus on the issue of recidivism, and

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:08.099
in particular, re-entering former offenders
and doing what we can to reduce the likelihood

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:10.910
that they will reoffend.
And then on the fiscal plan I will share with

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:15.819
you. It costs me $10,000 every time I prosecute
a felony. It costs us $35,000 a year to house

00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:22.060
someone in the county jail. It costs $51,000
a year to house someone in the state prison.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:28.890
My re-entry program, Back on Track, costs
less than $5,000 per participant. Right? And

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.329
you're having a, you're having an impact on
whole families when you do that work.

00:45:33.329 --> 00:45:35.950
So again, it's back to the question about
the difference between me --

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.240
&gt;&gt;David: Yep.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: and my opponent. I-I'm sure

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:47.849
someone would say, "Oh of course she's doing
that. That's not tough."

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:48.970
[pause]
Well I'm sorry so it's-it's just tough to

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.279
keep reacting to known, that you can just
predict they're gonna come out and just knock

00:45:51.279 --> 00:45:54.779
'em right back in, knock 'em right back in.
[laughs] How 'bout shutting that door so they're

00:45:54.779 --> 00:45:55.949
not going back in?
And that's what I'm talkin' about and I think

00:45:55.949 --> 00:45:59.400
you are too.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah. Thank you.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.915
&gt;&gt;David: Alright, next question over here
and I can predict, might be able to predict,

00:46:04.915 --> 00:46:07.549
be able to predict what it'll be about.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [unintelligible]

00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:09.170
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Actually I'm gonna --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.420
&gt;&gt;male in audience: angle it off.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Okay.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.680
&gt;&gt;David: Alright.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So as many Googlers and

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.769
San Franciscans, I'm-I'm a pretty radical
civil libertarian --

00:46:17.769 --> 00:46:20.769
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: and that's hence my objection

00:46:20.769 --> 00:46:21.989
to the --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes.

00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:26.859
&gt;&gt;male in audience: attendance thing. But
can you give me a counter-example? Give me

00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:37.509
an example where, 'cause to me your smart
also kind of means potentially ends justify

00:46:37.509 --> 00:46:43.719
the means in terms of preventing crime ahead
of time. Can you give me an example of where

00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:46.839
you've had a policy that you thought might
be effective --

00:46:46.839 --> 00:46:51.069
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: but for civil liberty

00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:58.219
reasons, privacy or intrusion into people's
lives, you've made the decision that that's

00:46:58.219 --> 00:47:03.999
not a good policy for the-the state or the
city to be following?

00:47:03.999 --> 00:47:06.829
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: A-a time where you've-you've

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:10.380
sort of backed off on that and said, "You
know what&gt; That's-that's too much, that's

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:16.789
too digging into people's lives?"
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's a wonderful question.

00:47:16.789 --> 00:47:20.069
[pause]
The-the one that comes to mind and I'm sure

00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:24.650
there-there's more than one. The one that
comes to mind most recently back to the question

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:33.519
was around the concern about known sexual
offenders using social networking sites.

00:47:33.519 --> 00:47:40.119
And I was very much in favor of regulating
or restricting access. And when I started

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:47.650
to think more about it and received more information,
I realized that that would have been too expansive

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:51.670
and would have restricted a lot of people
who should not be restricted.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:59.319
So what we did is I-I changed the definition
of social network sites to-to reflect more

00:47:59.319 --> 00:48:04.330
the federal definition which would include
that there, it's a substantial number of -of

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.160
users are minors.
Looking at how we can, and then in terms of

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.979
which sex offenders, let's restrict that to
those that are most likely, so that-that is

00:48:13.979 --> 00:48:15.949
probably one.
It would have been easy to go with the more

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:21.039
expansive one. It would have been politically
appear tougher, but-but I did reduce the-the

00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:26.939
scope of the focus because of my concern for
your point.

00:48:26.939 --> 00:48:28.979
And-and I, and I do wanna say something else
 --

00:48:28.979 --> 00:48:29.979
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: that I think is another good

00:48:29.979 --> 00:48:30.979
distinction between me, another distinction
 --.

00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:31.979
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: between me and my opponent.

00:48:31.979 --> 00:48:36.189
&gt;&gt;David: It's a campaign.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: It's a campaign. No time

00:48:36.189 --> 00:48:39.079
to be modest at all.
[laughter]

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:42.579
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs] We have 49 days
to go.

00:48:42.579 --> 00:48:47.319
It's real, I see the role of this office,
Attorney General, as being very similar to

00:48:47.319 --> 00:48:52.189
how I've tried to use my role as attorney,
as District Attorney. So there is the statutory

00:48:52.189 --> 00:48:57.609
and technical responsibility of the office,
and then there is the bully pulpit that comes

00:48:57.609 --> 00:49:01.190
with the office.
I have microphones in front of me all the

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:06.160
time. And hopefully I am educating myself
about issues and being informed by people

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.109
who understand issues more than I do. In a
way that when I'm in front of that bully pulpit,

00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:14.989
I'm speaking in a responsible way and hopefully
educating the public.

00:49:14.989 --> 00:49:21.869
And then the third role is-is-is the incredible
power that one has in these positions to convene,

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:23.809
which again is about bringing smart people
 --

00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:25.199
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: into the room to say, "Will

00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:29.670
you all come together with me?" And then maybe
some people who are in a different component

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.579
of, or sector of our community or our lives,
come together around my table. I've done it

00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:34.650
so many times, David.
&gt;&gt;David: Um.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.640
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Come together. Will you guys
come together for an hour? I've got an idea

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.246
and just come around my conference table and
let's play around with the idea.

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:46.539
And invariably in the course of that one hour
we are breaking through silos, but also during

00:49:46.539 --> 00:49:50.369
the course of that one hour there is invariably
some plan for what we can do going forward

00:49:50.369 --> 00:49:55.609
to be better, to be more effective, to-to
create synergy. And-and so I will say this,

00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:57.869
I'm very comfortable admitting what I don't
know.

00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:01.420
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And I, and I enjoy and I

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.029
am best when I make a decision after I have
heard from a lot of people. I like making

00:50:06.029 --> 00:50:12.380
decisions like that. I like being surrounded
by smart people. I have no problem admitting

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380
I don't know that.
And-and I think --

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.380
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: you want that in your office

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.799
holders because the power we have, the power
I have as a prosecutor is that with a swipe

00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:28.180
of my pen I can charge someone with a misdemeanor,
the lowest level offense possible. And by

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:34.740
virtue of that swipe of my pen you will have
to go to a courthouse and stand in line; you

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:39.439
will have to come out of pocket and hire an
attorney; you may get arrested for a few hours;

00:50:39.439 --> 00:50:45.209
you will be embarrassed in your community;
you will miss time from coming on to the Google

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:51.589
Campus; all because with the swipe of my pen
I've charged you with a crime, which I may

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:56.001
choose to dismiss two weeks later.
It's an incredible amount of power. And you

00:50:56.001 --> 00:51:01.089
wanna make sure that the people who have this
kind of power are taking seriously the responsibility

00:51:01.089 --> 00:51:02.089
 --
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:06.309
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: in terms of understanding
as much as anything the impact on the people

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:08.749
who will be impact, who will be affected by
that.

00:51:08.749 --> 00:51:11.249
&gt;&gt;David: Absolutely.
Great. Great. Next question.

00:51:11.249 --> 00:51:16.009
&gt;&gt;female in audience: You've outlined the
issues you consider important pretty clearly,

00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:20.529
but from a practical perspective can you explain
or clarify some of the actions that you'll

00:51:20.529 --> 00:51:22.089
take when you first come into of-office and
 --

00:51:22.089 --> 00:51:24.249
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Sure.
&gt;&gt;female in audience: how you'll prioritize

00:51:24.249 --> 00:51:26.729
them?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah. That's great.

00:51:26.729 --> 00:51:34.089
Well one of the first actions is I'm planning
on doing an audit [laughs] of the office and

00:51:34.089 --> 00:51:39.250
I did that when I was first elected DA and
I'll tell you why, many reasons. But mostly

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:47.849
because when you come in as the head of a-an
organization, there will be a bunch of squeaky,

00:51:47.849 --> 00:51:53.640
squeaky wheels which will demand a lot of
your attention and time. They're are gonna

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.329
be just banging cymbals and-and-and invariably
though when you look into it, you will find

00:51:58.329 --> 00:52:04.959
that it's the guy who's down the hall and
around the corner under that green visor that

00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:08.930
is the one's who's actually making the whole
train run.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.699
And if you start making decisions about how
you're gonna prioritize resources, how are

00:52:13.699 --> 00:52:18.749
you gonna distribute resources around what
is-is obvious, you're probably gonna make

00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:22.309
some mistakes.
So the first thing that you-you always have

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:26.849
to do in these offices and this gets back
to the-the seemingly mundane which is absolutely

00:52:26.849 --> 00:52:31.329
critical to doing the broad sweeping work
to the point of your question. You have to

00:52:31.329 --> 00:52:35.270
know where everything is. And-and you have
to figure that out pretty quickly so that

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:39.630
you can then start to make the decisions that
are consistent with your policy priorities.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:45.049
So that's one of the first actions I plan
on taking.

00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:47.020
&gt;&gt;David: Okay. Hopefully we can, you have,
you have time for, to --

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.020
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
&gt;&gt;David: get these last --

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.020
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah, absolutely.
&gt;&gt;David: three questions.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.020
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: Okay.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.020
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yes, absolutely.
&gt;&gt;David: Let's go here and there and back

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.089
again.
&gt;&gt;Joanne Syben: Okay. Hi, my name is Joanne

00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:58.880
Syben and I have a question for you about
the cost of incarceration --

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.089
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;Joanne Syben: versus apprenticeships and

00:53:01.089 --> 00:53:05.500
the context is I've been reading a number
of studies lately that suggest that despite

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:11.589
our grievous unemployment figures, we actually
are suffering a shortage of highly skilled

00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:13.160
blue collar workers --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.039
&gt;&gt;female in audience: electricians, plumbers,
solar technicians, auto mechanics, etcetera.

00:53:16.039 --> 00:53:19.250
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Um-hum.
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So could you compare,

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:24.529
a two-part question. Could you compare the
cost of incarceration versus apprenticeship

00:53:24.529 --> 00:53:31.079
programs? And given that it seems so blatantly
obviously a good solution all around, why

00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:36.219
have such programs failed to gain a huge amount
of traction so far? Is it lack of leadership?

00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:40.759
Political will? Funding? What's going on?
[laughs]

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:44.579
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And you're talking about
around skills development around known offenders?

00:53:44.579 --> 00:53:48.480
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah. So the cost. The cost

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.739
is like I was saying' for Back on Track, for
example, $10,000 to prosecute a felony, $35,000

00:53:52.739 --> 00:53:57.019
a year to house somebody in the country jail,
$51,000 a year to house someone in state prison.

00:53:57.019 --> 00:54:01.680
My Initiative Back on Track costs less than
$5,000 per participant. And it includes not

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.539
just a skills development but it actually
looks at the participants in a, in a, in a

00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:10.369
holistic way understanding their lives are
as multi-faceted as ours.

00:54:10.369 --> 00:54:14.999
So it's about their need for child care, their
need for housing, their need for clearing

00:54:14.999 --> 00:54:21.619
up their credit, some basic stuff.
I would say that part of the problem, I'm

00:54:21.619 --> 00:54:27.869
a little bit of a nerd, and-anyway I've done
a study of the criminal justice system in

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:33.420
the United States [laughs] and just simply
put there was one, once upon a time there

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:41.209
was this thing called the war on poverty.
But it was really, it was a great idea and

00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:46.439
it was really short-lived. And then it became
the war on crime and then it became the war

00:54:46.439 --> 00:54:50.089
on drugs.
Then there was this guy by the name of Michael

00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:56.329
Dukakis that decided to run for President
of the United States and it turned out this

00:54:56.329 --> 00:55:00.269
guy Michael Dukakis had been Governor of this
state called Massachusetts, and when he was

00:55:00.269 --> 00:55:05.329
Governor there was this guy by the name of
Willy Horton who was on a furlough program

00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:10.519
that was a job training program. And this
guy Horton went out and committed a horrendous

00:55:10.519 --> 00:55:16.999
crime and then this other guy Michael Dukakis
because of that, lost the election.

00:55:16.999 --> 00:55:26.130
And [laughs] all of a sudden the word "rehabilitation"
was synonymous with soft on crime. And all

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:30.390
of a sudden, and I'm -- this is the general
kind of crude analysis, but true. You can

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:36.579
track it and see all of a sudden, it was not
the tough thing to talk about when you wanted,

00:55:36.579 --> 00:55:41.160
when you talked about the crime problem to
talk about a focus on rehabilitation as part

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:47.439
of the solution. And it was abandoned.
And frankly to be very candid with you all,

00:55:47.439 --> 00:55:53.239
I rarely use the word "rehabilitation". I
talked about "reduction of recidivism" 'cause

00:55:53.239 --> 00:56:00.249
it just lost its-its-its true meaning. It
became soft on crime. It became, let me tell

00:56:00.249 --> 00:56:06.309
you a word you've probably never heard that
I've heard in many circles. It's a "hug-a-thug"

00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:08.170
program.
&gt;&gt;David: Huh.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.920
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Isn't that the most offensive

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.839
term you've ever heard? It's a hug-a-thug
program.

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:20.099
&gt;&gt;David: [unintelligible]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: This is the mindset and so

00:56:20.099 --> 00:56:25.019
you have where we are now. And-and so back
to the question from the, from the fellow

00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:30.910
who was over here. So we're much more prepared
to put $10 billion a year in California into

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:34.569
locking people up instead of into a holistic
approach.

00:56:34.569 --> 00:56:39.599
And by the way, nothing I'm saying should
be confused to be anything other than saying

00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:44.449
 -- when somebody commits a crime they must
be held accountable. I've spent my whole life

00:56:44.449 --> 00:56:48.729
locking people up. So I'm not suggesting you
let people get away with it. I'm not suggesting

00:56:48.729 --> 00:56:52.721
that people shouldn't go to jail.
But there are cycles and there are systems

00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:57.709
and we have to look beyond the one criminal
case and we have to look at the crime problem.

00:56:57.709 --> 00:57:00.089
And that's how criminal justice policy should
be designed.

00:57:00.089 --> 00:57:03.049
&gt;&gt;David: It sounds like you're describing
a lack of political courage and a lack of

00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:04.700
political will. How do you break through that?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Or creativity.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.299
&gt;&gt;David: Or even creativity. But how-how,
but if that's, if-if basically the view is

00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:12.969
you don't get elected if you talk about this
stuff or if you try to do these things maybe

00:57:12.969 --> 00:57:15.979
you-you'll-you'll get run out of office. How-how's
it ever gonna happen?

00:57:15.979 --> 00:57:20.170
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I think that people are smarter
than we give them credit for.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.989
&gt;&gt;David: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: I think that if you start

00:57:21.989 --> 00:57:26.020
talking about it in a way that, I mean here's
the other part of what's -- let me tell you

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:30.759
why I wrote the book. I wrote the book 'cause
I was, I wrote it in hoping it would be ready

00:57:30.759 --> 00:57:34.839
in time for the Denver convention, for the
Democratic Convention when we elected the

00:57:34.839 --> 00:57:38.230
President.
Because I was so sure that there was gonna

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.920
be this robust debate on criminal justice
policy and so I wanted to hopefully help inform

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.819
that debate. And of course there was no debate
on criminal justice policy --

00:57:45.819 --> 00:57:48.089
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: because to talk about criminal

00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:51.769
justice policy is to assume such a prickly
subject if you're gonna be reasonable --

00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:53.509
&gt;&gt;David: Hum.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: then nobody wants to bring

00:57:53.509 --> 00:57:54.509
it up.
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:57:54.509 --> 00:57:59.400
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And, but that being said,
I have -- as the Democrat from San Francisco

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:06.140
in the primary with six opponents, we took
L.A., we took Orange County, we took Fresno,

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.190
we took San Diego.
&gt;&gt;David: Um-hum.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:13.760
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And I have stood in living
rooms in Riverside and-and in Orange County

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.880
and places that are considered conservative
and talked about these issues and people get

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:23.019
it. I think when you talk to people in a way
that is just about what is pragmatic and realistic

00:58:23.019 --> 00:58:28.099
and it's about just not about ideology, they
get it and so I'm willing to take that risk.

00:58:28.099 --> 00:58:30.539
&gt;&gt;David: Right.
Let's try to get the last two questions in

00:58:30.539 --> 00:58:31.539
quickly.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.

00:58:31.539 --> 00:58:33.670
&gt;&gt;David: Right over here.
&gt;&gt;female in audience: It'll be really quick.

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:35.469
I'm on the --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: My answer probably won't

00:58:35.469 --> 00:58:37.269
be. [laughs]
&gt;&gt;female in audience: It probably will be.

00:58:37.269 --> 00:58:39.469
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm on the Online Media

00:58:39.469 --> 00:58:43.190
Team here at Google and you mentioned that
there is no other way to reach voters other

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:46.400
than through TV.
&gt;&gt;David: That's a question I have.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;David: We beg to differ.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Have you explored the

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.059
media tools that we have here at Google?
[laughter]

00:58:51.059 --> 00:58:55.789
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Will you help me?
[laughter]

00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:59.369
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Okay. Come-come sit up here

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:03.150
or we'll find you after. I mean that though.
I really do. 'Cause I'm sure we have not as-as

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.319
much as we should. Thank you. Thank you.
That's great.

00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:09.479
&gt;&gt;David: Last question over here. [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: [laughs]

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.960
[applause]
&gt;&gt;male in audience: My question is going to

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.670
be somewhat in-in a similar vein.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Oh good.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.989
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Good. I want your help too.

00:59:16.989 --> 00:59:18.749
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So-so my question is I

00:59:18.749 --> 00:59:25.729
mean you obviously talk about bringing the
criminal justice system from the 20th century

00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:26.729
into the 21st century.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Yeah.

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:29.440
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And of course some of
the common examples of email and so forth

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.489
and connectivity --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right.

00:59:30.489 --> 00:59:34.529
&gt;&gt;male in audience: there are-are obviously
resounding. But I mean are there other concrete

00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:40.119
things that which are perhaps sort of leading
edge or bleeding edge that you're, that you're

00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:46.510
thinking about and how you, are-are you thinking
about enlisting some of these or the-the most

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:52.479
innovative-innovative companies in the, in
the space or in the Valley to sort of help

00:59:52.479 --> 00:59:57.150
lead that in-in-in that and set a model for
the country as a, or maybe even-even more

00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:58.179
broadly?
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Absolutely.

00:59:58.179 --> 01:00:01.679
&gt;&gt;male in audience: As opposed to completely
leading from the political side which obviously

01:00:01.679 --> 01:00:03.289
 --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Oh no I don't think it can

01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:08.140
happen that way. I agree with you completely.
It can't happen that way and-and absolutely.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.099
I've been wanting to come to the Google Campus
for a year and a half.

01:00:10.099 --> 01:00:11.099
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Let me just be clear about

01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:12.099
that. I'm so happy I'm here right now.
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Um-hum.

01:00:12.099 --> 01:00:17.259
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: But I've been wantin' to
come because I want these relationships. And

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:21.059
I wanna cultivate them because I want you
to be an advisory group.

01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:26.190
And I want you, I wanna be able to say, "Look
guys this is what I've got. Tell me from -- what

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:32.390
do you see as the way that we get to where
we need to be? What does the design look like?"

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:37.469
And that's gonna be around everything in terms
of how we're communicating online to what

01:00:37.469 --> 01:00:43.039
we're doing around creating systems that are
about keeping and warehousing information

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:48.999
and data to what we can be doing around just
upgrading all of the-the-the pure kind of

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:52.720
communication systems that-that exist and
should exist within government. So we can

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.839
increase accountability and effectiveness
and reduce human error and all of that.

01:00:56.839 --> 01:01:01.709
And I-I am positive that the skill set to
be able to get where we need to be is not

01:01:01.709 --> 01:01:09.759
gonna be inside necessarily. It's gonna be
about our friends coming in to give the help

01:01:09.759 --> 01:01:14.420
and the assistance to-to upgrade us. And-and
so I agree with you completely.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:22.059
And it is, I love having advisory committees.
I have a few that I rely on completely and

01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:25.949
on this issue of technology there's no question
that, and-and this is what I meant earlier

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:32.739
about my pride about being in California where
this is a short drive to come here. This is

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:34.380
you, this is backyard, we're family.
&gt;&gt;David: [laughs]

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.979
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And-and so --

01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:38.700
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Right?

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700
&gt;&gt;David: yes.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: And so-so it-it-it California

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:43.799
AG should be a leader on these issues. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;David: Great. Well, everyone thank-thanks

01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:44.799
so much and Kamala, it's great to have you
here.

01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:45.799
[applause]
You really, really [unintelligible].

01:01:45.799 --> 01:01:50.069
Let's make sure it doesn't take a year and
a half for the next time and you're welcome

01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:51.869
 --
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: That's not your fault.

01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:54.530
&gt;&gt;David: You're welcome anytime.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.479
&gt;&gt;David: And thanks to everybody. Great questions.
&gt;&gt;Kamala Harris: Thank you all. And we'll

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.169
find that woman --
[music]

01:01:58.169 --> 01:02:04.949
Me and my friends were all misunderstood.
They say we stop for nothin' and there's no

01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:09.619
way we ever could.
Now we see everything that's goin' wrong

01:02:09.619 --> 01:02:16.400
With the world and those who lead it
Just feel like we don't have the means

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.939
To rise above and feed it.
