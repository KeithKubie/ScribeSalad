00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:02.810
SPEAKER: Please join
me in giving a warm

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.817
welcome to Amanda Cohen.

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.890
AMANDA COHEN: Thank you for
that lovely introduction.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.130
SPEAKER: Of course, Amanda.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.940
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.600
I know we're all really
excited to have you.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.850
So let's just start about
learning a little bit more

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.890
about your background.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.880
How did you know you
wanted to be a chef

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.764
and eventually open up a
restaurant and a cookbook?

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.430
AMANDA COHEN: I didn't
know any of that.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.950
I still don't know if
I know any of that.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.866
I'm not sure what I want
to do when I grow up.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.060
I really loved cooking as a kid.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.410
I'm from a really big family.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.370
I have four older siblings.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.620
And there's about a five-year
gap between my nearest

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.980
sibling to me in age.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.700
And one day, all
my siblings sort of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.420
ended up-- they
were all in college.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.920
And my mom basically
turned to me and my dad

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.200
and was like, yeah, I'm done.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.630
I'm not cooking anymore.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.914
And we were like, OK.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:00.830
My dad was like, yeah.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.230
I guess I'll just have
lunch at the office.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.470
I don't know what he did.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.450
And I was like,
yeah, but I'm 13.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.339
I've got to eat.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:07.130
She was like, yeah.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.240
You're gonna have
to figure it out.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.030
And I did.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.580
And I really liked to cook.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.310
So every night after school,
I would go home and cook.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.490
And I just fell in love with
that time in the kitchen

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.540
and how much fun it
was to play with food.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.500
And then I sort of
forgot about it.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.370
I went to college.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.700
I came to New York.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.080
I went to NYU.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.260
I went through school.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.700
I traveled a bunch afterwards.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.240
I lived in Hong
Kong for two years.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.840
I lived in LA for a year.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240
And I was really floundering.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.620
And what I really
wanted to do in my life

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.500
was travel and not work.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.559
But I realized that
nothing's free.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.600
So I had to have a skill.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060
And I literally had no skills.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.310
And I was like, well, maybe
if I go to cooking school,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.610
I can travel with this skill.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.220
And I like to cook enough.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.330
So I'll learn how to cook.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.340
And then I can go
anywhere in the world

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.460
and use this great
skill of mine.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.240
So I came back to New York,
and I went to cooking school.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.050
And I started
cooking in the city,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.580
and I actually really
never traveled again.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.050
I've been here ever since, and
that was about 20 years ago.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.050
And even at that time,
as I was cooking,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.599
I didn't know this
was my passion,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.640
it's what I wanted to do.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.440
I just liked it.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.360
I like the culture in kitchens.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.020
I really like sort of exploring
textures and flavors with food.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.160
I like the hours.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.300
I like the whole
crazy environment.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.700
And I kept going and going
and going until one day,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.490
I realized, oh, shit.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.030
This is what I do.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.900
I guess now 10
years into this, I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.480
can call myself a
cook and a chef.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.830
And then I had had a series of
jobs, some of which I liked,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.230
some of which I hated.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.730
But I kind of hit a
point in my career

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.370
where I couldn't go any further.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.620
I had sort of stayed in
the vegetarian world.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.570
And there weren't really any
other vegetarian restaurants

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.540
I could go cook at.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.990
I had sort of cooked at
them all in the city.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.680
And I had this
choice I had to make,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.090
which was either stay
where I was in my career

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.390
or start back at the
beginning and be a line

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.440
cook in a mainstream restaurant,
cook a lot more meat,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.100
rise through the ranks that way.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.070
Or I could say, screw it all,
and start my own restaurant.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.630
And I had actually kept
working for other people,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.450
and then I kind of got
fired from a lot of jobs.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.730
And I realized that,
oh, maybe my only option

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.220
is to work for myself
because obviously, I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.860
don't like other bosses.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.510
And so that's when I
opened the restaurant.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.350
SPEAKER: Well, that's
an awesome story.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.330
How was opening your
first restaurant?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.536
Could you walk us through
what that really is like?

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:45.410
AMANDA COHEN: It's sort
of like going to hell

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.960
and never getting out of it.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.980
And you think you're
at the last circle,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.563
and then you discover
there's actually

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.740
an eighth circle of hell.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.090
And that's just like the first
day of opening the restaurant.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.260
It was really, really hard.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.430
You think you know everything.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.742
You're like, oh, I'll figure
this out as I go along.

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.700
But I've worked in
restaurants for long enough,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.741
so I know how this works.

00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.540
And as it turns out,
you know nothing.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.659
And I've opened a
second restaurant since.

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.950
And the second time, I was
like, oh, I know everything.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.116
I've got this under control.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.430
And I'm still like, fuck.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.750
How do I not know anything?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.680
How do I keep screwing this
up over and over again?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.524
They say that chefs
have really big egos.

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:26.940
I got to tell you,
though, opening

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.430
a restaurant will
just crush that

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.110
over and over and over again.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.810
So the first one
was really hard.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.920
It was small.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.960
It was 350 square feet.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.230
I had about maybe $300,000
was my budget, which,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.710
350 square feet, it
sounds like a lot.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.460
It sounds like it should be
the right amount of money.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.500
I had an awful contractor.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.377
He really, really
screwed us over.

00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.960
He took all my money, basically,
and didn't do a lick of work,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.030
and then we had to bring
in a second contractor.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.570
And if you've ever
built anything,

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.153
you sort of know
that that's the worst

00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:02.400
thing you can do because
then nobody has to take

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.260
responsibility for anything.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.860
So when the plumbing goes
wrong, the second contractor's

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.717
like, oh, yeah.

00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:08.925
Sorry, that's not my problem.

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:10.245
And you're like, yeah,
but you're my contractor.

00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:12.703
And they're like, yeah, but
the first contractor put it in.

00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:13.580
And you're like, ah.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.080
All right.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.970
And he's like, so, it's going
to cost, you know, $500,000.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.850
And you're like, well,
I need a bathroom.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.580
So, OK.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.840
And the build that was
supposed to take three months,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.460
it ended up taking a year.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.910
And instead of
costing $300,000, it

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.660
cost us $700,000
for 350 square feet.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.386
And the place was still crappy.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:37.760
People would walk
in and be like,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.392
what's this little craphole
in the Middle East Village?

00:05:40.392 --> 00:05:42.600
And I'd be like, but it's
such an expensive craphole!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.250
You can't say that!

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.900
It took me a year to
get the floors level.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.646
And they'd be like, yeah, but
that's still rolling downhill.

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:50.520
Yeah, I know.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.970
Well, I tried.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.910
And then when we actually
opened, because everybody

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.870
had really sort of
not done their job,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.789
we opened without gas.

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.830
And so we spent the first
six months without gas,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.290
cooking on Easy-Bake appliances.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.370
So we had a teeny-tiny
little grill,

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.100
a teeny-tiny little fryer.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.307
Our oven was like
a toaster oven.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.890
It wasn't even one of those-- I
don't know if anybody watches,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.190
like, "Real Housewives
of New York"

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.160
where Sonya wants
[INAUDIBLE] her toaster oven.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.660
It wasn't even a fancy
toaster oven like that.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.950
It was really like
an Easy-Bake Oven.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.330
And so we had to really
struggle through that.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.360
And eventually, we got gas.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.030
And we had sort of set
the restaurant up to fail.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.260
And that's a really weird
way to write up a budget,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.968
but I was like, I
don't know if anybody's

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:40.750
going to want to
come and eat my food.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.000
We're going to do
vegetarian, but we're really

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.170
going to focus on vegetables.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.930
And who knows who's going to be
out there that'll want to come

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.430
eat.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.390
And we had set it up so
that if worst came to worst,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.836
I could be the only one in
the restaurant running it.

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.460
And then it seems
really roomy, if it's

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.440
one person doing all the jobs
in a 350 square foot restaurant.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.749
And what happened, actually,
is we got really busy.

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:04.790
And we were really lucky.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.331
So within the first
couple of months,

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:10.300
we started really filling
up, and then filling up way

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.210
too much.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.270
And we kept having
to hire more staff

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.850
and trying to get as many
guests into the restaurant as

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.800
possible.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.780
So in sort of a
normal restaurant,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.110
you would want to do,
if you have 18 seats,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.400
the most you'd really, really
want to do is about 50.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.670
That's about two and
a half turns, plus.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.980
And we started doing
about 65 people a night,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.420
which meant we were doing
three and a half turns.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.540
And the restaurant
just collapsed.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.410
It couldn't withstand
that many people,

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.530
and I had too many staff.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.566
And you'd think with that
number of people coming in

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:44.190
that you would actually
be making money

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.500
and it would be a financial
success, but it's not.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.245
I'm not sure the restaurant
really ever made any money.

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:51.490
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.470
What a great story.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.512
AMANDA COHEN: It's
a really sad story.

00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:57.470
SPEAKER: We talk about
being scrappy at Google,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.480
and using those Easy-Bake
appliances definitely applies

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.610
over here.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.240
So when you think about
the landscape of New York

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.620
restaurants or even just
restaurants in general,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.290
a lot of the trends
are moving towards

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.680
this vegetable-focused cuisine.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.760
How do you think of new ideas?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.000
How do you keep them fresh?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.784
How do you know it's good?

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:23.200
AMANDA COHEN: I
do a lot of drugs.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.975
That's a hard question because
people are always like, oh,

00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:36.350
how do you come
up and do dishes?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.590
And honestly, I'm
like, I don't know.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.380
I think of a vegetable,
I think of a flavor,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.120
I think of a place on the menu
where we need to do something,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.320
and then we go through
a lot of testing.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.130
So whatever the idea is in
my head at the beginning,

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.870
it looks totally different
when it goes out to a customer

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.930
three months later
after all the testing.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.887
We have a broccoli dish.

00:08:58.887 --> 00:09:00.220
We have these broccoli hot dogs.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.690
This is an easy example.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.020
And I knew I wanted to do
something with broccoli.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.160
And we had had this sort
of smoked cauliflower

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.990
dish on the menu.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.762
People loved it.

00:09:09.762 --> 00:09:11.220
It had been on for
about two years.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.730
And I was like,
it's time for that

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.240
to go to the island
of retired dishes.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.850
We need to get something new in.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.479
And broccoli was
the right vegetable,

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:20.020
because it has the
same sort of heft.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.610
So it was filling a
position on the menu.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.068
And I really wanted
to do something

00:09:23.068 --> 00:09:24.890
with barbecue broccoli.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.700
And we had sort of pulled out--
we had pulled all the stalks

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.950
off the broccoli so that there
was just this one single floret

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.000
on its long stock.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.870
And we were going to grill
that and-- I don't know.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.237
It was going to get slathered
in a barbecue sauce.

00:09:40.237 --> 00:09:42.570
And I wanted to do, like,
five different barbecue sauces

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.690
and make it really traditional
and have soft white bread,

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.460
but make it broccoli bread.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.700
And I kept testing this
and kept testing this,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.140
and it was disgusting.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.010
It was the most disgusting
thing we've ever made.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.120
And the broccoli bread was foul.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.680
It was like my staff was
like, stop making us eat this.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.020
And I was like, no.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.560
But I think this one's
a little bit better.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.684
And they're like, it's not.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:04.780
It's just not.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.600
But we had all these components.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.340
And we had made the
broccoli bread into a bun.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.622
And I had sort of had a
temper tantrum, which I'd

00:10:14.622 --> 00:10:15.830
like to say I'm exaggerating.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.860
But really, I had had a
temper tantrum in the middle

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.610
of the restaurant.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.070
We'd been working
on it for months.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:20.710
It was a Sunday.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.751
And I literally just took
everything and threw it

00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:26.220
in the garbage and maybe
threw some things at the wall

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.380
and broke some dishes.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.100
But really, this
is how it happened.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.500
I looked in the garbage,
and the stock of broccoli

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.280
sort of fell into the bun.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.210
And I was like, oh, well, that
looks like a broccoli hot dog.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.800
So we went back to
the drawing table,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.480
and we stopped making
the broccoli buns.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.250
We made this soft, white
Japanese milk bread, really,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.250
really soft, as close to
sort of like a fake bun

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.620
as you can possibly make.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.730
And then we have
our broccoli stalk

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.910
in the middle and the
broccoli sauerkraut

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.180
that we put on top
and this mustard sauce

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.840
and dehydrated broccoli rob
chips with a little vinegar

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.340
powder.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.050
And the dish sort of
rolled out from there.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.860
Now, that dish actually
gave birth to another dish

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.790
because the problem with
the broccoli hot dog

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.100
is we have that one center
stalk of broccoli, right?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.600
But you get, like, eight
cups of broccoli florets.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.470
So at the little
place, we just ate

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.615
a lot of broccoli
for our family meal.

00:11:25.615 --> 00:11:28.564
But you have to imagine,
it would be like every day

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:29.980
if you guys went
to the cafeteria,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.938
and the only thing that
was there was broccoli.

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:34.160
You'd revolt.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.850
And we still couldn't
get rid of it.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.310
We had too much.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.430
And so we actually--
I tried to offer it

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.040
to all the chefs in
the neighborhood.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.575
And people would take a
quart here or a gallon there.

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.325
And then we tried to
actually give it away

00:11:47.325 --> 00:11:49.580
to the restaurants in the
neighborhood and be like,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:49.750
oh, look.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.260
Family meal.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.700
And they're like, yeah, we
can't eat that much broccoli.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.455
And then I actually put up
an ad on Craigslist just

00:11:56.455 --> 00:11:58.176
to give away the broccoli.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.731
And that's how we finally
started really getting rid

00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:01.230
of it.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.063
There was one woman.

00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:04.310
She came and she
would take it all.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.910
And it would be, like, a lot.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.940
Like gallons and gallons
of it, every week.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.500
And we were like, what
is she doing with it?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.280
And we couldn't
actually make a dish

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.864
with the broccoli
at little Dirt Candy

00:12:15.864 --> 00:12:17.238
because we didn't
have the space.

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:19.430
And so everything that
we did at the little one

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.209
was really based on
the space that we had.

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:23.750
How many dishes was the amount
of space we had in the fridge.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.730
How much alcohol we
served was how much space

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.250
we had in the drawers under the
banquette where we stored it.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.600
But at the new place,
we have the space.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.170
We have walk-ins and fridges.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.585
So we were like, OK.

00:12:37.585 --> 00:12:39.210
Well, we've got to
figure out something

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.210
to do with the broccoli.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.880
And that's how we came up with
probably our most popular dish

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.970
at the moment, which is our
Korean fried broccoli, which

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.320
is a deep fried broccoli dish.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.547
And it's addictive, and people
come all over to have it,

00:12:49.547 --> 00:12:50.880
and then they have a second one.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.550
Then they have a third one.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.400
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.400
I'm going to have to pay
for your hospital bills

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.192
because you're gonna die.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.150
And amazingly, we still
have too much broccoli,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.691
and I'm still giving it away to
a restaurant down the street,

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:01.400
but not as much.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.360
SPEAKER: Broccoli
ice cream, maybe?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.190
Very cool.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.940
So as a chef and
restaurateur, you've

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.450
also done some really
amazing things in terms

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.440
of eliminating tipping.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.210
So how did you come
to that decision?

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.820
What were your key drivers?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.540
And how did you react to some of
the press and people's results?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.280
AMANDA COHEN: So I came to it
for a couple different reasons.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.780
The first was about
three, four years ago,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.690
I put out an ad for a
new cook at Dirt Candy.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.439
And we actually
got zero responses.

00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:39.230
And I was like, well,
that's kind of weird.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.370
Because when I had first
opened, the first couple years,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.744
every time I would
put out an ad,

00:13:42.744 --> 00:13:46.400
I would get, like,
30, 40 applications.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.470
And I put out a second one, and
a couple people trickled in.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.902
And thankfully, one stuck
around, and we hired them.

00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:55.360
But it didn't make
any sense to me.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.744
I have a very niche cuisine.

00:13:56.744 --> 00:13:58.660
And there's enough
vegetarian chefs out there.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.820
And we're a well-known
enough restaurant

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.247
that we should have
been getting a lot more.

00:14:03.247 --> 00:14:05.080
There's only so many
vegetarian restaurants,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.069
but a lot of vegetarian chefs.

00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:08.860
So that was sort of
making me think there's

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.060
something weird going on.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.344
And I started asking
all my chef friends

00:14:13.344 --> 00:14:15.010
if they were noticing
the same problems.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.218
And they were like, oh, yeah.

00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:18.390
We're having the hardest
time getting cooks.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.310
And what I sort of realized
was, oh, yeah, of course.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.660
How There's no cooks
left in New York City.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.480
There's a lot of cooks in
cooking schools for students

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.117
training to be cooks.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.700
But they're all going
to other cities.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.960
It's really expensive for
them to live in New York.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.460
And they're traveling an
hour, an hour and a half

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.600
to get to their job where
they're working 14 hours,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.630
and then traveling back.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.020
And the standard pay
rate is about $10

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.500
for a prep cook or line cook.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.690
And you move up, maybe $12.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.960
And sort of the top
you hit is about $15

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.340
until you get very specialized.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.890
But at $10, $12, it's
really, really hard

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.092
to live in New York.

00:14:56.092 --> 00:14:58.050
And so these students
are going to other cities

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.510
and now have great restaurants.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.770
There's great food
scenes everywhere else

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.490
and a higher standard of living.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:03.990
It's easier.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.490
So I was like, ah.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.920
Well, I have to fix this
because in the back of my mind,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.920
I'm like, oh I'm about
to open a new restaurant.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.140
And I'm going to need
about 15 more cooks.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.340
What am I going to do?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.140
Well, obviously,
the natural response

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.556
is, well, I have
to pay them more.

00:15:17.556 --> 00:15:20.080
And that's how I'll attract
them to the restaurant.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.350
But the restaurant doesn't
make that much money.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.460
So margins in restaurants
are really, really small.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.000
Even the best restaurants,
maybe it's, like, 5%.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.750
Most restaurants sort
of hover around 3%.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.730
I run a crappy one,
so it's like 1%.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.100
The money just isn't there.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.400
And we need a lot of labor
for the kind of food I do.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.150
So I was like, OK.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.880
Well, I have to find more money.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.570
But I can't charge more for
what I do because consumers

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.407
will only pay so much.

00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:48.490
And I was like, all right.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.931
I've got to find this money.

00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:51.680
And then I sort of
started looking around.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.540
And I looked at my
server, who I loved.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.750
But she was the only one who
was allowed to take home tips.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.380
And because we were a small
restaurant-- it's 18 seats.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.680
And check average
was about $100.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.480
And if you're doing
60 people a night,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.080
you're pulling in
a lot of money.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.890
And 20% of that is she's walking
out with about $600 a night

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:18.170
on top of the minimum
wage that I'm paying her.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.520
So I was like, oh, yeah.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.900
That is a huge discrepancy.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.410
My line cooks are walking
out with $120, $150,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.744
and she's walking out with $600.

00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:27.410
Doesn't mean that I
don't think that she

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.560
wasn't working really hard.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.180
But somehow, that
doesn't make sense

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.140
if we're all working towards
the same goal in the restaurant.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.137
So I was like, well, maybe I'll
just have my cooks serve more.

00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:37.970
And my cooks helped.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.261
They were always helping serve.

00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:42.480
My dishwasher was helping serve
more, and I was helping serve.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.190
But none of us can
touch the tips.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.530
So that is this law, that if
you accept the tip credit--

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.810
even without the tip credit,
that the only person who

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.950
can receive a tip is
the server because they

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.980
touch the food basically
80% of the time

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.646
once it's left the kitchen.

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:02.270
And that's how it
sort of gets divided.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.569
So then I was like, oh.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.630
Well, I can't take
her tip money away.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.535
That's illegal, and I
don't want to go to jail.

00:17:09.535 --> 00:17:10.660
I wouldn't do well in jail.

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:14.797
So I was like, OK.

00:17:14.797 --> 00:17:16.130
Well, I have to figure this out.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.963
And then I started
researching into tipping.

00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:20.170
And it's a really bad system.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.270
It's sexist.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.480
It's racist.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.380
And it's kind of a false premise
because everybody's like,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.880
oh, yeah.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.810
Well, if the service
is really bad,

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.410
then I'm going to
cut my tip in half.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.360
But the truth is most people
just tip what they tip.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.200
If you're a 20% tipper,
you're a 20% tipper,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.510
good service, bad service.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.500
If you do 15%, you're
15% across the board.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.300
And then I started thinking,
this is even weirder

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.350
that I'm basically just
letting my customers be

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.339
my human resources
department for my server.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:51.880
They're the ones who are sort
of deciding what she gets paid.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.710
And how does this
even make sense?

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.180
Because if I have
a bad night, it's

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.960
the server that's
going to get punished.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.170
And when service is really slow
and the food is really bad,

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.074
you blame the server.

00:18:02.074 --> 00:18:03.740
You don't necessarily
blame the kitchen.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.489
Just all these sort of points
came together in my head.

00:18:07.489 --> 00:18:08.405
I was like, all right.

00:18:08.405 --> 00:18:09.569
You know what?

00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:10.610
Let's get rid of tipping.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.342
Let's see if we
can make this work.

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.980
And it was a really good
time because minimum wage

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.750
is actually going up for servers
and for regular employees.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.412
So I had to figure
out how I was going

00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:23.590
to be able to pay them more.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.290
And yeah, that's
how we came to it.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.060
We started it.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.560
It's pretty amazing
how much people

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.450
really hated the idea that we
were getting rid of tipping.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.050
I have been pretty vocal
about a lot of things

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.600
that I don't like
in the industry.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.490
But nothing has made people
crazier and hate me more than

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.260
getting rid of tipping.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.264
It's like I'm stealing
from my servers.

00:18:49.264 --> 00:18:51.180
The bartenders aren't
going to make any money.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.402
How can I make this decision?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.930
This is one of these sort of
strange things that came out,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.390
but I have never got as
much anti-Semitic hate mail

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.237
except from this.

00:19:04.237 --> 00:19:06.570
I mean, I didn't even know
this really actually existed.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.736
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:12.120
You people are mean, saying
mean things about me.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.350
And they were like,
oh, you're so cheap.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.380
You're so awful.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.254
And I was like, well,
I'm not actually cheap.

00:19:17.254 --> 00:19:21.296
I'm actually trying to be
really nice to my staff.

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:23.590
And a lot of other restaurateurs
were like, oh, it's

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.590
never going to work.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.080
And then it so happened
that it did work.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.400
We haven't gotten rid of it.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.630
Danny Meyer then also went
to his hospitality included,

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.800
which really helped us
because it sort of cemented

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.060
the fact that this is the
way we think the restaurant

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.130
industry is going to move to.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.930
My back off house
is really happy.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.860
They get paid.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.520
And my front of house
is pretty happy.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.380
We get the people who want to
work for a salary, basically.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.010
We are guaranteeing them.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.830
Yes, they could
maybe make $300 one

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.840
night in another
restaurant, but they're also

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.220
never going to have a
night where they make $100.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.810
So it really sort of
evens out in the end.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.230
And then we did
decide to profit share

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.450
because I feel like
for everybody, you

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.100
need a little incentive.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.200
Raises, they're sort of far
and few between in restaurants,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.084
especially for the
front of house.

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.500
And we wanted to
make it more fun.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.560
And we wanted them to really
understand the economics

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.930
and have everybody
feel like they were

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.110
working for the restaurant.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.220
So we share 10% of our
profits when we have it.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.190
We don't always
actually have 10%.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.300
But we do our best.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.180
And we have lots of little
incentives along the way.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.590
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.630
So what's next?

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.790
What's on the next horizon
of changing the restaurant

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.300
landscape?

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.719
AMANDA COHEN: I don't know.

00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:36.510
That's a tough one.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.420
I don't know what really
is out there next.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.550
We have a really big problem
in the city right now.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.230
Restaurants aren't exactly
sustainable as they are.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:52.560
Minimum wage is going to go up
in the next couple of years.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.110
It's not going to help the
tiny margins in restaurants.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.900
Rents are incredibly expensive,
just operating a business

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.160
in the city.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.890
And it's still really
hard to find labor.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.010
No matter how much I'm
trying to pay my staff,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.620
they're just not here.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.687
And we've sort of had
this-- restaurants

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.770
don't charge enough money
for the food they serve.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.730
I know they seem
really expensive.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.540
A lot of labor goes into it.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.750
And it's really
hard to get people

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.200
to understand how much it
costs to eat in a restaurant.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.970
And we all think, oh, well,
this plate of those carrots

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.470
sliders-- if everybody came to
the cafeteria-- oh, you know,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.200
it's $12.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.990
And that's just a
carrot on a bun.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.970
But the reality is
it's way more work

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.580
than just a carrot on a bun.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.905
And on top of that, I'm not
only paying for that labor,

00:21:37.905 --> 00:21:40.280
but I'm also paying for the
toilet paper in the bathroom.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.619
And you all want toilet paper
when you come to a restaurant.

00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:45.660
I certainly know the people
who steal it want it.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.186
And you also want electricity.

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.810
And you want heat in
the winter and air

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.740
conditioning in the summer.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.281
And all of that is
really what you're

00:21:55.281 --> 00:21:58.230
paying for when you
go to a restaurant.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.080
And we don't charge enough.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.580
So we have to figure
out a way where

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.370
we can start
convincing the consumer

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.670
that they have to pay a
little bit more money.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.025
Because if not, restaurants
are going to start to close.

00:22:10.025 --> 00:22:11.670
And what you'll end
up with is a lot

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.270
of those sort of
quick-service restaurants.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.770
Fine dining will disappear.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.080
And that's sort of
the next challenges.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.680
Unfortunately--
or fortunately, I

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.965
don't know-- it's educating
the consumer a lot more.

00:22:23.965 --> 00:22:25.340
SPEAKER: Do you
think that that's

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.300
kind of the solution right now,
just to educate the consumer?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.882
Do you have--

00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:31.132
AMANDA COHEN: I mean, that's
the only solution I know.

00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:33.330
I've tried my best.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.802
I'm trying so hard to
pay my staff a fair wage.

00:22:35.802 --> 00:22:37.260
I want to be able
to pay them more.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.900
In two years, everybody who
walks into the restaurant

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.880
starts off at $15 an hour
unless you're a server, where

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.430
you make a little bit more.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.640
And in a couple
years, that's actually

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.946
just going to be minimum wage.

00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:51.570
So I now have to
figure out a way where

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.540
I can pay them $20 an hour.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.384
I can get that up.

00:22:54.384 --> 00:22:56.550
Well, I have to be able to
charge more for the food.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.620
I have to find the
money somewhere.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.910
So yeah, that is the
only solution I know.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.690
SPEAKER: Yeah, definitely.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.360
We'd love to shift
gears a little

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.720
and talk about your cookbook.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.610
So what made you decide to
one, write a cookbook, but two,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.780
make it a comic,
graphic novel cookbook?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.273
AMANDA COHEN: Well, I
really didn't really

00:23:16.273 --> 00:23:17.314
want to write a cookbook.

00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:20.770
And I had worked for a
number of restaurants

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.990
where sort of within the
first year, the chefs

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.622
had disappeared to
write a cookbook.

00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.427
And I was like, that sucks.

00:23:26.427 --> 00:23:28.010
Because you're not
there, and nobody's

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.259
taking care of the restaurant.

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:32.230
And the restaurant really hadn't
been around enough, I thought,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.050
to tell a story.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.720
But I'm also a snob and
have a lot of opinions.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.254
What do I know?

00:23:37.254 --> 00:23:40.100
So we had gotten approached
a couple of times

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.470
by some editors and
publishers that were like,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.790
oh, we really want you
to write a cookbook.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.415
We really want you
to write a cookbook.

00:23:45.415 --> 00:23:46.850
And I was like, no, no, no.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.470
And then sort of
one day, it sunk in.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.996
And I was like, well, maybe.

00:23:49.996 --> 00:23:51.870
But I don't want to
write a regular cookbook.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.820
I love cookbooks, and I
have a huge collection,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.320
but I'm not sure people actually
cook from cookbooks so much

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.130
anymore.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.480
There's the internet.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.610
I think most people
look online for recipes.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.235
And that's where they
really cook from.

00:24:06.235 --> 00:24:10.160
And cookbooks have become more
like picture books and coffee

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.030
table books.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.363
And I was like, that's not
really representative of what

00:24:13.363 --> 00:24:14.585
we do at the restaurant.

00:24:14.585 --> 00:24:15.960
And if we're going
do a cookbook,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.310
we have to make
something really fun.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.880
So I had-- I don't know.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.811
I was having some huge
fight with my husband.

00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:25.560
And he was like, are
you going to do this?

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.700
And I'm like, I don't
want to do this.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.590
It's not going to be fun.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.250
And he's like, well,
let's make it fun.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.010
I was like, I don't
know how to make it fun.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.176
I was like, we'd have to
do something really stupid.

00:24:33.176 --> 00:24:36.100
And he was like, yeah, like
do it in a comic book form.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.350
And then we both stopped dead.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.260
And we actually sort of
were having this fight

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.426
in the middle of the street.

00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:43.060
So traffic had stopped, too.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:43.750
And we stopped.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.550
And we were like, oh, yeah.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.360
That's perfect.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.140
And it just clicked
right away because we

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.860
knew that if we found
the right artist,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.910
we could really
capture the spirit

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.570
of the restaurant in this book.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.000
Little Dirt Candy was
crazy and was insane

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.080
and was like a circus
every single night.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.630
And I couldn't figure out how I
could just do that in pictures.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.550
But with sort of the
movement that you

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.005
get in a graphic novel, we
really were like, oh, yeah.

00:25:10.005 --> 00:25:11.380
We could really
make this happen.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.046
We can make these
characters come alive,

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:15.100
and we could tell the
story of the restaurant.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.910
And then we could
also sort of rework

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.035
how recipes were written.

00:25:21.035 --> 00:25:22.410
I think it's really
easy to learn

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.850
something visually
and not always

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.110
when there's a lot of words next
to it, especially with cooking.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.510
And we were like, oh, yeah.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.190
We could draw out
so much of this

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.210
and make it seem so real that
it would make a lot of sense

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.390
to the person who's
cooking from it.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.410
And these aren't easy
recipes, so we really

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.460
wanted to make them as easy
as possible for the reader.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.950
So we went back to all the
editors and publishers who

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:44.830
had come to us,
and we were like,

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.380
oh, we're totally going
to write a cookbook.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.380
We have this great idea.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.440
And they're like, no.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.147
Absolutely not.

00:25:50.147 --> 00:25:51.980
And we were like, no,
but it's going to be--

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.938
and they were like, no.

00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:53.860
Way too much work.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.430
And we found Clarkson
Potter, Random House.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.220
They took us on.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.870
And we worked with
them to do this.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.470
And it was amazing.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.170
I'm not an artist whatsoever.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.640
But Ryan Dunlavey, who
was the graphic artist,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.790
he did this amazing job
of just really capturing

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.880
the essence of the
restaurant and making

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.970
it look alive and fun.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.800
And we told the
story through it.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.930
And everybody said
that it wouldn't sell.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.170
And so our first run, I
think, was about 5,000 copies.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.040
And within, like, a month, we
had gone into the second run.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.600
And we're about
40,000 copies now,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.100
which for a cookbook without
a big name attached to

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.655
it is good.

00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:35.460
SPEAKER: Wow, that's awesome.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.290
AMANDA COHEN: I still
haven't made back

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.486
any royalties, though, yet.

00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:39.270
I'm waiting for that.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.390
SPEAKER: Maybe after this.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.740
No, that's awesome.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.370
So we also know
you were on "Iron

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.350
Chef," as mentioned before.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.020
How was that experience?

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.590
What is the 411,
inside scoop that they

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.500
don't show you on Food Network?

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.370
AMANDA COHEN: Actually,
the biggest surprise

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.290
was how long it
took-- not the battle.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.690
The battle is real.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.050
It's that 60 minutes,
and it is crazy.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.560
I don't remember
most of it because it

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.260
happened in such a blur.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.470
But the judging takes
a really long time.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.026
So it's actually four hours.

00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:17.150
And by the end, you're
like, I don't care who wins.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.766
I just want to go home.

00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:20.210
I've been here since 7:00 AM.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.960
I want to go home.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.330
The whole experience
was pretty crazy.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.480
Sort of like everything in
my life, I said no to it.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.980
And then they're
like, are you sure?

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.790
And I was like, I don't know.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.470
I'm just gonna go and
look like a loser.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.220
And I'm gonna lose.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.678
And they were like,
no, you're not.

00:27:35.678 --> 00:27:37.720
And I was like,
yeah, I probably am.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.470
And I was like, I don't
want to look dumb.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.303
And we had to agree
that it would definitely

00:27:41.303 --> 00:27:43.840
be a vegetarian battle.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.650
And you get there,
and it's just a lot

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.510
of bright lights and camera
people all around you.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.710
And the hardest thing
is that Iron Chef really

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.859
knows where everything is.

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:56.650
They've been there.

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.260
They've done it.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.551
They're allowed in the kitchen.

00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:01.170
So they stock their fridges
the way they want to stock it.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.450
They know how the stoves
work and the blenders work

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.444
and the ice cream machine.

00:28:05.444 --> 00:28:07.610
And as the competitor, you
walk in, and you're like,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:08.669
I don't know.

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:09.460
Where's the fridge?

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.920
And they're like, that thing.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.160
And you're like, oh, I
thought that was the freezer.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.490
I thought that was the stove.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.739
None of it really makes sense.

00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:17.170
So in those 60 minutes
when you're cooking,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.330
you're looking for things.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.070
Half the time is like, ah!

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.435
Where am I?

00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:23.810
And you're doing that as some
camera guy is following you

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:24.309
around.

00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:27.110
You're like, I feel crazy!

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.790
And then the Iron Chef, they
know where everything is.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.977
And so they're very calm.

00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:34.060
I did exactly what they
told me I was going to do,

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.930
which is they're like, oh, yeah.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.805
You're the chef, so you
probably don't cook a lot.

00:28:36.805 --> 00:28:38.190
I was like, I'm in my
kitchen every night.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.240
And they're like,
yeah, just be careful.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.530
You're probably going
to cut yourself.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.238
And I was like, I'm
not gonna cut myself.

00:28:42.238 --> 00:28:45.106
Like, two seconds into it, I was
like, my finger's hanging off!

00:28:47.782 --> 00:28:50.754
So in the whole
show, I had Band-Aids

00:28:50.754 --> 00:28:51.670
that kept falling off.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.640
And I was like, it
stopped bleeding!

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.940
I can keep the Band-Aid off!

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.805
And they're like,
no, continuity.

00:28:54.805 --> 00:28:55.790
I was like, ah!

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:00.010
So every three seconds,
I had a new Band-Aid on.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.520
SPEAKER: Stick to the plot.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.007
AMANDA COHEN: And then for us,
the-- we're dumb, all of us.

00:29:06.007 --> 00:29:08.340
I love my people who work in
my restaurant, me included,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.120
but we just didn't quite get
what we were supposed to do.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.150
And they were like,
well, it's five courses.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.900
And we were like, yeah,
it's five courses.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.410
And I don't know what was
actually wrong with our brains.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:24.880
But we made enough food for
like a night in the dining room.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.960
But really, it's only
the judges who sit there.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.590
And it's like three people
taking tiny little bites.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.730
They were all,
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.740
Tiny little sizes.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.080
And we realized that's really
what Chef Morimoto did.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.680
They make these tiny
little portions.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.610
Meanwhile, we made, like, a
gallon of beurre blanc sauce.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.710
And they were like,
what are you going to do

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.834
with all this butter sauce?

00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:44.840
I'm like, I don't know.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.090
SPEAKER: Put it on Craigslist.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.838
AMANDA COHEN: Put
it on Craigslist.

00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:52.290
So we spent a lot of time
doing stupid stuff like that.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.430
And I would like
to say that we won.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.720
But we did not win.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.910
But we did a good showing.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:58.607
And it was fun.

00:29:58.607 --> 00:29:59.690
I would never do it again.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.870
I'm not a competitive
person like that.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.572
But it was really,
really fun to do,

00:30:03.572 --> 00:30:05.072
and I'm glad I have
it on my resume.

00:30:05.072 --> 00:30:06.280
SPEAKER: That is awesome.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.990
What a cool story.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.790
So we'll actually
be taking questions

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.800
in the next few minutes.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.280
So if anyone has a question,
start to think about it

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.150
and head to the mics.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:21.110
We'd love to just hear a little
quickfire-- what is the best

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.152
thing you've ever eaten?

00:30:24.017 --> 00:30:25.850
AMANDA COHEN: I hope I
haven't eaten it yet.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.080
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.440
What is your favorite
vegetable and why?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.820
AMANDA COHEN: Um--

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.370
SPEAKER: I know, it's
like all your kids.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.900
AMANDA COHEN: Actually,
this is-- an onion.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.400
It's actually my
favorite vegetable.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.850
It's really really versatile,
and it's the backbone

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.190
of almost every single dish.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.330
So we couldn't live
without it in the kitchen.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.500
I mean, I don't usually
eat them like an apple,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.200
although sometimes
they're really sweet.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.550
But that is, it works
so hard in the kitchen,

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.974
and it gets such little love.

00:30:55.974 --> 00:30:57.140
SPEAKER: That's a great one.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.970
Any particular onion that
you like better than others?

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.080
AMANDA COHEN: No, no.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.097
I'm an onion lover.

00:31:03.097 --> 00:31:04.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.670
SPEAKER: What's your favorite
thing to do to relax?

00:31:09.496 --> 00:31:11.620
AMANDA COHEN: Actually,
just read a book by myself,

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.762
not talk to anybody.

00:31:12.762 --> 00:31:14.150
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.360
OK, cool.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.760
Well, any questions?

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.607
Oh, looks like we do have one.

00:31:19.607 --> 00:31:20.148
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:20.148 --> 00:31:22.836
So what are the tax implications
of the gratuity-only model?

00:31:22.836 --> 00:31:25.674
And I was also
curious if you see

00:31:25.674 --> 00:31:28.060
any way of changing
the laws to make

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.230
it easier for
restaurants to do what

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.460
you're doing in that regard.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.620
AMANDA COHEN: The tax
implications for me,

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.749
personally, as a business, it
doesn't make a big difference.

00:31:41.749 --> 00:31:44.290
My insurance has gone up a lot
because my payroll has gone up

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.070
a lot.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.100
So that's the biggest
difference cost to me.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.030
Tax implications
are for the consumer

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.180
because now you're
getting taxed on your tip.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.680
Right?

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.462
So sales tax for the
consumer has gone up.

00:31:57.462 --> 00:31:59.420
But it's also only gone
up slightly because you

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.070
used to pay sales
tax on, let's say,

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.860
the $100 portion of your bill.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.762
And now you're
paying it on $120,

00:32:04.762 --> 00:32:06.845
but it's really only that
differential on the $20.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.700
The laws are there to make
what I'm doing actually best

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.400
for everybody.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.220
The laws surrounding
tipping are so complicated.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.540
And even without meaning to,
people break them constantly.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.070
And it's funny things
you wouldn't think of.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.000
Bussers-- this is sort of what
most of the lawsuits, if you've

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.380
ever read the sort of
food gossip papers,

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.070
there's all these lawsuits
against restaurants and tipping

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.780
and who gets paid what.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.520
Well, the easiest
way to understand

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.240
them is bussers who
spend more than 20%

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.190
of their time polishing
are entitled to the tips.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.040
And that's part of
their job, right?

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.590
So then you have to be like,
OK, [? Russal ?], you've

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.512
been polishing for
an hour, and you've

00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:57.720
got to get back on the floor.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.240
I've got to switch you
off with somebody else.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.489
And even if he's like, but
I like doing the polishing,

00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:03.730
he's not entitled to the tips.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:08.190
So the law actually
works against tipping.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.180
It works for exactly
what I'm doing,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.420
which is paying
everybody a fair wage

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:22.470
and not having to sort of be
a part of that tipping system.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:28.920
It would be nicer if-- yeah,
the way we do get hit a little

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.169
is on our state taxes for
employees, like FUDA and SUDA.

00:33:32.169 --> 00:33:34.210
That would be nice if
those were reduced a little

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.750
because we're getting
hit with that.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:43.455
And if you weren't part
of the tip credit system,

00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:45.330
if there was some other
credit system but you

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.536
were paying your
employees a fair wage.

00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:49.244
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:51.510
SPEAKER: Very interesting.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.040
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.600
a little bit about
vegetarianism,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.670
both kind of your personal
philosophy towards it

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.639
and then the role that you think
it kind of plays or should play

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.680
in the food scene in
general, especially as there

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.460
are more vegetarian or
vegetable-focused restaurants

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.460
opening.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.900
AMANDA COHEN: Well,
I'm not a vegetarian.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:18.340
I was one for about
maybe 15 years or so.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.120
And I gave it up
because I just had

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.769
gone to-- I was really tired
of the vegetarian plate

00:34:24.769 --> 00:34:26.190
at restaurants, to be honest.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.815
I was like, I can't eat any more
grilled portabellas and a side

00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:33.281
of rice, even at
fancy restaurants.

00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:34.739
If I'm going out
to eat, I'm really

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.449
not becoming a better chef.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.622
Obviously, other
chefs just really care

00:34:39.622 --> 00:34:41.830
about the protein on the
plate and not the vegetable.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.746
That was about 15 years ago.

00:34:43.746 --> 00:34:46.420
And times have changed.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.400
But for me, I'm not
a vegetarian anymore.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.130
And I really became a vegetarian
because I don't like meat.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.160
So it's just a personal
taste preference.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.140
I've never really missed it.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.779
I do think the world's
diet is changing.

00:35:02.779 --> 00:35:04.570
I think people want to
eat more vegetables.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.910
I still think they
really want to eat meat.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.240
And it's all about
finding the balance.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.450
So I think restaurants
like mine that

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.100
are really
vegetable-focused are always

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:20.452
going to be a smaller proportion
of the restaurants out there.

00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:22.910
But the more people can offer
vegetables, the more exciting

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.220
it is.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.761
And we're starting to see some
really exciting things happen,

00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:28.220
particularly in New York
City, where people are now

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.700
getting used to eating their
vegetables at restaurants.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.080
It doesn't seem so awful.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.634
SPEAKER: What's your favorite
dish on your menu right now?

00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:43.430
AMANDA COHEN: Probably
the carrot sliders,

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.150
which is what we
served downstairs.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:51.500
And also, we have this pepper
dish, which is delicious.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.930
But mostly I like it because
it's really, really annoying

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.205
to my staff to have to make.

00:35:55.205 --> 00:35:56.270
And they have to do it.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.970
And we take bell peppers,
and we filet them.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.860
So we peel off one side of the
skin and peel off the other,

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.160
and then we punch a
lot of holes out of it

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.260
so they look lifesavers.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.510
And it's a lot of work, and
they're really angry at me.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.090
So I find that pleasurable.

00:36:16.214 --> 00:36:17.152
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:36:17.152 --> 00:36:18.865
We'll take a question.

00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:19.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.464
So Dirt Candy is a
really great name

00:36:22.464 --> 00:36:24.380
for a restaurant that's
focused on vegetables.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.921
I wonder if you had
any sort of story

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:28.500
about how you came up with
that name and its origins.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.000
AMANDA COHEN: Well, again, it
was a fight between my husband

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.674
and I. So we were
trying to figure out

00:36:34.674 --> 00:36:35.840
what to name the restaurant.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.770
And we wanted to stay away
from a one-word restaurant

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.090
name, really because-- and
this is weird to say here--

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.700
it's really hard to google it.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.080
If you're called Fork, and
you just put in "fork,"

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.020
everything shows up,
from actual forks--

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.040
like a fork in the road-- to a
million other restaurants named

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.530
Fork.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.150
So that was out.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.280
And we were trying
to really figure out

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.160
what the restaurant represented,
what vegetables represented.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.049
And as things escalate, we were
fighting about what they meant

00:37:14.049 --> 00:37:14.840
and what they were.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.548
And at one point, I
was like, no, they're

00:37:16.548 --> 00:37:18.300
like candy from the earth.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.690
And my husband was
like, dirt candy!

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.690
And we both stopped, and
we were like, oh, yeah.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:24.600
Dirt Candy.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.360
That's good.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.900
That's really, really good.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.890
And then before
we had opened, we

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.456
thought we were going to be
more of a vegetable and fruit

00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:33.955
restaurant.

00:37:33.955 --> 00:37:36.204
So we were like, well if we
call ourselves Dirt Candy,

00:37:36.204 --> 00:37:38.200
we can be Dirt
Candy and Tree Meat.

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:42.330
And then we both stopped, and
we were like, no tree meat.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.980
We cannot call a
restaurant Tree Meat,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.590
although I still really like it.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.100
And then we sort
of went from there.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.350
We were like, yeah Dirt Candy.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.030
It's perfect.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.240
And then I actually went to
go buy Dirt Candy, the name,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.490
and it was taken.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.340
That's why I'm dirtcandynyc.com.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.350
And it actually pulled up
my other favorite name,

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.710
not necessarily for a
restaurant but for a project

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.580
that one day I want
to work on, which

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.890
is nastybonbons.com, which would
be [INAUDIBLE] sister to Dirt

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.766
Candy.

00:38:13.766 --> 00:38:15.165
So I should have bought it.

00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:16.540
I really like
that, nastybonbons.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.220
And so we took Dirt Candy.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.661
And we knew it was going to be a
difficult name for some people.

00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:25.160
And we did.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.550
I mean, still to this day, eight
years later, two restaurants,

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.396
and countless reviews, we
are still getting, well,

00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:35.020
that's the worst name
for a restaurant.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.436
And I'm like, I don't really
care because you remember it.

00:38:37.436 --> 00:38:38.860
And you will never forget it.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.880
And so we branded
ourselves with this name.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.100
SPEAKER: How do you deal with
criticism and people constantly

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.640
critiquing your food?

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.850
AMANDA COHEN: I cry a lot.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.840
I cry by myself in the bathroom.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.316
I try not to read the reviews.

00:38:55.316 --> 00:38:57.315
And then I'm totally
lying, because I read them,

00:38:57.315 --> 00:38:58.667
which everybody does.

00:38:58.667 --> 00:39:00.250
I now have other
people who read them,

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.833
and they sort of
filter it out for me.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.910
The truth is, it's hard.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:08.630
It's really hard.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.850
We all work really hard.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.980
I'm in the restaurant
every single day.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.370
My team is in the restaurant.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.820
And we have staff meetings.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.700
We do our best to
do customer service.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.840
We're constantly asking
people how things are

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.560
or what else we can do for them.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.870
And when you read
something the next day

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.000
where it's really
negative, and you're like,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.514
but I was right there.

00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:31.930
Why didn't you say
something to me

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.560
in person where I can fix it?

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.550
I can't fix it if
you've left, really.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.650
I can offer to
refund your meal if I

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.450
can get an email address
or a phone number.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.760
But the truth is, I
want to help you there.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.500
My goal, even though I am a
chef and, yes, I have an ego,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.930
is I'm a restaurateur.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.700
And I want to give you the
best customer service possible.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.699
And I want to sure you
have the best experience.

00:39:53.699 --> 00:39:56.250
And such a small part
of going to a restaurant

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.697
is about the food.

00:39:57.697 --> 00:39:59.280
It's about the company
and the service

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.821
and everything else
that makes it up.

00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:03.796
And that's my job, is to make
you really, really happy.

00:40:03.796 --> 00:40:05.670
Hopefully, I can make
you love the food, too.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.540
You might not like
it, and that's OK.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.750
My food is definitely
not for everybody.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.670
But the experience is
what I want you to have.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.390
And it's really, really
hurtful, actually,

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.070
when we read negative reviews
because we're like, well,

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.060
we're right there.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.000
You could have said something.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.040
You thought this was too salty?

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.630
I'm so sorry.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.680
We would have remade it.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.980
Or you didn't like
this, or you thought

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.730
you weren't getting
paid enough attention.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.270
Whatever the thing is, I can
only fix it at the moment.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.210
SPEAKER: For sure.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.270
Definitely.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.052
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:36.135
First of all, the carrot
sliders were really good.

00:40:36.135 --> 00:40:37.604
Had one for lunch.

00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:38.520
So thank you for that.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.184
AMANDA COHEN: Thank you.

00:40:40.184 --> 00:40:41.960
AUDIENCE: They were
super delicious.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.589
And next, I was thinking
about all the challenges

00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:46.880
of having a restaurant in
New York City that you talked

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.565
about-- how expensive it is, and
how hard it is to get staffed.

00:40:49.565 --> 00:40:51.940
I'm wondering if you've ever
think about leaving New York

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.921
and setting up shop
somewhere else?

00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:55.920
And if you don't, why you
stay in New York City?

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.660
And if you do, where you'd go?

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.429
AMANDA COHEN: I stay because
I have a 10-year lease, which

00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:03.220
I can't get out of.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.070
Also, I live here.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.750
This is my home.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.120
I've been here
for over 20 years.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.112
I love, love the city.

00:41:13.112 --> 00:41:14.570
But it wasn't this
hard beforehand.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.170
And it's become really
hard and really expensive

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.100
over the last couple of years.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.430
And I probably will never
open another restaurant

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.190
in New York City.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.550
It's just financially--
I don't know how

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.850
people afford to do it, really.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.770
So if I were to go somewhere
else, I would probably go home.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.200
I'd probably maybe open
another place in Toronto, which

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.554
is where my entire family is.

00:41:39.554 --> 00:41:41.470
It would be nice to spend
some time with them.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.803
But I'm not sure I want to
ever open another restaurant.

00:41:43.803 --> 00:41:46.450
It's a lot of work,
and I'm getting old.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.580
I don't want to stand
that long anymore.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.910
I've been standing for 15
hours a day for about 20 years.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.260
I'm tired.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.114
Restaurants are really,
really hard work.

00:41:58.114 --> 00:41:59.751
AUDIENCE: So it's
been fascinating,

00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:01.500
as someone who likes
going to restaurants,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.320
to hear about your
experiences and your opinions.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.940
I was really curious
about what do

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.560
you think about
takeout and delivery

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.470
because that's a big thing here.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.310
I wonder what you as a
restaurateur think about that?

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.150
AMANDA COHEN: I mean,
I think it's great

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.320
because I eat it when I'm
not working all the time.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.690
So thank goodness for Seamless.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.180
I don't know what I would do.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:26.580
It's almost like
takeout and delivery,

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.840
it's like they're
two different foods.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.060
It's like they're not the same.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.350
We can't do delivery
from Dirt Candy

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.475
because our portions only look
normal sized in the restaurant.

00:42:41.799 --> 00:42:44.090
I don't know if it's because
of the plate size or what,

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.570
but when we pack it up
when somebody's like, oh,

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.712
I'll take that to go,
we're always like, huh.

00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:49.670
How did that fit in that
tiny little container,

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.380
but we spent three
weeks making it?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.720
So it is really,
really different.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.602
The takeout model,
though, and delivery

00:43:00.602 --> 00:43:02.560
and all those sort of
quick-service restaurants

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.059
are great.

00:43:03.059 --> 00:43:08.400
And they have found this way
to make portions decent sized.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.040
They get you
through fast enough,

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.220
and its sort of that
satisfying comfort moment.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.757
But it's really,
really different

00:43:14.757 --> 00:43:16.340
than going out to
eat at a restaurant.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.270
And I do think because people--
especially in New York,

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.230
there is so much
takeout and delivery.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.830
It changes your expectations
at a restaurant.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.280
You forget that you're
there for the experience

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.740
and to be there with company
and to have a bottle of wine

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.840
or cocktails or whatever
it is and really sit

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.350
and enjoy the moment versus
getting something really

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.690
fast and eating it at your
desk or in front of the TV

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.770
and being finished with it.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.400
And because there are so
many takeout and delivery

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.620
kind of places, it
has, I do think,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.192
changed the way people
eat in restaurants.

00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:53.020
SPEAKER: Yeah, for sure.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.240
Any other questions
before we wrap up?

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.102
Go for it.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.790
Oh, wait-- what's your
go-to Seamless order?

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.536
I have to ask.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.960
AMANDA COHEN: Well, we have
a lot of fights about it.

00:44:14.846 --> 00:44:15.720
You know what's hard?

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.770
Every time we find a
restaurant we really like,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.775
I swear the next
week, it's gone.

00:44:20.775 --> 00:44:23.061
I'm like, what happened to you?

00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:25.310
We have a Thai place on our
corner that's pretty good.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.960
And then I feel really bad
saying it's on our corner.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.250
I'm like, how can I not go
out and pick it up myself?

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.022
It's like a block
and a half away.

00:44:31.022 --> 00:44:31.980
But I'm still like, no.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.475
You got to come.

00:44:34.475 --> 00:44:36.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
wondering whether, as running

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.640
a vegetarian restaurant, you
feel that there's a pricing

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.540
pressure where
customers in New York

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.780
are willing to pay more if
there's a fancy piece of meat

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.130
on the plate than
they will if you put

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.290
even more labor into making
a really nice vegetable,

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.610
but they say, oh,
it's just a vegetable.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:53.930
I don't need to pay for it.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.740
AMANDA COHEN: Are
you in my brain?

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.240
Yeah.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.615
I mean, that's
actually, I think,

00:44:58.615 --> 00:45:01.490
one of the really big
problems with the restaurant.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.440
We sort of have
this price point we

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:09.370
can't go above, which
is, like, $22, $23.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.080
That's sort of the cutoff point.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.770
After that, we will
see in reviews,

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.780
oh, I'm not going to pay
that much for this food.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.810
But I do think if I had that
same dish at a steakhouse,

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.910
I could probably charge $30,
and nobody would sort of

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.160
think twice about it.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.660
It is where you're
eating and what's

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.202
sort of getting
served next to it.

00:45:27.202 --> 00:45:29.160
One of the really hard
things with vegetables--

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.868
and this is my fault.
It's my restaurant.

00:45:30.868 --> 00:45:31.630
It's what I do.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.010
But they are really
labor intensive.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.260
And if you think like, oh,
I put a whole piece of meat

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.593
in the oven, and I just cook it.

00:45:37.593 --> 00:45:41.790
Well, every single carrot has to
be peeled and diced and cooked

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.930
and done something else to it.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.700
And so that labor
difference is huge.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.920
People walk into my kitchen
and be like, oh, my God.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.240
There are so many of you here.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.781
I'm like, I know,
I'm so embarrassed.

00:45:52.781 --> 00:45:55.160
I'm like, why am I embarrassed?

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.350
So just that difference, yeah.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.779
I mean, I truly believe if I
put a piece of fish on my menu,

00:46:02.779 --> 00:46:04.820
I could raise all my menus
by a couple of dollars

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.760
and everybody would be
like, yeah, of course.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.426
She serves fish.

00:46:07.426 --> 00:46:08.470
Nobody would order it.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:10.604
But I would have it.

00:46:10.604 --> 00:46:12.020
Like, oh it's that
fish restaurant

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.590
with lots of vegetables.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.850
She can charge $30 a plate.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.660
SPEAKER: What's your
view on local produce

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.210
versus organic produce?

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.480
I feel like a lot
of the times now,

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.720
it's a lot of farm to table.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.290
Do you feel like that's a
really important element

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.170
to have in a restaurant
or your restaurant?

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.822
Or are you comfortable
with any type of vegetable?

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:34.197
AMANDA COHEN: I'm comfortable
with any type of vegetable.

00:46:37.198 --> 00:46:39.971
If you can afford it and you
want to buy organic, great.

00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:40.470
I can't.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.100
My prices would be
ridiculously high.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.430
We do some organic stuff.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:48.040
A lot of our dairy is,
half of our dry goods,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.850
and certain produce items.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.630
But for the most
part, we're not.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.660
Local when it's
in season, great.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.500
But we live in the Northeast.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.420
I wrote a whole
piece about tomatoes

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.360
and how if you want a
tomato, just go buy it.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.121
Don't feel guilty.

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.870
Better to eat a tomato
than something else

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.720
in the middle of winter.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.687
All food comes off a truck
in a box somewhere, anyways.

00:47:12.687 --> 00:47:14.520
We have a big enough
problem in this country

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.890
that people don't eat
enough vegetables.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.060
New York might be sort
of outside of that,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:24.195
but the USDA statistics for
how much vegetables are eaten

00:47:24.195 --> 00:47:26.430
are really, really
depressing in this country.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.920
And the two most
popular vegetables

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:35.160
are potato and tomato because
it's French fries and ketchup.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.610
So I'm like, yeah, I'm not
sure local is the issue.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:41.470
I'm just getting people
to eat vegetables.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.360
So yeah, when we
can, we buy local.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.360
But we can't always,
and my goal is

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.170
to get people to eat
their vegetables.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:49.934
And once I can get
them to do that,

00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:51.975
maybe I'll try a little
harder with other things.

00:47:51.975 --> 00:47:52.558
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:47:52.558 --> 00:47:53.330
Awesome.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.765
We'll take one more question.

00:47:54.765 --> 00:47:55.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.800
I live in the Lower East Side.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.175
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:00.530
a little bit about your
choice of location and kind

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.705
of the restaurant scene in
Lower East Side and sort

00:48:02.705 --> 00:48:05.130
of how you feel it compares
to other parts of the city

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.100
and stuff like that?

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.160
AMANDA COHEN: I've
only ever owned

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.243
a restaurant in the East
Village or the Lower East

00:48:09.243 --> 00:48:11.420
Side-- totally
different neighborhoods.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.720
They're actually very similar.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.200
The thing with the
Lower East Side

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.000
is it's probably one
of the last areas

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.790
where you can get a
good deal on rent.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:24.830
And that's why I chose it.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.570
Rent is really expensive
in New York right now.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:32.640
So for my small space,
which was 350 square feet,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.810
my rent started off
at $1,800, which

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.660
was really fair and decent.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.102
And eight years later,
it was at $4,000.

00:48:40.102 --> 00:48:41.830
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.950
AMANDA COHEN: So those numbers
just don't make any sense.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:49.310
Now, 10 blocks south, which is
where I am in Lower East Side,

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.866
I have about 2,500 square
feet, and my rent is $10,000.

00:48:52.866 --> 00:48:54.560
So that makes a lot more sense.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.720
And there you can still
get really good rent deals.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.955
The restaurant scene, I
think, in the Lower East Side

00:49:00.955 --> 00:49:01.830
is the most exciting.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.434
The restaurants are really nice.

00:49:04.434 --> 00:49:05.850
I loved being in
the East Village.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:08.920
But I don't know, they
were mean over there.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.012
Nobody wanted to
take my broccoli.

00:49:11.012 --> 00:49:13.180
In the Lower East Side,
everybody's taking it.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.680
No, they're really nice, and
we have a really nice community

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.306
of restaurants.

00:49:16.306 --> 00:49:17.930
And I think the food
scene is exciting.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.610
And I think because
the rents are cheaper

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.484
and you can sort
of make a living,

00:49:24.484 --> 00:49:26.150
people are more willing
to take chances.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.480
And so it's a lot of fun.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.590
There's just this really young,
vibrant feeling down there.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.060
Other neighborhoods in the city
to me seem really stagnant.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.860
It seems like it's the same
restaurant opening over again.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.530
And I think in the
Lower East Side,

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:40.456
you get to see a little
bit more diversity.

00:49:40.456 --> 00:49:42.700
SPEAKER: Super cool.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.370
All right.

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.070
Well, that is it.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:47.740
Everyone should go stop by Dirt
Candy and make a reservation.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.740
AMANDA COHEN: Please do.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.470
SPEAKER: At 86 Allen Street.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:54.300
We also have some
comic book cookbooks

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.580
for sale, Googler
discount, for $5.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.130
So feel free to grab
one after the talk.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.040
Amanda, thank you
so much for coming.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.290
The food was amazing.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.335
And I know I can
speak for myself

00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:07.293
and everyone else-- this
talk has been awesome.

00:50:07.293 --> 00:50:08.080
AMANDA COHEN: Good.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:08.660
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.826
AMANDA COHEN: Thank you all.

00:50:09.826 --> 00:50:12.790
[APPLAUSE]
