00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.130
 10) The Chinese wall is the only man-made object visible from space. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.809
 To be able to see something on Earth from space, it must be quite big, the 8047 km long 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.570
 Chinese wall is certain. But it is only 9 meters at its widest. 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.489
 Here is a photo taken from the International Space station, 321 km above the earth. 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.329
 Can you see the Chinese wall between the mountain tops? 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.360
 Here, right? No, that is a river, the wall is actually here. Even if you would guess the place 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.660
 by pure happiness, this photo was taken with a telephoto lens, so out of the window 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.710
 from the space station it looks more like this - which is pretty clear the Chinese wall 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.180
 let count as "not visible." With regard to the man-made part of this myth 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 our glorious man-made cities that pour light into space are certainly visible. 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 9) Cracking your knuckles causes rheumatism. Socially repulsive? Yes. Causes rheumatism 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.620
 later in your life as a punishment of karma? No. 8) People only use 10% of their brains. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.560
 If you have never seen medical drama in the last 30 years, you would have seen it 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 that doctors now have machines that can look into people in brains and, unlike 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.369
 what many people think, 90% of neurons don't sit idle all day. 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.860
 Although scientists do not yet know exactly what each part is doing, they do know that all 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 small parts are important. So if you think you have 90% of your brain 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 can spoon out and would still be fine, then you might only use 10% of it. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.780
 7) Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow. 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.359
 This is technically correct, but misleading. Some languages, such as German, like it 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.819
 words put together by stringing several smaller words together, making German words 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.369
 sometimes absurdly long. The languages ​​of the Inuit also use compound words 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.869
 so instead of saying 'yellow snow' as you say in English, if Inuit speaker combined 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.909
 the two become in one, but it's not really a new word, but rather a stroke of grammar. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.749
 So technically, Eskimos have 100 ways to describe snow ... but then every one has 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.200
 andre language that too. 6) You need 8 glasses of water every day. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.009
 Although some people would undoubtedly benefit from drinking more water and less 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.039
 junk, there is no scientific evidence that 8 glasses of water per day is the recommended amount 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.069
 and sometimes it seems that it might be too much. And now that we are talking about water ... 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.759
 5) Water from the tap is bad but spring water is good. If you live in a paradise, free of regulations 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.459
 from the government such as, say, Somalia, then you may have good reasons to prefer spring water than 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.869
 drinking tap water. But modern, functioning countries have health regulations 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.170
 with regard to both types of water. In addition, water is extremely tight as far as transportation 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.730
 from those pristine mountain peaks and glaciers enormously expensive making spring water 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.250
 companies don't bother. 'Source' water is often just local tap water 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 with a chic label and a huge increase in price. 4) Chewing gum takes seven years to get through 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 digestion system. This is quite easy to refute yourself, but 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 it's easy to see why most people don't try this experiment themselves. 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.800
 3) Blood in your veins is blue. The idea here is that the blood in veins is blue 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.370
 and does not turn red until it is exposed to the oxygen in the air. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.630
 This thought is not unreasonable. After all, veins already appear blue and medical diagrams 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.360
 show arteries as red and veins as blue, but that's the same mistake as' Mountain 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.270
 Dew 'is green because it is in a green bottle. Pour it out and discover that Mountain Dew actually 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.790
 piss yellow, which is probably the reason why she is storing it in a green bottle 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.570
 sit. The next time you have blood taken from a vein, 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.010
 take a look. What color is it? Red. How much oxygen is there in a good syringe? 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.270
 No. Unless you are a horseshoe crab or Plavalaguna, 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.850
 your blood is not blue. 2) Fan death 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.750
 This myth is South Korea's specialty. Here it is believed that if you spend too much time with 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.710
 an electric fan spends in an enclosed space, it will use up all your oxygen and 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.730
 you will choke. How exactly a fan made of lifeless, anaerobic 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.060
 plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear, but hilariously have South Korean 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.580
 fan producers - who should know better - added timers to fans to counteract 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.290
 that they would stay on too long. 1) People swallow 8 spiders annually while they sleep. 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.860
 Probably while you are in bed, helpless, unconscious with your face wide open, everyone 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.490
 eight spiders find their way into your mouth and you swallow them reflexively. 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.349
 This is of course ridiculous: spiders love hot, humid places so eight is probably a much lower bet.
