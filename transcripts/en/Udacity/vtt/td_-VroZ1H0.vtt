00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.450
Now I've decided to add only my reflections from lesson one to the first commit.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.770
I did this because I want to have one commit per logical change and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.400
I think of the two lessons as logically separate.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.060
But this is a bit subjective, so you may have decided to

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.450
add both files to the staging area and commit them both at once.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.620
To do this, I ran git add lesson_1_reflections.txt.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.690
After that, git status shows that my lesson_1_reflections file is in

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.910
the staging area, which is why it's marked Changes to be committed, and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.570
my lesson_2_reflections file is still untracked.
