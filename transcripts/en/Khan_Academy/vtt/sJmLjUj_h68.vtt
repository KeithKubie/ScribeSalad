00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.350
What is the perimeter
of the shape?

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.980
Each square in the grid is
a 1 by 1 centimeter square.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.160
So all we have to do
is add up the lengths

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.050
of these blue segments
right over here.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.890
And they put it
on this nice grid.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.150
And each box here is 1 by 1.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.820
So let's say we start up here.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.620
We want to make sure that we
only go to where we started

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.040
and we don't double count.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:30.973
So this perimeter is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:41.780
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24 centimeters long.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.474
So it is 24 centimeters.

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:45.390
The other way we could
have thought about this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.973
is you could have looked at the
length of each of these sides.

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:51.620
So this is 1 plus 2
plus 3 plus 1 plus 3

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.530
plus 1 plus-- what is this--
5 plus 2 plus 4 plus 2.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.560
And you would have also
gotten 24 centimeters.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.692
What is the perimeter
of the square?

00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:04.900
So once again, it's the
length of all of the segments

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.350
that define the outside
boundary of the square.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.480
And by definition, a square--
all of its sides are equal.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.590
So you have 4 sides that
are all 7 meters long.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.560
So you could say it's
7 meters plus 7 meters

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.150
plus 7 meters plus
7 meters, or it's

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.725
4 times 7 meters or 28 meters.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.660
Let's do one more.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.720
What is the perimeter
of the regular pentagon?

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.950
So it's a regular pentagon,
which means all of its sides

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.969
have the same length.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.260
And they give us a side of one.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.350
The length of one is 2.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.340
So all of the sides
have length 2.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.860
So it's going to be 2 plus
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.219
or essentially five 2's.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.010
Or another way of
thinking about it is it's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.910
5 times 2, which
is going to be 10.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.130
You have five sides
of this pentagon.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.080
Each of those sides
are 2 units long.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.473
So 2 units long times 5 sides
is going to be 10 units.
