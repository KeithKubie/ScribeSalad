BUKI: I'm Buki.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.360
I'm a software engineer
and a fine artist,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.943
and this is how I code.

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:07.210

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.870
So when I'm coding from home,
I like to be super comfy

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.740
and really relaxed.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.945
I'm sitting on my bed.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.630
I have my fur because,
yeah, I'm extra.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.538
So I have fur on my bed, I
have fairy lights as well,

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:22.080
and then I need loads of feed,
so I have my chocolate cookies

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.090
on the side and my tea.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.550
And then I have
my sibling coming

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
in asking to use my Oyster
because I'm working from home.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.020
When I'm on the
terminal, if I needed

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.150
to get to a specific file,
sometimes the file pathway

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.440
could be really long, so for me
to shorten it down to a word,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.030
I would create an alias.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
And the way that is done is that
you are still in the terminal,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.715
and then you click
open.bash_profile.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.340
When you do that,
you have to make sure

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.750
you're actually on the
home directory as well,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.400
and that will open up
the bash_profile window.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.440
And then within the window,
you write down the alias,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
so the syntax with that
would be literally the word

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.980
"alias" followed by the
shortcut name, which

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.550
is whatever you want it
to be, and then = quotes.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.080
And within the quotes, you write
the command or the file path

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.155
that you want to replace.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:17.640
So it's the alias,
shortcut name, command.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.840
Whoo!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.290
