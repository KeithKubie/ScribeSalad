00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.560
The goal can be stated simply enough: the
overwhelming priority, when on a date with

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.610
someone we like, is to persuade them to like
us back. But the simplicity of the mission

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.970
masks the complexity required to achieve it.
Typically, the advice focuses on externals:

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.450
what to wear, when to unfurl a napkin, what
to order… But such counsel, however well-meaning,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.830
is at odds with what we ourselves know about
attraction: that it is profoundly focused

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.789
on psychology. However much we may deny it
to friends, a date is ultimately a search

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.410
for a potential long term-partner. So what
really renders someone attractive on dates

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.579
are signs that they are emotionally well-equipped
for what good-enough long-term relationships

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.800
require. The capacity to find an ideal full-bodied
Chianti on a menu may be impressive, but what

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.390
we’re really alert for are signs that someone
is going to be a decent companion twenty years

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.200
from now when we have received a difficult
medical diagnosis or are feeling weepy and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.860
ashamed at the progress of our careers. Here
then are some of the things we might do to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:17.010
prove attractive to another person on a date:
i. Tell them that we are a bit mad. We might,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.970
in the course of the conversation, light-heartedly
drop in that we’re not quite sane. Perhaps

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.720
we have great difficulty getting to sleep
or get very anxious in social situations.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720
Maybe we are often deeply sad on Sunday evenings
or have a painful rivalrous relationship with

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.320
a sibling. The key is that, as we reveal these
vulnerabilities, we can suggest we have a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.169
mature, compassionate, unruffled relationship
to them. Yes, we may be a little mad, but

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:36.169
we are eminently sane enough to know about
and be unfrightened of our follies; we have

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.169
mapped them, are able to warn others of them
and can protect those we love from their worst

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.730
sides. What we require in a partner is not
someone who is perfect, but someone with a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.520
good handle on their manifold imperfections
– who can warn us of these in good time,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.210
and not act them out in ways that will ruin
our lives.

It is deeply reassuring to witness vulnerability

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.170
well-worn and madness confidently understood;
to see someone mature enough to talk about

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.620
their immaturities in an undefended and serenely
curious way. Over the long-term, every possible

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.620
partner will be revealed as rather crazy in
some dimension of existence or another. So

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.620
what really counts is not whether or not they
are psychologically complicated, but how they

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.620
relate to this complexity: the degree of insight,
calm, perspective and humour they can bring

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.969
to bear upon it. Conversely, there should
be nothing more terrifying on a date than

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.920
a person who sticks a little too aggressively
to the idea that they are totally sane and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.569
entirely normal. Anyone over the age of twenty
possessed of the idea that they are ‘easy

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.390
to live with’ has evidently not begun to
understand themselves or their impact on others.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.750
We should probably skip desert and head home
early. ii. Ask our partners how they are a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.909
bit mad The enquiry should sound playful,
natural and wholly compassionate. Having laid

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:39.909
out our flaws of character, we should take
it as a given that – despite their evident

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.909
strengths and accomplishments – our date
too will have a litany of their own madder

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.450
sides. We should create a safe space in which
we imply that it is extremely unsurprising

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.769
that our date should be a bit ‘broken’
in certain areas; everyone is. We can gently

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.409
enquire into what makes them in particular
anxious or depressed, what was untenably difficult

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.279
in their childhoods or what they in particular
regret and are ashamed of. This can prove

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:08.340
charming because what we’re ultimately looking
for in love are not people who find us perfect,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.239
but people who will not flinch from the sight
of our wounds. We want to be seen for who

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.920
we really are and forgiven; not mistaken for
someone else, idealised – and then one day

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.450
condemned.

iii. Reveal we’ve been a bit lonely and
sad lately We often assume that people want

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.560
to hear that things are going brilliantly
for us – and that we become winning for

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.579
others when we can show we’re triumphing
in the world. But what really warms us to

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.430
others is evidence that they share in some
of the very difficulties and confusions that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.499
we are beset by in our private selves. If
love involves a desire for an end to loneliness,

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:56.450
then some of what we no longer want to be
lonely with are our more melancholy dimensions

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.400
that most people have no time for or interest
in – and that we therefore have to take

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.950
care to hide from others in a bid to look
competent and strong. How seductive, therefore,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.029
to stumble on someone around whom we sense
we will no longer have to be jolly in a brittle

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:11.150
way; someone who can give us room, through
their own candour, to confessions of feelings

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.420
of loss and sorrow. There can be few things
more charming on a date than to hear, from

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.479
someone who looks extremely self-possessed
and competent, that they’ve been feeling

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:27.000
unusually isolated and very perplexed of late.
They’re showing us the fertilised soil in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.830
which our love can grow. iv. Pay some compliments
We can, understandably, get anxious at the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.990
idea of having to pay our date some compliments.
The approach can feel too direct, demanding,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.919
almost sleazy. But there is an art to good
compliments that starts from a different place:

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.580
a recognition that most of us struggle to
maintain a basic grasp on what is decent and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.900
good about us, and privately hunger to hear
from someone else certain basic but psychologically-sustaining

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.490
things about our characters (that sound unbelievable
when we try to say them to ourselves): that

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.280
we aren’t wholly stupid, that we are sometimes

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.150
funny or perceptive and have a few qualities
to contribute to the world. We can be so worried

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.700
by our own inadequacies that we forget that
the person across the table will have an equally

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.400
large share of them – which it lies within
our power to calm.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.640
These antics and more belong to a properly

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.200
rich sense of what we might need to talk about
on the audition of our lives we call, with

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.800
touching modesty, a date.
