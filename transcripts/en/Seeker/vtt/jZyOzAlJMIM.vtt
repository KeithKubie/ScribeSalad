00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.860
Sometimes I sleep with a sound machine or
a fan.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.410
It started in college to drown out loud roommates,
but now that I've read this research, I'll

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.720
probably quit!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.300
'Sup sleepers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.950
Sound machines are very popular with adults,
especially in noisy urban environments, because

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.250
they can use white noise to drown out other
sounds.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.820
A new study in Pediatrics found, some infant
sound machines can hit 50 decibels!!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.201
A JACKHAMMER is 95! 50 decibels is loud, and
since most adults keep them near the bed they

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:42.320
often do the same for their baby's infant
models.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.500
Some of them even hang on the crib.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.969
Sound machines for babies are meant to drown
out extraneous noise and let both babies and

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.240
adults sleep uninterrupted.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.530
They create white noise, which is all the
frequencies of sound the human ear can hear,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.530
combined together.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.670
It's the white light or black paint of sound.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.759
Some experts think it mimics what babies hear
in the womb; others look at how the brain

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.240
processes something like noise, versus tones
or notes.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.209
The problem is babies experience sound MUCH
more intensely than adults because their straighter,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.350
wider ear canal naturally amplifies sound.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.649
Plus, like in The Matrix, they've never used
them before.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.780
So long term exposure to 50 decibels could
potentially be bad for a baby's hearing.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.869
Hearing is the ear and brain working together
to measure the waves of air pressure surrounding

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.869
your body.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.630
The waves are perceived as sound, and measured
in decibels.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.329
The human ear is very sensitive, registering
sounds as loud as jet engines and as slight

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.919
as a pin drop or hair brushing skin.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.799
As our ears get used to the experience of
sound, loudness can become less intense -- we

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.799
get used to it.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.829
For instance, sound machines and fans make
constant noise all night, and yet after a

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.959
while you feel like you're in a quiet room.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.880
The reason we can sleep with something so
loud firing across our eardrums, has to do

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.240
with our brains.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.520
When you're in a loud crowded place, you can
hear one or two conversations at once because

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.709
your brain is great at using visual information
combined with sound to pick out voices.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.439
But, if you stand on the edge of a crowded
auditorium, it turns into a big mess -- even

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.819
TRYING to pick out a voice can be tough.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.040
White noise is the same, with all those frequencies
going at the same time, your brain can't pick

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.170
out other sounds and just flat-out ignores
the whole batch.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.069
This doesn't translate to every situation
though, the National Institute for Occupational

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.329
Safety and Health says ambient noise can increase
stress levels, exacerbate high blood pressure

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.849
and cause stress related problems like ulcers
and headaches.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.489
And a study done with rats and published in
Physiology &amp; Behavior found white noise can

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.000
affect the release of the stress hormone cortisol
-- rats exposed to white noise had 1.8 times

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.660
more cortisol!

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.780
In humans that affects planning, reasoning,
impulse control, and might even mess with

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.170
short term memory writing.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.459
Another study from the University of California
San Francisco found white noise might keep

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.079
the brain from learning during sleep in children
-- delaying language acquisition and messing

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.079
with hearing.

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.530
If you HAVE to use a sound machine to sleep,
put it far from somewhere a baby sleeps, and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.840
from YOU for that matter.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.159
Keep the volume low, and set the timer so
it doesn't drone all night.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.670
Less exposure to the constant drone might
be better for your brain and your kids.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.950
What's your sound machine?

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.950
Fans?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.950
Radiators?

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.950
The furnace or air conditioner turning on?

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.950
Dishwasher?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.349
Or do you have an app on your phone?

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.499
Let's talk about it down below and see if
there's a better way than constant noise.
