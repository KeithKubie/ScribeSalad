00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
I FOMO pretty hard

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.120
Oh my god, I can't believe that party last night.
- I know! I'm sorry I got so crazy towards the end.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.400
No, don't even apologize. It was so much fun!

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.480
Ah, so much fun!

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.900
Oh my god, wow... That sounds like so much fun... Haha... So much fun.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.560
I-I wish that I had been there... But I wasn't.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.440
Oh but I did um, I photoshopped a photo of myself with you at the party last night.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.500
It's like "it was crazy, huh?"

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.640
It's...crazy...

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.800
(awkward laughter)

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.340
You know, and I feel like it's really easy to FOMO these days,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.700
because we can see how much fun everyone's having

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.380
on like Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.960
(notification sounds)

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.700
And more often than not I feel like my FOMO is so irrational.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.880
Do you, Brad, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.740
I do.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.140
And do you, Will, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.220
I do.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.160
Now, do you both take me to be your lawfully wedded bestie, to the Hawaii honeymoon?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.960
It's gonna be so much fun, you guys.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.920
You do. You say... you say you do.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.720
I... do...?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.560
I... I do...

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.440
(ding sound)

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.900
No, like, even more irrational than that.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.260
So, why don't you tell me what happened here?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.780
He burst in here and then he just murdered both of them.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.400
(crying)

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.960
And then he just left?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.900
Yeah... Can you believe that?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.000
I was like: "Hello, what about me?"

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.560
I'm always left out of everything..

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.260
A case of the FOMO...

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.180
And I feel like I'm a hypocrite, because whenever I see photos from a party I'm like:

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.800
"That looks like so much fun...

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.860
Ugh... Everyone had so much fun.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.640
(notification sounds)

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.560
Without me.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.200
(notification sounds continue)

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.860
But whenever I'm invited to a party I'm like:

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.860
"Oh my god, I just wanna stay home and watch TV..."

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:57.980
*typing* So sorry, can't make it. Have a last minute deadline. *stops typing* To watch Narcos.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.040
What about you?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.600
Are you, like, irrationally FOMO-ing about everything

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.240
or do you avoid social media the day after a party for this reason?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.100
Or do you just not care because you are a self-confident, cool person?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.340
I am not.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.740
I am Anna Akana. 
Stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.520
Oh, and I have some stand-up shows on these dates. Come see them, yay!

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.560
