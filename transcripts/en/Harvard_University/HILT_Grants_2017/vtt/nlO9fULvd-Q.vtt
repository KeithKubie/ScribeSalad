00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.240
Our project is centered around
these experimental design chalk

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.340
talks that we've incorporated
in our introductory molecular

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.260
biology class for
graduate students

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.390
at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
And we've looked at the
effect of these chalk

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
talks in a few
different ways, both

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.150
looking at video
recordings of students

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.259
in their first and second
times doing these chalk

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.750
talks during the
course, as well as

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
written answers to
experimental design questions

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.190
throughout the course.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.070
We've also been
looking at and thinking

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.540
about how this affects students
confidence or self-efficacy

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.820
with the skills or
science communication

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.980
and experimental design and how
that changes from the beginning

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.360
to the end of the semester.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.880
We've also been
developing some resources

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.500
for training students.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.690
Training students in how
to do experimental design

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.190
in chalk talks.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.550
So a chalk talk is literally
talking with chalk.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.710
And so what it is, it's
very different from a type

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.937
of presentation that we
see a lot with our trainees

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.270
is that we do a good job of
teaching presentations using

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.793
PowerPoint in the background.

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:19.960
But in this case, they don't
have PowerPoint, right?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.620
So they actually have to
do an unscripted talk.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.590
Well, they're scripted.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.040
But they do it in an
unstructured way at the board.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.330
And they walk through an
experimental protocol.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.890
What's different
and what you see

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.480
with that presentation
in general

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.240
is that it's built
to be interrupted.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.890
And a lot of times,
the conversation

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.970
goes where the audience
wants you to go,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.230
and thinking about how you
craft a narrative while actually

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.330
interacting with the audience.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.150
It's used at multiple
different stages.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.190
We know that faculty
are typically

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.595
asked to do it as part
of their job interview.

00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:52.720
Along with a seminar, they
have to do a chalk talk.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.320
A lot of trainees
don't know that.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.590
But we've also seen
instances at multiple places

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.450
where some postdocs
are asked to do it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.770
as part of their interview.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.710
We know that graduate students
use it in their prequalifying

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.720
exams for many of our programs.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.220
So we're training
them for something

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.700
that they'll see
in the second year.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.200
And I've actually
heard of instances

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.960
now where graduate
students are being

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.473
interviewed for graduate
school using a chalk talk.

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:15.640
One of the things we found
working with our students

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.150
is we talk about
experimental design a lot,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
that that's what you get
out of graduate school.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.000
But we actually don't do
a lot of formal training

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and experimental design.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.488
That's a deficiency that we saw.

00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:26.530
And we tried to address
that in our life sciences

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.372
graduate course by actually
trying to intervene, teach them

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:32.830
skills in experimental design,
teach them skills in science

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.530
communication, and then force
students to actually put that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.320
into practice through the types
of assessments that we use.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.080
So when we talk about
teaching experimental design

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.420
and how to do a chalk
talk, we do them together.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.660
And we've developed a series
of resources including videos.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.450
So we have sample questions
that we show students.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.030
This is what the assessment
will look like in our course.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.400
Then we have videos
that we've developed

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.857
a good version of what a
response would look like

00:02:56.857 --> 00:02:58.690
and a great version of
what a response would

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.120
look like, and actually
put those on display

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.495
for the students along with
an annotated guide that tells

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:05.703
them, this is what a good,
this is what a great chalk

00:03:05.703 --> 00:03:07.090
talk looks like,
and this is what

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.340
gets you to a high score using
a novel rubric that we've

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.840
developed.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.835
So the students get sample
question, sample presentations,

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.960
and a rubric with an
annotated guide that tells you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.372
how to excel at that rubric.

00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:20.830
And the last piece that we're
finishing up with our project

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.930
is actually trying to
make animated movies

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.060
to explain this, so that
actually accompanies it too.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.550
We're at the point
now, I think one

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.650
of the nice outcomes
from this whole project

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.710
is that we've lined up a
pretty robust set of papers

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.190
that we're developing as
outcomes from the project.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.990
And we're actually
spanning back,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.772
we're at a point where we're
analyzing data for 10 years.

00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:42.230
And so this chalk
talk was actually

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.240
introduced in this class in
2009, the very first time

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.990
that it was done.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.047
And then 2010, it was modified.

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:52.130
And we've gradually modified
it to the point where

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.255
it's been pretty consistent
for the last four years

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:55.440
what it looks like.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.980
But the idea was simply we had
a standard molecular biology

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.670
class.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.503
The person who was very
involved at the time

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:01.640
was Johanna Gutlerner.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.930
She was a curriculum
fellow in the course.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.638
She preceded me as
the curriculum fellow.

00:04:04.638 --> 00:04:07.970
And I preceded Madhvi as
the curriculum fellow.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.618
She thought we should
find a way working

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:12.410
with the faculty, the
faculty and the class

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.990
also, to make the
class more interactive

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.870
and actually to focus on
skills, which at the time,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.280
was their idea for life sciences
graduate education, right?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.030
Everybody said you
come to graduate school

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.130
to learn all the
mechanisms and the details.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.030
And they were talking about
trying to introduce skills.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.790
Fast forward 10 years,
now that's what everybody

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.310
is talking about in grad ed
that we need to focus on skills,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.230
that it's not just an
undergraduate thing.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.920
So it's taken on a life, I
think, a value in that respect.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.340
So we worked it into the
course as an assessment.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.535
And I think the
driving force behind it

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:46.910
was watching the
student feedback

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.203
on the course evaluations, which
told us that students liked it.

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:52.370
And what we learned was to
use the feedback in a way

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.230
to continuously address
the problems they

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.940
had with the
assessment to the point

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.192
where it's consistently
been one of the strongest

00:04:58.192 --> 00:04:59.150
positives in the class.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.650
One of the outcomes
from our project

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.770
is all the data analysis
we've done on course evals,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.455
consistently positive.

00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:06.830
And another thing
that we've seen

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.630
is when we ask students
years after they've

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.880
left the class, what
was the lasting learning

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.080
outcome from the course?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.030
It's actually the
exercise and being

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.640
able to apply that skill in
multiple different settings.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.440
Really enjoyed working
with the students.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.600
And I think for me, they
weren't just workers.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.760
They were also collaborators
in the project.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.180
And I think it was really
important to involve them

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.290
in that way.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.410
And I think also
just the breadth

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.850
of things we were able
to look at related

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.940
to experimental design chalk
talks and the different types

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.310
of outcomes, I think
that was really

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.650
valuable to have that breadth.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.420
And I think that
the grant really

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.290
enabled us to have
a broader view of it

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.225
instead of just looking
at an individual part.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:57.600
One of the things that's very
nice about the Spark grants

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.760
in particular is that when you
need a relatively robust amount

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.710
of money, but not an
immense amount of money,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.050
like a NSF grant
or NAH grant, it's

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.840
enough money to get a good
amount of projects done

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.622
and get research done.

00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:14.080
And it really helped with us
being able to engage students.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.020
So this project really
benefited from the fact

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.780
that we have six students who
are helping with the project.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.090
And I mean, one of the
projects literally entailed

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.780
transcribing 500 rubrics
for multiple years, right?

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.130
And two students did that.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.260
And so that type of
work is not something

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.440
that it's really easy to
justify for a big grant.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.018
But it's a starting point to
actually get the work done.

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:36.060
And what we've been able
to do is do that, right?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.477
So a lot of that
engaging students

00:06:37.477 --> 00:06:40.080
who have different expertise
like biostatisticians

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.367
to help us with analysis.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.200
So I think the student
engagement part of it

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.690
actually has been a
really important outcome

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.840
of having the funding.
