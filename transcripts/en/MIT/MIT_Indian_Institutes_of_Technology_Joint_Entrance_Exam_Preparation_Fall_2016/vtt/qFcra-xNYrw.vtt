00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.710
Hello and welcome to the second lecture on
the binomial theorem.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.710
In this lecture, we will look at the binomial
theorem and some of the related results which

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.830
can be derived from the binomial theorem.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.480
First, recall the definition of nC_r, which
is the number of ways of choosing r objects

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.660
from n distinct objects, and which can be
written as n!/[(n-r)!

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.640
* r!].

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
So the binomial theorem

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:52.139
given by this result:

00:00:52.139 --> 00:01:26.730
(x+y)^n = nC_0 x^n y^0 + nC_1 x^{n-1} y^1
+ ... + nC_{n-1} x^1 y^{n-1} + nC_n x^0 y^n,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:36.320
where nC_r is the number of ways of choosing
r objects from n distinct objects. This can

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:50.870
be more succinctly written as the summation
\sum_{r=0}^{n}{nC_r x^{n-r} y^r}.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.430
The binomial theorem can be taken to be an
identity in x and y. The binomial theorem

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:13.569
is applicable for x and y complex, and n being
a positive integer.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:22.840
At this point, I would like to mention that
generalizations of the binomial theorem for

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.340
the case when n is any real number also exist.
In the definition/in the expression of the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:45.510
binomial theorem, we take x^0 to be equal
to 1 for all x which are complex numbers,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.480
i.e., irrespective of the value of x, we define
x^0 to be equal to 1.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:05.860
Notice that there are n+1 terms in the binomial
theorem, and there are NOT n terms but n+1

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.790
terms in the binomial theorem. You notice
that there is a sort of pattern to the terms

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.189
in the binomial theorem, and that is well
captured by the general term of the binomial

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:26.680
theorem. In general, the (r+1)th term in the
expansion of (x+y)^n can be written as nC_r

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:37.120
x^{n-r} y^r.
To

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:47.439
give you an example of the application of
the binomial theorem, let's look at (x+y)^1.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:59.739
From the binomial theorem, we get that this
is nothing but 1C_0 x^1 y^0 + 1C_1 x^0 y^1

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:13.040
which gives us x+y, which is what we expect.
We can also derive for the case when we have

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:34.620
(x+y)^2, which is nothing but 2C_0 x^2 y^0
+ 2C_1 x^1 y^1 + 2C_2 x^0 y^2. Since 2C_0

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:46.750
is 1, we have x^2; 2C_1 is nothing but 2,
we have 2xy; and 2C_2 is again 1 so we have

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:55.480
y^2. This is the well known result (x+y)^2
= x^2 + 2xy + y^2.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:14.420
Similarly, you can derive that (x+y)^3 is
x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3, and you can derive

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.770
this result from the binomial expansion as
well.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.170
So one way in which you can interpret the
binomial theorem is as follows: to derive

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:43.750
(x+y)^n is equal to this expression, just
consider (x+y)^n as nothing but (x+y)*(x+y)*...*(x+y)

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:58.330
for a total of n terms, and the interpretation
of this expansion can be given as follows.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.960
If you choose n x's, then you choose an x
from each of these, uh, each of these parentheses

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.660
here, and so there is only one way of choosing
x's from each of these parentheses. There

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.390
is only one way of choosing n x's and 0 y's,
and that gives you the coefficient of x^n

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:25.860
y^0. If you want to choose (n-1) x's from
this expression, then you have to choose (n-1)

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:33.620
x's from the n possible x's, and you have
to choose 1 y from the n possible y's, and

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.580
that can be done in n choose 1 ways, and that
gives you the coefficient of x^{n-1} y^1 (and

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.290
so on).
In this way, you can derive the/you can provide

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.110
a combinatorial interpretation of the binomial
expansion.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:07:00.580
So, as I mentioned previously, there are generalizations
for the binomial theorem for the case when

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:12.450
this exponent n is not necessarily a positive
integer, but when it can be any real number.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.470
This is the general result of the binomial
theorem, and you can derive several related

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.430
results by playing around with the general
result of the binomial theorem. For instance,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:35.060
you could replace y by -y in the theorem and,
upon doing so, you would get an expression

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:54.090
for (x-y)^n. This is going to be nC_0 x^n
(-y)^0 + nC_1 x^{n-1} (-y)^1 + ... + nC_n

00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:06.620
x^0 (-y)^n, and
this can be more simply written as summation

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:22.360
\sum_{r=0}^{n}{(-1)^r nC_r x^{n-r} y^r}. This
result is very similar to the result we derived

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.139
for the binomial theorem.
A second result which we can derive is by

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:49.940
replacing y by 1, in which case we can derive
an expansion for (x+1)^n as nC_0 x^n 1^0 +

00:08:49.940 --> 00:09:08.960
nC_1 x^{n-1} 1^1 + ... + nC_n x^0 1^n. This
can be written as nC_0 x^n + nC_1 x^{n-1}

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:24.060
+ ... + nC_n x^0. Now, to arrive at a more
simpler expression of this result, use the

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:32.130
fact that nC_r is nC_{n-r} and you can derive
this to be equal to nC_n x^n + nC_{n-1} x^{n-1}

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:44.740
+ ... + nC_0 x^0. This
last expression can simply be written as summation

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:55.860
\sum_{r=0}^{n}{nC_r x^r}. This is the binomial
expansion of (x+1)^n.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:06.920
Similarly, we can also derive this result
from the binomial expansion: we can derive

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:17.490
an expansion for (x+y)^n + (x-y)^n. If you
apply the binomial expansion for these two

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:39.550
separate expressions, you will get 2*[nC_0
x^n y^0 + nC_2 x^{n-2} y^2 + ...]. The

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.990
alternate terms will cancel out and it will
leave you with this result.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:52.370
So that's it for this lecture. Hope you had
fun listening to the binomial theorem and

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:58.051
some of its related results. In the next lecture,
we will be looking at some examples of the

00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:03.240
usage of the binomial theorem and some possible
problems you will face in an exam situation.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.890
Thank you.
