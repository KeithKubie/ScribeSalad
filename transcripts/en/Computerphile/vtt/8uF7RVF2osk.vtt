00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.440
So over the past year the Bitcoin network has reached his maximum

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.460
Capacity all the blocks are becoming full and as a result there's been a lot of debate about how we can scale

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.460
Bitcoin in the future

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.080
So i'm gonna talk a little bit about some of those proposals, and what they could mean and what's the trade-offs?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.620
Some of the technical solutions being proposed to improve the scalability of Bitcoin are so that it can handle more and more users

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.959
because if Bitcoin was to become mainstream then it needs a lot more scalability that it has right now and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.689
The problem is that when Bitcoin was first created the founder of Bitcoin who originally published the code

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.559
About a year after he published a code. He inserted a block size limit well

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.799
What's called a block size limit in the code which means that each block has a maximum block size of one megabyte

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.920
So to give a quick recap of how the Bitcoin network works

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.780
The Bitcoin network is a decentralized system

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.080
where anyone can run their own node and these nodes will have a copy of what's called the blockchain and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.790
The blockchain is essentially a series of blocks

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.999
That contain all the transactions in the system this creator of Bitcoin realized that there's a potential problem here of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.269
What's called a denial of service attack

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.938
someone could potentially spam the network with transactions and make blocks that are very big and

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.780
so he

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.059
Created a limit that each block should be no bigger than one megabyte and this limit is hard-coded in all of the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.438
Software that you use to run a Bitcoin client or node on your own computer so that means

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.239
your software will automatically reject any block that is bigger than one megabyte and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.570
Now we've reached a point. Where blocks are becoming full

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.619
They've reached a maximum capacity of one megabyte and so no new transactions can be put in in the blocks so

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.439
That gives us a capacity of around three to seven transactions per second which isn't very much

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.319
Because there is now more demand for more transactions per second in the network as a network has grown

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.740
Is it a simple case of if we were able to make these blocks bigger you could fit more transactions in?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.320
Sure, yes, you can do that if you make the blocks bigger

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.460
It's a naive and very simple way of increasing scalability, but the main

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570
Argument against it from its critics has been that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360
if you increase the block size

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.960
Then the block chain itself would get bigger and that means

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.770
Every single person who runs a Bitcoin node on their computers,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.760
What's called a full node,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.060
Has to have all the data of the above the whole blockchain in order to verify the whole blockchain correctly

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280
If we increase the block size

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.830
you would need more and more storage to store a copy of the blockchain and this is a problem because

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.860
The all point of Bitcoin is that as a decentralized system

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.439
Anyone should be able to run their own node when this limit was first added in 2009 2010

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.779
The Bitcoin wasn't as popular so it was much easier to modify the code and insert

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300
new changes and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.310
uncontroversial, or you know

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.060
Protocol rules like that. Now, It's a much bigger space so now each change needs a lot more

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.890
Consensus if you'd like because if you were to if you wanted to increase the block size this would create what's called a hard fork

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.149
You would essentially create a blockchain that's incompatible with all the existing nodes that run on the Bitcoin network

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.229
Because the existing nodes, they will reject any block that is bigger than one megabyte and everyone will have to upgrade all the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.519
Software so this is the kind of change that requires every single person to agree to it or the majority of the ecosystem

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.700
To agree to it. People who want, who are thinking about how to scale

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.700
Bitcoin kind of really fit into two camps

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.959
Camps of the people who are advocates of what's called on chained scaling and people who are advocates of what's called off chain scaling

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.380
The idea of on chained scaling is that we want to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.479
by increasing the number of transactions that we actually put in the blockchain itself and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.959
you and you would do that by increasing the block size and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.820
Yes, that would make it more expensive to run a Bitcoin full node

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.880
but argument is that the majority of Bitcoin user they'll run Bitcoin anyway if you have a Bitcoin wallet on your

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.180
On your phone, or if you use a web wallet

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.120
It's not a proper Bitcoin node if your wallet

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.680
Trusts a different node or some centralized service to some extent

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.320
to get information about the Bitcoin network and get information out of blockchain so

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.570
one of the original things that the original creator of Bitcoin said is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.739
that he expects that as the blockchain grows in size and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.190
Ultimately people will no longer be able to run nodes and nodes will become super nodes

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.320
you will have to have access to data center to run nodes, and that was kind of part of the plan

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.830
But one of the things that the creator of Bitcoin anticipated was that Moore's Law

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.769
would catch up with the blockchain size

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.940
So that's regardless. It wasn't mega expensive for someone to store a copy of blockchain. But unfortunately Moore's law

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.080
hasn't, has been somewhat dead for the past few years. Hard drive storage

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.080
Has largely remained at roughly the same cost for the past few years

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.899
It's kind of stopped, and that's kind of created a problem

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.169
So that's what on chained scaling is about.The idea of off chain scaling is that let's move the transactions out of the blockchain

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.499
Do we really do we really need to put every small

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.410
Transaction like if you go to a coffee shop and buy coffee

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.609
Do we really need to put it on the blockchain and do we really want

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.359
Every single person who runs a Bitcoin node to have a copy of that little transaction

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.649
so the idea of off chain scaling is let's only put big or

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.140
important transactions on the blockchain and let's put all of those micro transactions off the blockchain and

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.640
One of Percival's for doing that is a system called the Lightning Network and the Lightning network is basically

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.169
using something called payment channels between different individuals

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.390
to facilitate off chain payments for example Alice might send Bob ten dollars

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.029
And then Bob sends at least five dollars in the next day

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.179
So what they do is instead of having every single payment on the blockchain?

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:31.169
They just keep a balance sheet between them and they put all the payments on their balance sheet and then for example after a month

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.500
They say let's see what is the final balance and let's set all that balance on the blockchain

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.760
So you only need to put that final payment on blockchain rather than every single payment in between

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.550
and

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.720
You can extend this at least as a payment channel with Bob and Bob has a payment channel with Charlie and let's suppose Alice wants

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.059
To pay Charlie Alice kind of route that payment through Bob, which would then send a payment charlie

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.149
And this is the idea of lightning network, you use a route or a network of payment channels

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.150
And you would find the route

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.510
between person-to-person that you can make that payment of the blockchain and

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.159
In theory it sounds like a really great idea, but there are some

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.100
controversies around it so

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.959
some people don't think that it would be very feasible if

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.019
This would be able to be used by millions of users, for every single person to find a route between

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.820
any other person in a decentralized way because one of the

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.580
Things with that network is that

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.829
In order to establish a payment channel you have to deposit a

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.380
certain amount of money, which is at least a minimum amount of money of how much you expect to

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.080
go through that payment channel and

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.369
That some people just don't have the upfront capital so people expect

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.690
What's called large payment hubs to facilitate that so you would have a large payment hub

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:04.800
That has a large amount of deposit inside of it, and yo you would route your payments to that so in some way

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.829
There's a bit of centralization involved with that if you have on chain scaling we have super nodes

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.810
But if you have off chain scaling we might have large centralized payment hubs

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.350
So it is still bit of centralization involved in both

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:27.329
Bitcoin cash when Bitcoin cash forks off from Bitcoin the value of Bitcoin cash on the first day was something like 500 dollars

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.340
So people were 500 dollars per coin for free out of thin air when this fork happened

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.030
So it's possible that some people but the value of Bitcoin has risen
