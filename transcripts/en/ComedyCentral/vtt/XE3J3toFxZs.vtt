If today felt like it had a bit
of an orange glaze cast over it,

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:05.739
that's because
it was the birthday

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.876
of evil James Spader character
Donald Trump.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.979
-Ugh.
-Yes, Donald turned 70 today,

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.814
although his hair
only turned six.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.184
Uh... but what do you get
for the man who had everything,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.686
lost everything, got everything
again, lost everything again,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.789
and is now close to becoming
the leader of the free world?

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.158
-(audience boos)
-Well...

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.461
I... I-I didn't do it.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.863
Uh... uh, you got to just
check Amazon, you guys.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.766
I would like you to give me as
many items that you might find

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.302
on Donald Trump's Amazon
wishlist as you can

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.838
in 60 seconds.
And begin. Matteo.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.207

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.608

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.477
Child leash for Ivanka.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.379

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.488
A soda stream.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.390
It doesn't affect anything,
it's just a great product.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.092
Yeah, it's a great gift.
It's a great gift. Mamrie.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.129
Uh, those Hulk hands painted
orange to hide his tiny hands.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.598
All right, points. Yeah. Matteo.

All right, points.
Mamrie.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:10.604
Uh, that hug from his father
he never got,

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.906
which is why we're in this
(bleep) show to begin with.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.006
Okay, points.
