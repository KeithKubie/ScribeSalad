00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.760
In certain quarters, cynicism has a distinct kind of glamour.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.660
It sounds pretty tough not to have too many hopes, and to claim to be able to see through the dreams of others.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.500
Cynics will tell you that everyone is selfish and weak,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.540
that the system is rigged and driven by greed,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.860
that you can never succeed, so it's pointless and contemptible to try,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.200
that all ideals are ridiculous,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.420
and the do-gooders are only out to show off their own supposed virtues.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.640
It's hopeless to try to disprove cynicism.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.620
There will always be an abundance of vivid examples to back up a catastrophic interpretation of humanity.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.920
But what identifies people as cynics, is not so much what they claim - as why they do so.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.060
The downbeat assessments are based not on a dispassionate analysis of our species,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.460
but on an inner emotional compulsion.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.260
Their philosophy is, first and foremost, a defense against suffering.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.540
Beneath that gruff surface, cynics are afflicted by a near hysterical fragility,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.560
around the idea of expecting anything, which turns out to be less impressive than they'd hoped.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.480
And so they twist their mental apparatus to secure themselves against the eventuality of any discouragement.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.400
They disappoint themselves before the world can ever do it for them, at a time and in a manner of its own choosing.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.680
Cynics may look like people trying very hard to see the facts as they are,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.000
but in truth, they are trying even harder to insulate themselves against pain.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.800
The origin of their stance is not worldly experience and insight;

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.420
it is - rather more poignantly - psychological trauma.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.240
Somewhere in the past, they will probably have been a blow to their hopes

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.780
that felt too powerful to handle.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.100
Sadly though cynics don't give away the slightest clue as to their touching and vulnerable backstories,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.280
they will instead talk stridently about corruption and manipulation,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.740
pile up examples of greed, and profit complex sounding theories about economics.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.200
But what they won't do, is voluntarily or easily reveal how their father humiliated them when he was drunk,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.920
or how it felt when their mother ran away to another city when they which just five.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.780
The cynic, is never truly and completely cynical.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.400
They are still recovering from hopes that grew too painful to avow.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.220
A natural temptation, when encountering a cynic, is to try to argue them out of their attitude, by citing counter-examples,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.720
but this, is in its own way cruel, because it misunderstands what cynicism is about.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.000
It is an emotional protection. In essence, a mode of coping, learned under conditions of duress.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.600
What the cynic really needs, and yet fears they may never get, so naturally never asks for, is kindness.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.760
The kindness that may eventually help them to rekindle their stunted, secret desires, for hope, and fulfillment.
