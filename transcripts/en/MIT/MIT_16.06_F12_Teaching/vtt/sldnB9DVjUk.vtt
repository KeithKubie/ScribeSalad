00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.420
STEVEN HALL: So there
are a couple challenges

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.580
that you need to
think about when

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.600
you're using this approach.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.990
One is it's important to
explain to the students what's

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.410
going on.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.622
If you just start
doing this and say,

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:26.330
this is what we're
going to do, and don't

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.000
tell the students why
you're going to do it,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.850
that's problematic.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.500
I think it's important to think
of the students as partners.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.480
Explain what's going on, they're
much more likely to buy into it

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.660
and maybe get used
to the new approach.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110
One of the things I do
is I present some data,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.780
because it's MIT and students
are persuaded by data.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.800
And what the data says is
that generally the more active

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.230
a learning exercise, the
more that students learn.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.060
And there's some
really good data

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.620
in the literature
that shows that,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.350
so I explain to students that
the reason I'm doing this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.090
is to increase their
level of understanding,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.830
especially at the
conceptual level as opposed

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.380
to the analytic level of
just doing a problem using,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.141
the equations.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:20.390
STUDENT: I've never had a
recitation like this before.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.760
Actually working on
problems with everybody else

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.340
and kind of going through
and struggling through it,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.140
but eventually
understanding a lot better

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.050
what was done in lecture
through, I guess, a more hands

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.740
on approach.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.000
STEVEN HALL: Do the
students like this?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.060
Well, I have a little
bit of feedback.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.340
I do think that, initially,
they're apprehensive.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.050
They're not used to being
so exposed in the classroom.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.234
They can hide, usually.

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:52.900
If they don't want
to answer a question,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.790
they don't raise their hand.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.910
But in a situation like this,
everyone's answer is visible.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.900
So initially, I do think they
are a little bit uncomfortable.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.880
I think they get
comfortable very quickly

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.300
and get used to it.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.080
At the end of the day, at
the end of the class when

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.950
they evaluate it, I've
found that students really

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.450
like this approach, that they
like this sort of recitation

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.430
much more than
conventional recitations,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.180
and often comment about that
in the course evaluation.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.490
So even though there
might be a little bit

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.720
of initial reluctance, I think
most students would really

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720
like this approach.
