-Tuesday is Deep Dish Pizza Day.
-FLEMING: Yay!

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.672
Yeah, or as New Yorkers call it,

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.841
Casserole That Can Go
(Bleep) Itself Day.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.843
(laughter)

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:13.814
Uh, personally, I do enjoy deep
dish. I like both, all right?

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.083
I am bi when it comes to pizza.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.151
Uh, I like the thin,
but I like the deep dish,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.686
'cause it's one of the few foods
that's classified

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.523
both a carbohydrate
and as an intense sedative.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.559
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.762
And no one... no one likes
deep dish pizza more than

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.197
Pizza Squirrel!

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.965
-(applause and cheering)
-FLEMING: Yeah! Oh!

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:38.906
It only took him 25 minutes
to climb up that tree...

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.908
-(laughter)
-(Hardwick pants deeply)

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.943
...where he had
a massive heart attack.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.211
(panting loudly)

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.113
The only reason
I think that's funny is just

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.514
that when he falls out
of the tree,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.982
having had
a massive heart attack,

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.752
is the tiny little squirrel
ambulance that pulls up.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.153
And they run out.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.855
(in high-pitched voice):
Clear!

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.124
Don't you (bleep)
die on me! Clear!

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.725
-Playing the...
-BRAUNGER: But then they can't

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:59.960
fit him into the truck.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.196
HARDWICK:
They can't fit him into the...

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.598
-(laughter)
-Oh!

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:08.235
-Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.805
Comedians, what's a fun fact
about Pizza Squirrel?

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.207
Emily.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.009
He's going through a real messy
divorce with Pizza Rat.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.045
HARDWICK:
Yeah. Points. Points.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.848
-Jon. -Well, he stores his nuts
in Papa John's hole.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.416
(laughter)

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.252
(applause and cheering)

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.355
He does.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.957
Matt Braunger.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.225
He's knowingly
lactose intolerant.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.260
His family hates him
for his heinous farts.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.329
HARDWICK:
Yeah, points. Points.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.064
No, but they're adorable
squirrel farts.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.066
-They're adorable. -BRAUNGER:
They are. They sound cute, but

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.166
-they smell like gas. -HARDWICK:
Squeaky... Yeah. Yeah.
