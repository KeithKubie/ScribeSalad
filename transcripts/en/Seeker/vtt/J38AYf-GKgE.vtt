00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:12.660
When I was a kid, I thought I was a bug person.
But then I realized there’s more to bugs

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.400
than grasshoppers and fireflies….

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:25.199
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews. My
love for bugs is directly related to how adorable

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.150
they are, which is why I’m kicking off my
list of strangest bugs in the animal kingdom

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.150
with the Puss Moth Caterpillar.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.120
Seems like they could have come up with a
better name than “puss moth” for something

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.350
so cute! This little guys face looks like
some kind of cartoon character with big black

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.129
eyes and red lips - Pokemon come to mind.
In the animal kingdom, it’s face is actually

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.019
a defense mechanism to scare predators off.
Caterpillars are pretty vulnerable little

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.289
creatures, they’re soft and squishy....but
this species also comes equipped with 2 horns

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.709
at their tail. When they’re threatened,
they’ll wave the horns around, and if that

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:59.409
doesn’t work, they’ll spray you with formic
acid. That’s similar to the stuff found

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.030
in bee stings. When it goes through its metamorphosis,
it creates one of the strongest cocoons in

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.759
the world, and it emerges as a moth with extremely
soft, cat-like hair.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.600
Significantly creepier is the scorpion fly
- otherwise known as a nightmare fly, straight

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.759
from children’s night terrors. This fly
is aptly named for its weird cross between

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.079
scorpion and fly features. But instead of
the tail being a stinger, it’s their genitals.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.950
Beside their weird aesthetics, these harmless
flies are known for their strange mating rituals.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.930
The male flies first attract the females by
wafting his pheromones around while hanging

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.290
from trees. When a female approaches, the
male offers her a gift: a dead insect. She

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.240
checks it out, and if she’s interested,
mating will begin - and she’ll eat the insect

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.770
while they’re having sex. Kinky.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.259
Back to bugs I wouldn’t mind running into
is the Devil’s Flower Mantis. This species

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.579
of mantis has evolved to look like orchids
and omigosh they’re so beautiful! They hide

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.140
out in the flowers that they resemble and
then whip their arms out faster than you can

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.060
blink to grab their prey. Sometimes that’s
insects, other times it’s actually...small

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.670
bird. Dang. Praying mantis don’t mess around
- what with all that cannibalism after sex

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.670
and whatnot.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.340
And for those of you who aren’t fans of
bugs, what about really really big bugs that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.569
almost aren’t like bugs anymore because
they’re bigger than some pets? The Goliath

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.920
Beetle is one of the largest bugs in the world
- in their larval stage, they can weigh up

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.350
to 3 ½ ounces. May not sound like much but
like that’s almost a quarter of a pound

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.849
- and it’s a BUG! This beetle is known not
only for it’s size but tremendous strength.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.489
It can lift a load 850x it’s weight. These
beetles are from Africa, but they’ve been

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.370
bred in captivity to monstrous sizes using
cat and dog food. Yup, scientists are basically

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.190
keeping these guys as pets. But they probably
won’t play fetch….

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.370
Thanks for joining me for DNews folks! Are
you a bug person or do they freak you out?

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.540
Let me know down below and we’ll see you
next time on DNews.
