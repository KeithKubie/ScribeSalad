1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,250
Three two, one. Boom. Hello
Abby. Hello Joe. What's going on?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,920
Nothing much. I saw you chilling with
Oliver Stone the other day. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,940
What does that like? It's pretty
cool. He's an interesting guy.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,330
Very interesting guy. Yeah. He
likes to support radical politics.

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,270
So he came out for this screening
of the new film that we did. Yeah.

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,270
He's a very unusual character
in that regard. Right.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,930
Cause he's like this
blockbuster movie maker Guy,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,960
but he's also pretty radical guy in the
way in his politics and when he supports

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,320
and yeah, he was kind of like the black
sheep of Hollywood for awhile, you know,

10
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,670
doing all the radical, kind of the radical
outlier of Hollywood basically. Yeah.

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,840
But the do you saw the JFK movie, right?
Yeah, of course. That was a weird one,

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,170
right? It's like, I kind of like
it, but I've kind of like, hey man,

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,080
that fucking general wasn't
even a real person. Like you.

14
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,750
You made up a real person.
Like you put them in there.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,320
I think I didn't exist like a lot
of really? Yeah. Very good. Very,

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,720
very good.
But I get it.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,950
He kind of needed to move it along for a
90 minute or two hour movie or whatever

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,150
it was.
I get it.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,440
You kind of needed like this
little character to like
be dishing out the inside

20
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,100
scoop that Donald Sutherland character,
but in real life there was no guy.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,290
I didn't know that. Yeah. God Damn it all
her. If you knew, would you tricked again?

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,190
Would you be like, hey mother fucker,
what'd you do? Why'd you add that guy?

23
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,820
Because it's weird because like people
talk about that. They said, hey,

24
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,760
you know when the Oliver Stone movie, they
detailed all these things that happen.

25
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:31,680
Like, yeah, yeah. But they also added
a guy. It wasn't a real guy. Right?

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,300
Like as at the end of the day,
it's a fictional, you know, is it,

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,510
if it's a real president who was shot
by someone and you trying to explain who

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,510
in your, your movie, and you
have all these real characters,

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,400
but then you've got this one guy who
just kind of shoved in there. Yeah.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,760
To fill the, the professor, what was, what
did he call himself in the movie again?

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,300
The [inaudible] character? I do not
remember. I haven't seen in years.

32
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,580
I don't know cause I,
if I remember correctly,

33
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:03,540
it was him kind of just filling in the
gaps and kind of tying the narrative

34
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,840
together as, yeah, they used him as
a tool to kind of move the movie.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,750
Come on isn't another way to do that.
And the makeup a dude.

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,720
Brilliant asked movie though, right?
Very good movie. I don't know.

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,880
What do you think happened? The Oliver
Stone and even have right off the bat,

38
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,700
let's look talk about five k a I don't
know. I mean I think you had, yes.

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,240
If I give you a hundred bucks you said.
All right,

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Abby Quinn put bet on red or bet on black.

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,770
Did you think Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone or do you think that there was some

42
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,030
sort of conspiracy involving
various nefarious groups?

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,140
I think Oliver Stone's movie is closer
to the truth than obviously what the

44
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,160
official narrative is.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,240
I think that if you look at all those
high pro profile assassinations and that

46
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,830
era, I think a lot of them are
highly questionable. I mean, yeah,

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,790
it doesn't just stop at
JFK were talking about RFK.

48
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:58,500
I show her leave that story at
all. Um, Martin Luther King,

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,460
you know, I mean all of your, sure.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,370
There is really,
really sketchy things about all of them.

51
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,630
And if we were conducting,

52
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,670
the CIO is conducting basically an
assassination program around the world to

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,100
expedite us foreign
policy and imperialism.

54
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,520
Why would we not have been doing that here
at home? [inaudible] you know, I mean,

55
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,390
we know that Fred Hampton
was killed outright at the,

56
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,780
the leader of the Black Panther party.

57
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,340
So all of these things are kind of make
more sense when you look back at history

58
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:27,010
and see how kind of out of
control the CIA was at that time.

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah.
I mean,

60
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,420
it only makes sense that they would want
to get rid of certain characters that

61
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,540
were causing trouble. Right. You
know, I had Mike Baker on, uh,

62
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,220
from who used to work. He was a CIA
operative and he looked into the JFK,

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,740
or excuse me, the, um, Martin
Luther King assassination.

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,150
And he said that one more than any other
one that he looked into seemed like

65
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,190
something was really,

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,320
cause James Earl Ray was like a
loser or to like the shift he guy.

67
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,020
And then before the assassination,
all of a sudden you had money.

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,520
All of a sudden he like, he was, he was,
it looked like he was being steered.

69
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,910
And uh, he went into great detail about
it. I don't remember all the details,

70
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,850
but he was shaking his head about,
he's like that one out of any of them.

71
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,380
One that I looked into had the
fingerprints of manipulation on it.

72
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,530
Well, you know about his family,
obviously Martin Luther King,

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,360
his family that had that civil trial
and basically concluded that the u s

74
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:18,140
government had to have been involved for
the circumstances to have happened the

75
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:18,974
way they did.

76
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,920
And if you look at how Martin Luther
King at the time was considered the most

77
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:24,320
dangerous,
quote unquote and Negro in the country.

78
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:27,350
That's what the government was saying
about him. I mean, he was hated.

79
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,280
He was loaded.

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,630
He was trying to basically end the meant
like a poor people's campaign to occupy

81
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:37,580
DC to get poor people economic
rights. That was a, that was really,

82
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,490
really threatening I think,
to the establishment. And

83
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,360
at that time also,
you know,

84
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:46,340
it's hard for us when we're thinking
back about that era. I mean,

85
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:49,400
we weren't really, I mean,
I was, I was born in 67.

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,930
You warn laughed at that. It wasn't,
we don't understand that era.

87
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,010
That's a hundred years after slavery.
Just a hundred a person's life.

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,130
Person's lifetime. Yeah. Kind
of crazy. Right. You know,

89
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,390
and things still hadn't been resolved.
And then when you look at it now, I mean,

90
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,110
Juneteenth, they had the,
uh, congressional hearings,

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,420
they're talking about
reparations and you see just the,

92
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,980
the different polarized sides
of how people look at it.

93
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,000
Even today,

94
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,980
whether or not reparations should be given
or whether or not there should be any,

95
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,840
any sort of effort to rectify the obvious.

96
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,670
If you look at the,
the,

97
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:33,671
the economic strife that's in these
southern cities that are primarily African

98
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,490
American, that are really
from slavery. I mean,

99
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:41,330
this is literally the remnants of
slavery and it's never been fixed.

100
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,010
It's almost like any other problem that
would be in our infrastructure or any

101
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:49,120
other problem that would be in, you
know, anything with, you know, Po,

102
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,870
po pollution or any,

103
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:54,710
anything else that people clearly did
where someone did and fucked it up.

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,100
There's efforts made to fix it and there's
discussions it, but this is so much

105
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,660
resistance. Right? Tena has
the coats, I think his name
is, he was testifying there.

106
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,550
Um, and he was saying that, you know,

107
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,370
the argument is we had nothing
to do with this because again,

108
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,780
it was more than a person ago.

109
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,170
Why should we have anything
to do with what slavery did?

110
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,140
And it's beyond that though,
as you're mentioning. I mean,

111
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,141
this was an institutionalized racism
that we still see the effects of very

112
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,390
shortly within the prison community
within, I mean, all these things.

113
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:28,340
And he said we were still paying out
civil war soldiers, families, pensions,

114
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,690
decades after that. So
like why, why do that?

115
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,580
But not actually try to,
you know,

116
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,400
provide some economic justice to
the black community. It's a weird

117
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,420
conversation because it's
not just a conversation about
whether or not something

118
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:48,710
wrong was done,
but it's also a racial conversation.

119
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,900
Like I've seen some weird posts
like you know, chuck Woolery,

120
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,020
the guy who was from the love connection,
we'll be right back in to,

121
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:56,130
and to remember that guy,

122
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,660
that guy is turned into this like
serious hardcore right wing pundit.

123
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,750
And I think it was him that was tweeting
about reparations for union soldiers,

124
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,920
for their families that died.
So he was saying writing in the civil war.

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,150
It was like, how about these
people? And then like not saying,

126
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:21,780
how about the fucking people who's like
brought over here from Africa and chains

127
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,470
and their great grandchildren are
alive today in the same community.

128
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,660
Well,
as the basis of our capitalist society.

129
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,500
I mean that's why we're the
richest country in the world.

130
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,640
And because it was predicated on the,
and you know the enslavement of Africa,

131
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,310
Africans,

132
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,150
yeah. I don't know if you can fix
it by giving people money today,

133
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,180
but I do think the money should be spent
to try to fix those communities and I

134
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:46,260
think that can be engineered and done.

135
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,630
And I don't hear anybody talking about
other than Tulsi gabber talks about it

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,070
and I think Bernie Sanders in mate has
made some indications that something

137
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:59,430
should be done. Although I don't know if
anybody has like a real definitive plan,

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,750
but when you talk to
people that have like, um,

139
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,010
Michael Wood who was a Baltimore police
officer, I've told this story before,

140
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:11,490
but it's a crazy story. He,
when he was a cop in Baltimore,

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,570
they found these papers
that showed that the exact,

142
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:20,571
it was papers from the 1970s the exact
same crimes in the exact same areas and

143
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,970
the exact same problem areas they were
dealing with in the 70s there were

144
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,810
dealing with in the two thousands and
he was like, what the fuck? Like wow.

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,770
Imagine that feeling like, here you
are, you're police officer, right?

146
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,900
You're putting your life
on the line literally,

147
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,130
and you're out there dealing with the
same problems that existed in the same

148
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:42,720
exact areas and no one's ever
done anything to fix it all.

149
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,960
They don't ever get to the rest
of arresting people. Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,690
Don't get to the root.

151
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,490
I mean Tulsa and Bernie are they only
candidates worth giving a shit about?

152
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,570
What about put a g,G , G, G,
G, g. G. I think that dude,
that fucking town hall suck.

153
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,404
That is

154
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,990
how many candidates are there now?
I feel like two,

155
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,450
two other ones just jumped in the race.
Now we have like,

156
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,610
I don't fucking know their names.
You know anyone other beyond

157
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,880
[inaudible]
on the way out though.

158
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,370
He's too close to Beta.
It's too close. He does.

159
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,980
He does look like he would be called that,

160
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,860
but his dad actually just openly said
in an interview. He's like, yeah,

161
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,950
I called them Baito cause I wanted him
to get the Mexican vote cause I knew who

162
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,750
would eventually run for office.

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,180
Why is real names like Robert
Robert own horses crust?

164
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,890
That sounds like a stroll. People. I mean,

165
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,830
these people are like a
hundred shades of Hillary.

166
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,310
I mean every single one of them other
than Tulsi and Bernie just seem like

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,700
they're, uh, just like
Hillary Clinton light. We'll,

168
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:45,870
they've also done this weird thing where
they're like, no straight white men.

169
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,110
I'm like, okay, like there's
like straight white men.

170
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,700
We're not voting for straight white men.

171
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,990
That's just as bad as saying
you're never voting for a woman.

172
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,200
It's just as bad as saying you're
never voting for a black person age.

173
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,170
You'd need, I mean, I get it. There's
been a lot of straight white men.

174
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,210
They've been present. I get
it. Right. You're right.

175
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,040
But to say no straight went to disqualify
someone based on something they have

176
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,280
no control over whatsoever
is a form of discrimination.

177
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,040
I know you don't think it's a form of
discrimination because so many of these

178
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,970
people have already had that job. I
get it. It seems unfair. You're right.

179
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,400
But you can't say that because that's
a shitty way of thinking. It's,

180
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,400
it's piss poor logic and thinking. It's
discriminatory. It's identity. Politics.

181
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,290
Yes.
It reigned supreme and,

182
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:33,291
and I saw there was like a
combating supporters from
Kamala Harris and Bernie at

183
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,990
some rally or something.
And then they just kept shouting,

184
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,860
we need a woman president.
It's like, that's,

185
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,380
that's like the only reason why you
like Kamala Harris, you know, I mean,

186
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,220
Kamala Harris,
um,

187
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,070
I saw this one speech that she was
giving what she was talking about,

188
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:55,071
forcing children to attend
school by holding their
parents accountable where she

189
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,790
instituted a policy where if the kids miss
school, the parents could be arrested.

190
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,040
Do you know about that now? It was super
disturbing. It was super disturbing.

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,090
And she was talking about how, how
effective it was and that, you know,

192
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:14,091
they had cops show up at the door of the
woman's house who was a single mom who

193
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:19,500
had these children. The kids weren't
going to school like, Hey, no,

194
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,720
she was a cop. I mean, she's a top cop.
Exactly. But that authoritative, yeah.

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,140
Authoritarian nonsense. Like that way
of thinking. You know why you do that?

196
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,550
Because no one's ever done that to you.
Right.

197
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,650
So I'm never knocked on your
fucking door and said, hey,

198
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,190
we're going to lock you up in jail
because your 16 year old boy when you have

199
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:37,230
three kids, right? And
if you're a single mom,

200
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,310
anyone who's a single mom who has a boy
knows and that fucking boy hits puberty.

201
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,270
If they run with the wrong crowd,
good fucking luck trying to control them.

202
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,110
Good luck. It's hard. It's real hard.
And if she's got a job or two jobs,

203
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,900
maybe because she's trying to put food
on the table and keep the fucking lights

204
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,700
on and you're going to arrest her because
their kid doesn't show up at school.

205
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,170
Holy Shit.

206
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,810
Can you imagine looking at all the
problems in our country and being like,

207
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,150
you know what? We need to arrest parents
if their kids are truant. Yeah, it's,

208
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,910
it's insane.
I mean,

209
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,940
make sure [inaudible] I'm 99%
sure I'm correct about that.

210
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,080
They're talking about her like
regret about this policy and

211
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,620
[inaudible] running for fucking president.

212
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,130
You should regret something like money
or another in the same pool policy going

213
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:18,730
back to a row,

214
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,730
Robert or Robert is the human
cost of C'mon on truancy.

215
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:27,700
The progressive prosecutor wanted to
transform how California responding to

216
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,140
students. Busy school parents like uh, I
don't know how to say her name. Sheree.

217
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,490
Sheree people's wound up paying the
price. So she, this lady, I read that,

218
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:39,550
I remember reading this one. I'm going to
fucking child. Yeah, so I'm, I'm correct.

219
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,670
There was a good reason her kid was
sick or something and she so Beto no,

220
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,730
let's not call them Beto anymore.
His name is Robert. Robert. Yeah.

221
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,290
Robert actually has a really great idea.
Joe.

222
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,520
He wants to tax non military families
to pay for veterans' healthcare.

223
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,130
Pay For veterans. Yeah. Isn't that nice?

224
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,270
So punish the people who don't want
to join the military. What very smart.

225
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,580
Robert [inaudible],

226
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,530
the fucking people who make the weapons
influence the politicians hacks the

227
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,520
defense contract.

228
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,760
Find out what the military
industrial complex is really made of.

229
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,080
Find out how much money they're really
making and saying, Hey, look at you guys.

230
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:21,040
You made x amount of billions of
dollars and look at all these guys that,

231
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,240
you know, we have, we have to fund,

232
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,660
we have to rely on charities and we
have to rely on things like the wounded

233
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:29,470
warrior project and all these foundations
that are taking care of these veterans

234
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,140
when you're the ones who are
profiting and, yeah, I mean that,

235
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,340
that's where the money should come
from. Yeah. Sound like they're poor.

236
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,110
And since these are fucking
insanely rich organizations, yeah.

237
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,530
They're stocks of like tripled
in the last four years there.

238
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,700
They're doing real well. When we had
that situation where Dick Cheney,

239
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,270
who was the CEO of how Burton
was giving Halliburton,

240
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,110
no bid contracts to go over
and fix places that we bombed.

241
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,750
It's like what? Yeah, that,

242
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,780
that is like a doctor breaking people's
legs so he can fix them so it's so crazy

243
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,230
and then drive it around in a Porsche.
It's fucking crazy. Yeah. Well,

244
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:09,700
Trump was sitting down at some table
with all the head defense contractors a

245
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,970
couple months ago and it was
after the [inaudible], you know,

246
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,640
dismemberment and the embassy. And, uh,

247
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,960
he was openly talking about how we can
not stop that $110 billion weapons deal

248
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,350
and you should see that just the
glee on these people's faces. I mean,

249
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:27,040
it was just, it's just unbelievable how
transparent it is, especially under Trump.

250
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,060
That was a weird conversation. Where, who
was he being interviewed by? Oh, Steve.

251
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,560
Steve Hilton, my friend. I know
Steve Hilton. Oh my God. Forever. Um,

252
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,940
we're actually family friends.

253
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,830
Our families have gone on vacations
together and Shit. It's a good guy.

254
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,160
Is that the Fox Hilton error or is
that just uh, no, no. Uh, it's uh,

255
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,840
one of the fuck is named Paris group
Dad. Oh no, he's British. But um,

256
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,310
he was,
um,

257
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,560
Trump and they were talking about the
mill in Trump was openly discussing how

258
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,700
these people want to go to war.

259
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,700
The military industrial complex
wants to go to war. I mean,

260
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,400
Trump saying that he didn't want
to have anything to deal with this,

261
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:08,460
but that they want to go to
war and it's like, I get it.

262
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,230
Trump has a weird guy because he's such
a loose cannon that he says shit like

263
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:16,190
that, that you don't, that Obama
would keep it his cards, you know,

264
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,350
Obama would hide his cards, but
Trump hate him or love him. He,

265
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,240
he gives you glimpses that you're not
gonna get as far as like what kind of

266
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:30,910
influence does the military industrial
complex really have on policy change and

267
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,090
decision making and whether or not they
take action and he was openly discussing

268
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:35,450
it.

269
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,350
He removes the mask. You know,
it's, it's interesting because he,

270
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:42,860
I think that he's talking out of both
sides of his mouth because on one hand he

271
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,710
says that kind of stuff. But
then on the other hand, I mean,

272
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:50,711
he hired all the most rabid war generals
in his cabinet and also just John

273
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,641
Bolton. I mean, come on,

274
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:57,641
this is like a maniacal neoconservative
who been for war with Iran since the day

275
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,770
he was born. So it's like, if
you don't want war with Iran,

276
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,320
I mean he campaigned on it, so
we know that he, he hates Iran.

277
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,570
He campaigned on abolishing
the nuclear deal with Iran,

278
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,740
but then he picks John Bolton to lead
all of these efforts. I mean, it's like,

279
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,160
it's like starting a fire and
then getting applauded and,

280
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,940
and congratulated when you stop the fire
at the last minute before it erupts and

281
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,050
takes over the whole planet.

282
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,750
And that's what would happen
if we actually did balmy run.

283
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,010
I think that people don't understand how
precarious the situation is that Trump

284
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,100
and these cronies have laid out,
not just his,

285
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,880
but came so close to being
a reality just a week ago.

286
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,990
You mean you don't think we should go to
war after for bombing oil tankers and,

287
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,060
um, Saudi oil tankers, you know,

288
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,530
that we should go to war over
that shooting down a robot. Yeah.

289
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,140
They shot our robot.

290
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,030
I would die from Saudi oil tankers and
I'd be the first one I put my body on the

291
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,110
line.
There was a lot

292
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,210
people that were saying, this seems like
the Gulf of Tonkin too. They're like,

293
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,860
I don't,
I'm not buying this at all.

294
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,740
There were so many people that were like
really kind of credible people who were

295
00:16:55,741 --> 00:17:00,600
openly saying, this stinks. Like it just
seems staged. It's, it seems like some,

296
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,020
some bay,
like why would they do that?

297
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,760
Total false flag shit going on
over and over and over again.

298
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,690
They're just trying so hard because they
want to provoke Iran to the point where

299
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:12,340
he,
Ron will be forced to respond.

300
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:16,370
And this is after suffocating x
fixating the sanctions that have,

301
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,490
that are causing people's lives.
I mean,

302
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,390
what is it for the folks that haven't
been paying attention to this,

303
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,390
what is it that makes them
want to go to war with Iran?

304
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,250
So we have to just look at what Iran is.
I mean,

305
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,520
Iran just won its independence less
than a hundred years ago in a, you know,

306
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,280
an era of an,
a wave of anti colonial struggles.

307
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:39,310
And we immediately the
[inaudible] as well as the CIA.

308
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,320
CIA instigated a coup.

309
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,040
So we always talk about how we want Iran
to have democracy. They had democracy.

310
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,070
They had a revolution,
a people's revolution that was overthrown.

311
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:53,071
We overthrew Mohamed Duck and instated
a absolute monarchy for decades.

312
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,810
And at the time it had the highest human
rights abuses documented in the world.

313
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,170
It was pretty unique in that sense.
And you know,

314
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,990
you can only imagine why
Iran is the way it is today.

315
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:08,670
And there was such a suppression of the
Left and of the Communist Party in Iran

316
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,671
that the Islamic revolutionary revolution
happened in the ayatollah was the

317
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,510
leader of that political movement.

318
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,630
And that's why Ron has the
political system it has today.

319
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,710
But it's about the oil man.
It is,

320
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:24,270
it's always about the oil and it's always
about the foreign domination of the

321
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,400
region. They hate that Iran, um,

322
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,160
is an independent country
and doesn't bow down to us.

323
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:34,161
Imperialism and us capitalism and Iran
also his allies with a lot of states that

324
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,150
is real in the u s and Saudi Arabia do
not want it to be allies with, you know,

325
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,510
Hezbollah, Hamas. Um, and so that's,

326
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,520
that's a big problem for the u s and it's
getting in the way of a lot of kind of

327
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,750
goals in the region.

328
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,710
But it's really fascinating when
you look at what actually happened,

329
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:57,030
because you know, the nuclear deal
was amazing. It was huge. I mean,

330
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,020
Trump keeps belaboring the fact that he,
Ron should not have nuclear weapons.

331
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,480
They didn't have nuclear weapons,
they never did.

332
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,200
And they were agreeing to never have them.
That was the whole Iran nuclear deal.

333
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,650
But I'm Trump just immediately rescinded
that slapped insane sanctions on Iran

334
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,930
and now, you know, sanctions every month,

335
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,520
just continuing to constrict their
economy and even basically sanctions on

336
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,570
threatening sanctions on China and India
and other countries that actually do

337
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:29,010
deals with the Ron now too, which is
totally insane. So once you do that,

338
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,740
um, and then you say, well, you
know, you're hitting yourself,

339
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:33,720
you're hitting yourself, why
you doing this? It's like, no,

340
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,650
you're doing this to them. And on top of
that, John Bolton keeps saying, you know,

341
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:39,600
there's all these unique
threats coming from Iran.

342
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:43,320
We need to surround them with all these
warships and they keep sending thousands

343
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,610
of more troops,
thousands more troops.

344
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:47,460
So you're getting to a position
now and now the drone, right?

345
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:52,050
We're flying a drone into Iranian airspace
and expecting that they're not going

346
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:52,561
to shoot that down.

347
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:56,340
Why the fuck are we flying a drone
and Iran the fuck would we do if you,

348
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,030
Ron flew a drone in here, right?
I mean it's just unbelievable.

349
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,510
The chauvinism and arrogance of the US
to be doing all this shit and then be

350
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:07,840
like, okay, now you guys are a belligerent
threat. We have to do something.

351
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,341
And it's like,
no,

352
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:13,050
you guys are the ones and circling them
and closing all of their, you know,

353
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,130
basically just encapsulating their entire
territory and threatening them over

354
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:20,550
and over and over again.
Basically hoping for something to happen.

355
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,470
And if you look back
at the Gulf of Tonkin,

356
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,960
there was a guy who was
actually on the USS Maddox,

357
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:29,961
the ship that was eventually attacked
and got us into the war with Vietnam.

358
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,890
And he even said, um, my dad
was on the ship and he said,

359
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,810
we had no idea why we were there.

360
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,250
And one of the generals are captains on
the ship just said they want us to be

361
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,540
hit.
They want us to be a tax.

362
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,180
So they can get into a war
that they want to get into.

363
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,740
And that's exactly what's going on.

364
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,750
And what's sad is whoever's
in the navy circling Iran,

365
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:53,470
they're going to be the ones who fucking
die when he, Ron does launch back.

366
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,460
They're sacrificing themselves for
these generals and defense contractors.

367
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,294
Profits.

368
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,520
Now,

369
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,070
there's some reason to believe that I
ran is not being honest about its nuclear

370
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,620
program. Right. I mean, that was one
of the reasons why it wasn't that,

371
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,380
what was the virus that the United States,
stuxnet,

372
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,190
stuxnet virus that they put on
the Iranian nuclear program to,

373
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,880
to kill it while they were
in the middle of, um, um,

374
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,660
doing whatever they do to uranium.
Right.

375
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,910
It's for the enrich. Enrich uranium.
Yeah. I mean, yeah, that, that was, uh,

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,850
that was also crazy. It's
cyber attacks, right?

377
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,380
Right.
But the cyber attacks,

378
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,380
weren't they effective though
in stopping the nuclear program?

379
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,230
There was like a secret nuclear
program that they were doing.

380
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,810
I don't know what exactly they,

381
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't think that there
ever was a nuclear program,

382
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,830
but I know that that was another crazy
thing that the US did was basically in

383
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,330
fact their thing and destroy
all of this technology.

384
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:47,410
But I mean basically all we need to
know is that they agreed to not develop

385
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:50,830
nukes and it was all agreed
from the international
community and then Trump gets

386
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,570
in there and just unravels at all.

387
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,620
And it's so dangerous because Iran would
make a rock look like child's play.

388
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,970
Yeah.
It's not a joke.

389
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,920
And I mean it's literally so precarious
at this point that anything can happen

390
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,130
any erupt into a full blown war.
And then when Trump says, oh,

391
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:10,540
I pulled back the airstrike because
I wanted to save 150 lives. No Dude,

392
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:14,470
you're starting fires all over the world
and then you get a plotted and you want

393
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:18,580
to congratulate yourself because somehow
he's still kind of appealing to this

394
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,170
like non interventionist lion,

395
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:24,160
which is just fake to me because you
don't appoint the most rabid war hungry

396
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,380
people to surround you and
to carry out these policies.

397
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,360
If you don't want that to a certain,

398
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,690
well it also created is really weird
ideological rift where people were

399
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:38,691
complaining that he didn't do anything
and people were upset that he was going

400
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:42,000
to take action. He didn't. There
was even about drone. Yeah,

401
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,560
well that he will about the drone and
about the attacking of the oil tankers and

402
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:47,670
that he was ready to launch.

403
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,640
Then he didn't and what wasn't
the one on the Fox guys?

404
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,710
It was talking about the consequences
of taking no actions like Brian Kilmeade

405
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,780
or one of those guys.
The media is insane,

406
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,850
but the media has been attacking him and
the Democrats do and the media and the

407
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,730
Democrats always attack this
administration from the right.

408
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,790
Whenever there's some sort
of military involvement,

409
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,230
they always want him to bomb and go
to war. It's pretty shocking. I mean,

410
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:14,750
I guess not too shocking when you
realize the corporate media is literally

411
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:18,020
subsidized by like oil companies
and banks and defense contracts.

412
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,970
No, I know you didn't.
That's pretty crazy.

413
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,550
You didn't have to deal
with that at our ti,

414
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,740
but what do you think happens when
someone is a pundit and they're on a

415
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:30,800
television show and they're talking
about something that has his global

416
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:33,140
implications?
Do you think they get talking points?

417
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,280
Do you think they're allowed to express
their own personal opinions or are they

418
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:40,640
informed that they're supposed
to tow a certain line?

419
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,380
I think there's varying levels. I
think that it would be naive to, okay,

420
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:47,240
these people are paid to lie.

421
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,980
I think that the vast majority of people
working in corporate media are lackeys

422
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,520
for the empire. They really
truly believe that, you know,

423
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,560
they believe that America's the
greatest country in the world.

424
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,300
They believe that we're
the world's policemen.

425
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:02,510
They actually believe that these countries
are evil and they need to be taken

426
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,000
out to in state, kind
of global, have Gemini.

427
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,500
I've truly believe that they cater to
the line of American exceptionalism and

428
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,150
that's pretty sad,

429
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:15,710
but also pretty dangerous because
they're the perfect mouthpieces for us.

430
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:16,920
Foreign policy.
I mean they,

431
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:20,570
they essentially are stenographers for
whatever the government is laying out,

432
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:24,650
which is really disturbing because the
premise of journalism is to actually

433
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,050
challenge power and
challenge the U s government.

434
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,300
Especially when you
are working in America,

435
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,930
you're an American citizen and there's
all this destruction going on from on

436
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,180
behalf of your government and
you're not challenging that,

437
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,190
especially when it's war claims,

438
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,360
especially when you have assholes
like John Bolton claiming, you know,

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,810
all of these things are happening in
these channels and bodies of water and

440
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,640
people are just like, okay. I mean,

441
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,320
God damn you should see when fucking Mike
Pompeo was talking about how Hezbollah

442
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:55,640
was in Venezuela and these people will
just just printed it. They're like, well,

443
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,090
Hezbollah in Venezuela now. It's
like, what are you talking about?

444
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,690
You're literally just printing what the
Trump administration saying without even

445
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,100
questioning these claims.

446
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,260
Hmm.
That's disturbing.

447
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,070
Do you think that the people that are
talking about on TV or just saying it

448
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:13,490
because they really don't understand
what they're talking about?

449
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:18,110
And this just seems to be a way
to cover the subject in sort of a,

450
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,780
a way that zig acceptable to the
network and acceptable to the party and

451
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,320
acceptable to this sort of idea
whether it's left or right,

452
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,140
whether whatever ideology
there they're participating in.

453
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,750
Yes.
That there,

454
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:35,440
there is definitely that as well where
they know kind of the line that they

455
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:38,200
can't cross. So even if you
individually believe, you know,

456
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,660
you think that climate change
is an existential threat,

457
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:43,540
you think that the war in Yemen is a
serious thing that you should address.

458
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,440
I think that you definitely get kind of
knocked down in the editorial meeting.

459
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,250
Yeah. Before and you're just
like, okay, no, I can't do that.

460
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:55,030
But what I can do is just, you
know, talk about whatever. That's,

461
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,240
it's so weird the advertisers
will agree with, in

462
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,380
this day and age,

463
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,940
there's not like a really respected
independent source of news, right.

464
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,140
That you've got some,
the online stuff which is mono,

465
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
there's some online stuff is very good,

466
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,610
but some online stuff is so
entangles with insults and,

467
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,450
and,
and bullshit and,

468
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:25,270
and emotions and distorted perceptions.

469
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,460
And Ego that it's like it
sort of discredits whatever
they're trying to promote

470
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,150
whenever, whatever ideas or trying to
get across. There's no Walter Cronkite.

471
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,900
There's no,
there's no one person who,

472
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,170
or no one organization who you
emphatically trust with their on the news.

473
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:49,230
Everything is either left
or right. Everything is like
flavored by an ideology.

474
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,190
Right.

475
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,080
Of a place that I go to
that I know I can get clear,

476
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,290
unbiased emotion free objective
analysis of any international issue.

477
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,120
Right. It doesn't exist. I don't mean
unless you can tell me if one do you,

478
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:06,590
what do you,

479
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,190
well I mean I go to a real news,
I go to democracy now and the only reason

480
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,610
no super left wing, right,
left wing leaning, but yeah,

481
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,290
left, left leaning. I mean
I go to places that are not,

482
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,340
this is the problem like with capitalism
and try and have an independent media,

483
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:25,341
is that you need funding and you need
funding from like donors and grassroots

484
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:26,401
sources.

485
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:30,330
Because once you get funded by these
right wing billionaires and corporations

486
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,070
and states and governments,

487
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:35,610
then it becomes very ideologically driven
and then you're kind of just catering

488
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:39,240
toward what those interests
want you to present. And I, I'm,

489
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,550
that's why the empire files
does what it does. It's,

490
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,260
we're basically based on donations now
because Trump sanctions on Venezuela

491
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,400
shutdown the show a year ago.

492
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:52,260
So we did a big donation drive and that's
my husband Atrio Patrion we're on go

493
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:54,210
fund me and I'm just paypal.

494
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:59,211
But we're just trying to survive on a
very minimal budget because I don't want

495
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:03,900
to take, you know, I don't want to like
lobby to corporations or states or,

496
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,240
or go that route because I don't want to,

497
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,780
I don't want to answer to
anyone other than myself.

498
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,000
But then you just come with
a whole host of problems.

499
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,650
You're not getting your message out there.
I mean,

500
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,510
that's why it's incredible
for you to have me on.

501
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:20,511
But that's why the fake news mantra
resonated so much with the Trump campaign

502
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:25,500
because people are extremely
disillusioned with the corporate media.

503
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,260
You know, New York Times, Washington Post,

504
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:33,260
these so called beltway publications that
pretend to be like the arbitrators of,

505
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,280
uh, our objective reality. They, um,

506
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,340
they are the premiere advocates of fake
news when it comes to us foreign policy,

507
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,790
you know, American exceptionalism and
corporations and like the corporate line,

508
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:49,710
they're always the ones towing the
things that basically prop up the system.

509
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,480
And so I think people, you
know, became really, really, uh,

510
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,080
just attracted to that whole fake news
mantra that Trump was saying because

511
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,770
people have an extreme distrust in the
corporate media because of the Iraq war,

512
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:04,410
because of all these things that
have happened. But as you know,

513
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,330
and as you've talked about extensively,
Joe,

514
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,770
this wave of censorship that has happened
in the last two years since Trump got

515
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:15,480
elected because of Russian
propaganda and fake news hysteria.

516
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,490
Yeah. And it's just propped up
these same institutions. Um,

517
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,640
and it's really just gone after a lot of
alternative and independent media that

518
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,490
have gone by the wayside.
Yeah. Um, and you know,

519
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,310
people who have been propped up by right
wing billionaires and billionaires in

520
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,740
general are not going to be
effected at the end of the day.

521
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:35,520
But all of the people who've been
caught up in this censorship with the

522
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:40,440
algorithms, with the d platforming,
um, it's really scary. It's really,

523
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,040
really scary what's happened.
It

524
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
is scary to me because the Internet in
my eyes is this unique place where people

525
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,690
can get information and
distribute information.

526
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,090
And then on top of that,

527
00:29:55,091 --> 00:30:00,091
you have this almost parasitic entity
that is allowing you to distribute

528
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,980
information and gather
information through it,

529
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,700
but also controlling the
flow of information and
then controlling the flow in

530
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,850
its own ideological bend like it to Sorta
match its own ideas of what should and

531
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:21,260
shouldn't happen.

532
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,000
I think they feel justified by
having a guy like Trump in office,

533
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,000
having a guy like Trump coming
into office and go, well,

534
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,200
we have to do something about that.

535
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,900
So what we're gonna do is we're
going to silence conservative voices.

536
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,550
We're going to silence
conservative pundits were
going to silence w call people

537
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:41,140
outright and just change our algorithms
to make it much more difficult for them

538
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:43,510
to get propagate for them
to propagate their ideas.

539
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,080
I just find that really distressing
because I think that in the marketplace of

540
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,000
ideas,
you,

541
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:57,030
you're supposed to be able to combat
a bad idea with a better idea.

542
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,520
And this is how we,
this is how ideas evolve.

543
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,000
This is how people get to communicate.
You got to look at what someone's saying,

544
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:04,690
look at someone,

545
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,680
how someone's dissecting what
someone's saying and then for yourself,

546
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,350
figure out what you believe
and what you don't believe.

547
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,010
And there should be a free exchange of
information so that you could figure that

548
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,630
out. And when you show, when someone's
shown to be a bad actor or a liar or show,

549
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,990
have deceptive news, fake news,
whatever you want to call it, the, okay,

550
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,780
now we know and this is
a clear example of that.

551
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,810
So now take it with a grain of salt
whenever they say anything about anything

552
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:32,410
else. But when you d platform them
and shove them aside, they say, see,

553
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,950
they're trying to silence us because
they don't believe us or are they?

554
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:36,400
They don't.

555
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,050
They don't want us to be in power because
they're trying to prop up whatever

556
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:45,550
left wing socialist economy that are
dictated that they want to put into place

557
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,020
and it's this weird sort of situation
where you've got people dictating and

558
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:54,740
almost engineering our culture,
right. Curating our reality. We,

559
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,720
you know what's going on in Toronto with
Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

560
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,580
Now this is a very disturbing thing to a
lot of people where they're essentially

561
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,290
setting up blocks and they're putting
cameras in these places and they're

562
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:12,820
gathering data and information and
the trying to engineer a utopian city.

563
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,560
Yeah. I was reading about it
yesterday and I was like, no,

564
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,770
like this is a terrible idea.
It was like, what if terrifying.

565
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,620
What if these people
don't want to be filmed?

566
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:26,800
What if these people don't want
information gathered about them?

567
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,280
Like they're still doing it
under the guise of here it is.

568
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,090
Alphabets plan for Toronto depends
on huge amounts of data. Yeah,

569
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,340
we need more data collection,
data mining,

570
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,550
their ideas that they're going to make
it easier for people to get around and

571
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:45,050
smoother. But how facial recognition,
I love how they always say, oh,

572
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
people are being sex trafficked and
this will help. It's like, no dude,

573
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:52,470
this is like 0.0001% of all the
people that you're, you know,

574
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,720
data mining. So sidewalks, labs released
more detailed plans for Toronto,

575
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:01,230
the site of Google sister companies
first attempt to bring its technophile

576
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,390
digital forward sensibility to a
full scale development project.

577
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,220
The sidewalks lab,

578
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,140
sidewalk labs projects dates to 2017
when the Canadian city welcome to company

579
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,350
to an undeveloped section
of its waterfront.

580
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,260
Now after 18 months of
speculation work, Oh God, I am.

581
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:24,020
These motherfuckers especially can
work in backlash from local advocates.

582
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,350
The company has a 1,524 page master plan
for the 1212 acre lot called quayside.

583
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,380
First of all,
I hate that fucking name wayside.

584
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,530
That was quite [inaudible]
for volume plan,

585
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:40,280
highlights ambitious and sometimes
flashy innovations from sidewalk labs,

586
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,360
which has played pledged
to spend 1.3 billion on the
project. If it goes forward,

587
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:47,750
the company hopes to construct
all the buildings with timber,

588
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,490
which says is better for the environment.

589
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:54,491
It also catches fire and
build an underground new
modic pneumatic tube system

590
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:59,120
for garbage removal and wants
residence to lean on public transit,

591
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:02,300
walking and biking rather than
personal vehicles. Good luck.

592
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,890
It's fucking zero degrees in Toronto.

593
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,640
You assholes and plans to build
streets with autonomous vehicles,

594
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,520
perhaps from a sister
company. Waymo there. Listen,

595
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,200
every robots with dealing with Waymo
is no, no, I don't need a delivery.

596
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,060
Robots might trundle down. It's wide
sidewalks at your strategic use of large,

597
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,260
very large umbrella like coverings might
make outdoor spaces comfortable all

598
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,710
year round. No small feet and
lake shore Canada sidewalks,

599
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,800
sidewalk wants to designate 20% of its
of the apartments to as affordable and

600
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:37,640
another 20% as middle income. So
they're, they're engineering city,

601
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,300
right?

602
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,300
This is by people who are really
just openly social justice warriors.

603
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,980
I mean these are the people that censored
that James Damore guy and fired him

604
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:53,330
for having this memo of what that really
kind of discussed women in tech based

605
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:57,170
on evolutionary biology based on studies.
And they,

606
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:00,800
they said that he was highlighting
or harmful gender stereotypes,

607
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,870
which it's not true.
It's not accurate.

608
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,760
If you look at what he actually
said and what he actually wrote,

609
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,830
even at a page and a half dedicated
in that memo trying to come up with

610
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:12,500
strategic ways to encourage
women to get into technology.

611
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,990
This study that the paper that
James Damore has no relation to,

612
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,230
the way he's been framed and
the way people talk about him.

613
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,280
And this is a direct result of Google and
Google's social justice warrior or um,

614
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,270
sort of ethos, like the way
they operate as a company. Well,

615
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,430
Google pretends to be, you know, don't
be evil. This is, this seems like style.

616
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,520
Don't make shave up on, don't be
evil. It took that down by the day.

617
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,060
Why the fuck would you ever take that?

618
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,340
Now they're like, okay, where are you evil
now, but this, this just seems like it.

619
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,710
They like plugged in some shit in
algorithm and they're like, all right,

620
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:48,510
this is our city now. Like when
they're creating sims, I mean Google,

621
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,800
I agree with David Pac man's
kind of depiction on Google.

622
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,260
I think that they're a giant corporation.

623
00:35:55,261 --> 00:36:00,261
They have billions off shore in tax
havens and they are not liberal.

624
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,720
They, they appear to be liberal
because that's capitalism.

625
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:07,530
You're trying to basically adapt to where
society is at and you want to pretend

626
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:11,100
like you are socially conscious. But
when you look at their actual policies,

627
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,140
they're conservative as fuck.
I mean,

628
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:17,670
they actually fund a lot of crazy
like Koch Brother, um, Alec,

629
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,660
they fund, um, a lot of right wing
organizations, the federalist society,

630
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,890
they've given a huge grants to.

631
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,290
So I think that they're
kind of playing both sides,

632
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,180
deregulation to lobby for kind of
the deregulation of their industry.

633
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,370
So I think that all of the perception
and the mantra of Google and youtube and

634
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,300
you know, catering to like
the social consciousness and,

635
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,280
and you know,
what you're talking about,

636
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,320
I think is honestly
just to make more money.

637
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,700
Well, I'm sure they're going to make
more money in the process of doing this,

638
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,180
but the idea that they're going to
engineer a city to me is terrifying.

639
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,850
That's insane. I just
don't, I don't like it.

640
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,290
You know there was a great podcast that
Sam Harris did with the guy who was

641
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,700
explaining,
um,

642
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,990
what Google as essentially done
and what they've done with data.

643
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,890
The data is essentially a commodity that
we didn't know as a commodity and we

644
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,030
all gave up our rights to this commodity
and this commodity turns out is worth

645
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,740
billions and billions of dollars and no
one had any idea and they just took it

646
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,310
and now they have it and they have it.
And what are they giving you for this?

647
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:21,860
Right? They'll let you search things
like what are they giving you for this?

648
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:25,370
So let's use their email. Like
it's, it's kind of crazy. Yeah.

649
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,910
They search your email for
certain keywords and all
of a sudden you know you're

650
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,590
looking for a patio chair and you're like,

651
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,390
I'm am looking to buy a patio chair and
also sudden your fucking Google mentions

652
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,480
to fill the patio chairs.
Cause you sent an email really,

653
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:39,340
really creepy or just talk about something
and it talks about, yeah, yeah, yeah,

654
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,860
yeah. Um, my, my guest
yesterday, my friend will Harris,

655
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,080
he was talking about a trading in his
car and he got a fucking text message,

656
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,840
a text message that said,
hey,

657
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:55,580
I hear you're looking to trade in
your car so you know, here, here's a,

658
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,700
here's a link as to what you
could get for it. He goes,

659
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:00,230
I'm not clicking that fucking link.

660
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,220
Like a text message with a link showed
up on his phone because of something he

661
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:08,450
was talking about. He wasn't even talking
on the phone. That's what's crazy.

662
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:12,440
Really, really scary. It's fucking
insane. Yeah. No, that's fine.

663
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,900
How does that happen? Does anybody
know how that happens? Right?

664
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,990
Like if you and I were talking
right now and you said, ah,

665
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:22,250
I need a new laptop and you started
getting laptop ads and your Google feed,

666
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,960
what is happening? Is your phone
listening to you say that? Yeah. Yup.

667
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,580
No, I mean it, it comes
through everything. I mean
that's what's so fucking scary

668
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,310
and that apple is the best at it
in terms of like not up your data.

669
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,400
It's one of the reasons why I still
use an iPhone and support apple.

670
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Apple goes out of their way to not
share your data when you use maps.

671
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,460
That's why apple maps suck.
It's one of the reasons why it's not good.

672
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,480
She was a fucking great article
that was written about it. Uh,

673
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,960
they called apple maps. The being
of a, of of navigation tools.

674
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,950
It's like, you know, bing, the
search engine for the fuck uses that.

675
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,510
I use a windows laptop.
Use being the fuck out of here with that.

676
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,700
Google is better. Right? So you
just got automatically use it.

677
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:10,030
But Google just go and Google fucked.
I mean no and all the,

678
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,540
well going back to this whole
like tech censorship thing,

679
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,690
they preemptively changed the algorithm.

680
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:20,010
That's what so scary to me is that there
wasn't even a law. You know, like China,

681
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,170
we are, we all know that
China's sensors, the Internet,

682
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,760
we've done the same thing here.

683
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,700
But people just think that we
still have freedom of information,

684
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:30,390
that we can all access all these
things. No, I mean Google, youtube,

685
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,250
because youtube is owned by Google now,

686
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,440
but they preemptively
changed the algorithms.

687
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:37,950
They backpage all of this
progressive media, independent media.

688
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,150
So it wasn't just about what they're
saying it's about, I mean, this,

689
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:44,970
this was targeted to
basically all extreme views.

690
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,670
Everything that they felt
like was too radical. I mean,

691
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,460
going back to the DNI report,
which is where this all started from,

692
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,810
this kind of conclusive report that they
said, these 17 intelligence agencies,

693
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,221
you know,
here's,

694
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:59,700
here's all the evidence of how Russia
colluded and costs the election for

695
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:04,020
Hillary. They cited my show on breaking on
breaking the set. The, you did it? Yeah.

696
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,960
They said I was part of
the conspiracy of Russian

697
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:11,170
Madeline. Did you rush in
metal mean are you a Russian?

698
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,210
Putin told me to do, man. I mean,
I'm sorry, take that as a snippet.

699
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,800
But in the,
in the room

700
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,730
poured it said, um, she
fomented radical discontent.

701
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,590
And when you look at what
all this is sowing discord,
all of these, um, you know,

702
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:31,240
the black box algorithm from a Hamilton
68 dashboard like this US government

703
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:36,241
funded Twitter crawler that just like
determines what's Russian propaganda,

704
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,020
what's fake news. And
then you have, you know,

705
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,120
Facebook working with
the Atlantic Council,

706
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:44,020
which is an organization stacked
with the literal spooks, cops,

707
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,940
CIA heads and defense contractors,
UAE, US, government. Um,

708
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,130
that's who's like
curating our reality now.

709
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:56,131
And it's all about expunging the most
radical views on the Internet to prop up

710
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,970
essentially the system
and the establishment.

711
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:01,570
And that's why I know it's not
a liberal or conservative thing.

712
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:06,571
It's literally just extremists thought
and radical thought that challenges the

713
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:11,410
status quo. Um, because sowing
discord just means disagreement.

714
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:16,390
That's what they said. This was about
these websites. So discord, Joan,

715
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,230
I mean that's,

716
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,170
I thought that was a fundamental thing
about American democracy is that you talk

717
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:23,920
about what we disagree on and when you
look at what the report says of what

718
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:26,170
breaking the set covered DMT,

719
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,680
that wasn't in the report you
were on there talking about Dan

720
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,480
that's talked about aliens.
Fuck we wanted,

721
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,220
but because I talked about things like
inequality and occupy Wall Street and

722
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:38,780
Hillary Clinton,

723
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,950
that was all part of this grand
conspiracy to sow discord on behalf of the

724
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:46,640
Russian government. So it becomes
very comical once you, you know,

725
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,650
kind of poke at the underlying narrative
driving this way but sends a share of a

726
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,850
Renee to rest his work.
Did you ever pay attention to know?

727
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,910
She was on my podcast and she
detailed what the IRA did,

728
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,080
the Internet research agency
right in Russia and it was
really fascinating. They,

729
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,200
it's set up like a fake black lives
matter account and then they would talk

730
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,110
about how as black Americans,

731
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,070
we can't vote for Hillary
Clinton because of this.

732
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,730
And they started,
did they develop these communities,

733
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,550
these really large online pages,

734
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,210
whether it was on Facebook or
Instagram or whatever it was,

735
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,250
where they spoke as like a southern
separatists or as a Muslim.

736
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,551
But yeah,

737
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,480
I mean they would have dozens of them
and they developed these communities and

738
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:38,750
they developed these communities and
they would set up these organizations and

739
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:42,630
then they would have events where they
had one where they had a Texas secession,

740
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,350
uh, event directly across
the street from, uh,

741
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:50,540
a Muslim pride event. And they did it
on purpose so that they would fight.

742
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,280
They put him across the
street from each other.

743
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:56,030
They organize these Facebook pages and
these events and these people show up

744
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,910
these people that are Texas a sec,
we should leave the union. You know,

745
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:02,010
we can Texas as a republic.
And then they have these other people on,

746
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,540
they want like Muslim rights and they
want the Sharia law and they put them

747
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,130
right next to each
other and they're there.

748
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,450
They're literally engineering argument
and their engineering fighting.

749
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,690
And the idea was that someone wanted
this to this idea of promoting discord,

750
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,230
right?
They wanted arguments.

751
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,680
They wanted to fuck with our democracy
and that they could shift it just a

752
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,050
little bit. By doing this,
by having these arguments,

753
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:31,460
by pretending that they're there for
Lbgtq rights, but they're really not.

754
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,890
But they're really just, some
Russians are just, you know,

755
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:37,160
talking shit and that this is what we need
to do. We need to radicalize the head.

756
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,290
ANTIFA groups. They had all
these different groups. I mean,

757
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:43,600
Israel and Saudi Arabia do the same
thing except we analyze dramatic. Yes.

758
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,140
I shouldn't be governments unit right now.

759
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,170
It's fascinating that we just
focusing on Russia when my God,

760
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:51,050
this is happening on every front.
I mean look at going back to Pete,

761
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,990
Buddha's judge, judge,
judge, you say his name,

762
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:58,370
but he has like a hundreds of sock puppet
accounts that are all like propping

763
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:03,170
each other up on dress. Oh my God. I
just saw it's like blacks for Pete.

764
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,280
Buddha's judge, gaze for Pete Boucher.
It's like all these making these his,

765
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,710
I mean, I guess he thought
that that was a, I dunno,

766
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,140
injected with corporate money
that he's just like, all right,

767
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:15,890
make a hundred sock puppet accounts. It's
like, Oh God, everyone does this shit.

768
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:19,780
But when we focus in on just Russia,
and then of course you have, um,

769
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,370
the removal of, you know, Syrian accounts.

770
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:25,370
You have the removal of pro
Maduro accounts on Twitter.

771
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,180
Why is it only that we're talking about
our so called enemies that these are the

772
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:32,100
people who are sowing discord
and fomenting radical discontent.

773
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,760
What about all the other countries that,
you know, we do it all over the world.

774
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,710
What about all the other countries
that are doing the same thing?

775
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,340
So if he really does have the sock
puppet accounts that are doing this,

776
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:44,400
that are pretending that these
are just fans, you know, that's,

777
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,400
that's some sleazy shit. Yeah,
it's sleazy as hell. I mean,

778
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,230
that's a sleazy, it gets, in
my opinion, that's dirty shit.

779
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,830
You're pretending you're a person
who's just an independent person who

780
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,470
supporting you when really just is an
employee who's there for some propaganda

781
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,820
purposes. Especially like
the identity politics thing,

782
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:07,200
like all of the different
groups, you know, marginalized
groups support you. Yeah.

783
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,100
It's all fake. While the
craze Astros, you saw that um,

784
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,910
town hall after the shooting a cow,

785
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,420
my top shot sky and then everyone saying,

786
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,470
how the fuck are you going to run for
president when you can't even run a city?

787
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,520
Yeah. Doesn't even job
this one. I'm confused.

788
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,990
Like have jobs running
for president giant jobs.

789
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,410
Who's running the city while he's
there? What's going on? Yeah.

790
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,400
Imagine if I just say, Hey, during this
I'm not going to do this podcast anymore.

791
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,560
Uh,
I'm going to go get a Brian Cowen.

792
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,560
He's going to be meeting here now on
and a I want to run for president.

793
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,630
Might as well Brian callow for
Joe Rogan experience. Like what?

794
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,670
People would be like,
what the fuck is happening here?

795
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,690
It's like you have a fucking city to run.
Yeah. Why are you running for president?

796
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:54,780
How can you, the fucking Metro's
falling apart too much time.

797
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:57,870
Do you spend actually being married
Pussy Shit. Damn money back, dude.

798
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,180
They just want the book deals.
They want to go on the view.

799
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:03,330
They want to have a reason to be
relevant views. It's disgusting.

800
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:07,200
It's pretty gross. It should be illegal,
Megan Mccain. It really should be.

801
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,540
If you really, really shouldn't,
you should quit your fucking job,

802
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,420
whatever you have and dedicate
100% of your time to doing that.

803
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,060
If you think that you could have that,
first of all,

804
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,900
everyone knows what a grueling
thing it is to run for president.

805
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,060
It is a fucking time consuming.
Massive commitment to your energy.

806
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,570
How can you do that and also be
the mayor of South Bend? Yeah.

807
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,290
You just have to be on the phone begging
for donations when you're not jumping

808
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,040
on tables like Robert O'Rourke is all over
the country. It's a lot of work. Yeah.

809
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:38,010
There's no way you run in that city and
how fucking crazy are these people's

810
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:38,844
egos?

811
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,570
I mean they say that Trump
is this existential threat
that he's the next Hitler.

812
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,010
He's mentally incapacitated.

813
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,400
Yet they all jump in the race because
they think they're the smartest people in

814
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,600
the world. So it's like two
Blasio. It's like, really? Yeah,

815
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,430
they're pulling so low drop out,
dude.

816
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,110
This is all to try to prevent
Bernie from winning does.

817
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:02,610
It really is who makes sense to you? Is
Bernie makes sense. Bernie is my guy.

818
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,820
Bernie's my guy through and through.
And I'll tell you why. Because a,

819
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:09,720
we need medicare for all. We need to
abolish student debt and that shit.

820
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:12,810
You just Tax Wall Street
gambling done medicare for all,

821
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:14,220
cut the military budget done.

822
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,670
I don't want to live in a country
where people are rationing insulin.

823
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,120
I don't want to live in a country where
half of the go fund me campaigns are

824
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:24,570
because people are going to die if they
don't get donations for healthcare.

825
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,770
What is wrong with this country?
Um, but back to Bernie, I mean,

826
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:30,430
you look at the last 30 years

827
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,450
of political advocacy.

828
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:35,230
This is a guy who's been the saying
the same thing for 30 straight years.

829
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:39,850
No matter if it's veteran's rights
about Gulf War Syndrome, um,

830
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,580
about just a political
revolution as needed. I mean,

831
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:46,270
he's been talking about that since
he won the Senate seat initially.

832
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,240
And you can't really say the same
thing about any other candidate.

833
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,670
And I do like what
Tulsi Gabbard is saying.

834
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:54,150
And I do like some of the
things Elizabeth Warren, the,

835
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,100
but it seems like she's just making
it up on the fly and adopting kind of

836
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,530
burning light policies.
And I think this is all a strategy to,

837
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,900
to siphon all the delegates away from
Bernie because we already know this Third

838
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:09,130
Way Corporate Wall Street
funded organization that's
like Corporate Democrats

839
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,800
have said they want anyone but Bernie.

840
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,740
Bernie is the biggest threat
to the establishment by far.

841
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Did you see when a Charlemagne called
Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel

842
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,810
Dolezal Oh my God, sure. Facey she's
not, she doesn't have a chance. Not,

843
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,530
she doesn't have a chance
with the trumps shit. No.

844
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,270
Trump has to say as Pocahontas over and
over again, and it's hilarious to me.

845
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,270
As I say, Pocahontas is racist.
Um, it's a fucking Disney movie.

846
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,270
How can Pocahontas be racing flats
up? She really, really screwed up.

847
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,140
That's a big fuck off. It's a really
wound up getting the DNA test.

848
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,150
I am 200 times more African
than she is native American.

849
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,950
Um, I'm 1.6 for example,
man. The Ego of these people,

850
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,890
it's like she's just so upset that Trump,
yeah,

851
00:48:56,891 --> 00:49:01,390
I mean I so nuts that she went and got
jobs saying she was native American.

852
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:05,060
I mean, yeah. It's one thing to
say I have native American blood.

853
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:07,700
It's another thing and I
don't know how much you know,

854
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:11,570
ancestry native American ancestors you
has, but I do know that she was, you know,

855
00:49:11,571 --> 00:49:15,710
that was on like her Harvard yeah.
Bio and all this stuff and it's just like,

856
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:16,790
what is going on?

857
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,560
Well Jamie is going on.
James talked about it.

858
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:25,270
He didn't get them done.
[inaudible] he got into school,

859
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,090
Ohio state. You're a professor. He's
got an iris, but he thought he was,

860
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,670
a lot of people thought he was my,
my wife thought she was,

861
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:36,750
my wife thought she was part
native American, so she got
her DNA. Don's like, hmm.

862
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,940
Fucking bunch of fucking liars.
You know what,

863
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,700
with Warren's more native American
than that wife, that was a thing.

864
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,890
I think my life's still more native
American. She's a little bit,

865
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,360
but that was a thing where,
um, people were like,

866
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:51,870
they wanted it to be spiritual. They
would say they were part native American.

867
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,100
They wanted to be extra cool. Well
my native American blood, oh I can,

868
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,030
I smell and wolves are coming.
Like you can put your ear to the ground.

869
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,923
He know what it's going to rain.

870
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,920
Just they felt like they were
more connected to nature.

871
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,690
It's like some weird thing I remember in
high school, like when kids wanted it,

872
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,780
we cool. They would say they were part
native American and you're like, ah, wow.

873
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,090
Well the native American
community immunity

874
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,060
came out after she got the DNA
test and they said, this is not,

875
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,800
this does not make you native native as
much more than like whatever percentage

876
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:25,790
of your blood. I mean, native is, uh, you
know, it's a way of life. It's a culture.

877
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,800
And it was really kind of, um, gross.

878
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,010
That whole thing was just bizarre.

879
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,730
What was gross is even after the testing,

880
00:50:35,731 --> 00:50:40,140
she was trying to use that as proof that
she was correct and then people will

881
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:44,130
analyze the data, like, are you fucking
crazy? You know, small this percentages,

882
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,110
this is an insanely small percentage.

883
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,810
But she was saying that Trump
needs to give her $1 million. Yeah.

884
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,150
Because of the fact that
she did take the test. Like

885
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,100
it was insulting to the native community.
It was embarrassing all around.

886
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,730
And it was also just weird that she
even did it at the behest of Trump.

887
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:00,380
Like why did you do that?
Yeah.

888
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:01,781
Gotcha.
But he had,

889
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:04,630
she had to do it cause he kept saying
it over and over and over. Right. Yeah.

890
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,720
I feel like she's a
politician, you know, and,

891
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,420
and I say that in the most
unflattering of terms.

892
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:13,960
I feel like she's one of those people
that just says what needs to be said in

893
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:16,210
order to get electronically.
That's what it seems like we're,

894
00:51:16,211 --> 00:51:19,150
I don't get that impression
from Tulsi at all. I don't,

895
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:22,180
I don't feel like that's who she is.
I feel like she's a,

896
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:27,181
a veteran who did two tours in the Middle
East and who's a congresswoman from

897
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,350
Hawaii who really wants to
do good. I mean, I really
do think that what she said,

898
00:51:32,351 --> 00:51:35,950
she doesn't take any corporate
money. None. She wants this,

899
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,390
she wants this job because she thinks she
can do a better job than what has been

900
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:43,040
done before and the other people that
are running for it. I really believe her.

901
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,030
I mean she's, she makes sense to
me. What do you think about Bernie?

902
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,300
I like a lot of things.
Bernie says, you know,

903
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,670
one of the things interesting now that
people are mad at him and he's rich,

904
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:56,140
right, let he met a lot of money off his
book, is that you go write your own book,

905
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,600
your own money. I mean,
and the, there's a lot of,

906
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,480
you know,
criticisms that people lobby against him.

907
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:09,540
What I like about him socially is
that what he is standing for is the

908
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:15,670
downtrodden he's standing for the people
that are dead don't catch a good break.

909
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,810
When he starts talking about things like
income inequality only say I'm like,

910
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:20,350
okay,

911
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:24,940
I understand what you're doing and why
you're saying you put what is the cause

912
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,760
of income inequality. Like what?
That's what we need to find out.

913
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,160
We need to find out what's the cause,
like why,

914
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:33,700
why are these poor communities the way
they are and why that needs to be helped.

915
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:34,870
That needs to be fixed.

916
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,290
There's so much that can be done
that's not being done and right.

917
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,780
At least he seems to be.

918
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,220
He seems to be calling out
to the people that are,

919
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,520
that are ignored,
that you aren't,

920
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,370
aren't being served by Wall Street.

921
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,100
Right. I mean, a big problem
is one automation happened, um,

922
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:00,150
wages stopped going up with inflation
and then credit subsidized all of the

923
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,751
wages.

924
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:05,600
And that's why people are just indebted
to credit card companies where you know,

925
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,480
up to our ears in debt and that,

926
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:10,060
and he does talk about that and he
talks about the solutions to that.

927
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,871
But you're totally right.

928
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:15,871
I mean what other candidates have these
25 people are discussing things that are

929
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:19,510
going to reach like a populist,
you know, have a populous

930
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,890
Andrew that are reaching people.

931
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,950
Andrew Yang is like what Andrew
Yang saying and I, and I, he again,

932
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,110
Tulsi does not seem like a politician.
I believe him.

933
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,720
He's an entrepreneur and a businessman
and he's warning everyone. He's,

934
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,780
he's like the fucking Paul revere of
automation. He's like, you know, look,

935
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:39,480
artificial intelligence is coming
and you're going to be out of jobs.

936
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,320
The fucking half the country is going
to be out of jobs and we can actually

937
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,970
figure out a way to get through this.

938
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,570
And there's a bridge that we can make
and through this universal income,

939
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:49,680
universal basic income,

940
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,880
you can develop a bridge where
you can give people their
basic needs, food, water,

941
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:58,140
shelter, give them food. Like make
sure that no one's starving, that we,

942
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:01,470
even though people were out of jobs,
make sure that their needs are met.

943
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,340
So then they can go and find a way through
this mess and then figure out a way

944
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,700
to contribute and make an income and
make a, make a living and adjust,

945
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,940
but to have nothing to have
nothing. Like what, what is that?

946
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:16,530
Like you can't just have people out of
work because of automation and people go

947
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:20,490
back to the industrial age, well, hey that
happened during this and that and yeah,

948
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,380
okay,
did it didn't,

949
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,360
but it didn't work out well for all
those fucking people that lost those jobs

950
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,171
back then.
We should,

951
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:29,940
we shouldn't have to go through that
massive chaotic situation again.

952
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,220
If there's a way to engineer
a better way through it.

953
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,340
I don't know if universal basic
income works. Um, you know,

954
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:38,550
I've talked to a lot of people
that think like, uh, Nevada, uh,

955
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,590
he was on my podcast recently and his
perspective is it doesn't give people

956
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:46,980
meaning and it's not a good
idea cause you need a life.

957
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,130
If you want people to be happy and you
want the to be able to do something,

958
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,040
they need to have meaning in
their time and what they do.

959
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,990
Just to give people money, it's not
going to make people happy. Okay.

960
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,260
Yeah. I think it's a bandaid.
Yeah. I think it's a bandaid.

961
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:02,370
I agree with the concept that
Yang proposes about ubi, but yeah,

962
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:06,300
I think that if we give people like
healthcare and and have their basic needs

963
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:11,100
met than not, it's going to give them
the ability in them like to maneuver,

964
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:15,270
to find their passion and to be able to
have that space where they can fulfill

965
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,030
their lives.

966
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,790
Yes,
and I think there's a way to do both.

967
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,730
There's a way to find meaning
and have your needs kept. I mean,

968
00:55:21,731 --> 00:55:25,320
the idea is that Jay, you know, it's,

969
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,560
I don't think that people should get
free money to the point where they could

970
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:30,360
live a,

971
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,360
a full rich life and go on
vacations and have a nice car,

972
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,710
a nice house, and never have
to work again. It doesn't
make any sense. You should,

973
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,220
you should contribute, right?
Everyone should contribute.

974
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,990
But if you're in a job that's going to
be completely annihilated by automation

975
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:51,370
and artificial intelligence, it makes
sense that as a community, as a culture,

976
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,730
we should figure out a way to give people
money so that they can have a place to

977
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:59,731
live and food and then try to come up
with and sort of engineer some sort of a

978
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:04,570
program to help people find new ways
of income, new ways of making living.

979
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,570
I don't know what that
would be. You know, and,

980
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,440
and when I talked to Tulsi about that,

981
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:11,260
she didn't know what that would be either
or this idea of trying to promote new

982
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:14,290
jobs. People say that we're gonna,
we're gonna create new jobs.

983
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,920
Like I hate that expression. Like what
does that mean? If there's not a job,

984
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,230
how are you going to create a new journal?
Our infrastructure?

985
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,000
I mean, God damn takes like that. I
mean, good God, we've been given an

986
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,210
f like every year by the army corps of
Engineers and shit's falling apart, dude.

987
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,410
I mean,
look at the new deal.

988
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,900
Look at what Fdr did and that's
what Bernie keeps saying. He's like,

989
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:36,520
I am literally in stating and economic
bill of rights that FDR did a hundred

990
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,820
years ago.

991
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,360
Why am I considered radish a radical
extremist when I'm just trying to give

992
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:45,361
people basic economic rights and trying
to propose jobs to rebuild this country?

993
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,440
What happened to that promise that Trump
lovey during the campaign? We want to,

994
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,180
you know, he talked about
our infrastructure crumbling.

995
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,860
What the hell's been done on that front
and also there was the big one is the

996
00:56:56,861 --> 00:57:00,730
economy like the the debt rather
like how much we're in debt.

997
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,010
We're in debt and more. Oh my God. Yeah.

998
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,910
Crippling one point 6 trillion for
student debt alone. That's insane.

999
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,670
What do you think about the people that
are calling out to try to eliminate

1000
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:12,940
student? I am 100% on board
because as possible, absolutely.

1001
00:57:12,941 --> 00:57:17,770
And you just tax Wall Street gambling
literally that can do it alone.

1002
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,340
You do not have to pay me by Wall Street
gambling. Bernie laid it all out. He,

1003
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:25,030
I just read this morning on the way here,
so I don't know the full proposal,

1004
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:30,010
but Wall Street just makes
you know, billions of dollars.
I don't know how often,

1005
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:34,870
but just like betting on these trading
and shit like Wall Street just make so

1006
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:38,860
much money and if we just
taxed Wall Street or you know,

1007
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:39,970
like you're talking about taxing,

1008
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:43,510
these defense contractors are actually
trying to change the laws to not have

1009
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:48,280
these corporations hide billions of
dollars off shore and tax havens.

1010
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:52,090
It solves all of these
problems pretty quickly. Um,

1011
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,300
and it's not a matter of how can we do it.

1012
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:59,140
It's a matter that we have to do it
because students are totally crippled.

1013
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,560
There's no opportunities in this country
inequalities the highest that it's been

1014
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:05,080
since the great depression
and that's a huge problem.

1015
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:09,430
We're not going to be able to get people
opportunities at all or a better life.

1016
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,600
It's also so crazy that you do that to
people that are 17 years old, right?

1017
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,380
They don't have any idea what it's
going to be like to be 35 and be quarter

1018
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,070
million dollars a year.
Parents have student debt.
Yeah, they did. Yeah. My step,

1019
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:25,150
my step father was in debt when he,
when he graduated from school.

1020
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,180
It just seems like it's getting
so exponentially worse. Yeah.

1021
00:58:29,181 --> 00:58:30,700
I mean he handled it,

1022
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,800
but it's what you have
today if you don't have any,

1023
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:40,740
if you don't have any grants and you just
try to go to school based on, you know,

1024
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,280
on loans. Greg Fitzsimmons
was here. What was he saying?

1025
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,270
His kids were, it was 60 plus thousand
dollars a year for each one of those kids,

1026
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,653
I think a year.

1027
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,550
And then there's each one of his kids
and there's no jobs once you go and you

1028
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:56,080
know, go to school. Right.

1029
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,350
I mean especially if you have anything
technologically related to the idea that

1030
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,460
at the end of four years the technology
is going to be relevant. It's, it's great.

1031
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,690
Right? Exactly. Then here's the crazy
thing, like we all know that kids,

1032
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:08,890
human beings,

1033
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,430
their frontal cortex isn't even fully
developed by the time they're 25 until

1034
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:14,590
they're 25 wow.
I smoked way too much.

1035
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,910
We had four then we saw
much smarter than I am.

1036
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,980
So lucky that I always smoke weed like
maybe six times before I was 30 I get

1037
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:27,740
super late. Yeah. Yeah. When
I was 30 I became a stoner.
I was, was not a pod headed.

1038
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,480
I thought it was for losers.
I thought it just made me,

1039
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,660
because in a lot of people that don't
smoke pot think that they think it just

1040
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:35,870
makes you lazy and stupid,
but being lazy and stupid,

1041
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,610
it turns out it makes you lazy and
stupid. Right. It's not actually apply.

1042
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,130
It turns out it was not the pot.
But yeah,

1043
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:46,520
I tell everybody just don't do it
when you're a kid or if you do do it.

1044
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:50,350
Don't do it often. I mean, if
you, I don't think it's, you know,

1045
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,800
like if you're fucking 18 years old,

1046
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:53,750
you smoke weed once in a
while with your friends.

1047
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:57,110
I don't think you're gonna get fucked
up. But, but like every day, stoners,

1048
00:59:57,111 --> 00:59:59,930
it's terrible for you. It's
just, you're, you're in a fog.

1049
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:03,110
Like you need to be able to deal
with reality. But what in it?

1050
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,820
Like I always say it's a tool. Use it.
Use it correctly. Don't, don't, you know,

1051
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,860
don't try to do everything
with a fucking hammer.

1052
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,440
Sometimes you need a screwdriver,
sometimes you need a saw. John,

1053
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:17,390
she has a battery your fucking life
with weed. But occasionally you smoke,

1054
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,580
uh, weed, smoke a joint
rather than, you know,

1055
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:23,510
you have a meal with a friend and
you feel like more close to them.

1056
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,280
The Communications Fun, you're warm
and friendly. It's like, it's a great,

1057
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,430
I don't want to call it a drug
cause I don't like that expression.

1058
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:36,200
This blanket throw over amphetamines
and sedatives and all these different

1059
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:38,350
things and you throw marijuana in there.
It's,

1060
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,210
it's a sacrament and I think it should
be used in the most general and the

1061
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:47,060
lightest use of that term as a sacrament.
I like to use it,

1062
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,590
I like to use it for certain things,

1063
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,560
but it's definitely not something you
should use all the time. It's just,

1064
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,280
it's definitely not something you should
use as, as a kid, you know? And I,

1065
01:00:55,281 --> 01:01:00,140
I see a lot of kids that are smoking
every day. I'm like, man, yeah,

1066
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,480
yeah, yeah. I mean,

1067
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,920
it's used as a crutch more and more
because I think people are just trying to

1068
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:08,680
numb out what the shore, but pay
better that than pills. Right.

1069
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,240
You know better that
than alcohol. God, dude,

1070
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,780
I just read something about how death by
suicide is going up in the US and it's

1071
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:19,900
going down and almost every other
country in the world. It's like,

1072
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,600
what does it really fucked up
problem everything, man. I mean,

1073
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:25,680
it's the same reason
why so many people are,

1074
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,080
it's the same reason why
people are dying on, you know,

1075
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,430
Dean on prescription pills.

1076
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:36,431
It's like America's uniquely fucked
in so many reasons and I think it's,

1077
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,100
it can be the lack of health care.
It's, it's that we're, you know,

1078
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:41,870
the center of global capitalism.
I mean,

1079
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:46,790
there's a lot of reasons why essentially
the empty pursuit. Realistic,

1080
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,780
Yup. Yup. It's an empty pursuit. Right?
And when you get there, it doesn't,

1081
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,520
doesn't feel good.
You just like,

1082
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,910
you just keep trying to chase
in more and gather more things.

1083
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,240
Just like that study that shows that
there's a cap on happiness. It's like,

1084
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,680
it doesn't make you happier when you
have more money in certain points. Yeah.

1085
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,470
100%.
And I'm in agreement with that.

1086
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,930
Doing something you love
is what makes you happy.

1087
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,410
Having good friends and having
family and people that you love,

1088
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,000
that makes you happy. Doing things
that you find rewarding, you know,

1089
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:21,630
and helping people. That's the weird one.
Like helping people makes people happy.

1090
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,180
And this, it's so kind of
like, people are like, yeah,

1091
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:27,960
you got to look out for yourself to take
your business. Right. It turns out no.

1092
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:31,890
Yeah, no, no. For other people
is like super rewarding.

1093
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:37,070
Like it's a selfish thing to be generous
and kind selfish in lot of ways because

1094
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,170
it really helps yourself. Well,
that's the whole mantra of,

1095
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,520
of growing up in America as you need to
help yourself and you're a loser if you

1096
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:48,870
don't get rich and all this shit. It's
all these impossible, um, you know,

1097
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:51,750
goals that we can't do without
actually help from each other. No.

1098
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:55,950
The biggest losers, rich people
who are sad, right? God Damn Right.

1099
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,500
You're rich and you're still depressed.

1100
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,460
You're super successful and
you're still depressed. I've, wow,

1101
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,240
you built a shitty house.
Like your foundations sucks.

1102
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,580
You know what I mean? Cause like your
foundation, like who you are as a person,

1103
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:15,150
like the way he treat people,
the way you view the world,

1104
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:19,290
the way you love your friends and
your family, that's your foundation.

1105
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,620
And if you become successful
and you have that foundation,

1106
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,300
I feel like you can still be happy.

1107
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:28,290
But if you become successful and you just
shit that foundation away because you

1108
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,990
just wanted to make it, I'm just
going to make it fuck all that stuff.

1109
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:33,090
I don't need that then I don't need love.
I don't need any of that.

1110
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,510
And then you make it and you
just sitting there alone. Yes.

1111
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:38,160
It's like a fucking tomb.

1112
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,490
That's why I think that's why a lot of
people like Trump because they think of

1113
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:44,700
him and like, I've actually heard this
term like a blue collar billionaire.

1114
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:49,650
It's like what? He was given a million,
if everyone's given $1 million from their,

1115
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,320
pappy is a couple million.
Yeah, a couple, a few,

1116
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,570
couple of million from
their daddy. Um, yeah,

1117
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,780
you'd probably have it a lot better off.
Small loan of a couple of million bucks.

1118
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:02,540
No big deal. Unbelievable dude.
To him, that is a small loan now.

1119
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:05,010
That's what's really bizarre.
He, yeah, he's someone,

1120
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:07,080
I think Matt Taibbi described it best.
He's like,

1121
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,820
what a stupid poor person thinks of
as a rich person. Oh my God. Yeah.

1122
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,670
And his, and his idea is just
to throw money at everything.

1123
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:15,840
Like the Palestine Israel thing.

1124
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,590
Did you see Jared Kushner's whole layout
of like this is the new peace plan? No.

1125
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:24,150
Oh my God.
It's literally just let's give them jobs,

1126
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,270
meaning let's have corporations
like basically profit off.

1127
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:32,271
The occupation was interesting to me is
that even right wing Trump supporters in

1128
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:36,360
particular should say right wing Trump
supporters do not seem to like them,

1129
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,310
do not seem to like Jared Cushner or they
don't like the fact that his daughter

1130
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,220
is working in the White House
and that the southern law is,

1131
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:47,460
they're running things like they're very
disturbed by that. They don't like that.

1132
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:51,060
Yeah. Nepotism. I mean, well, what's weird
is they just blow at the fucking wind.

1133
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:51,301
Man.

1134
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:55,510
I saw fair and had 11 nine
totally recommend it to
everyone that is listening.

1135
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,100
Michael Moore's newest documentary.
Oh my God, it's amazing.

1136
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:03,690
But the first 20 minutes just shows
like how Hillary lost and it shows that

1137
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,830
Jared Cushner actually lobbied to
have sicko in theaters all across the,

1138
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:11,640
I mean he was forced socialized medicine
and he was like working hand in glove

1139
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,260
with Michael Moore to roll this out.

1140
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,070
It just shows you how fickle they are
and like how they just have no actual

1141
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,200
value trying to make money.

1142
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,560
Yeah, just try and make
money. This is a great idea.

1143
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:21,730
You know his voice is really high.
He's like,

1144
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,410
it's weird. Yeah, it's super weird. I'm
sure the two of them together, it makes,

1145
01:05:27,411 --> 01:05:31,430
it's very strangely they have
sex. I think they do. No,

1146
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,640
I think jerks off with a cop. She gets
up, she squirts it in there and shit.

1147
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,474
She kicks him

1148
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:44,950
never out in fair night,
11 nine

1149
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,340
he shows a just how bizarre and
inappropriate Trump is with the Banca,

1150
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:51,970
but there's this one talk show where the
host is just like Ivanka. She's like,

1151
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,250
what are what? What do you have
most in common with your dad?

1152
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,040
And she's like real estate and
golf and she's like, Trump,

1153
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:59,580
what do you have most in common? The bunk.
And he's like, well I would say second.

1154
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,460
Whoa.
Yeah,

1155
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,590
that's like w w what father says that?

1156
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,160
Well like what do you have most
in common with your baby sec

1157
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,720
comment, your move. A lot of uncommon
cuts. It just in common in common.

1158
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,590
That's such a crazy super just Friday
and like I want to fuck her but I can't

1159
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,460
because she's my daughter. He just
says so many crazy things. I just,

1160
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,580
I think that guy is just always talking,
you know?

1161
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:32,520
And when you're always talking to him
for a good chance to really contemplate

1162
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,440
what you're saying,
you're just always just talking.

1163
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,440
And then once you're taught like so
many times during the campaign trail,

1164
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,720
it just seems like you would say things
and then you would just have to like

1165
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:43,140
justify what he said. You know,
I've done that. When I was younger,

1166
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,410
I would say something stupid and then I
would have to try to figure out how to

1167
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:48,560
make that stupid thing
makes sense. Right, right.

1168
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
In Trump's just constantly
goes 27 year old man.

1169
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,910
I'm like, yeah, it's here. Play Ivanka,

1170
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,060
what's the favorite thing you
have in common with your father?

1171
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:08,610
Either real estate or Gulf.
Donald's with your daughter. Well,

1172
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:11,660
I was going to say sex,
but I can't relate that,

1173
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:19,010
that's the crazy thing is he thought about
it and decided he wasn't going to say.

1174
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,400
Yeah,
I was going to say.

1175
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,953
And everyone's like,

1176
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,300
yeah, cause he's on Wendy Williams
and he wanted people to scream.

1177
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:30,140
I want to say just a good
opportunity to say sex like

1178
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,110
crazy.
He's out of his mind.

1179
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,990
Oh, there's a whole montage of creepy
shit that he said like he would date her,

1180
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:42,850
you know, when she was
a baby, he was like,

1181
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:47,650
she's gonna grow up and hopefully have big
tits or whatever. Like he said, really?

1182
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,240
And he hates Tiffany.
He hates Tiffany because she is not,

1183
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,040
because she's not attractive.

1184
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,070
Oh, that's the the one. Yeah,
with Marla maples. Does that
the other daughter. Good,

1185
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,920
good point. I don't actually
know who Tiffany is. I mean,

1186
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,630
I think he had her with the
was very attractive, so it's
weird. That is weird. Oh,

1187
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,460
something happened.
Some sort of cross inbred lighting,

1188
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,670
but he just pretends like she
doesn't exist. It's kind of sad. Wow.

1189
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,470
Are you to do these?
Look,

1190
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:22,400
I don't know how the fuck you can pay
attention to anything other than I don't

1191
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:25,850
understand how a president,
it's still a job. I mean,

1192
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,850
it was a great job when Lincoln
was running things, you know,

1193
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:31,730
and probably extremely chaotic.
But with today's economy,

1194
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:34,130
when you're dealing with all these
different threats to the environment,

1195
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:39,410
cyber threats, the economy, all the shit,

1196
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,340
they have to deal with.

1197
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,490
The idea that one person that's supposed
to be the general manager of the

1198
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,660
country, the company. That's
absurd. Absurd. It's absurd.
And the pardoning power,

1199
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:51,080
usually that's supposed to be like
sympathy pardons for people like Chelsea

1200
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:55,280
manning. Yeah. Not for war criminals
who have killed a bunch of civilians.

1201
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,820
Like what is, I mean basically saying,
has he done that yet? Is He, is he,

1202
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:05,270
he's, he's talking about as the seal.
This is like more than just the seal.

1203
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,310
I mean he's,
he's contemplating actually partnering

1204
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,011
the No Service Square
Massacre Blackwater employees.

1205
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:11,870
It's like what the fuck is going on here?

1206
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,130
But that's to me that's like sending a
message to soldiers like act like Isis

1207
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:19,550
and you'll be fine all part in you.
Meanwhile look at what he's doing.

1208
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:23,750
A Julian Assange. Yeah. This
is like going beyond the Japan.

1209
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:28,030
Sean's things weird cause I thought that
he would be a guy that would want Julia

1210
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,410
the Sonjay out talking out
of both sides of his mouth.

1211
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:34,940
He said how many times during the campaign
trail, wikileaks, I love wikileaks,

1212
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,430
but then you look back
before the campaign,

1213
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:41,810
he said Julian Assange to get the death
penalty on Fox and friends back in the

1214
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,261
day.
But again,

1215
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,650
I think he probably thought about that a
micro second before he said it and then

1216
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:49,300
how to justify it. Right. What I mean he's
just like, he's just talking to crazy.

1217
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,340
You probably had eight cups of coffee,
four red bulls to diet pills.

1218
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:57,350
I just went out there and that, that
doll so scary though. I mean a Sanje, um,

1219
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,460
that it's beyond the Pale because now
you're not just prosecuting whistleblowers

1220
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:04,490
with the espionage act,
you're actually prosecuting publishers.

1221
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:10,210
That's like a whole level of a direct
assault on the first on journalism press.

1222
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:13,580
Yeah. He's a legitimate
journalist in that regard. Right.

1223
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:18,170
What he's doing is he's distributing
information people that is literally when

1224
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,490
it changed the way people view the way
the government and the military works.

1225
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,360
It's,
I mean,

1226
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:28,130
it's incomprehensible how much the world
has changed and what we are aware of

1227
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:30,830
because of wikileaks revelations
in the past 10 years. I mean,

1228
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:33,380
even just the film that I just
made Gaza fights for freedom,

1229
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,280
I cite a wikileaks cable about how Israel
wanted Hamas to win and Gaza and um,

1230
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:43,220
they said that they were strategizing for
that to happen so then they can regard

1231
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:46,070
Gaza as a hostile territory and
then just relentlessly bombed them.

1232
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:49,700
That was because of wikileaks. I found
that out because of that. I mean,

1233
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:54,110
I can't believe what is going
on because people, um, I didn't,

1234
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:54,861
I don't think that,

1235
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:58,430
that people really knew that Trump
would take these powers and becomes so

1236
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:00,550
authoritarian with them.
Well,

1237
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,620
what's disturbing to me is wikileaks
used to be something that people on the

1238
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,980
left would cite as evidence at the
military was out of control or that the

1239
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:14,100
military industrial complex is of
control then because feel like somehow

1240
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,830
or another, the wikileaks was
involved in helping Trump.

1241
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:21,240
They became a Russian mouthpiece and a,
and a trader.

1242
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:26,080
I mean like the left over the last
few years in particular, since the,

1243
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,390
since 2016 wikileaks
has been sort of read,

1244
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,790
sort of redefined.

1245
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,780
They're conflating Julian Assange,
just personal politics.

1246
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:36,980
And I don't know what those are.

1247
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:40,400
I know that he had those private
dams with Trump jr, which looked bad,

1248
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:44,420
but what did he say to Trump jr he
was talking to him about, you know,

1249
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,800
we need your tax returns.

1250
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,900
So then people don't think of us as
like a biased organization and the,

1251
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:51,260
and it would look good and kind of like,
you know,

1252
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:53,150
a little too buddy buddy with Trump jr.

1253
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:58,151
But that does not take away from the
importance and validity of what wikileaks

1254
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:01,670
is as an organization. It's
awesome. What's curves area?

1255
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:05,360
Talk to another person giving
their opinion, which makes sense.

1256
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,200
People just really don't like join
us on [inaudible] as a person.

1257
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,510
And it doesn't matter how
much you hate Julian Assange,

1258
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:16,160
this is completely beyond the Pale
what's going on to him. And um, it's,

1259
01:12:16,161 --> 01:12:17,810
it's,
he needs to be defended,

1260
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:20,860
his rights need to be defended and
very few people are defending him.

1261
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,220
That's even more interesting.
What's crazy is these charges, um,

1262
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:26,690
that just got unveiled what
the Trump administration,

1263
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:28,580
they're trying to extradite
hinder the u s of course,

1264
01:12:28,581 --> 01:12:31,790
and he'll just be sitting in a cell for
the rest of his life if he doesn't face

1265
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:32,630
the death penalty.

1266
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,560
But the charges have nothing to
do with the 2016 election at all.

1267
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,020
Do they all have to do with the,
um, the massacre, the collateral,

1268
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,210
the collateral murder video.

1269
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,000
That's what it has to do with it has
to do with the same thing that Chelsea

1270
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:50,060
manning was in jail for releasing to him.

1271
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,740
And so they've just trumped up all these
charges based on him publishing war

1272
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:56,630
crimes.
And that's really what this is.

1273
01:12:56,631 --> 01:13:00,670
It's publishing war crimes
and embarrassing the US
empire. And what is the, what,

1274
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,210
what are they saying? What are
they calling it? Like what is the,

1275
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:07,960
the actual chairs saying that he
helped Chelsea manning hack into,

1276
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:12,020
I forget. It's like some sort of
charge that it's basically concocted.

1277
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,821
Um,
they're saying that he helped,

1278
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:17,030
Chelsea manning basically released the
information to him and that's how he's

1279
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:20,780
part of the conspiracy. It's total
bullshit. Completely concocted. He,

1280
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,690
he's a political prisoner
and he needs to be freed.

1281
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,920
And it's absolutely astounding that the
Trump administration is doing this and

1282
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:31,310
that people are going along with it. I
see people applauding this. It's sick.

1283
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,160
It's weird.
It's weird.

1284
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,460
It's weird that shift in how people
used to defend him and now no longer do.

1285
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:39,930
And nothing really has changed
in terms of what he's actually,

1286
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:40,460
dawn,

1287
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:44,810
it was a traumatic election and people's
reptile brain's got activated hardcore.

1288
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:49,490
Yeah. And they think everything is Russia
and they think join us on just Russia.

1289
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,820
And I think anyone who's talking about
what us foreign policy is towing the

1290
01:13:52,821 --> 01:13:54,800
Russian line,
towing the Kremlin line.

1291
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,900
It's not about the people
who control this government.

1292
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:59,960
It's the dark evil forces behind your
friends and family and the people who are

1293
01:13:59,961 --> 01:14:03,230
talking about, you know, sowing
discord and shit. And that's,

1294
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,920
it's a disturbing time because it's
hard to relate and actually have these

1295
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:08,060
discussions with people.

1296
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:12,280
Yeah. I think you nailed it
when you said the 2000 elections

1297
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:17,020
of sort of they've awakened this reptile
brain because that's what it seems like

1298
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:17,830
you're seeing.

1299
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:21,100
He's seeing so many people that think
that there's a war going on like a war in

1300
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:24,310
this country. Right. Instead of discussing
things, they don't want any discussion,

1301
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:26,230
they want to shut things down.
And that's part of, I think,

1302
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:30,610
some of the motivation behind this and
justification for d platforming people,

1303
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:34,570
wiping them out, like remove
them, get them out. You know,

1304
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:38,680
we are at war right now, we have to fix
this. We have to get a woman president,

1305
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:40,570
we have to be a gay man.
We have to get, you know,

1306
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,790
it's like this kind of shit that you see,

1307
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,580
like they feel like they're
in an ideological war.

1308
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,140
That's why identity politics
is so fascinating because
it's just been adopted by

1309
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:51,070
the establishment,

1310
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,980
by the liberal wing of the establishment
to try to like trick people that were

1311
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:58,960
somehow a progressive society that
it's all just like corporatism with,

1312
01:14:59,370 --> 01:14:59,710
you know,

1313
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:03,640
under the flag and the banner of like
social politics and identity politics.

1314
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,450
And it's completely absurd.
I mean, with Barack Obama,

1315
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,120
we thought that we were in a post
racial society because we had a black

1316
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:13,750
president and we know that
that's absolutely a falsehood.

1317
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,980
So I just think that we're just going
down the wrong path here and I'm,

1318
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:19,830
Neo liberalism has really,
uh,

1319
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:24,880
done a number on this country in the
world and we're going to see kind of more

1320
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:29,590
authoritarian fascist policies take root
because people are really down and out

1321
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:34,450
with, with how capitalism
has morphed and um,

1322
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,830
has strangled basically the economy.
It's really disturbing because you know,

1323
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:43,690
you're looking at like left identity
politics but it's under the banner of

1324
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,450
capitalism.
So really it's just about privatization.

1325
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:51,070
Neo Liberalism has just
about privatization. So
it's not about like leftist,

1326
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:53,950
you know, socialist politics and even
you look at someone like Bernie Sanders,

1327
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:58,030
he's not a socialist, he's
a democratic socialist. Um,

1328
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,070
which means that he just
wants social democracy.

1329
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,250
He's not talking about abolishing
private industry's not talking about

1330
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,180
nationalizing anything.

1331
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:08,230
He's just talking about having workers
have a seat at the table and getting the

1332
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,960
fair share.
So we're just kind of,

1333
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:15,970
we've gone off the wayside
of like rhetoric and we just
have no idea how to talk

1334
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:20,971
about these things in like a fair
way because things are so heated and

1335
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:26,281
ideological and people are just blinded
I think and and don't really understand

1336
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:30,940
these issues well enough and it's really
disturbing because we're at a point in

1337
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:35,890
our country where we need
to have conversations. We
don't just want soundbites,

1338
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:39,820
but going back to the the censorship
stuff and the consolidation of corporate

1339
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,830
media,
people don't have the platform.

1340
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,950
They don't have the voice to
get these ideas out there,

1341
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:49,480
which is why your show is so important.
I mean having people like me like Tulsi,

1342
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:54,481
I mean bringing out these concepts and
and shifting the consciousness is very,

1343
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:56,314
very important.

1344
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:01,450
Well I think that when people are hearing
the same thing over and over and over

1345
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:06,010
again from one side and then an opposite
view over and over again from another

1346
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:10,040
side, it's, it's very difficult
to have an understanding

1347
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,120
of what the fuck is going on.

1348
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,480
It's very confusing to most people and
I think they tend to either just give up

1349
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:22,450
or they tend to just find whatever side
seems to get them the most social credit

1350
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:26,510
or the most most a reasonable
perspective in their terms,

1351
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:30,140
like whether it's left wing or right
wing and then just support that.

1352
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:35,141
Just just given to that and then just
have this pattern that they adopt this,

1353
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:41,090
this conglomeration of opinions they
adopt and then they're so busy with their

1354
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:42,340
jobs are so busy with their family,

1355
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:46,250
they're so busy with her life and then
all this other shit when you're seeing,

1356
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,410
you know,
deregulation,

1357
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:52,430
all this other shit you're seeing when
the stuff that caused the banking crisis,

1358
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:56,840
this stuff, all this stuff is going on
and it's going on without their knowledge.

1359
01:17:56,841 --> 01:18:00,740
It's all happening underneath the surface
and then something erupts like the

1360
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:03,470
economic collapse of 2007
2008 and they were like,

1361
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,570
what the fuck is happening right now?
This happened,

1362
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:09,410
I didn't see this coming
and now the economy crashes
and then we have to buy out

1363
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:10,730
all these fucking banks.
And then,

1364
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:14,030
and then it rebuilds back up and people
were still doing the same goddamn thing.

1365
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:16,670
They're still working and
trying to get ahead and try it.

1366
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,240
And then all this is happening behind
the scenes and it's so incredibly

1367
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,380
difficult to pay attention to all of it.
Of course,

1368
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,150
to really develop a nuanced
perspective of what the problems are,

1369
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,110
how to fix them,

1370
01:18:27,111 --> 01:18:32,111
and then who is actually going to support
a real tangible solution versus who's

1371
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,990
just saying some Elizabeth
Warren type shit to get elected.

1372
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:36,441
Well,

1373
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:40,820
that's why we need a real mobilization
in the streets because there's no person

1374
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,760
who's going to change this.
There's no top down, you know,

1375
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,940
implementation that's really
gonna Revolutionize Society
and get people living

1376
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:49,910
wage and get people healthcare.
Even Bernie said,

1377
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:54,680
I'm not going to be able to do this.
I need you to come out to get my back.

1378
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,270
Right. Um, but yeah,

1379
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:59,030
I mean there's nowhere in the country
that you can live if you're living on

1380
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:02,030
minimum wage and actually afford
a two bedroom apartment. I mean,

1381
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:06,490
that's the reality here. But when
we bailed out the banks in 2008, um,

1382
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:10,460
no one had a fur had fretted about how
we're going to pay for that. I mean,

1383
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:12,350
it was just, it was just
kind of understood. Okay,

1384
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:17,060
we're going to pay and give the banks
the bailout. What about fucking us?

1385
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,210
Yeah. Don't we deserve a
bailout? What about the people?

1386
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,613
Yeah,

1387
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:29,830
thanks too big to fail. The banks failed
in the people fail. It's unbelievable,

1388
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:33,430
man. And all this shit that were
spent, I mean, the Venezuela's shit,

1389
01:19:33,431 --> 01:19:38,200
all these sanctions, uh, it
is the Venezuela coup. I mean,

1390
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:40,030
where are you following that?
That was insane.

1391
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:44,690
Falling in as much as you were
sort of putting all as much.

1392
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,170
You are putting a very alternative view,
uh,

1393
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,400
as opposed to like what we're seeing in
either left or right wing publications.

1394
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:56,660
You were in the, and you face a lot of
resistance because of that. Right? Right.

1395
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:57,800
But you were there.

1396
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:03,040
Yes, yes, I was there. And
that's why I knew with my own,

1397
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,470
I mean I saw with my own eyes,
the reality on the ground.

1398
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,780
And what do you think is over there? So
what is happening over there? I mean,

1399
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:12,240
if you pull Venezuelans themselves,

1400
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:15,990
they will say that their quality of
life has less than two because of US

1401
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,824
sanctions.

1402
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,030
So back in 2015 Obama declared
Venezuela in national security threat.

1403
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:22,710
Very random.
There was no threat,

1404
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:27,060
obviously posed to the u s but it was
just to kind of start the sanctions on

1405
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:31,470
them. But when the truncation,
who knows, who knows?

1406
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:32,130
Pressure.

1407
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,130
I mean there's always been pressure
because of course the US has always hated

1408
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:39,720
Maduro and hated you go Chavez and the
US empire doesn't forget and it doesn't

1409
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:41,040
forgive.
And you know,

1410
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:45,420
going back to 2002 Bush tried to
engineer a coup against who goes Chavez.

1411
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,111
That didn't work.

1412
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:49,980
And so what we've done with these civil
society organizations is try to foment

1413
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,700
radical discontent on the ground
in Venezuela to try to, you know,

1414
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,460
get some sort of uprising.
Um,

1415
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:01,490
the guy won Ypo was just some guy plucked
from obscurity who was just well known

1416
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:04,260
in Georgetown in Washington DC.

1417
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:08,490
Much more well known there and then he
wasn't even in Venezuela. So, you know,

1418
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:11,230
this was completely engineered.
It was totally concocted.

1419
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,920
No Venezuelans really knew who he was.

1420
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:18,810
I think like 80% of Venezuelans had
no idea who [inaudible] was, but um,

1421
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:19,081
you know,

1422
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:23,820
the economy went into a spiral because
oil prices dropped and they would've been

1423
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:25,350
able to pick back up their economy.

1424
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:29,730
But unfortunately the sanctions were so
debilitating that it went to complete

1425
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:33,180
freefall. Um, Venezuela's
not a socialist country.

1426
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,070
That's actually the vast majority is
private industry and a lot of those, um,

1427
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,430
private CEO's are very anti government.
Um,

1428
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,670
long story short is that the
coup was initiated, you know,

1429
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,360
during the Trump administration after
he slept like 70 sanctions on Venezuela.

1430
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:51,390
And we're talking about medicine,
food,

1431
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:54,120
all the things that they're
saying that they need, right.

1432
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,820
That they're trying to stage
these fake aid caravan deliveries,

1433
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:57,990
that was all bullshit.

1434
01:21:57,991 --> 01:22:00,840
What they're doing is actually preventing
the delivery from food and medicine

1435
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:01,980
from getting the Venezuelans.

1436
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:05,970
And this coup was a failure because the
resilience of the Venezuelan people,

1437
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,300
they believe that they have a democracy.
They do have a democracy.

1438
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:11,610
It's actually more free than,
than our democracy.

1439
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,430
There's not a dictatorship there.
Um,

1440
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,600
Maduro won a presidential election last
year. He won a presidential election.

1441
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:21,990
The US lobbied the opposition
candidates to not run against him.

1442
01:22:21,991 --> 01:22:25,170
So then they can say it was illegitimate,
that it was a dictatorship.

1443
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,810
And so he won.
He won the popular vote,

1444
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,810
and they tried to implement all these
things and they've been blocked.

1445
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,250
And you know, the opposition keeps
crying to the US that they need help,

1446
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:36,390
that they need to be invaded.

1447
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,990
It's pretty disturbing when you
have opposition candidates saying,

1448
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:44,460
slap sanctions on us and Vader, our
country help us. Trump help us. I mean,

1449
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,130
it's absolutely ridiculous.
But when I was on the ground,

1450
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:51,000
I saw a flourishing democracy.
I saw dozens of people,

1451
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:54,300
hundreds of people who said that
they love the process there,

1452
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:57,510
that they believe in the bullet Varian
movement and that they're Chubbies mode

1453
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,523
til death.

1454
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:02,910
And we don't understand because those
people's voices are totally censored from

1455
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:03,744
corporate media.

1456
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:07,750
The only Venezuelans that we hear from
an corporate media are rich opposition.

1457
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,650
Either you know,
expats or people who just have fled.

1458
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,830
And what do we hear from corporate media?
What does, what does the corporate take?

1459
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:18,430
So this is even Elizabeth Warren, even
Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this.

1460
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:22,240
Um, I mean it's, it's really bad. I
mean their take on corporate media,

1461
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:26,970
if you're looking at like
Fox News, they'll say we
need to overthrow Maduro and,

1462
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,210
and you know, everyone's starving
and it's a failed state. Um,

1463
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:33,400
they never mentioned the sanctions.
They never mentioned.

1464
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:38,401
The fact that US sanctions just from
2017 alone has killed 40,000 Venezuelans.

1465
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:43,770
This was just a study out by seper
40,000 Venezuelans have died from Trump's

1466
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,153
sanctions,

1467
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,450
from insulin shipments not
getting there primarily.

1468
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:54,400
Um, um, a lot of other
things, um, medicine wise that
people have not been getting.

1469
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,270
And they are dying. So that
is absurd. You know, we,

1470
01:23:58,271 --> 01:24:01,960
we like to think of sanctions as kind
of like the soft power that just targets

1471
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:04,180
elites of the country.
No, it's an act of war.

1472
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:05,890
And that's exactly
what's happening to Iran.

1473
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:08,830
And Trump's implemented sanctions all
over the world and a really devastating

1474
01:24:08,831 --> 01:24:12,640
way. But, but the corporate media,
we'll say we need to overthrow them.

1475
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:17,590
They're a failed state. They're, you know,
they're a dictatorship. Um, and reality,

1476
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:21,700
no, they're not. They're democracy
and they don't like their politics.

1477
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,490
That's really what it is. We don't
like the fact that their politics,

1478
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:27,400
their politics are that
they nationalize the oil.

1479
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,410
And that's really where it comes from.

1480
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:32,140
This fake ambassador that was
trying to get into the embassy here,

1481
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:33,250
Carlos Vecchio,

1482
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:38,460
he's an ex Exxon lawyer and you see all
of these people who were involved in

1483
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:41,510
Exxon mobile and all of the
oil industries that, um,

1484
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,020
were flourishing in Venezuela
before Chavez got, uh,

1485
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,950
got elected and they just want their
profits back. They want their money back.

1486
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,000
They don't like the fact that Chavez
took the profits from the oil companies.

1487
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:56,530
That's what the, that's what the crux of
the problem is, Joe. Um, and it's amazing.

1488
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,300
It's amazing how transparent it is.

1489
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,720
So ever since these failed coup
attempts over the last decade,

1490
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:05,710
the u s has been foment in regime change
through the civil society organizations,

1491
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:09,340
USA ID offshoots in the country and um,

1492
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:12,370
and basically trying to
foment violent unrest,

1493
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:17,320
violent unrest to the extent that they
burned down streets. There's lynch mobs.

1494
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,100
I mean when I was there during the
height of the violence in 2017,

1495
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:25,020
like 200 people died and the
news just kept saying, Ma,

1496
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,450
like insinuating that Maduro was going
out there with police forces and actually

1497
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:31,300
gunning down people in the streets.
It couldn't be farther from the truth.

1498
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:33,550
We looked at all the deaths,
we broke them all down.

1499
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:35,500
We looked at death records and um,

1500
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:39,340
we found out that the opposition Lynch
mobs were actually responsible for the

1501
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:43,570
overwhelming majority of deaths in
the streets. So that's happening.

1502
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,930
People get lynched for being black.
They get lynched for being Chubbies mode.

1503
01:25:46,931 --> 01:25:49,480
These people are targeting
maternity clinics, hospitals,

1504
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:52,180
basically any enclave
of government services,

1505
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,770
because that's what this is really about.

1506
01:25:53,771 --> 01:25:58,060
It's about of kind of a fascistic bent
of the opposition wanting to take back

1507
01:25:58,061 --> 01:25:59,800
the power from the poor.

1508
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,010
The poor people got power
and they didn't it, and

1509
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,390
that's what the crux of the problem is,

1510
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,130
but when you're looking
at the corporate media,

1511
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:11,000
it's an absurdly cartoonish
brush that's being painted.

1512
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,390
And then if you look at the liberal media
with Maddow and all these other people,

1513
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:18,410
they either don't talk about it or
they say Maduro needs to let the Aden.

1514
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,180
You even saw Bernie and Elizabeth Warren.

1515
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,680
Zane Maduro needs to let the Aden let
the aid in Maduro. The aid was the COO.

1516
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:26,990
The aide was,
was a trick.

1517
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:30,020
They're getting aid every day from
countries that are not trying to actively

1518
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:34,070
overthrow them, but we staged
this big stunt on the border.

1519
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:35,390
I'm of Columbia,
and by the way,

1520
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:39,170
Columbia is actually suffering more than
Venezuela. Columbia is in dire poverty.

1521
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:42,980
There's people getting assassinated
every week who are labor leaders and

1522
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,611
teachers.

1523
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:46,490
I went there and I talked to a teacher
who's living in exile because he's scared

1524
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:49,850
for his fucking life. Um, but
we don't hear about that, right,

1525
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,710
because they're allies
with the US. Um, so it's,

1526
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:58,150
it's cynical stunt to try to get this
humanitarian international outcry to say,

1527
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:01,730
Oh my God, people are
dying. People are hungry.

1528
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,980
It's not a matter of that there's no food.

1529
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:08,150
It's that food is very expensive because
there's an actual economic war being

1530
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:12,050
waged by massive corporations in the
country and just external entities,

1531
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:16,700
whether it be the Trump administration or
us multinationals that are ex fixating,

1532
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:21,230
preventing aid and food from coming in.
And the aid that they're,

1533
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:26,000
they're claiming that they need to accept
is basically a hoax. It's a stunt, um,

1534
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,390
to try to get regime
change to, to happen. Um,

1535
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:33,120
we just saw Richard Branson
stage some ridiculous, um,

1536
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,600
big concert on the border of Colombia.

1537
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:40,790
And they had like what they said were
aid trucks on this big bridge and you had

1538
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,900
CNN on the ground being like, all
right, they need to let the aid.

1539
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,180
And the one that they let the
Aden and the aid was, it was fake.

1540
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:51,080
It was just a truck full of like, I
don't know, like very minuscule things,

1541
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:55,370
but they wanted to try to ram these
trucks through just to get the soldiers up

1542
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:57,680
in arms and to try to get them to defect.
It hasn't worked.

1543
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,400
They've been trying over and over
again to try to get something going.

1544
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:05,930
And basically at the end of the day,
what happened was just a giant money grab.

1545
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,360
It was basically a
money laundering scheme.

1546
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:11,690
You look at these people who are the
opposition leaders now won wide. Oh,

1547
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:16,070
Carlos Vet Geo. They've just
stolen all the money back. Um,

1548
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,680
maybe they realize the coup
wasn't going to go forward,

1549
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:22,250
but they basically ended up stealing
at least $70 million in just putting it

1550
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:25,610
right in these people's bank accounts.
It's pretty shocking. I mean,

1551
01:28:25,611 --> 01:28:26,750
you have international,

1552
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,680
it's an international conspiracy
to try to take the money back from,

1553
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:34,700
from the people whose monies
was, was basically, um,

1554
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,410
administered by Maduro for social
services is nationalizing Theo oil,

1555
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:43,790
nationalizing the oils, the root of it
all. And also just uplifting the poor.

1556
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:44,330
I mean,

1557
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:47,630
poor people got a voice and they never
had a voice in that country their entire

1558
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:51,170
lives. And that country was, you
know, it was a colonial holdover.

1559
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:52,161
And so the bullet,

1560
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:56,200
Varian movements started this pink
tide all across Latin America. And um,

1561
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,150
it was scary. It was a giant
threat to the u s establishment.

1562
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,340
And actually that's why Telesur
was founded. Tell us or the, the,

1563
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,770
the organization that I
used to sell the show too,

1564
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:09,150
it was started as kind of a counter to
this global hegemony in this corporate

1565
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:13,230
narrative trying to overthrow these
democratically elected leaders.

1566
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:18,120
But it's shocking when you see like the
Bank of England seized all of this gold

1567
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:22,620
that was rightfully Maduro's. They
seized it illegally. All of these,

1568
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:26,070
these banks and international bodies
just stole all this money and they just

1569
01:29:26,071 --> 01:29:27,750
gave it to these opposition leaders.

1570
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:31,230
So even though the opposition leaders
weren't able to take, you know,

1571
01:29:31,231 --> 01:29:32,730
take the power back in the country,

1572
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,910
they still have taken all the money
and no one's talking about that.

1573
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:39,990
And everyone just acting like this is
some crazy dictatorship that needs are

1574
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:43,620
saving. How dare you? Who
the fuck do we think we are?

1575
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:48,390
We're uninformed, right? Yeah. Is that
what it is? Yeah. You should check out.

1576
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:50,930
Everyone should check
out our empire files. Um,

1577
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,880
Youtube channel cause we've done
extensive coverage on the ground,

1578
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:58,590
really going into the nuts and bolts
of what the economic crisis really is.

1579
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:02,730
And my partner Mike prisoner did this
epic take down of John Oliver. You know,

1580
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,020
the liberal media is just as bad.

1581
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:09,021
John Oliver did some fucking absurdly
false kind of like analysis of the whole

1582
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,190
Venezuela situation and we just went
through and debunked every single line of

1583
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:16,680
it.
I mean it was extremely disingenuous.

1584
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:21,000
I bet he had someone who wrote all right.
Right.

1585
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:25,710
So I bet he probably has no real
knowledge of it nor could you really,

1586
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,030
unless you extensively studied it the
way you have and especially if you have

1587
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,890
feet on the ground.
Right.

1588
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:37,310
I think that most people just in order
to understand a complex nuanced problem

1589
01:30:37,801 --> 01:30:42,120
like some sort of an
international conflict that
we're involved in that has to

1590
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:44,370
do with nationalizing oil.
Like God damn,

1591
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:48,630
you got to do a lot of work do you do
and if you run in a show like last week

1592
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:50,130
tonight or whatever the
fuck this show's called,

1593
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,980
you have producers doing everything for
you. Yeah, someone else is doing that.

1594
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:53,661
I mean you,

1595
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:57,840
you find that with a lot
of these so called online
experts when you talk to them

1596
01:30:57,841 --> 01:31:02,520
one on one and you get them off the
record without notes like they're just

1597
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:03,090
people.

1598
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,900
Well there's this guy that's un human
rights investigator named Alfred

1599
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,350
[inaudible] that I did this big interview
with and he said he tried to propose

1600
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:13,530
this to the UN saying there is
new no humanitarian crisis there.

1601
01:31:13,531 --> 01:31:17,250
This is all fake. Yes, people
are suffering and dying,

1602
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:21,300
but it's not because of Maduro is
policies and corruptions because of us

1603
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,140
sanctions that have excess,

1604
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:26,760
fixated the economy and prevented any
sort of recovery from taking place.

1605
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,200
And the economy is still in free fall.
They can't work with international bodies.

1606
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:31,531
Again,

1607
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:35,130
we have the threats of sanctions with
institutions that now work with Venezuela.

1608
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,580
So they've been isolated,
they've been isolated from the world.

1609
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,720
So was the idea that they just

1610
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:42,970
put the sanctions in place, allow
this political unrest, take place,

1611
01:31:42,971 --> 01:31:46,570
support the opposition and then just
have a slow burn until it all collapses,

1612
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:51,400
come in and swoop in and fix everything
and make it a part of the United States

1613
01:31:51,401 --> 01:31:52,030
government.
And

1614
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:55,570
then those people will not have
a voice any longer. And um,

1615
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:58,960
another thing that they hate is that
Maduro has given 2 million free homes

1616
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,560
people. That's something that's
completely unheard of to maybe Americans.

1617
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:06,130
But that's one thing that one
why doe said that he would do,

1618
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:10,240
he immediately implemented a new
hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to

1619
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:13,900
implement a new hydrocarbons law, which is
again, you know, reprioritizing the oil.

1620
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:19,060
And also just immediately privatizing all
of the social services that Maduro and

1621
01:32:19,061 --> 01:32:23,980
Chavez did. So it's, it's pretty
shocking what would happen.

1622
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:26,200
Um, and pretty devastating
what would happen if,

1623
01:32:26,201 --> 01:32:30,460
if windows crew did succeed and
the whole Trump administration,

1624
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,460
I mean it's not just Venezuela,
it's Nicaragua and Cuba too.

1625
01:32:33,461 --> 01:32:34,810
I mean we can't go to Cuba anymore.

1626
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:38,020
Yeah. That's a new one, right? Yeah. One
of that happened a couple of weeks ago.

1627
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:41,070
Right. What was the purpose
of what was the rational,

1628
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,070
because socialism is terrifying and we
can't just let this small island nation

1629
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:46,150
just live its life.

1630
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:50,410
We have to create some genocidal blockade
that prevents food and medicine from

1631
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:54,040
getting in there too. But what was
the, the, was there a justification?

1632
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:58,120
Did they say why they were doing this
while are imposing these new laws? No,

1633
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:02,080
it just, John Bolton's bizarre speech
about the troika of tyranny number,

1634
01:33:02,081 --> 01:33:04,620
that number, the axis of
evil. Remember that? Yeah.

1635
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:08,590
But now it's a troika of
Tierney, Nicaragua, Cuban,
Venezuela. And it's like, wait,

1636
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:11,770
I thought that I thought that we
are fighting a war on terrorism.

1637
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,620
We're going off to Nicaragua
too. Yeah. Cause of Ortega. Yeah.

1638
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:17,020
They hate anyone who leans left.

1639
01:33:17,021 --> 01:33:21,500
They want to crush crush.
Mm.

1640
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,710
It's pretty fucking nuts. What's happened
is a weird one, right? The Cuba ones.

1641
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:30,520
Cause what, what has happened over there?
Nothing. There's no, they're not. Yeah.

1642
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,630
Right.

1643
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,190
The only thing they just did was actually
give out free HIV prevention pills and

1644
01:33:36,191 --> 01:33:40,090
they, that's where they
fucked up big Pharma.

1645
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,240
That's really fucked up
and we're not into that.

1646
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,660
Yeah, no, it's the Venice
where the thing's a mess.

1647
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:48,900
It's so difficult because it's
so nuanced. But that's, you know,

1648
01:33:48,901 --> 01:33:52,440
I encourage everyone to maybe check out
Venezuela analysis and empire files and

1649
01:33:52,441 --> 01:33:54,990
tell us or if they want to
learn more about that situation.

1650
01:33:55,210 --> 01:34:00,210
Have you encountered any demonetization
of your channel from discussing these

1651
01:34:00,221 --> 01:34:01,120
complex issues?

1652
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:05,420
Yes, we have. Um, so we actually
stopped monetizing altogether.

1653
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,750
So we are added free. But we would,
we would have been demonetized I'm,

1654
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,840
I'm absolutely sure.

1655
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:15,190
And we also are slapped with age
restrictions and sensitive content bans on

1656
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:18,310
almost every single video that we put up,
whether it be Israel,

1657
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:19,360
Palestine or Venice.

1658
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:20,940
Really.

1659
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:25,940
And then what would cause you to get an
age restriction or a sensitive content

1660
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:26,671
bent?

1661
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:31,140
Like is there anything that is like a
fairly innocuous video that you guys have

1662
01:34:31,141 --> 01:34:33,210
put out that I was also gotten a clue?
Absolutely.

1663
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:36,930
Like Mike [inaudible] video about John
Oliver was just literally taking clips

1664
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:39,930
from John Oliver and then critiquing
them and they said that was sensitive

1665
01:34:39,931 --> 01:34:43,290
content van. It's like, well what do you
mean? Why is that sensitive content band?

1666
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:44,130
Um,

1667
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:47,610
but I think it has to do with an issue
because you're criticizing an HBO show.

1668
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:50,030
Uh, no, no, because
it's happened with some,

1669
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,960
with almost every single
one of our videos.

1670
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:55,110
And so you have to make sure that you're
logged in, that you prove your age.

1671
01:34:55,111 --> 01:34:58,310
Just all these different
steps and gatekeeping

1672
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:01,580
methods to prevent people from,
from getting access to our channel.

1673
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:04,910
And another crazy thing about it is
if you just search like empire files,

1674
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:09,170
Venezuela, like it will take you a really
long time to actually find our work.

1675
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:13,580
Even if you type in the channel name Abby
Martin and, and these subjects, it's,

1676
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,930
it's really difficult to find.

1677
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:18,290
And they've made that difficult to
find on purpose. I have no doubt.

1678
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:23,150
What's also weird, like how they
determine what is trending. Right.

1679
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:27,470
You know, cause it's not real. Right,
right. Trending. Right. Really?

1680
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:31,250
What is trending like? Uh, Alex
Jones freaked out. I was like,

1681
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,070
they're their key cause of video.
You've got millions and millions of hits.

1682
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:36,590
Like they're, they're censoring
us from trending. I'm like, dude,

1683
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:41,420
I got news for you. I've never trended
ever. Really zero. You know, that's fake.

1684
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:45,240
That's where it's fair. Yeah. Right.
Zero times a channel of dummies.

1685
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:49,070
But shouldn't they be building your
channel up? No. Some people like it,

1686
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:53,630
some people over there like it.
I think it's too fucked up.

1687
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:58,370
You know, I think there's like, they don't
know what I'm doing. Like there's not,

1688
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:02,720
it's not, you can't put it in a
clear box and there's too much,

1689
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,430
too many comedians on and there's too
much weed and people get drunk and they,

1690
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:10,910
you know,
they talk crazy shit and it's uncensored.

1691
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:16,130
I just think I don't, it's a
very complex thing. This sort of,

1692
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:19,130
but you know, it's
happening. There's, you know,

1693
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:22,970
someone has made a choice
to never have it trend.

1694
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:26,840
It's trended zero times how
many views we had total.

1695
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,540
You're talking about that
one report the guy did.

1696
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,310
That's in earlier times we have trended
but it's been like a very few amount of

1697
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:35,930
times,
like over five years.

1698
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,530
That report was like over a
one year period he'd but we
haven't trended in years.

1699
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:43,160
The main channel as our clips
channel pops up there every so often.

1700
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:47,210
Let's channel this. Yeah, it's
a weird slip. I wouldn't know.

1701
01:36:47,211 --> 01:36:48,710
It's hard to now trending page.

1702
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:53,210
You have only the only one that's up
now is our pages in a good gauge to mark

1703
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:54,140
stuff I don't like.

1704
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:57,920
Well it's not like this is the news of
the day kind of page does help people

1705
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:01,390
like see people that are
trendy seemed to look at.

1706
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:04,800
I know that he's your friend to Peter
Joseph who's been on this show before his,

1707
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:08,690
you know zeitgeists and the Zike guys
trilogy was like one of the most popular

1708
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:12,090
videos online and that was
totally fucking censored. Yeah.

1709
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:14,990
100% well can barely find that anymore.

1710
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:19,460
This is the issue that people have with
Facebook and Google in any of these

1711
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:24,461
gigantic online corporations that are
deciding what is and isn't popular and,

1712
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:26,050
and,

1713
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:30,740
and using algorithms to
steer people in directions.

1714
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:31,701
You know,

1715
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:35,420
one of the more fascinating discussions
that's happened over the past few years

1716
01:37:35,421 --> 01:37:38,540
is this understanding
that there are algorithms,

1717
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:41,120
favor people arguing about things.

1718
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:45,440
Like if you want to have a subject
like say abortion and you put up a, uh,

1719
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:48,860
you know,
if you're a pro choice or pro life person,

1720
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:53,730
you're going to get steered towards things
you disagree with so that you didn't,

1721
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:56,130
you'd engage with them more
because that's where the money

1722
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:00,840
is. The money is in you being upset
and engaging. And that's where people,

1723
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:03,690
that's where people really get into it.
So the more you engage,

1724
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:08,160
the more profitable it is for our Facebook
and the more they encourage that type

1725
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:11,990
of behavior. So they're, their algorithm
actually encouraged, pisses you,

1726
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:16,470
encourages pissing you off and wants you
to stay on youtube and just go down the

1727
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:20,730
rabbit hole, particularly um, Facebook.

1728
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:24,570
But with youtube, that was one of
the weird New York Times piece,

1729
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:29,571
the radicalization of some soft minded
child who got online and was turned into

1730
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:34,890
a right winger and then was subsequently
turned into a left winger by another,

1731
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:37,680
another video. And they're like,
finally he was saved. Like,

1732
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:39,690
are you sure I didn't read it?
Yeah,

1733
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,800
it's just nonsense because it sort of
connected a lot of people that aren't even

1734
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:48,210
right wing, including me with the
radicalization of this young man.

1735
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:53,510
And they did link some websites that or
some youtube channels that are right.

1736
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:57,240
You know,
that are right leaning and even far right.

1737
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:02,280
But they also threw in a bunch of
other ones that like Philly d right,

1738
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,850
who's not right wing at all. Me and a few
other folks. Well that's the algorithm.

1739
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,880
The algorithm just takes
you down, down, down. Yeah.

1740
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:12,270
But they were New York Times article was
suggesting that we all were right wing

1741
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:15,420
cause it was a sloppy article.
Just wasn't resident really well done.

1742
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,790
But what's interesting is the conclusion,

1743
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:21,780
ultimately he was saved by
this by their algorithm.

1744
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,140
Their algorithm led him,

1745
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,330
led him to an opposition
of that left wing person.

1746
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:35,040
Youtube employee wrote it or assumption
that idea that this is the thing that

1747
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:38,010
drives me crazy. Save you
believe something, right,

1748
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,840
and then if you go online and you read
something else and that something else is

1749
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:45,750
contrary to what you believe and you
start believing in that something else

1750
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:48,180
somehow or another,
that's bad.

1751
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:54,270
This is one of the great arguments against
censorship is like you have to figure

1752
01:39:54,271 --> 01:39:56,190
out what the fuck makes sense.

1753
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:59,850
The only way to figure out what makes
sense is to read all kinds of things,

1754
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:02,970
to engage with all kinds of content.

1755
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,020
The idea that we're supposed to protect
people because we know what's right.

1756
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:11,820
We know it's correct. Well, who are
you? Let me, let me talk to you.

1757
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,320
If you think you know what's correct,

1758
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:15,890
you're the arbiter of free
speech are the arbitrator of of,

1759
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:19,230
of logical discourse and and
and common sense in this world.

1760
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:22,080
Let me ask you things.
Let me talk to you.

1761
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:23,820
Let me get to the heart of how you feel.

1762
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:27,390
How do you feel about trans kids
transitioning when they're six?

1763
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:32,340
How do you feel about all sorts of
crazy weird things that have just been

1764
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:36,840
propped up as logical and makes sense?
How do you, how do you feel about war?

1765
01:40:36,841 --> 01:40:41,270
How do you feel about abortion? How do
you feel about ghosts? How old are you?

1766
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:42,990
Who are you and you just,

1767
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:48,200
you just get to choose whether or not
someone lean or information that comes to

1768
01:40:48,361 --> 01:40:51,000
them leans left or right.
I think it's preposterous.

1769
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:56,260
I just think it's incredibly dangerous
because you have to have an unbelievably

1770
01:40:56,261 --> 01:41:01,261
complex and nuanced perspective in order
to be able to dictate what makes or

1771
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,880
does not make sense and you,

1772
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:09,070
you have to have a lot of information at
your disposal. You have to have a lot.

1773
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:12,670
If you're talking about
something like Venezuela, let's
look at that, for example,

1774
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:17,770
to look at what you know and then look
what you see in what you would call

1775
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,320
progressive,
left wing media.

1776
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:25,270
That to your knowledge is incorrect
and it's basically propaganda points.

1777
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:28,870
It's being read distributed
in this way that is palatable.

1778
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:32,800
Now imagine if the people decide that you,

1779
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:36,670
Abby Martin or somehow or another part
of some right wing conspiracy now and

1780
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:36,891
they,

1781
01:41:36,891 --> 01:41:40,780
they're going to censor your voice and
sense of Europe because it doesn't fit in

1782
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,240
to this narrative that there,

1783
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:47,550
because you need so much information
to be able to really understand what's

1784
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:52,240
happening in this one part of south
South America. The word right. Exactly.

1785
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,880
It's so complex. Well, they
treat us like children.

1786
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,630
Um, and they think that we're not smart
enough to actually discern what is

1787
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:04,100
information that we need. And I
mean, I want the Russian perspective.

1788
01:42:04,101 --> 01:42:05,510
I want the Venezuelan perspective.

1789
01:42:05,511 --> 01:42:08,660
I want the Chinese perspective because
I feel like we're smart enough to really

1790
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:12,260
determine our own reality based
on all the available information.

1791
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,430
Well,
this is where we're fucked,

1792
01:42:13,431 --> 01:42:18,431
is that we don't have a reliable
independent source that's not filled with

1793
01:42:19,281 --> 01:42:22,280
hyperbole and emotion and,
and,

1794
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:25,580
and dunking on people and
screaming and insulting.

1795
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:31,120
And I want someone who can break things
down logically and clearly with no

1796
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:36,700
ideological bend. They, you're not leaning
left. You're not leaning right. What,

1797
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,990
where is that and why?
Why doesn't that exist?

1798
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:43,120
Because it's not necessarily
human. And, and you know,

1799
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:47,030
people have opinions and they have biases
and either they couch those biases in

1800
01:42:47,031 --> 01:42:50,050
like these think tanks and pretend like
they're these unbiased journalists or

1801
01:42:50,051 --> 01:42:53,490
are they just kind of wear it
on their sleeve? Like I do, um,

1802
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:56,200
with empire files and media
roots, which is my, you know,

1803
01:42:56,201 --> 01:43:00,340
my news organization that I do
with my brother Robbie, but I mean,

1804
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:03,280
we try to lay it out, but we also
don't hide where we're coming from.

1805
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:05,320
I almost appreciate that more than,

1806
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:08,080
than a lot of these journalists so
called journalists who are really kind of

1807
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:11,380
stenographers who pretend like
they are unbiased and they're like,

1808
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:14,270
I'm just giving it to you straight.
And at the end of the day, they're,

1809
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:15,190
they're really not,

1810
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:18,970
they're trying to tow a line and they're
trying to push a certain perspective,

1811
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:20,650
but it's just not obvious.
Yeah.

1812
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:23,143
It's just,

1813
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:28,150
we live in such a strange time
where we are overwhelmed with data.

1814
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:33,050
I mean, right. Overwhelmed. Do
you, you cannot get away from it.

1815
01:43:33,051 --> 01:43:38,000
And there's no way, there's not a fucking
human alive that understands all of it.

1816
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:40,880
It is impossible.
It really is impossible.

1817
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,360
And it's so hard to find
out what is true and what,

1818
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,743
what is bullshit,

1819
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:51,410
right? Oh my God. What you posted
about how you can now change people's,

1820
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,780
like you can make a picture
talk. Yes. Oh, that crazy

1821
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,050
way. Mona Lisa of a wave of
lies. I know. I was like, oh,

1822
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:01,630
that's what the Monalisa looked like.
Cool.

1823
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,530
[inaudible] it's unbelievable.

1824
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,180
I like to do coke planes even though they
like you could have the Mona Lisa say

1825
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:13,620
anything really disturbing

1826
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:18,600
what we're in for. What, like what's
coming? Buckle up. Buckle up. Yeah.

1827
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,430
Right. Imagine the fourth, fifth,

1828
01:44:20,431 --> 01:44:24,300
and sixth generation of this technology
beyond lies by government, you know?

1829
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:28,050
Oh my God. And then being utilized
by someone to sort of, I mean,

1830
01:44:28,051 --> 01:44:32,100
you could easily justify assassinations
if you can prove that someone's saying

1831
01:44:32,101 --> 01:44:33,450
something fucked up,
you killed them,

1832
01:44:33,451 --> 01:44:36,930
and then you release a tape of them
saying something fucked up. Totally.

1833
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:39,870
That this person was trying to overthrow
the government. Yeah, sure. For sure.

1834
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,480
For sure. Oh my God. Just
a drone strike anyone.

1835
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:47,520
What I'm hoping is that if you look
at what this technology is doing with

1836
01:44:47,521 --> 01:44:51,000
technology in general is doing
particularly like information technology,

1837
01:44:51,001 --> 01:44:51,810
Internet,

1838
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:56,810
cellular phones and smartphones and all
these devices and then all the various

1839
01:44:57,151 --> 01:44:58,680
new incarnation that are coming out.

1840
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:04,160
What they seem to be doing is they
seem to be creating portals for which

1841
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:12,240
information is more quickly accessed.
It's more and more transparent,

1842
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:15,000
like ideas are getting to people quicker.
There's less.

1843
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:18,240
And I think this is one of the things
that these companies like Google and

1844
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,330
Facebook and Twitter and also that
they're trying to like figure out a way to

1845
01:45:21,331 --> 01:45:23,640
manage this like,
well this is just too crazy.

1846
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:27,030
We have to figure out how to manage
information and get it right people,

1847
01:45:27,031 --> 01:45:30,360
things that they want to say.
But I think ultimately it's going to fail.

1848
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,760
And I think ultimately as technology,

1849
01:45:32,761 --> 01:45:34,770
as all these innovations
keep coming down the pipe,

1850
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:39,771
we're going to get closer and closer
to this time where everyone has an

1851
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:43,110
instantaneous and equal
access to information.

1852
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:46,080
And I think that when that time does come,

1853
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:48,720
lying will be virtually impossible.

1854
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:51,230
I really do believe that
because I think we're,

1855
01:45:51,231 --> 01:45:56,231
we're probably a decade away from
implementing some sort of a device or an

1856
01:45:57,541 --> 01:46:02,070
ability to read minds or, wow, I
believe that that's kind of terrifying.

1857
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:05,730
I think they're going to develop some
sort of technology that allows us to link

1858
01:46:05,731 --> 01:46:09,870
up together and through some,
some sort of,

1859
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,820
some new way of communicating that we did.

1860
01:46:14,821 --> 01:46:18,540
We don't foresee now, but if you just look
at this trend, like what is the trend?

1861
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:21,390
That trend was, oh, you go to
the library and get a book.

1862
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,910
Well now you can get a book online.
Well now you get a book on your phone.

1863
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:26,790
Well now you could have that book
read to you on your phone. And now,

1864
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:31,010
I mean it's all this now, the Australian
accent, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1865
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:34,560
It keeps getting closer and closer to
you. And I think there's going, I mean,

1866
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:37,110
when Elan Musk,
he's been very vague about it.

1867
01:46:37,111 --> 01:46:38,310
He won't really discuss what he's doing,

1868
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:42,210
but there's neuro link thing that
he's doing that he thinks is going to

1869
01:46:42,211 --> 01:46:45,540
radically increase bandwidth between
human beings and information.

1870
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,270
And he thinks it's going to
literally change humanity. Wow.

1871
01:46:48,271 --> 01:46:51,360
What the fuck that means? But if
he's working on something like that,

1872
01:46:51,361 --> 01:46:52,530
he's not the only one.

1873
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,740
And if you're wearing some sort of
a device that allows you to access

1874
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:58,290
information that this radical paid what,

1875
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:01,380
what the next step would be was to,

1876
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:06,440
is to make it so that you can tap into
some sort of a universal language.

1877
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:12,260
And this universal language would not
be dependent upon the various languages

1878
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:15,090
that we use were Spanish or
Chinese or whatever it is,

1879
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:19,740
but some sort of a new language
that kids learn in a new language.

1880
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:24,830
It's a universal language
that's distributed through
online platforms and have

1881
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:29,400
this all go straight to
your fucking brain. Wow.

1882
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:33,630
It's going to happen. We're,
we're becoming cyborgs and
some sort of a weird way.

1883
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,980
And that's the other
thing that Ellen said,

1884
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,380
we're already sideboard were just carried
around with us and that's what your

1885
01:47:37,381 --> 01:47:40,080
phone is, right? We're so
dependent upon these devices.

1886
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:45,650
It just seems to make sense
that the general direction
that all this is going is

1887
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:48,870
to becoming more and more invasive.
And more and more inclusive,

1888
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,180
more and more invasive in terms of it's,

1889
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:56,190
it's the way it's sort of ingrained in
your body and becomes a part of your

1890
01:47:56,851 --> 01:47:57,620
life.

1891
01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:02,620
Put becomes more and more a part of
everyone's life and then more inclusive in

1892
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:09,881
terms of more access to this information
and more access to thoughts and I just

1893
01:48:10,881 --> 01:48:15,410
think we're, we're just a few years
away from someone making a breakthrough.

1894
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:16,893
Wow.

1895
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,630
I think in some ways it's probably oh
Joe and says he's going to do this.

1896
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:22,460
If I showed you this before,

1897
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:26,270
this thing is called alter ego where he
can talk to it without moving as a mouth

1898
01:48:26,271 --> 01:48:30,320
and it communicates with a computer.
This is a, this is over a year old,

1899
01:48:30,321 --> 01:48:33,230
so I don't know what the developments
they've made sense then. Yeah.

1900
01:48:33,231 --> 01:48:36,290
I sent this to Ilan and he says,
it's just a trick. You said,

1901
01:48:36,291 --> 01:48:39,740
this is basically like a trick. He said,
yeah, this has given you information.

1902
01:48:39,741 --> 01:48:43,160
You don't need to talk to it. But he said,
well, he's doing is far more complex.

1903
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,200
And then I asked him questions
and he went radio silent on me.

1904
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,210
I'm just going this, this has gotta be
the first step for that. Look at that guy.

1905
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:52,700
Looks like a Dork wearing that
thing that my two scientist,

1906
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:55,730
he probably figured out
himself. Yeah, probably.

1907
01:48:55,731 --> 01:48:57,440
But that looks like
some iron man type shit.

1908
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:00,800
He's going to wear a football helmet that
does that. And if I just go one step,

1909
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:02,840
this is like, then the next thing
they get is on a Bluetooth thing.

1910
01:49:02,841 --> 01:49:05,570
Just touched your ear
that like everybody's been
already been walking around

1911
01:49:05,571 --> 01:49:06,890
with for the last 25 years.

1912
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:10,280
So he's essentially
essentially calculating his
groceries as he walks around.

1913
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:13,640
Yeah, he's just, this is just
probably the connected to his phone.

1914
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,050
I was just sort of showing you this,

1915
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:18,680
this is already may be available and
like they're showing this as proof of

1916
01:49:18,681 --> 01:49:20,660
concept.
Go back this up cause it was,

1917
01:49:20,661 --> 01:49:22,970
let's read the narration because
it just said something there.

1918
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:28,100
So without it right there without any
voice or just go back to witness. Okay.

1919
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:28,993
Really right there

1920
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,140
without any voice or
discernible movements,

1921
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:33,750
enabling the user to communicate
with devices. Just let it play.

1922
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:38,203
Um,

1923
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:43,400
AI assistance applications or other
people in a silent and it's too fast.

1924
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,980
Yeah. So bad video wrote. Yeah. How will
the fucking read that fast? I'm reading

1925
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,670
it pretty good. That very simply by
vocalizing their eternally subutex

1926
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:56,800
faster than me.
That's insane.

1927
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,900
You'd be wearing one of these
devices to tell your brain.

1928
01:49:58,910 --> 01:50:01,700
They're trying to tell you you're stupid.
You're stupid. Do you need this please?

1929
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:05,390
Can I play? We have a little trailer for
the film. Could I play it real quick?

1930
01:50:05,391 --> 01:50:10,190
Short, where's the checkout empire
files and it's the most recent thing.

1931
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:15,920
How long have you guys been a independent,
like ad free? Basically a year.

1932
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:19,730
Um, since I came on, I, right
after I came on last year, um,

1933
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,420
the sanction shutdown our show and so we
had to do this giant fundraiser and it

1934
01:50:23,421 --> 01:50:28,340
was just absolutely, um, very
difficult to do that. Here it is. Yep.

1935
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:29,750
Okay.
Let's check it out.

1936
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:33,620
Empire files, Gaza fights
for freedom. And this is,

1937
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:38,920
this is the little trailer for a film
that just came out. [inaudible] what does

1938
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:44,240
[inaudible] our oldest daughter, she
was my first choice and she was killed.

1939
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:47,910
She's a medic.
You want to read this first?

1940
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,880
I'm female to field volunteer girl.

1941
01:50:49,881 --> 01:50:54,710
She was the first to go to the margin
camp mints and everyone participated.

1942
01:50:54,711 --> 01:50:58,760
I participated, the whole family did.
My husband, my children, my neighbors,

1943
01:50:58,761 --> 01:51:02,110
my siblings did too.
All Palestinians participated.

1944
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:06,470
It was up there are marches peacefully

1945
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,500
if we do not carry weapons.
And we showed there with her big chests.

1946
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:19,420
We stand before a huge force of
afford to fight army with tanks.

1947
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,440
Gus and war planes
or marches,

1948
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:27,250
peaceful reasked for our rights.
I have the right to have a country.

1949
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,600
I have the right to have a home.

1950
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:33,690
How all those refugees have the
right to return to their homes.

1951
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:43,040
Yeah. During this protest, is
this when these people were shot?

1952
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:45,200
What we're seeing here?
Yeah.

1953
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:49,050
So it's a lot of people who are getting
carried out clean little kids. Yeah.

1954
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:53,600
And they're shooting at them. And
this is um, isn't it time yet?

1955
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:57,140
She says, everyone around the world is
sitting there watching us and they're all

1956
01:51:57,141 --> 01:52:00,680
comfortable with our lives. Here we are
under siege. We have no borders, no life.

1957
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:02,030
Where are we supposed to go?

1958
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:08,390
So this is coming out in a couple of
weeks. We're, we're fine tuning it.

1959
01:52:08,391 --> 01:52:11,780
But we just had a big theatrical
release in downtown and it was, uh,

1960
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:17,150
it was really cool. That's where you saw
the Oliver Stone yesterday or, but yeah,

1961
01:52:17,151 --> 01:52:21,200
it's, it's, it's sick. I mean, you texted
me that video of the kid, you know,

1962
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:23,150
another medic was just shot.
So

1963
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,160
yeah, there was something
crazy Balaam, Mohammad,

1964
01:52:26,161 --> 01:52:28,870
who's one of the UFC fighters
had on his Instagram.

1965
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:31,250
And I texted you that it's,

1966
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:37,340
it's, so again, this is another thing,

1967
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,860
it's so difficult to understand
what's actually going on.

1968
01:52:39,861 --> 01:52:43,430
There's so many pro Israel people that
put their head in the sand and don't want

1969
01:52:43,431 --> 01:52:46,970
to look at some of these atrocities and
don't want to look at some of the videos

1970
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:50,990
that you sent me of soldiers shooting
at people that are not doing anything.

1971
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,030
Right.

1972
01:52:52,030 --> 01:52:53,290
I mean, yeah, I mean,

1973
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:57,880
their whole argument is that it's all
Hammas and their human shields. I mean,

1974
01:52:57,881 --> 01:53:01,870
we looked through hundreds of hours of
footage that these people gave us and

1975
01:53:01,871 --> 01:53:06,180
it's mind blowing footage. It looks
absolutely cinematic and epic. Um,

1976
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:11,140
but the footage is heroin and I didn't
see one weapon. I didn't see one militant,

1977
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:15,910
not one weapon. It was literally people
with slingshots throwing rocks at tanks.

1978
01:53:15,911 --> 01:53:18,040
It's kind of a rite of passage.
It's very symbolic.

1979
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:21,820
They're not trying to hurt anyone. No
Israeli soldiers had been hurt or killed.

1980
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:25,760
Um, you know, during 2018, which
is what the film looks at is,

1981
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:29,560
is through 2018 of the great march of
return and there's not any weapons.

1982
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:33,820
There is no militants. Hamas has nothing
to do with these, with the march.

1983
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:36,430
And um,
it just shocking.

1984
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:41,290
I mean it's shocking how many war crimes
were committed on camera and it's just

1985
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:43,540
amazing the propaganda.
Um,

1986
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:48,400
that's just told to us about what this
is and why they have the right to kill

1987
01:53:48,401 --> 01:53:50,470
people that pose no threat to them.

1988
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,200
When you were on last time
when you talked about this,

1989
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:57,970
one of my email accounts was flooded
with literally a chain letter,

1990
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:03,300
the same letter like denouncing you
and your lies and your anti semetic

1991
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:08,830
perspective and your anti
Israelis perspective.

1992
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:13,450
It was, it was weird because
it was the same email,

1993
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:17,180
astro turf guy was fake. Yeah. You
know, that's a campaign, you know,

1994
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:21,320
that that has a lot of money behind it.
Yeah. There's a lot of money behind that.

1995
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:23,510
I mean the film is mindblowing.

1996
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,890
Go to Gaza fights for freedom.com if
you want to check it out when it rains,

1997
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:30,560
when it gets released. And it's just
a really on in controvertible Joe.

1998
01:54:30,561 --> 01:54:32,120
I mean they're,
you know,

1999
01:54:32,121 --> 01:54:35,600
even if it were a war between armies,

2000
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:39,860
all of these things that Israel has done
are still documented war crimes in very

2001
01:54:39,861 --> 01:54:41,810
grievous violations of international law.

2002
01:54:41,811 --> 01:54:46,220
And we're talking about direct targeting
and assassinations by Israeli snipers

2003
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,850
of disabled people have children,
medexpress and medics.

2004
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:54,560
And that's what, who resigned was,
she was a medic. And as you mentioned,

2005
01:54:54,561 --> 01:54:57,710
another medic just passed
away. Um, was killed rather.

2006
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:01,520
I hate to use the passive voice because
you always hear Palestinians died. No,

2007
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:02,360
they were murdered.

2008
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:06,230
They're all being murdered by snipers
and they pose no threat to them.

2009
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:07,640
And so the film looks at this,

2010
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:12,641
you went investigation basically during
the march in 2018 and documents all of

2011
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:17,030
the grievous, um, crimes and atrocities
conducted by the Israeli military.

2012
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:18,800
And I mean,
you know,

2013
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:23,630
Palestine is a right to defend itself
and this isn't even what that is. Um,

2014
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:28,160
but if you look at the UN Charter
of 1978, they say that, you know,

2015
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:33,670
occupied people's and besieged peoples
have the right actually for armed self

2016
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:37,130
defense. And the fact that
this is not even what that is,

2017
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:41,150
that there's literally people going out
there and peace with their bare chests

2018
01:55:41,151 --> 01:55:45,930
holding flags and they're getting killed
in sniped. There's so many amputations.

2019
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:50,040
I mean, just in 2018 alone, there
was 35 kids who were killed.

2020
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:55,920
900 shot Jesus. Yeah. That's
children. And, and you know,

2021
01:55:55,921 --> 01:55:57,240
some of these stories or heroin,

2022
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:01,680
a kid hiding behind a trash can who was
sniped a kid who went up to the fence

2023
01:56:01,681 --> 01:56:05,130
and just put a Palestinian flag and she
was shot in the head and died instantly.

2024
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:08,310
It just, it goes on and on
and on. And so, you know,

2025
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,580
we're just trying to document this
to really kind of push the needle for

2026
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:16,050
accountability because these laws have
been agreed upon by the international

2027
01:56:16,051 --> 01:56:16,501
community,

2028
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:21,210
some of them a hundred years ago and to
have kind of a rogue state acting with

2029
01:56:21,211 --> 01:56:22,230
complete impunity,

2030
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:25,500
knowing that it has total protection from
the u s empire and given more freedom

2031
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:29,940
than ever under Trump with this goal on
a heights thing and the moving of the

2032
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:33,660
Jerusalem embassy or the moving of the
embassy to Jerusalem. I mean it's just,

2033
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:37,980
it's a bismal and it needs to
be stopped and um, you know,

2034
01:56:37,981 --> 01:56:41,040
they can't control the narrative any
longer because we're seeing this with our

2035
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:45,000
own eyes and that's what this film
does is really lays it all out.

2036
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:45,531
Abby,

2037
01:56:45,531 --> 01:56:50,290
you concentrate and focus on so many
different fucked up parts of the world,

2038
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:54,200
but you, so you're very
friendly and upbeat. Like see,

2039
01:56:54,201 --> 01:56:58,550
like you're laughing at this.
How do you manage to maintain your sanity?

2040
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:03,770
Cause I, I I have a hard time if I
just watch one of your pieces, right?

2041
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:06,980
I watched one of your clips and I just go,
what the fuck?

2042
01:57:06,981 --> 01:57:10,610
I'm just want to cry and I don't know
what to do and I want to hug my kids.

2043
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:12,560
But you're in this,

2044
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:17,150
you're in the trenches every day and
you go to these places all the time.

2045
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:18,770
How do you,
how do you do it?

2046
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:23,340
Well, I think that, well first
of all, I, I go and camp a lot.

2047
01:57:23,341 --> 01:57:26,580
I get into nature a lot, which is also
kind of depressing knowing that, you know,

2048
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,990
climate change and blah,
blah blah.

2049
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:32,340
But I try to get out and see the beauty
of the world and understand my privilege,

2050
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:35,370
especially as an American
citizen because I don't have,

2051
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:41,420
we can't afford to not be aware and
we can't afford to not be educated and

2052
01:57:41,551 --> 01:57:42,570
talking about these issues,

2053
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:45,840
especially when our government is
subsidizing this around the world.

2054
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:49,980
$10 million every day with our tax
dollars, you know, I mean this is,

2055
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:54,981
this is going on and it's so close to
home and we have to acknowledge our

2056
01:57:55,261 --> 01:57:59,700
privilege and acknowledge the situation,
which is we have agency,

2057
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:04,760
we have agency to lobby our government
to change this and to stop these criminal

2058
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:07,043
acts.

2059
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:13,470
But do you ever feel that it's almost
like you're absorbing too much because you

2060
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:16,220
are looking at all the
problems of all the people,

2061
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:21,270
seven plus billion around the world and
all these different horrific injustices.

2062
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:25,330
I try to focus on what I
can do and what I can do is,

2063
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:28,360
is challenge my own
government and you know,

2064
01:58:28,361 --> 01:58:31,270
as an American citizen
living in this society,

2065
01:58:31,271 --> 01:58:36,010
I think that the US empire in the Pentagon
is the source of a lot of problems

2066
01:58:36,011 --> 01:58:39,460
around the world.
I look at the world as complex.

2067
01:58:39,461 --> 01:58:42,130
I mean you have to understand the
issues are going on, especially

2068
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,570
with foreign policy in terms of
the colonized and colonizers,

2069
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:48,630
the oppressed and oppressors and the US,

2070
01:58:48,890 --> 01:58:52,840
his role as well as other previous
empires role in shaping the world as it is

2071
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:57,820
today. And a lot of the problems that have
arisen are because directly us foreign

2072
01:58:57,821 --> 01:59:00,400
policy,
whether it be the global war on terrorism,

2073
01:59:00,401 --> 01:59:02,830
whether it be terrorism in
general, I mean that, you know,

2074
01:59:02,831 --> 01:59:06,760
drone strikes basically caused terrorism,
whether it be the environmental crises,

2075
01:59:06,761 --> 01:59:09,040
the Pentagon is actually the
largest polluter in the world,

2076
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:13,180
more than 140 countries.
That's essentially every
country in the world almost,

2077
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:18,070
um, a bigger polluter than the top
four chemical companies combined.

2078
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,640
So it all kind of stems back
from this notion that, you know,

2079
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,390
the u s is the world's largest empire
that's ever existed and it needs to be

2080
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:30,190
stopped to save humanity.
And so as an American citizen,

2081
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:34,690
I look at all of the problems
that I understand that
there is like a very common

2082
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:37,450
route and I can do something
about this common root.

2083
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:40,370
And if you're looking at domestic
problems, the lack of healthcare,

2084
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:45,370
the lack of education, I mean,
Martin Luther King called
it decades ago. He says,

2085
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,270
uh, you know, a mill,

2086
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:51,040
a nation that spends more and more on
military spending is facing social death.

2087
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:55,000
I probably butchered his quote, but
that's essentially the spiritual death.

2088
01:59:55,001 --> 01:59:55,900
I think he is what he said.

2089
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:59,230
But I mean that's exactly what's happening
is when we're squandering all of our

2090
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:01,630
money,
bolstering up this huge global empire,

2091
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:05,290
we're not taking care of our people at
home are brothers and sisters at home.

2092
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:10,210
My empathy extends as an internationalist
all around the world. I, I, you know,

2093
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:14,050
I feel for my brothers and sisters
in Palestine, Yemen, everywhere.

2094
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:19,340
But I can only do what I can do based
on what my government is doing and,

2095
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,740
and you know,
it's doing a lot.

2096
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:25,120
It's doing a lot of horrible things and
it's time for us to really acknowledge

2097
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:29,680
what those horrible things are because
we need to reinvigorate an antiwar

2098
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:30,700
movement in this country.

2099
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:34,960
And when you're saying that
drone strikes create terrorism,

2100
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:38,080
what you're really saying
is that, well, what people,

2101
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:43,170
if they don't understand drone
strikes primarily kill civilians,

2102
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:45,310
right? 98% yeah. It's a,

2103
02:00:45,311 --> 02:00:49,210
it's a really crazy number
and it's this very strange,

2104
02:00:49,211 --> 02:00:54,211
sanitized way of handling an issue where
if you had a person and you had some

2105
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:58,390
Rambo character, you send
them overseas, you said, hey,

2106
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:03,250
I want you to go get this isis terrorist.
And uh, in the process, kill everybody.

2107
02:01:03,251 --> 02:01:05,950
The fuck that you see everybody
that's in front of them,

2108
02:01:05,951 --> 02:01:09,790
that person would be a war criminal.
All right? If you had a guy,

2109
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:12,790
and he knew that some isis guy was in a,
an apartment building,

2110
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:16,480
so he just started gunning down men,
women,

2111
02:01:16,481 --> 02:01:19,450
and children in that apartment
building until he got to the terrorist,

2112
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,950
that guy would go to jail.

2113
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:25,420
But if you do it with a remote control
and you launch how fire missiles out of a

2114
02:01:25,421 --> 02:01:28,750
drone and it blows up the
apartment building and kills
all these innocent people,

2115
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:33,040
but also gets the terrorist, it's
mission accomplished. And it's crazy.

2116
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:37,270
It's crazy that we're signing off on
that, right? And what gives us the right,

2117
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:40,430
it's to kill people. It's, it's a thing

2118
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:45,500
because we're not there. Where there's
this weird sort of, uh, uh, just, uh,

2119
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:51,160
there's a bridge that we're allowed to
cross into this really sickening act.

2120
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:52,940
It's a very,

2121
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:57,940
when you have anything that's ineffective
to the point where most of the people,

2122
02:01:58,011 --> 02:02:01,850
it kills our good people, or at
least are innocent people should say.

2123
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:05,870
That's crazy. I mean, this is not
saying that there's not terrorism.

2124
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:09,260
It's not saying there's not horrible
people in Iceland is absolutely right.

2125
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,630
The it, look, I'm a pro military person.

2126
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:16,130
I think we need military and I think
just like the same I need, we need cops.

2127
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:20,900
But to deny that cops sometimes
are bad is fucking crazy.

2128
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,220
To not deny that.

2129
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:27,221
Sometimes when you allow the military
industrial complex to do things like have

2130
02:02:27,261 --> 02:02:31,670
drones that launch missiles into wedding
parties because you think one of the

2131
02:02:31,671 --> 02:02:34,670
people might be a terrorist
and are often incorrect,

2132
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,410
often to the tune of 90 plus percent.
Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. And you look at,

2133
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,120
you know,
the last 10 years,

2134
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:44,840
you look at some of these terrorists
who have conducted terrorist acts.

2135
02:02:44,841 --> 02:02:48,080
You look at actually what their
intention was in a lot of them,

2136
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:52,760
the vast majority of literally
cite us foreign policy,
revenge, US foreign policy.

2137
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:57,320
I mean,
every time you kill 98% innocent people,

2138
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,360
whoever survives,

2139
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:03,230
if you lost your whole family and
that you have an incredible amount of

2140
02:03:03,231 --> 02:03:07,730
motivation to get back at whoever did
it right and that whoever did it is the

2141
02:03:07,731 --> 02:03:11,630
United States. We need to stop
normalizing this. And um, you know,

2142
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,290
militarily speaking, Trump actually,
you know, it's not just Trump.

2143
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:18,290
I mean this is a bipartisan effort
throughout the entire Congress.

2144
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:20,360
If there's one thing
congress can agree upon,

2145
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:25,660
it's to make nonviolent bds efforts
against Israel legal and also to just keep

2146
02:03:26,121 --> 02:03:30,680
ramping up the military and ageing on
whoever is sitting in the Oval Office to

2147
02:03:30,681 --> 02:03:34,790
be more militaristic. And that's
exactly what's happened with Trump. Um,

2148
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,150
in a bizarre way. I mean, Congress
approved to like a seven, uh,

2149
02:03:38,151 --> 02:03:43,151
near trillion dollar defense budget and
the increase alone in the last year was

2150
02:03:43,401 --> 02:03:47,030
basically Russia's entire military
budget more than Russia's entire military

2151
02:03:47,031 --> 02:03:49,850
budget.
That's how much this shit's ramping up.

2152
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,620
And then you have the space for us.

2153
02:03:51,621 --> 02:03:56,330
I mean it's just like how far is this
going to go? This society is collapsing.

2154
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:01,340
If you looked at the argument
against this, you would say,

2155
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:05,000
we need this in order to
keep people safe here.

2156
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:10,430
That would be the argument against it.
I, my question would be what are we,

2157
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:13,130
what threat is there isis?

2158
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:18,740
When has isis ever done anything here
other than, I mean there was like a truck.

2159
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,420
I mean,
come on.

2160
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:25,220
We already know the statistics
on terrorism in this
country and they're are very

2161
02:04:25,221 --> 02:04:26,550
low, right? I mean you're,

2162
02:04:26,551 --> 02:04:29,900
you're basically more likely to die from
like furniture falling on you or sharp

2163
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:34,070
Harmon. Yeah, yeah, and the whole
isis thing. I mean, as we know,

2164
02:04:34,071 --> 02:04:38,100
isis of rose out of us foreign policy,
the failed and Libya,

2165
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,640
the Iraq war, that's still
criminally ongoing. I mean,

2166
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:45,120
Trump announced this indefinite extension
of the criminal occupation of Iraq.

2167
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:47,700
It's just crazy how normalize this is,
you know,

2168
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:51,270
far longer than Vietnam
were in Afghanistan.

2169
02:04:51,271 --> 02:04:52,800
Fatalities that aren't all time high.

2170
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:56,130
All of these things are a direct
result of US foreign policy.

2171
02:04:56,131 --> 02:05:00,390
And look at the refugee crisis, look
at immigration, the Honduras cool,

2172
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:04,020
all of this shits connected and that's
what we need to start like expanding our

2173
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:07,920
consciousness and our empathy worldwide
to understand all of these things are

2174
02:05:07,921 --> 02:05:12,921
linked and the struggle is all linked and
our world is shrinking really rapidly.

2175
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:17,960
What candidate speaks in this way?
What,

2176
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,960
what candidate do you think understands
and recognizes all these things that

2177
02:05:21,961 --> 02:05:25,740
you're talking about? I mean, micro
vel is the only one who's like,

2178
02:05:25,741 --> 02:05:30,741
we need to end the u s empire
Bernie and see Mike Ravel was uh,

2179
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:35,700
he was the guy who basically read the
Pentagon papers and do record. He, he's,

2180
02:05:35,701 --> 02:05:37,620
he's a good guy. He has, yeah,

2181
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:39,810
he has like this online
campaign that's really awesome.

2182
02:05:39,811 --> 02:05:44,100
But I mean Tulsi is speaking a
lot about regime change wars,

2183
02:05:44,101 --> 02:05:47,400
which is extremely important,
but she still believes in drone strikes.

2184
02:05:47,401 --> 02:05:51,930
She basically has a little bit of Obama's
foreign policy that I don't agree with

2185
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:54,570
that fundamental understanding,
limited drone strikes.

2186
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:57,300
Like maybe if there's an
isis camp somewhere. I mean,

2187
02:05:57,301 --> 02:06:02,301
I can't believe that she believes in some
sort of a just broad brush use of it.

2188
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:07,770
I haven't looked into the nuances
of that, but I do think that, um,

2189
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:12,120
no one is saying what I want them
to about us empire, about, you know,

2190
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:17,640
scaling back the US empire and stopping
all of this civil society movements

2191
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:21,570
because it's not just about invasions
anymore. It's about, you know,

2192
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:25,080
you surfing the democratic processes of
all of these countries like what we've

2193
02:06:25,081 --> 02:06:29,730
done in Venezuela, what we're doing all
around the world to try to foment unrest.

2194
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:31,800
Um,
all of this needs to be stopped.

2195
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:36,830
Do you foresee a time where our dependence
on foreign oil is radically reduced

2196
02:06:37,501 --> 02:06:42,270
to the point where it doesn't justify
these regime change wars in our dependence

2197
02:06:42,271 --> 02:06:46,140
on these resources that these people have?
I mean,

2198
02:06:46,141 --> 02:06:48,810
this is almost every
conflict in the world.

2199
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:53,010
You can boil down to the acquisition
of resources and also the protection of

2200
02:06:53,011 --> 02:06:55,170
capital and that's like what a lot is.

2201
02:06:55,290 --> 02:07:00,270
What a lot of it is now is actually just
capital interests needing to expand and

2202
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:05,271
grow and continuing to up increase the
profit structure of these corporations.

2203
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:09,990
And that's exactly why we've
seen imperialism, you know,

2204
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:13,620
kind of go out of control and the
way that it has, I don't know.

2205
02:07:13,621 --> 02:07:17,810
I mean I thought that we were
more independent oil wise.

2206
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:20,550
I don't think it's good. I think that
climate change, yeah, I think that,

2207
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:24,890
and it hasn't stopped, you know, it
hasn't stopped the imperialist, um,

2208
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:26,820
misadventures of the u s government.

2209
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:31,260
So I think there just needs to be a really
big shift in consciousness and people

2210
02:07:31,261 --> 02:07:35,130
to stop thinking that it's our
right and that we have, you know,

2211
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:39,790
the right and the duty to do this around
the world. It doesn't give us the right,

2212
02:07:39,791 --> 02:07:43,690
we don't have, it's not right, man.

2213
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:45,610
It's really not. And, uh,

2214
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:50,050
we need to really reinvigorate the
masses here because again, I'm,

2215
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:53,230
society is collapsing.
That's pretty fucking obvious.

2216
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:55,930
Well, if it is, if it's not obvious,

2217
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:59,110
what is obvious is that
we're not evolving, right?

2218
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:04,290
In terms of if we're still involved in
drone strikes that kill 98% of people,

2219
02:08:06,131 --> 02:08:07,810
if we're still involved in regime change.

2220
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:12,811
Wars were still involved in these
unnecessary military actions against Iran.

2221
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:14,770
It's these things that
people freaking out about.

2222
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:19,990
This is all the same kind of shit
that people have been fighting against

2223
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:20,651
forever.

2224
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:25,651
That we don't want our brothers and
sisters and husbands and wives to die for

2225
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:27,820
nonsense.

2226
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,480
We don't want them to die for some
people that live in these air conditioned

2227
02:08:31,481 --> 02:08:36,481
rooms that are making billions of dollars
that are profiting off of the actions

2228
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,773
of these,

2229
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:43,080
these noble people who think that
they're doing it to protect America.

2230
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:46,240
I mean this is the narrative
that they're being served.

2231
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:49,810
This is what they're being told and
when they're going to these places,

2232
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:53,630
then are going to those places to
act as evil as, as, as the, the,

2233
02:08:53,631 --> 02:08:54,970
the boots of some empire.

2234
02:08:54,971 --> 02:08:57,400
They're going over there because they
think they're protecting freedom.

2235
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:00,280
They think to protect them, their
family and their loved ones back home.

2236
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:03,820
That's why they're doing it. If we're
still doing that, we're not evolving.

2237
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:05,151
Well, I mean, I,

2238
02:09:05,151 --> 02:09:07,980
that's what's so scary about the
Iran thing because the people who are

2239
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:10,140
surrounded in Iran and being
directed to go out there,

2240
02:09:10,141 --> 02:09:12,230
they're the ones who are going
to be the sacrificial. Exactly.

2241
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:14,010
For these defense contractors.

2242
02:09:14,011 --> 02:09:18,600
And I don't think that you can argue
any more that this is for freedom.

2243
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:23,990
I mean, how can you, what threat
does he Ron pose to the top cellmates

2244
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:27,080
so a tough sell. I don't, I don't
understand what threat they serve either.

2245
02:09:27,081 --> 02:09:27,914
And what,

2246
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,270
what benefit would it be for them to
start some shit with us and is that is the

2247
02:09:32,271 --> 02:09:35,300
craziest idea ever. I mean,
it's like my, you know,

2248
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:38,660
a nine year old kid trying to
pick a fight with Mike Tyson.

2249
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:41,930
It's fucking crazy. It doesn't make any
sense. Like what are you trying to do?

2250
02:09:42,230 --> 02:09:43,100
Trying to get killed?

2251
02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:47,240
I mean inevitably we're trying to get to
the global confrontation with China and

2252
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,010
Russia, I guess. I mean that's,

2253
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:54,650
it's scary to think that we only have a
couple independent states left to knock

2254
02:09:54,651 --> 02:09:59,570
down to be under complete subjugation from
the u s military in global capitalism.

2255
02:09:59,571 --> 02:10:00,550
It's pretty nuts.

2256
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:01,870
Well,
not only that,

2257
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:05,950
even if we do move into some sort of a,

2258
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:11,320
some sort of a situation where we're
in control, then we're a bigger target.

2259
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:17,100
And with the amount of nuclear weapons
that are possessed by these countries

2260
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,660
that were,
I mean,

2261
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:24,930
just what North Korea has just this one
small fucked up country could ruin life

2262
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,083
on earth.

2263
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:32,650
Just this one country
and forget about Russia.

2264
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,890
We could literally annihilate
each other. Right? That's right.

2265
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:38,510
That's a possibility. Right? I mean, if,

2266
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:42,080
if someone chose to launch an attack,

2267
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,890
if they decided that they have the
justification to launch an attack and then

2268
02:10:45,891 --> 02:10:49,340
all of a sudden we're in a real
war. Yeah, like a fucking war war.

2269
02:10:49,870 --> 02:10:52,690
We're invading us.
Shit's getting knocked down.

2270
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:56,610
Buildings and bombs blow
up. I mean, over what?

2271
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:00,090
This can't be avoided.
This is the only way.

2272
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:02,400
The only way his missiles and bombs,

2273
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:06,970
like you said, we're not evolving or
devolving. I mean it's, it's unbelievable.

2274
02:11:06,971 --> 02:11:11,440
We have the capacity to
provide for everyone. We have
the capacity to cooperate,

2275
02:11:11,441 --> 02:11:16,180
to innovate, and we're stuck.
We're stuck dehumanizing the other.

2276
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:20,320
We're stuck with this mass conditioning
to basically perpetuate these,

2277
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:24,400
these injustices and a,
it's really a shame. I mean,

2278
02:11:24,401 --> 02:11:26,260
we have all the information
at our fingertips,

2279
02:11:26,261 --> 02:11:30,220
but we still keep reverting
back to what's the myths?

2280
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:32,420
These myths that underpin our society.
Yeah.

2281
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:35,290
These conversations I have with you
are so depressing because it's always,

2282
02:11:35,291 --> 02:11:36,360
I always leave going,
what,

2283
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:38,103
Huh?

2284
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:42,630
What can be done? What can we
do? What at? Where does it end?

2285
02:11:42,631 --> 02:11:46,650
Where does it go? You know, these
are, these are the big questions.

2286
02:11:46,651 --> 02:11:49,410
And then also the,
what we discussed before,

2287
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:54,470
it's impossible for anyone to really
have a deep nuanced understanding of all

2288
02:11:55,951 --> 02:11:56,850
these different issues.

2289
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:00,270
Right? Right. I mean, I think
focusing on what you can do,

2290
02:12:00,271 --> 02:12:03,520
we can only do what we can do, right? And
you have to understand that, you know,

2291
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:06,960
you can't get debilitated or
disillusion with, you know, the,

2292
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:10,900
the influx of information or
just the complete, you know,

2293
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:13,560
the heaviness of it all.
You just have to do what you can do.

2294
02:12:13,561 --> 02:12:15,990
You're doing what you can do.
You have me on to,

2295
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:19,640
to help spread awareness about these
issues. And that's when you will freak out

2296
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:22,230
and you're about to,

2297
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,170
you're about to get spammed with a lot
of Hasbro and they don't have my real

2298
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:27,450
email.
Okay.

2299
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:30,230
But that's, that's what
we can do, Joe. And,

2300
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:34,460
and you just have to live your life and
provide for your kids and love what you

2301
02:12:34,461 --> 02:12:38,440
have and, but also just understand
your place, you know, and,

2302
02:12:38,441 --> 02:12:42,680
and just extend the empathy that
you can and just, yeah, I mean it's,

2303
02:12:42,681 --> 02:12:44,750
it's hard because I don't have the answer.

2304
02:12:44,751 --> 02:12:48,740
All I know is what's needed and what's
needed is we need a movement of the

2305
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:51,780
masses. It's not going to
come from the top down. Um,

2306
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:53,350
it's going to come from a grassroots,

2307
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,090
mobilized effort to try
to change these policies.

2308
02:12:56,091 --> 02:12:58,580
That's the only way things
have ever changed in the past.

2309
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,630
And I absolutely have hope and optimism
that we're going to change things and

2310
02:13:02,631 --> 02:13:06,290
that we're going to correct this
horrible path that we're on.

2311
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:11,970
Do you think that the 2020 elections can
have a real significant impact of any

2312
02:13:12,011 --> 02:13:12,311
of this?

2313
02:13:12,311 --> 02:13:17,311
Do you think that whoever gets into
office can really have an effect on the

2314
02:13:17,770 --> 02:13:21,640
kinds of policies that we're talking
about with the kind of influence of the

2315
02:13:21,641 --> 02:13:25,700
military industrial complex, of all these
lobbyists of Wall Street, off of all,

2316
02:13:25,701 --> 02:13:30,701
all these like ma monstrous machines that
just pure good fashioned democracy can

2317
02:13:33,121 --> 02:13:36,900
actually step in and turn
the ship away from the rocks.

2318
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,370
Bernie, I really do think that
he's one of our last chances,

2319
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:45,170
not because I think that he's going to
completely do some revolutionary upheaval

2320
02:13:45,171 --> 02:13:46,490
from the top down.
As we know,

2321
02:13:46,491 --> 02:13:50,240
Congress is stocked with a lot of terrible
people who will block a lot of these

2322
02:13:50,241 --> 02:13:51,810
efforts, but I think that, um,

2323
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:55,370
he's going to mobilize the masses and
reinvigorate the labor movement and

2324
02:13:55,371 --> 02:14:00,371
reinvigorate unions and help workers
understand that they need to fight for

2325
02:14:00,711 --> 02:14:04,160
these rights that had been eviscerated,
you know, over the last hundred years.

2326
02:14:04,730 --> 02:14:09,440
One thing that does inspire me as well as
seeing people like Elon, Omar, you know,

2327
02:14:09,441 --> 02:14:12,590
she is incredible.
She's a Somali refugee.

2328
02:14:12,591 --> 02:14:16,520
She advocates bds against Israel
and she does not fucking back down.

2329
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:19,810
I love that woman. What an
incredible woman. She got visceral,

2330
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,310
viciously attacked for re-tweeting,
um,

2331
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:25,160
one of my episodes from empire files.

2332
02:14:25,161 --> 02:14:28,910
And I think it just shows how scared
people are of, of her and her ideas.

2333
02:14:28,911 --> 02:14:33,200
And you saw how hard everyone came down
on her for just saying that Israel has

2334
02:14:33,201 --> 02:14:35,330
an influential lobby in DC.

2335
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:39,750
Yeah, well the, she's also
wearing religious garbs that
people are scared of that.

2336
02:14:39,751 --> 02:14:44,280
Right. Right away the job. And
then, um, there was something,

2337
02:14:44,281 --> 02:14:48,180
some hit piece on her yesterday. They're
saying they think she married a brother.

2338
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:50,130
Oh, that's ridiculous. Yeah.

2339
02:14:50,131 --> 02:14:53,120
They think ridiculous to get
into this country that she had a,

2340
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:56,520
a religious marriage, but then she
had another, yeah. I don't know.

2341
02:14:56,620 --> 02:15:01,620
She's the only one in Congress other than
[inaudible] and of course AOC and um,

2342
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:03,400
you know,
some other very few people,

2343
02:15:03,401 --> 02:15:06,970
but she's out there every day speaking
against the military industrial complex,

2344
02:15:06,971 --> 02:15:09,010
speaking against the wars.
I think as a refugee,

2345
02:15:09,011 --> 02:15:11,800
she understands the effects of US policy.

2346
02:15:12,490 --> 02:15:15,910
And I'm really excited that she
has a voice in there. But again,

2347
02:15:15,911 --> 02:15:19,390
I don't think that the hope is going to
come from within Congress and the system

2348
02:15:19,391 --> 02:15:20,740
is way too far gone.

2349
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:26,260
But the electoral college
and the gerrymandering and
the voter rights, you know,

2350
02:15:26,261 --> 02:15:29,290
that had been rescinded. Its, it's
a lot and it's an uphill battle.

2351
02:15:29,291 --> 02:15:31,300
But that's why someone like Bernie,

2352
02:15:31,301 --> 02:15:35,440
I think we'll turn to the people
and say I can't do this alone.

2353
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:39,550
You have to come out and get my back and
we have to have millions of people in

2354
02:15:39,551 --> 02:15:43,340
the streets demanding these things.
That's the only way it's going to work.

2355
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:47,730
All right, Abby freaked
me out. Thank on. Andrew.

2356
02:15:47,731 --> 02:15:52,340
Santina is coming on later and we're going
to get high and shit. Hi. Good. Hi. Ooh.

2357
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:55,650
