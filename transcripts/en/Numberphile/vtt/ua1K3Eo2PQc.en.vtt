00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
This is actually super interesting to me,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.460
because it's one of the most famous proofs of all time.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.600
It's the proof for Fermat's last theorem, which Andrew Wiles famously solved.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.660
Now I don't wanna explain that,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.180
what I want to explain is what's at the heart of that proof.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.520
It's actually not what Wiles spent seven years on, it's

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
it's actually something else.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.580
It's the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture which is now called modularity.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.920
So we're gonna say is Fermat's last theorem is true

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.880
and has to be just as obvious as the
fact that one doesn't equal two.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.540
In this case, Fermat's theorem reduces down to something called modularity,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.090
it's the modularity theorem.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
So it's not 1 doesn't equal 2 here, it's something else.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.130
So it's all about two things,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.719
about elliptic curves and this is specifically for

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.039
whole numbers and fractions are actually modular forms in disguise,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.359
so what does that mean?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.520
And that's how I feel even as a mathematician it's like, what?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.540
So what I want to do, just trying to get you to appreciate what this means;

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.540
just an appreciation

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.369
not the full thing, just an appreciation of what's going on.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.349
And what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to use much simpler equations,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:18.569
right, what do you want to start with?

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.850
So starting with modular forms, a modular form, now the way you need to think about

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.010
this is it's something to do with symmetry, but there's different forms of symmetry.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.390
And the one I want to show you today is called translational symmetry,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.780
and what it is, is this. Imagine you have an infinite plane

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.260
this is being nicely provided by brown paper.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.759
And imagine we actually have here so I'm just gonna

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.499
just going to kind of just put arrows to represent that I've chopped this up.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.120
Imagine now cutting this up into strips, infinite strips
but the important thing is is that the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.380
strips all the same width, and so now
something has the symmetry has a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.690
translational symmetry 'cos this goes on forever,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.010
like left and right as you can imagine
this kind of situation.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.820
What has the symmetry which you can basically take a strip of this, and cut and paste but

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.320
what's important is we want to know what functions you can cut and paste, cut and paste.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.430
yeah, a graph, but what it is we're looking for an equation, we want something to generate it,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.110
because say if you had like a picture
or funny picture in here,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.070
it might have a really complicated equation. Maybe it doesn't even have an equation at all.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.600
I can think about a pattern I mean this
doesn't even have regular pattern, my shirt

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.860
I usually like pretty regular patterned shirts

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.420
But the point is I want to show you something which actually has a very regular pattern and it's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:53.010
something I'm hoping you've seen before it's one of
these things like basically this is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.560
a sine wave so it goes up and down up and down up
and down now this actually has a long

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.350
complicated equation but the important thing
is it's like even though it is this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.480
equation that you crank out potentially you could
cut and paste, cut and paste, cut and paste

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.340
so that's the idea, a modular form has that 
except hyperbolic geometry and

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.209
it's really complicated but if you get the ...
just appreciate the fact that it's a

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.739
cut &amp; paste thing, you take one section
of it you cut &amp; paste, cut &amp; paste, that's the idea not all

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.819
functions are like that. How about a function
like this is my attempt to circle

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.680
Brady: (laughing)
Simon: thanks man

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.700
so a circle has an equation. I'm actually going to write the equation down just because it's fun

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.170
basically the circle is another equation
except it doesn't have translational symmetry

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.100
think about it just exists in
one section so what this relationship is

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.370
saying ellipitic curves (so whole numbers and fractions)
are modular forms in disguise

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.709
it's actually saying is that you can fit a
modular form into elliptic curves, you can fit a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.430
translational symmetry equation into the
equation of the circle. That's what it's saying.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.510
this is magical stuff. So how does this
work? how can we make this work

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.500
well the way you have to think about it is that 
imagine now we had a point on the circle

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.350
alright? now we start following it around yeah? So let's just have fun, maybe we could do it really quickly

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.620
maybe go slowly maybe go fast-slow-fast-slow but if
we chose to do it at a constant rate

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.070
going round and round and round imagine
what that'd look like if this was actually

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.470
moving through space so if you think
about it if I'm doing the circle imagine

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.600
now if I go like this, so now I'm gonna start
moving at the same rate as I'm going up

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.720
and so what's actually going on is I'm
actually making a coil

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.020
Brady: It's like a slinky
Simon: It's like a slinky

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.910
that's right so now just imagine right, what
we're doing is we're actually creating a

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.290
coil now again if it was a slinky, slinkies you
can make them bunched up and ... but imagine

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.210
we've got a slinky that's just perfectly
evenly spaced so now that has an

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:15.450
equation; it has a helix equation, it's got an equation in
3D but what happens if you look

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.430
down the barrel of that helix? What
would you see if you looked straight

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
down and there was no perspective
problems like if you look straight down

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.000
the barrel what would you see?
Brady: A circle

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.600
Simon: that's right, so what's actually going on there is that the helix can fit inside the equation of the circle

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.300
and the only reason this works is because 3D
space and 2D space are both flat when you

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.280
dealing with curvy spaces this is really
not an option and these are curvy

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.940
spaces the actual elliptic curves belong
to projective space, modular forms belong

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.320
to hyperbolic space, the complex numbers, I
mean they are really super curvy, but in this

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.400
example it's really nice because what
we're doing is we're actually fitting

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.960
three-dimensional numbers into
two-dimensional numbers. Not really

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.050
three-dimensional, they exist in three dimensions
you gotta think they have a different

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.830
relationship going on. So what the coil
has, the coil has translational symmetry

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.300
So this is the link between modular forms and elliptic curves. It says

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.230
that this really strange function over
here can fit inside this really dull

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.340
function over here and when this happened
no one believed it no one believed you

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.250
could stick, you know, you can stick this
coil into the circle. The reason why no one

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.630
believed it was because no one could
visualize it so nicely like we can, they're just

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.510
completely different spaces. That's the
connection that needed to happen to

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.320
actually make Fermat's last theorem work.
It's ... this is again, this is not the real

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.870
thing because if you think about it if
you have a whole number or a fraction as

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.490
its cycling around ok as long as it's a
fraction there'll b a point where it will come

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.250
back on top of itself. Like there is a point
where fractions because there's a number

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.940
you can multiply fractions by, you'll get a
whole number. So what that means is, in turning

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.960
around a circle if you start with some
sort of fraction you'll end up back at

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.120
the same spot if you have an irrational
number which by definition is something

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.100
that can't be a fraction you started at
some point and went around by root two

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.940
we never get back to the .. to the actual original
position so again this is the feeling here

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.750
of the proof the fact these these
numbers matter the type of number

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.330
matters. This is not how the proof is
worked! I again am trying to give you a

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.020
feeling for what's going on the fact
that the reason why Fermat's last

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.630
theorem involves numbers is because
these numbers the way the numbers are

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.510
actually they work together

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.220
impact whether you can put a curve into
one of these and so then, how they linked it in

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.420
here is the fact that they said: Fermat's last theorem involves whole numbers therefore the circle

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.660
equation I'm making should permit one of
these things except they proved all

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.760
these wonderful people that you've seen
on numberphile who you should be seeing

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.040
if you haven't seen yet all the
wonderful people that actually proved this

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.860
they showed that that created a
contradiction so basically even though

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.670
you're playing by the rules and using
whole numbers it doesn't permit one of

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.270
these things so again it's the one, not equaling two.
