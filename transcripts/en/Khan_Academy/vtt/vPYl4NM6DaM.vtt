00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:01.756
- [Narrator] We're told this table

00:00:01.756 --> 00:00:03.821
gives a few values of function f.

00:00:03.821 --> 00:00:05.693
It tells us what f of x is equal to.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:08.837
That x is equal to two,
three, four and five.

00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:11.693
Which condition would
allow you to conclude

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:15.319
that there exists a maximum value for f

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.831
over the closed interval from two to four.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.039
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.536
So you might already remember,

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:27.212
if we're trying to
conclude that there exists,

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.413
anytime people are talking
about, there exists,

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:30.693
something over an interval,

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:31.720
we're probably dealing

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.437
with some type of an existence theorem.

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:36.260
And if we're talking about
the existence of a maximum

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.745
or a minimum value for a
function over an interval.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.065
That means that we're talking about

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.048
the extreme value theorem.

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:48.020
Or we are likely talking about
the extreme value theorem

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.419
and in order to apply the
extreme value theorem,

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:54.188
sometimes abbreviated EVT,

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:57.234
we need to know that our
function is continuous

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:59.267
over this closed interval.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.715
So, in order to do that,

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.483
we need to know that f

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:06.150
is continuous over our
closed interval here,

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:08.913
over two to four.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.918
The closed interval from two to four.

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:16.446
So let's see which of these
will allow us to conclude this

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:18.103
because if we're able to conclude this,

00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:19.862
then we're able to apply
the extreme value theorem,

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.470
which tells us that there exists

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.710
a maximum value for f over that interval.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.174
Alright, choice A says,

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:29.405
f is increasing in the open
interval from two to three

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.453
and decreasing on the open
interval from three to five.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:34.581
Now you can completely,

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.005
this doesn't tell us that
we're definitely continuous

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.213
over that interval,

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:39.997
over two to four

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:40.981
so I would rule that out.

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.653
You could definitely
still be discontinuous

00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:44.661
and statement A still being true

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:46.557
so I'm gonna rule that one out.

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:50.800
F is continuous over the closed
interval from two to five.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.318
Well if we're continuous
over the closed interval

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:53.431
from two to five,

00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:55.833
we're definitely continuous
over a sub-set over that,

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.071
over the closed interval from two to four

00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.622
and so if we're able to
make that, if we know that,

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.478
then we can use the extreme value theorem,

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.966
we've met the condition for
the extreme value theorem.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.152
To say that there exists a maximum value

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:10.280
for f over that interval.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.383
So, I like this one.

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:13.216
Let's just look at this last one.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:16.934
F is differentiable over the open interval

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.267
from two to four

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.005
and at x is equal to two.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.335
So this is close

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:28.642
because differentiability
does imply continuity.

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:31.794
But, it isn't telling us what's happening

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:32.985
at x equals four.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:36.330
We could still be
discontinuous at x equals four,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.402
we're just differentiable
for every point up to four

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.994
because it's talking
about an open interval.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.034
So this is close.

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:43.258
If they said differentiable

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.498
over the closed interval from two to four,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.154
then this would allow us to conclude

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:49.042
because differentiability
over an interval,

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.666
implies continuity

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:51.667
but I'm gonna rule this one out

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.650
because it does not ensure continuity

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.643
at our right boundary, at x equals four.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.842
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:03.146
H is a differentiable function.

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:03.979
And once again,

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.722
they've given us what our
function h is equal to

00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:08.466
at certain sampled x points, x values.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:12.633
Clyde was asked whether
there's a solution to h of x

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:17.384
is equal to negative two on the interval

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:20.960
from the closed interval
from negative one to three.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.664
This is his solution

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:23.632
and then we're asked,

00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:25.288
is Clyde's work correct?

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.392
If not, what is his mistake?

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:28.840
And then they give us some choices.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.472
But, before even looking at the choices,

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:33.504
let us, pause this video

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.816
and see if what Clyde
is saying makes sense

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.888
and if it doesn't make sense.

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:39.664
Try to pin point where he messed up.

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:41.304
What step did he make
the wrong conclusion?

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.848
If he made any mistake at all.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.344
Alright so, the first thing he did

00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:47.177
is he said look,

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:49.344
negative two, we wanna
see, is there an x value

00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:51.984
where h of x is equal to negative two.

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:53.696
So first he says look,

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.688
negative two is between h of negative one

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:57.400
and h of three, so let's see,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400
h of negative one is two

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.887
and h of three is negative five

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:07.448
and he is right,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:11.333
that negative three,
or sorry negative two,

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:12.661
sits right in here

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:17.472
so negative two is right
between these two values.

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:19.745
It's right in between h of negative one

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:20.995
and h of three.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.017
Since h is differentiable,

00:04:24.017 --> 00:04:27.674
we know it is continuous
on that closed interval.

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:28.507
That's right.

00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:29.649
We were just talking about that.

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:32.689
Differentiability implies continuity.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.881
Continuity does not always
imply differentiability.

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.313
You can't make that assumption

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:40.065
but differentiability implies continuity.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.216
If we're differentiable over interval,

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:43.369
we're definitely continuous
on that interval.

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:45.082
And so, he's right here.

00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:47.105
That so far step one and step two,

00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:48.297
we can conclude

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.570
that we are continuous
over the closed interval

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.809
from negative one to three

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:53.729
and then he says,

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.370
the extreme value theorem
guarantees a solution

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.896
to h of x equals negative
two on that closed interval.

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:03.121
So this feels a little bit fishy.

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.969
Because the extreme value theorem says,

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.393
it says, if we meet our conditions

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.177
and we did for even the
extreme value theorem,

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:11.129
we're continuous on that closed interval.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.897
It says that we're gonna
have a well defined

00:05:12.897 --> 00:05:15.105
maximum and minimum value
on that closed interval

00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:17.664
but we don't care about minimum
and maximum values here,

00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:20.353
what we care is that we take on

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:24.418
an intermediate value in that interval.

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:26.651
Value in between h of negative one

00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.995
and h of three,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:31.115
possibly what each of
those boundaries as well.

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:34.619
And so, he's applying the wrong theorem.

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:36.843
It should be the
intermediate value theorem,

00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:40.043
I'll just abbreviate that as IVT,

00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:41.539
is what he should be saying.

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.802
The intermediate value theorem,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.219
because we are continuous
on the closed interval.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.491
It says that we are going
to take on every value

00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.987
between h of negative one

00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:51.526
and h of three

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:54.236
and negative two is one of those values

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:55.723
between h of negative one

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:57.363
and h of three

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.627
and so if he just wrote
intermediate value theorem instead,

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.275
he would've been correct.

00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:04.525
So let's see which choice is consistent

00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:07.506
with what we just wrote.

00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.243
He's definitely not correct.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.874
Step one wasn't incorrect.

00:06:11.874 --> 00:06:15.291
Negative two is between h of negative one

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.307
and h of three.

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:20.807
Step two was actually correct.

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:25.362
We know that differentiability
implies continuity.

00:06:25.362 --> 00:06:26.712
Step three is incorrect,

00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:29.462
yes he applied the wrong theorem.
