00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.030
The three engines of growth are ways
to think about customer acquisition.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.580
The first one is the sticky
engine of growth,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.480
where you're going to focus on bringing
your customers back month after month.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.330
You really want them to stick with you.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.170
You're really focusing here on
keeping customers with you,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.330
rather than acquiring new customers.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.810
So, this is the right
engine to focus on,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.980
if your focused on retaining
customers for the long term.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.860
The second engine of growth
is the viral engine.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.270
This is usually heaven for
entrepreneurs,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.960
where they get to the point where their
customers are bringing in new customers.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.850
And their user base is just
growing virally and organically.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.750
Now I wouldn't rely on this one, because
it's really hard to actually get here.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.730
Your product is going to
have to be incredible, and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.150
really fit your target market perfectly,
otherwise it doesn't really work.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.710
So once you have a really awesome
product, growth can be self sustaining,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.870
but it doesn't necessarily
happen to everyone.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.370
And the third engine of growth
is the paid engine of growth.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.290
Most start ups have to be
familiar with this one.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.190
And most advertising channels
fall into this engine.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.550
Now as long as you're making
a profit on each customer,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.860
you can keep operating this engine.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.800
Your profit will allow you to invest
more and more into advertising and

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.380
help you sustain your growth.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.150
Now big companies will focus on more
than one or even all of these engines.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.290
However, as a startup, we recommend
that you focus on only one at a time.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.610
In this lesson in particular we'll
be focusing on the paid engine for

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.600
customer acquisition.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240
If you're interested in learning more,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.980
we highly recommend checking
out the book The Lean Startup.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.080
It describes these three engines as
part of a whole lean startup approach,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.170
that helps entrepreneurs build
fast growing companies, and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.220
encourages them to build, measure and
learn on an ongoing basis.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.820
Check out the link to the book
in the instructor notes.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700
Okay, so let's dive into
this paid engine of growth.
