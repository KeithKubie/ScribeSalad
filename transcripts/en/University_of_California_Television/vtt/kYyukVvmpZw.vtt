00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.530
(piano music)

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.993
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.493
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:35.315
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:39.534
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:42.574
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:44.657
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.420
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.092
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:53.175
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:55.817
We shape the future from our

00:00:55.817 --> 00:00:58.567
shared understanding of the past.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:03.846
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:08.013
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:12.440
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.023
of humans like you.

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:33.051
(piano music)

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.661
- I'm talking about
adaptations to high altitude.

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.911
First, let's ask what is high altitude?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.417
We typically define high altitude as

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:18.000
2,500 meters, that is
8,000 feet or higher.

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.402
And that obviously covers a lot of ground.

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:26.081
Down on the bottom right,
you might be thinking

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.969
oh high altitude and rugged mountaineers

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.136
are seeking to climb to the
summit of Manaslu at 27,000 feet

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:38.902
or you may think of athletes,
such as this soccer player

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:41.484
from low alt, from sea level, who is

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:44.499
playing at 12,000 feet in Bolivia.

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.083
And those are ways in
which many many people

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.026
are exposed to high altitude.

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:53.396
The top two photos
describe another type of

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:56.563
exposure to high altitude, and that is

00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:59.409
people who have been living,

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.516
who are the descendants of populations

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:03.027
that have been resident at

00:03:03.027 --> 00:03:06.347
high altitude for thousands of years.

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:09.914
On the right are Andean
highlander children,

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:13.426
who are descended from a
population that has lived there

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:18.329
at high altitude in this
case, about 14,000 feet,

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.996
for something like 14,000 years.

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:25.255
On the left, the Tibetan woman spinning

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:28.685
is the descendant of Tibetan populations

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:32.137
and there have been people
living on the Tibetan plateau

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:34.606
for 20 to 30,000 years.

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:39.098
So you can see that the
exposure and the actual altitude

00:03:39.098 --> 00:03:41.879
varies enormously when we talk about

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.649
adaptations to high altitude.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.722
Why is high altitude so interesting?

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:50.237
Well one of the reasons
it's so interesting

00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:54.237
is that there is a unique
and very severe stress

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.031
and it's called hypoxia.

00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.781
Less than the usual oxygen level.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.070
If we think of ourselves
here in San Diego,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.120
think of taking a lungful of air

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.549
and you get a certain number of molecules.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.828
Let's call that 100%.

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:17.623
As you go up in altitude,
barometric pressure falls,

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:20.747
and as you know the
molecules grow further apart

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:25.632
and there are fewer
molecules per unit of volume.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.902
By the time we're in
Denver, at 1,500 meters,

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:32.652
or about 5,100 feet,
that same lungful of air

00:04:34.188 --> 00:04:38.345
has only about 80% of
those oxygen molecules.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:41.428
At Pike's Peak, at about 14,100 feet,

00:04:42.496 --> 00:04:45.049
each lungful of air has only

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:48.940
about 58% of the same molecules.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.273
Now this is a severe stress,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.175
and it's a stress that's constant.

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:57.030
It doesn't go away with the seasons.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.664
It doesn't go away if
you're rich or you're poor,

00:04:59.664 --> 00:05:02.868
so this makes it a good stress to study.

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.035
Now what is an adaptation?

00:05:06.053 --> 00:05:10.220
And what is hypoxia have
to do with being a stress

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:13.479
to which we might have to adapt?

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.103
Well, we need to get a sufficient number

00:05:17.103 --> 00:05:21.270
of oxygen molecules from our
lungs in the ambient air.

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:27.159
We need to exchange those
with our bloodstream.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.594
We need to transport
those oxygen molecules

00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:34.590
through the heart and
the cardiovascular system

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.757
and deliver them to our
mitochondria where they are used.

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:44.263
And our mitochondria must
have those oxygen molecules.

00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:49.430
So what do we do when
faced with a situation

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.103
where let's say there are only 60%

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:55.047
of the usual number of oxygen molecules?

00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:58.346
Well something has to
happen with gas exchange,

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.513
gas transport, or gas use.

00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.670
And that something are adaptations.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.293
And I'll use adaptation as a very,

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.443
in a very general way to refer to

00:06:10.443 --> 00:06:13.038
a biological response that increases

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:16.455
survival and reproduction under a stress.

00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:20.224
And adaptations can take place

00:06:20.224 --> 00:06:23.182
on a wide range of time scales.

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:27.285
As the X axis shows, some acclimatizations

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:31.536
can take place in seconds,
hours, days, or months.

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:34.624
We refer to those that are really fast

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:37.874
and are reversible as acclimatizations.

00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:43.185
Another type of adaptation
occurs if we grow up

00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:45.274
under a particular stress.

00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:49.274
That's an irreversible
developmental adaptation.

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:53.999
Over the course of generations
and thousands of years,

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.042
or hundreds of thousands of years,

00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:59.724
natural selection may
result in an increase

00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:03.224
in allele frequency of alleles at that are

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.456
effective at counteracting
the environmental stress.

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:13.068
Let's first look at ourselves.

00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:15.450
I'm assuming that
everyone here is like me,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.966
and we've all been born
and raised at low altitude.

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:22.973
So we lowlanders, let's
say we go to Pike's Peak,

00:07:22.973 --> 00:07:25.100
or we go to Everest Base Camp.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.135
One, we acclimatize.

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:30.604
We acclimatize at the
level of oxygen exchange

00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:33.150
by increasing our breathing.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.520
And you can see from this plot that shows

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.289
over days at altitude from
before you go to altitude

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:43.505
to up to about three weeks
or a month at altitude,

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.505
our ventilation increases enormously

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.998
and what does that do?

00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:51.983
It means that the number of liters of air

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:55.824
that we're taking in in
a minute is increased.

00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:58.900
That's how we get enough
oxygen molecules or how

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.951
our bodies are responding or acclimatizing

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.873
so that we get enough oxygen molecules

00:08:05.873 --> 00:08:10.040
at least at the beginning of
the oxygen transport system.

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:14.448
This is an acclimatization that is

00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:18.042
sustained for years at high altitude.

00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:22.689
After decades, it starts
to fade and become blunted.

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:24.918
We also acclimatize at the level of

00:08:24.918 --> 00:08:29.413
gas transport or oxygen
transport by hemoglobin.

00:08:29.413 --> 00:08:33.789
And the way we do that
is there is an increase

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.028
in erythropoietin that stimulates

00:08:37.028 --> 00:08:39.937
the production of more red blood cells

00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:41.854
containing more hemoglobin.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:45.354
More hemoglobin molecules to carry oxygen,

00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.757
so again now we're adapting
at the level of gas transport.

00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:54.128
The higher the altitude,
the higher the stress,

00:08:54.128 --> 00:08:57.611
the higher the hemoglobin concentration.

00:08:57.611 --> 00:09:01.717
And this also is an
acclimatization response

00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:05.884
that lasts indefinitely until
we return to low altitude

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.350
and then it is reversed.

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:13.982
At the level of gas use or oxygen use,

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.386
something very puzzling happens

00:09:17.386 --> 00:09:21.660
and that is at least for the
first few weeks at altitude

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.827
our gas use as measured by
our basal metabolic rate,

00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:31.512
that's the minimum amount
of oxygen that's required

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:34.594
to keep us alive by our heart beating

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:37.157
and breathing and so forth.

00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:39.607
That actually increases for the

00:09:39.607 --> 00:09:41.786
first couple of weeks at altitude,

00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:45.119
and then it by three weeks or four weeks

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.470
it has returned to its pre-exposure level.

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:54.886
So those are acclimatizations,

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:58.434
and these are within the
purview of all people.

00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:02.420
How is it that we mount
those acclimatizations?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.587
Well we do so because we have
an oxygen homeostasis pathway

00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:11.195
consisting of genes, and proteins,

00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:13.778
and it's a very lovely pathway.

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:18.471
The first element in the pathway

00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:20.611
is the oxygen sensor

00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:23.436
and it is a protein that is coded for

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.353
by a gene called EGLN1.

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:30.522
Second elements in the
pathway are subunits of

00:10:32.443 --> 00:10:36.610
proteins that are called
hypoxia inducible factors

00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:39.663
and we have three of them.

00:10:39.663 --> 00:10:43.496
Hypoxia inducible factors
one, two, and three.

00:10:44.484 --> 00:10:48.091
Hypoxia inducible factor one is called one

00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.749
because it has a particular protein

00:10:51.749 --> 00:10:55.623
that is coded for by a gene called HIF1.

00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:59.233
HIF for hypoxia inducible factor one A.

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:02.316
HIF2 has a subunit coded for by HIF2A

00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:06.228
and the same for HIF3.

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:10.117
These three hypoxia inducible factors

00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:12.249
are transcription factors,

00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:15.557
and they, once the oxygen sensor

00:11:15.557 --> 00:11:18.518
senses that a cell is hypoxic,

00:11:18.518 --> 00:11:20.995
these hypoxia inducible factors

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:24.115
accumulate and they
induce the transcription

00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:28.282
of hundreds of target genes
that increase gas exchange,

00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:33.597
increase gas transport,
and modify gas use.

00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:39.458
One of the target genes
is the erythropoietin.

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:43.375
Why do we have this oxygen
homeostasis pathway?

00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:48.605
Well we have this oxygen
homeostasis pathway

00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:51.922
because we're descended from ancestors

00:11:51.922 --> 00:11:56.089
that lived at a wide range of
atmospheric oxygen content.

00:11:57.825 --> 00:12:00.983
The red line here shows the 21%.

00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:03.983
This is the number that
we all learn in school,

00:12:03.983 --> 00:12:06.534
air contains 21% of oxygen,

00:12:06.534 --> 00:12:08.400
but it hasn't always.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.995
Along the X axis here
you'll see millions of years

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:16.162
and we're showing that until
about 650 million years ago,

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:21.352
the Earth's atmosphere was
composed of less than 5% oxygen.

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:24.953
Around 600 million years ago,

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.339
multi-cellular animals evolved.

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:32.422
It was at this time that
HIF1 alpha also evolved.

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:38.166
So we share this with
all of our multi-cellular

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:42.303
animal compatriots, if you will.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:46.184
A little bit later around
550 million years ago,

00:12:46.184 --> 00:12:49.601
vertebrates arose and HIF2 alpha evolved.

00:12:51.094 --> 00:12:55.367
Again, we share this with all
of our fellow vertebrates.

00:12:55.367 --> 00:12:59.768
At the time, oxygen
concentration was only about 12%.

00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:03.807
Then we went through some
periods of very high oxygen,

00:13:03.807 --> 00:13:08.088
low, and about 200 million
years ago mammals evolved

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:12.263
and with the evolution of
mammals, we see the evolution

00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:16.326
of our third hypoxia inducible factor one.

00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:20.744
So the why question of
why are we able to respond

00:13:20.744 --> 00:13:23.800
and acclimatize to high altitudes

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.714
is that we are descended
from a series of ancestors

00:13:28.714 --> 00:13:32.881
that evolve these elements of
our oxygen homeostasis system.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:37.952
So that implies then well, okay.

00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:42.051
We must all, we being all
seven billion of us humans,

00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:46.807
respond in the same way to
high altitude hypoxic stress.

00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:50.310
Let's look at that, and let's ask whether

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.859
women like this Tibetan highlander

00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:55.300
living in the shadow of Mount Manaslu

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.726
acclimatize in the same way we do.

00:13:58.726 --> 00:14:03.045
Let's look at gas exchange
and we are comparing here

00:14:03.045 --> 00:14:06.214
Tibetan and Andean highlanders,

00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:10.718
and let's focus on the
area above 3,500 meters.

00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:15.623
That is, the samples of people
who are under hypoxic stress.

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.757
And you can see that in
general, what has happened

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:22.980
is that Tibetan highlanders
in the blue triangles

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.617
have retained the acclimatization

00:14:25.617 --> 00:14:27.867
response of high breathing.

00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:32.286
The Andean highlanders
in general, have not.

00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:34.953
They have blunted that response.

00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:38.556
With respect to gas transport,

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:40.535
the opposite occurs.

00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:43.416
Andean highlanders have essentially

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.347
retained the acclimatization response

00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:50.514
while Tibetan highlanders
have blunted that response.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.966
What about gas use?

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:56.640
Here's a dissertation project for someone.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.851
We don't have very much information.

00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:00.906
The little information that we have

00:15:00.906 --> 00:15:04.189
is that both Andean
and Tibetan highlanders

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:07.106
have normal as expected oxygen use.

00:15:09.223 --> 00:15:10.616
So we don't see any evidence

00:15:10.616 --> 00:15:13.636
for population differences there.

00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:18.344
Well now in addition to having
three types of adaptations,

00:15:18.344 --> 00:15:20.927
Andean, Tibetan, and lowlander,

00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:27.343
we also have to think
about acclimatizations,

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:31.806
developmental adaptations,
and genetic adaptations.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.139
So why do we think this contrast exists?

00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:38.847
Well with genomics and being able

00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:41.971
to examine whole genomes, we've discovered

00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:45.471
that the actual oxygen censor gene, EGLN1,

00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:50.795
has a number of variants
and that the variants

00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:54.212
in EGLN1 that exist in Andean populations

00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:59.697
are different from those that
exist in Tibetan populations

00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:02.755
and in turn, those are different

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:06.922
from the variants that
exist here at low altitude.

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:11.177
The variants are not fixed, but they are

00:16:11.177 --> 00:16:14.333
a very different allele frequencies.

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:18.000
So this is one reason
for Andean highlanders

00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:23.212
having the particular
pattern of low ventilation,

00:16:23.212 --> 00:16:24.795
high gas transport.

00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:29.926
Tibetans, on the other hand, not only

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:32.926
have mutations in the oxygen sensor,

00:16:33.898 --> 00:16:37.398
they also have mutations in the HIF2 alpha

00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:42.790
element of hypoxia inducible factor 2.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.457
And these are factors
of Tibetan highlanders

00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:50.646
that result in a dampened response

00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:54.452
to high altitude hypoxia,

00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:59.179
and the particular association
that is particularly strong

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:01.988
is that with hemoglobin concentration.

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:05.321
Homozygotes for the Tibetan form of HIF2

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.430
have two grams of hemoglobin less

00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:14.102
than their compatriots
who have the ancestral,

00:17:14.102 --> 00:17:17.352
or low altitude form of that same gene.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.263
So the reason then for

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:26.115
this difference between
Andean and Tibetan highlanders

00:17:26.115 --> 00:17:30.282
relates to natural selection
and local adaptation.

00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:34.717
We have Andean highlanders
and Tibetan highlanders

00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:38.941
who have adapted to the same
stress of high altitude hypoxia

00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:42.961
but on a local level,
with different mutations

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.628
and mutations at different loci.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.831
Now what are the
implications for medicine,

00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:53.648
whether we're at high altitude or low?

00:17:53.648 --> 00:17:56.869
You may be surprised to learn that

00:17:56.869 --> 00:18:00.786
something like 30% of the deaths in the US

00:18:02.142 --> 00:18:05.008
are associated with hypoxia.

00:18:05.008 --> 00:18:09.488
Not caused by hypoxia, but
they're associated with hypoxia.

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:12.886
And now that we understand that we have

00:18:12.886 --> 00:18:16.219
distinctive oxygen homeostasis pathways.

00:18:17.784 --> 00:18:21.284
Genes, molecules, proteins, and responses,

00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:25.124
we can now look at those deaths

00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:28.983
that are associated with
hypoxia and the diseases

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.795
that precede them, and we
can ask questions about

00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:36.825
well do certain variants in
the oxygen homeostasis pathway

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.994
make us more vulnerable?

00:18:38.994 --> 00:18:41.827
Or do they change the prognosis of

00:18:43.617 --> 00:18:45.925
a disease associated with hypoxia?

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:48.675
And does this give us opportunity

00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:53.439
for developing
pharmacological interventions?

00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:57.232
And all of those are in process.

00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:01.411
And so this is one way where

00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:05.801
evolutionary medicine, looking
at our evolutionary history,

00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:08.972
helps us understand and come up with

00:19:08.972 --> 00:19:11.389
new ways of looking at causes

00:19:12.863 --> 00:19:15.548
and factors associated with health

00:19:15.548 --> 00:19:18.173
and disease in our own population.

00:19:18.173 --> 00:19:19.945
Thank you very much.
