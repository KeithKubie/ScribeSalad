For YouTube giving week 2018 psyched ago has partnered with the brain and behavior Research Foundation

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.719
Stick around until the end of the video to see how you can help fund a better understanding of various brain and behavior disorders

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.070
including depression

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.279
Depression and mental illnesses are different for everyone with this list. We are not trying to generalize

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.650
instead we've compiled certain things individuals with depression have disclosed they struggle with

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.689
Here are eight things people with depression would like their family and friends to understand

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.050
one it's not as simple as eating healthier and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.919
Exercising more while we really appreciate you trying to help us the underlying condition isn't always solved that easily

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
It still feels like your feelings are being invalidated if things aren't phrased carefully

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.160
two it's not always easy to understand why things are this way?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.379
Depression doesn't always have a specific trigger. It just happens. It's more complicated than just feeling sad because we got a bad grade

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.959
Assumptions like this are diminishing our experiences. Sometimes there's no emotion

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.070
Sometimes there's too much it often isn't very clear why either

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.369
We'd like to understand it better ourselves. But depression can make you feel a wide variety of confusing things

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.360
three it's not your fault. There's no one single factor that causes depression. It's an illness

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.140
Certain things can contribute to it, but it's nobody's fault

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.508
For it's not that we're not trying hard enough. No one wants to have depression

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.979
Telling us that we're not trying hard enough when we are in fact, trying our hardest is dismissing our struggle and it's very hurtful

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.319
five we can't just stop out of it if it was possible to simply get over it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.820
We would have done it a long time ago. It's not a mood that you can come out of when you're done

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.849
six we don't want to hurt others. We hate to feel like an annoyance because of our illness

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.839
We don't want to cause the people around us pain because of what we're going through

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.079
seven we feel like a burden

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.019
Reassurance might not magically solve our depression, but it can help us open up the better feelings

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.729
We need validation that were not an annoyance to be able to relax around you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.890
eight we truly appreciate your efforts. We notice you trying to help us and we are very grateful

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.829
Reaching out to us is always a ray of light. But please remember we aren't asking you to fix us

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.220
