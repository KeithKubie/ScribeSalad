ERIC KOLEDA: The other
layer on the--

00:00:02.376 --> 00:00:03.626
TECH PERSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
on camera.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.744
ERIC KOLEDA: Whoops.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:11.620
TECH PERSON: Roll time.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.920
ERIC KOLEDA: Yep, and
then audio down.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.900
Main audio down.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:02:17.324
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.850
ERIC KOLEDA: Hi, and welcome
to Google Apps Unscripted.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.970
My name is Eric Koleda.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.800
I'm a member of the Google
Developer Relations team here,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.590
working on Apps Script.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.540
And with us today, Christian
Moscardi?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.030
Is that how you say it?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.010
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yep.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.470
That's correct.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.110
ERIC KOLEDA: Great.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.250
He's an intern working on our
team for the summer, helping

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.690
us out, getting Apps Script--
making it even more awesome

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.370
for everybody.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.270
Christian, you want to give us
a little bit of background, I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.680
guess, about maybe who you
are, where you come from?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.480
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Sure.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.260
Well, I go to Columbia
University during the year.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.770
I'm going to be a senior
this coming fall.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.470
And, I'm here on the Developer
Relations team, specifically

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.060
with Apps Script for the summer,
working on that,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.120
working on, ultimately, some
code samples that will be

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.840
pushed out in the near future.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.440
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.000
One of the things pieces of
feedback we get a lot is that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.900
it really helps to have complete
sample code, a whole

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.430
application.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.046
We try to put a lot of little
samples in our docs, little

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:17.300
bit of reference documentation,
or perhaps

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.370
little snippets just kind of
throughout our documentation,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.670
to kind of give you an idea
about how to use a very

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.200
specific function or feature.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.930
People like to see a larger
end-to-end application,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.590
something that covers more
of the use cases that

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.890
they are used to.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.440
So it's great to have you here
helping out with that.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.350
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah,
it's great to be here.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.070
It's been a great experience
so far.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.790
I'm excited to be working
on what I'm doing.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.700
ERIC KOLEDA: He was not
obligated to say that.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.028
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Not at all.

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:41.680
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.430
Well, we have a ton to cover
today, as well as get into

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.410
your questions.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.570
If this is your first time
joining us for Google Apps

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.710
Unscripted, there's two ways
you can ask questions.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.600
One is to join the Hangout link,
which I just posted to

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.580
the Event Page on Google+ for
this event, as well as the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.190
page on the Google Developers
Live Event Page.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.720
We have two different pages
where you can access the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.240
Hangout link.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.420
So you can either join
us via the Hangout

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.750
or, as you can see--

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.310
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: The
link is down here?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.150
ERIC KOLEDA: Actually, it's up
at the top, but it may not

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.830
have been there when you
loaded the page.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.170
It'll be there now.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.839
But there's also-- then on
this page, there it is.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.880
Join this Hangout.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.709
So you can join there, and we'll
take your live questions

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.390
later on in the show.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.180
Or, you can ask via the
Moderator, the Google

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.030
Moderator that's embedded just
below the event here, and ask

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.680
your questions, if you don't
have a webcam or you don't

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.670
feel like getting on air.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.080
We've got some questions
already trickling in.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.870
We'll get to those later
on in the show.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.580
But first, let's talk about
some recent news.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.380
So I think the big one
here is on the blog.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.820
We just published a blog post.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.010
And I mean just--

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.130
as in, literally right before
we went on the air.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.340
We published this blog post.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.560
We're happy to announce that
there is a new feature

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.690
available in Google
Apps Script.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.070
It's the ability to access the
cursor and selection of the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.930
Active User within a Google
Doc document.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.780
So at Google I/O this year,
one of the big things we

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.380
launched was the ability
to write scripts

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.770
inside of Google Docs.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.840
And we've seen people kind of
jump on board and start

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.650
playing with that.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.280
For right away, they're like,
you know, I really need to get

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.040
more interaction.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.420
I need to know what the user's
doing, where they are in the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.160
document, what they
have selected.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.890
And that's something that
we really knew people

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.630
we're going to want.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.540
But we had to put the finishing
touches on it.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.970
So it didn't quite
make it for I/O.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.730
But it's out now.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.310
And we think we're really happy
with how it turned out.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.200
And so this blog post links
off to some of the various

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.900
reference documentation
around the cursor

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.250
and selection object.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.490
But I think even more fun than
looking at some documentation

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.080
would be looking at
some examples.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.730
So we published three
different examples

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.550
on this blog post.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.220
Do you want lead us through
the first one, Christian?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.350
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Sure.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.450
It's really simple, very
straightforward, just showing

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.340
off how you can select a block
of text, say, and then in this

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.620
particular script, it's very
simple-- translate it from

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.730
English into Spanish.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.990
So it assumes English text and
translate it into Spanish.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.880
But you can imagine, it's very
easy to change those

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.290
parameters to whatever
languages you want.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.930
So this is the document here.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.780
And let's say I want to take
this block of text, "automate

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.260
workflows such as a document
or expense approvals, order

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.910
fulfillment, time tracking and
more"-- hmm, I wonder how you

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.794
say that in Spanish?

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:10.960
Oh, look at that.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.660
And there it is, translated
nicely into Spanish for you.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.000
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.800
So, I think we added a custom
menu item, which is something

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.730
that you could at I/O. But now,
rather than just try to

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.590
find some texts or do some
manipulation, you now know

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.360
what's in the selection.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.200
And that's what makes
this possible.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.540
So, that's a pretty cool one.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.870
Now, if you are also familiar
with what we did at I/O this

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.770
year, you may recognize the
term, "Bibstro" or "beepstro,"

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.150
depending upon how you choose
to pronounce it--

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.510
which is the sample app--

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.420
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: This
one's way cool.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.710
ERIC KOLEDA: --built by one of
our engineers, Jonathan.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.190
And this sample app allows you
to do really kind of complex

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.360
bibliography management
within a Google Doc.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.710
Now, people have been clamoring
for the source code

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.400
as soon as we were there at I/O.
And so, we've released

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.165
the source code today.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.210
And I will show you where
all that is later.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.910
And we've also now, with that,
added in the ability for

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.710
Cursor and Selection
manipulation.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.460
So now, you can use your
Selection or your Cursor to

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.130
help define bibliography
sources.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.130
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.870
So the doc's open here.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.120
And the resolution's a little
bit off, it looks like.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.910
Normally your sidebar over here
won't take up a solid

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.990
third of your screen.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.270
But this just lets you manage
all the sources that you've

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.110
added in, and from there,
update, ultimately, your

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.490
bibliography.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.370
And then the Selection feature,
I think, that's been

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.610
added in is--

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.730
for example, if I highlight
this selection here and

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:44.530
realize, oh, I need to cite this
clause, I would then go

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.210
in and say, Add Inline
Citation, what

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.480
should pop up a menu.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.420
Yep, here it goes-- which will
allow me to pick one of the

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.660
sources that I've added in.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.200
So, clearly this is
from Donald Knuth.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.700
And I cited--

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.750
And then you know, there are a
couple other options in here

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.280
for a specific bibliography
things.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.060
Oh, can I not reach
the bottom?

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.050
ERIC KOLEDA: [INAUDIBLE]
there's resolution.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.906
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.940
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Again, this
one happened on pretty

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.082
much any normal resolution.

00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:16.450
ERIC KOLEDA: That's something we
should look into for sure.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.172
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Yeah, totally.

00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:22.310
But, in any event, if I could
get down there I would then--

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.095
maybe if I drag this
up a little bit.

00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:26.790
ERIC KOLEDA: Getting into
dangerous territory now.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.120
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.280
ERIC KOLEDA: I think you
get the point there.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.230
Basically, he's using
that selection, and

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.630
then right in place--

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.470
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Exactly.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.754
ERIC KOLEDA: [INAUDIBLE] the
appropriate citation.

00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:38.830
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
I hit enter?

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.950
No, that just closed it out.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.299
ERIC KOLEDA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.080
So I think this is--

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.000
people have been really
wanting to

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.630
play around with this.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.580
And now that the source code's
out there, you can do that.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.370
And when we showed it at I/O,
it didn't have the Selection

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.030
capability.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.340
But I think that's something
that really makes it that much

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.405
more useful, to really quickly
just drag some text

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:58.190
and say, cite this.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.500
I'm sure in school this would
be extremely useful.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.790
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Absolutely.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.340
Yeah.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.010
Like, this is something we've
been brainstorming samples

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.740
that I could write.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.090
And this is actually one of
the things that came up.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.710
And I was thinking, what can
you do with the sidebar at

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.660
Google Docs?

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.020
Oh, totally like, a reference
or a citation manager is

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.940
something that I know
I would absolutely

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.270
want writing papers.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.550
And a lot of my friends at
school would absolutely be

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.480
interested in this as well.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:20.890
So.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.300
ERIC KOLEDA: Very cool.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.940
And so then the third example
that we have here--

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.290
this one is a little bit more a
tool for you as a developer,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.170
and less so something that you
would use in the wild.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.090
So it's called Cursor
Inspector.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.440
What essentially it does is it
gives you a sidebar that

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.420
allows you to get live updating
information about

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.260
what the current state of your
Cursor and Selection is.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.730
So it's actually pretty
challenging to represent a

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.400
Cursor and a Selection in a
document model, like the one

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.240
that we have in Google Docs
and in the document app.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.030
So we put a lot of time and
effort into making it clear.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.790
But we still think it'd be
helpful to have this tool to

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.390
give you a little bit more
information about, when you do

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.920
make a Selection, what are you
expecting to get back?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.200
And when you placed your Cursor
somewhere, what do you

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.770
expect to see?

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.410
And so, it's basically just a
simple tool where you can go

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.520
take this doc, throw in some
images, throw in some

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.710
drawings, throw in table
of contents.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.890
And just move your Cursor
around the screen.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.820
Kind of see how the
data changes.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.910
Select some things, see
how the data changes.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.020
And that will help, we hope,
guide your development efforts

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.996
when you use this feature
in your own products.

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:27.640
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: So again,
here's that doc.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.190
And you see, we've got the
Sidebar open on the side.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.820
That's popped up from this menu
here, where you just hit

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.550
Show Sidebar, and then
that comes up.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.040
And then, so right now
I'll just click here.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.180
Right now, this is
a Cursor, right?

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.920
I don't have anything
selected.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.670
So you see the offset from the
beginning of the paragraph

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.880
that we're in and what
type of element

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.210
we're looking at there.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.910
And then, if I go ahead and
highlight this whole block

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.520
here, we move down
to the selection.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.790
And we see the type of element
that the selection is in,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:01.870
whether or not it's partial.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.820
I have selected the full
paragraph here by doing that

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.310
double click.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.890
So you see that partial
is set to false.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.370
And then indices on where
that selection

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.670
happens, if it is partial.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.480
So with this partial selection,
you see the start

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.160
and ending indices within
the paragraph.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.060
ERIC KOLEDA: So, a simple little
tool, but it kind of

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.080
hopefully get you up
and running sooner

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.390
with Cursor and Selection.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.075
We'll probably do another GDL
someday that goes deeper into

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:29.730
Cursors and Selections.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.830
But for now, I think that's a
great way to get started.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.160
Check out the blog posts.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.460
Start playing around with
some of these samples.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.390
Go from there.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.050
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Totally.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.950
And in addition to that, you
can actually grab all the

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.930
source code.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.650
Of course, you can go into the
Script Editor here, and pop

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.890
open the source code and modify
it within the doc.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.310
But we also have this
all up on GitHub.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.550
And that link is, again,
in the blog post.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.860
And that's here.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.140
So I had the Cursor Inspector
open in particular.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.660
ERIC KOLEDA: It's also
Bibstro, as well.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.120
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yep.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.940
So Bibstro and the Cursor
Inspector are here, in GitHub

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.590
with a little bit of ReadMe.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.225
And you can grab all that
code from here too.

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:11.510
ERIC KOLEDA: So we're just
trying to make more of the

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.730
sample code available and
in a place where you

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.330
can always find it.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.920
Sometimes, we'll publish this
doc, and you can grab the code

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.260
from there.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.390
But maybe you'll lose
track of that.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.000
So hopefully we're planning to
add even more samples as we

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.880
build them into this Google
Apps Script samples

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.110
repository.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.320
And so, keep an eye on that.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.990
You may want to bookmark
it for the future.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.050
All right, great.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.860
That is a little section on
Cursor and Selection.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.650
Just to comb through some other
news you may have missed

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.440
since our last Google
Apps Unscripted.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.400
A bunch of other recent blog
posts that we put out-- one is

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.360
that there's a new version
of Flubarru out.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.090
Flubarru is the--

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.330
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Super cool.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.850
ERIC KOLEDA: Super cool and
hilariously named script.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.400
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Where'd
the name come from?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.550
ERIC KOLEDA: I have no
idea what that means.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.270
I'll have to ask somebody.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.330
But it's a very popular Apps
Script that teachers have been

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.020
using to do grading,
via forms.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.990
And Dave--

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.030
he's actually a Googler who does
this just on the side.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.170
It's not his main job.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.310
He just loves Apps Script and
helping out teachers.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.820
He put out a brand new version
that has new features

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.120
involved, some new features
that he listed there.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.602
And we think teachers are
really going to love it.

00:13:14.602 --> 00:13:16.380
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Yeah, I think--

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:22.310
so as well, I'm a student but
I've been a TA as well.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.290
And grading is one of the, in
fact the most frustrating part

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.330
of that job.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
So I can only imagine that as a
teacher it's quite similar.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.630
I don't think anyone really
wants to grade.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.320
So anything that makes that
process easier can only be a

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:36.760
good thing.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.630
Especially I guess now that
it's at version three and

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.346
pretty polished all that.

00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:43.006
ERIC KOLEDA: It's
pretty exciting.

00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:44.820
And cool.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.760
We've had two other blog posts
recently, kind of highlighting

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.350
what some people are doing
with Apps Script.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.030
So one here, a domain
administrator, who was tired

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:56.820
of creating groups within his
Google Apps domain for people

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.330
who wanted them.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.210
And so rather than just keep
fielding emails from requests

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.670
from people, he actually made
a system using Apps Script

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.500
that allows users themselves
to basically

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.690
apply labels to threads.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.310
And then he'll automatically
find those threads and create

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.930
a new domain group with all
the people in that thread.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.360
So it's kind of a really simple
way where it's like,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.970
you started a conversation
with a bunch of people.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:20.730
You're like, you know what?

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.710
We're constantly adding
these same five people

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.430
to this same place.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.830
Let's just create a group.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.330
So it kind of takes the admin
out of the picture.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:26.830
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: That's
pretty cool.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.750
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.170
And so that's one thing.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.150
And then the other one down
there is Shipping Tracking.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.850
So, someone who runs a small
jewelry business, I believe,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.610
and needs to keep track
of all the shipments.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.700
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.190
And that's cool.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.820
Like, I would consider setting
up something like this for my

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.430
Amazon orders, let alone
my [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.870
It's way cool.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:51.780
So I think what he did was he
basically looked in his Gmail

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.340
inbox for these particular
shipping emails, pushed those

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.420
out to a package tracking
service.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.260
And from that site he was able
to basically just see where

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.320
all the packages where.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.990
The tricky part was getting the
tracking info from those

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.910
emails to the shipping
service.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.050
And with just a quick little
Google Apps Script, he was

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.930
able to make that happen, with,
it looks like, very

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.250
little code.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.130
ERIC KOLEDA: It's the kind of
thing, he was not using Apps

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.090
Script as a language to do
complex geo-spatial tracking.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.070
But it's a really great
integration platform.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.350
There's an existing service that
allows you to get this

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.910
tracking information.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.580
So all he needed to do was pull
it out of one place and

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.710
put it into another place.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.200
And sometimes Apps Script
is that perfect glue to

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.500
get that job done.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.000
So do check out our blog
from time to time.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.482
We have some great posts there,
hopefully things that

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.870
can inspire you about what you
can do with Apps Script, as

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.970
well as news about new features
that come out.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.800
So something else that I wanted
to touch on was, we

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.990
just launched a feature
recently.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.370
And we did a whole GDL episode
on it that you may have

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.530
missed, on importing and
exporting Google Apps Scripts.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.490
So the Drive SDK is a separate
API that allows you to access

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.770
files from your drive.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.930
And it has the ability to
download from your drive,

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.920
upload data to your
drive, et cetera.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.040
Well, we recently enhanced it
to provide the ability to do

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.855
import and export of your Google
Apps Script as well.

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:19.935
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Is that here?

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:21.120
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.840
So if you go to our videos
section, you can see right at

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.910
the top there is Apps
Script Crash Course

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.820
on Import and Export.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.990
But if you want to see the
documentation itself, just go

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.270
back to our site.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.600
And then it's under the
Development Environment.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.880
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Ah, there it is.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.110
ERIC KOLEDA: And then in there
we have a link for Importing

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.500
and Exporting Projects.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.760
So, Arun, one of our colleagues,
put together a

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.610
whole bunch of great
documentation.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.270
And he's going to add even
more samples, hopefully,

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.570
showing you essentially how you
can use the Drive SDK to

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.520
do this kind of Import
and Export

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.620
of Apps Script project's.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.870
It's a little bit more
complicated, because you're

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.735
now writing code against
a different API.

00:16:56.735 --> 00:16:58.930
And you're doing it on your
own local machines.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.925
So if you're just used to
writing Apps Script code, this

00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:01.880
is going to be a little
bit different.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.920
You may have to use Python
or Java or Ruby.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.900
You can use a lot different
languages with the Drive SDK,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.810
setting up an environment,
a server.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.260
It could be a bit more
complicated.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.550
But that said, we think it
really opens up a lot of cool

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.119
doors for people who want to,
maybe, edit their code

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.609
offline, or download it, so that
they can check it into a

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:19.960
version control system.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.900
There's a lot of different
possibilities here.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.050
And we're excited to see
what people build.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.910
And actually, I think just
today, I saw that one of our

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.100
users on one of the Google
Apps Script Google+

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.580
communities actually built an
Apps Script library for

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.430
importing and exporting
Apps Script code.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.440
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Oh, awesome.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.410
That's funny.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.160
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, it's
very "Inception."

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.610
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Yeah, meta.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.130
ERIC KOLEDA: So, you can
now use Apps Script

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.590
to export Apps Script.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.430
Pretty crazy stuff.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.340
So, we hope that you check out
the GDL, where they go into a

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.092
lot more detail about how this
all works, or just check out

00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:55.700
the documentation.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.140
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah, it
looks like it's pretty

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.230
thorough here and pretty good.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.700
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh cool.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.180
And then other GDL that we did
recently was one about the

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.460
Script Editor, kind of
like tips and tricks.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.750
So when you write Apps
Script code,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.830
it's all in your browser.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.160
And we have an online editor.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.130
And there's a little features
in there that you might not

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.320
know about--

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.470
some keyboard shortcuts, some
sort of advanced features.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.540
So go to our Google Developers
Live page or the YouTube

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.850
channel there, on the bottom.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.620
And you can find that
episode as well.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.840
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah, you
want to catch up on the older

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.580
episodes here.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.910
And I thought that was a super
cool one, because I just love

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.070
keyboard shortcuts and just kind
of being on the keyboard.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.640
And actually in terms of
importing and exporting

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.690
scripts, I would love to see
a VIM extension too, just

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.350
keeping in with the whole
keyboard thing.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.550
Yeah, that one--

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:50.450
I learned a ton from that about
the Apps Script IDE, and

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.990
just ways to improve your
workflow and move a little bit

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.080
more quickly through the code
that you're writing.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.760
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, definitely.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.310
I mean, we all have other
things to do.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.680
So squeezing out a little bit
more time certainly helps.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.390
Very cool.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.500
And so then lastly, before we
jump into questions, I just

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.900
want to take a little quick
pass through our Release

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.970
Notes, to kind of catch up on
some important items you may

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.440
have missed.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.390
So, for big announcements like
brand new features, Cursor and

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.540
Selection, we'll post
those on the blog.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.960
But we're constantly, on
a week by week basis,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.250
introducing fixes to bugs,
or small new features.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.550
And our Release Notes page is
where you can find out, kind

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.120
of like, what's changed.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.380
It's linked off the bottom
of our home page, again.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.680
And it's a great thing to check
on from time to time to

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.630
see if there's something new you
could take advantage of.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.390
Or maybe a bug that was holding
up has now been fixed.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.340
So the list is long.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.020
We've done quite a number of
things since our last episode.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.490
But just to highlight a few of
them, one of the ones that I

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.720
know people were asking for was
Commenter abilities in the

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.300
Drive Service, specifically
around Google Docs.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.770
So, the Google Docs model allows
you to be a Viewer, an

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.325
Editor, an Owner, but
also a Commenter.

00:19:57.325 --> 00:20:00.880
You can view it, but you
can also add comments.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.520
And it's kind of somewhere in
between View and Edit access.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.530
And we didn't have that ability
to add that via the

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.300
Apps Script code.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.900
You could only do
it via the UI.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.940
But now we can do if via
Apps Script too.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.480
I think that's pretty cool.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.650
Yeah, for setting up scripts,
or maybe you want to take a

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.910
document you have, and email it
out to a list and say, hey

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.100
guys, can you review?

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.270
You want to automatically
give all those

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.590
reviewers Commenter access.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.820
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Right, you
can totally put a script

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.250
together for a list of
Reviewers, pushing that out.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.920
They become Commenters,
that kind of thing.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.700
ERIC KOLEDA: I think that
would be pretty cool.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.690
And then one of the things that
has been on our plate for

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.620
a long time now--

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.170
we finally got to it --was
making it so that when you

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.020
send email via Gmail app, the
emails you send appear in your

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.950
Sent folder.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.780
So a lot of people, they
were using Apps

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.100
Script to send out emails.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.370
But then they were kind
of never really clear.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.350
Was it sent?

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.140
What did the texts actually
say in the end?

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.530
Who were the actual
recipients?

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.036
You could do some logging, but
it'd just be better that, if

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:53.770
an email came from your account,
you can see it in

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.260
your sent folder.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.680
When that person replied, it
would be threaded nicely.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.345
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Right.

00:20:57.345 --> 00:20:58.430
ERIC KOLEDA: So that
was something that

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.080
people really wanted.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.690
And we just recently
added that in.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.370
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Were you
able to see it in your Gmail

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.480
previously, or was
it just not--

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.521
ERIC KOLEDA: Just
not even there.

00:21:05.521 --> 00:21:08.040
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: And if
someone replied, would it then

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.070
pop back into your inbox?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.520
ERIC KOLEDA: I believe it just
was as if-- like, you'd see it

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.050
as if you had never
gotten the email.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:13.720
And so you'd have it like--

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.510
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
A new thing.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.920
ERIC KOLEDA: --bracketed
in at the bottom.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.220
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Well, that's
cool that it's now in

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.015
the great Gmail UI
and all that.

00:21:21.015 --> 00:21:23.400
ERIC KOLEDA: So those are
some cool things.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.660
Likewise, if we keep going down
a little bit into June, I

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.210
think some of those ones--

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.980
yeah, just some small changes
to the way some things work.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.810
But I think in the June 3, there
was one where I wanted

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.490
to highlight.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.250
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Sure.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.710
ERIC KOLEDA: And the
first one there.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.280
When you would run a script
previously, it would say,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.270
"running script", and then
the name of the script.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.510
And then it would say, "script
finished." And sometimes what

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.370
that was doing was taking, kind
of like, the internal

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.540
names in your code and showing
them to the people that were

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.790
running your script,
which maybe

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.620
weren't always the coders.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.880
And it just gets a
little confusing.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.150
So we've now, just for
simplicity's sake, remove that

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.360
little piece of text--
the function name--

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.480
from that little notification
that comes

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.620
when you start a script.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.070
Just so it says, "I'm running
a script," and "I'm done

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.490
running a script."

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:08.670
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Right.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.980
And I can imagine that'll make
the lives of people using

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.060
scripts a little bit easier.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.680
ERIC KOLEDA: It's a little
less confusing, like I'm

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.990
running what now?

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.260
So do feel free to poke around
the Release Notes and go into

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.120
more detail.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.250
It's a great way to stay
up to date on all

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.751
these little changes.

00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:27.890
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Very cool.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.006
And there's a lot of them.

00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:31.860
ERIC KOLEDA: Gotcha.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.230
All right.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.930
So let's just keep going.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.170
So let's get into the question
and answer now.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.980
So, I don't know if we have
anybody live on the Hangout.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.500
Let's check in.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.030
Hello on the Hangout.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.280
Any questions?

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.740
I'm not hearing anything.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.500
All right.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.200
Well, so, feel free
to hang around.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.300
If you have a question,
chime in.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.795
And we'll feel free
to get to it.

00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:08.246
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: We've got
a couple in the Moderator.

00:23:08.246 --> 00:23:10.090
ERIC KOLEDA: So let's go.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.970
So we do have some questions on
the Google Moderator that

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.140
we had set up earlier.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.190
So let's take a look at those.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.630
So we have here--

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.300
let's start from the top.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.240
Any news about improvements
in the Apps Script IDE?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.470
Any plans for a plug-in with
Intellij or Eclipse?

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.060
Well, as we just mentioned, we
did do a whole show about the

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.600
Apps Script IDE.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.440
So maybe there's an improvement
that you didn't

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.470
even know about--

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.300
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Exactly.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:34.800
ERIC KOLEDA: And it's been
sitting there the whole time.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.040
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.245
Those keyboard shortcuts,
let me tell you.

00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:37.985
They're great.

00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:40.130
ERIC KOLEDA: And I think the
other thing is that we don't

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.010
have any immediate
plans to launch

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.670
plug-ins for our editors.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.750
But with the ability to use the
Drive SDK to do import and

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.730
export, there's nothing stopping
and enterprising

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:56.400
person, developer, to build
their own integration with

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.950
their favorites.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.440
So you say you're interested
in VIM--

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.720
that could be a week-end project
for you to spin up a

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.200
VIM plug-in.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.730
So I think, if there are IDs
that people really love and

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.590
would love to do Apps
Script coding, I

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.720
would say, it's a start.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.790
But just see if you can self
organize, like, check out the

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.010
Google+ community, see if you
get some other people maybe to

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.870
contribute, and then
go from there.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.840
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
Yeah, I know.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.500
I would love to see those.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.710
I just think those plug-ins
would be really cool.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.450
And being able to edit
offline like that

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.590
would be a cool thing.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.060
Again, that being said, I think
the Apps Script IDE is

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.080
very solid, with the
auto-completion that's there,

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.440
it's a really great way to
write Apps Script code.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.170
Because you don't have to
worry too much about

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.380
referencing back for a specific
library, you can just

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.590
his Control Space and find the
function you're sort of

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.990
looking for right.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.930
ERIC KOLEDA: I think that's one
of the issues that, if you

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.570
do go out and build one of these
plug-ins, you're going

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.620
to find that--

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.430
how are you going to
do auto-complete?

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.070
Right?

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.930
And then, how are you going
to run your code?

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.840
The code runs all
on the cloud.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.150
You can't really
run it locally.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.320
So, I think although having
offline Edit access actually

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.720
be useful in a lot of scenarios,
it's probably not

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.190
going to be as a rich or a
complete experience as using

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.162
the online IDE.

00:25:07.162 --> 00:25:07.580
All right.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.120
Great.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.350
So next up, can I edit the
navigation bar from a Google

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.490
site using Apps Script?

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.470
So the answer I think is,
unfortunately, no today.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.360
The navigation bar--

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.540
I guess it depends on
what that means.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.310
At least most of the Google
Sites I've used, the pages in

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.640
your site are just automatically
reflected on the

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.880
left-hand side bar.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.220
So you could add a new page or
move a page around, I believe

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.580
via the Sites app, which would
then influence the left bar.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.790
But if you're talking about a
bar at the top, or the menu

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.170
bar when you're doing editing,
unfortunately that today

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.620
cannot be manipulated
via the Sites app.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.170
For instance, you can add
a new menu to the

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.860
Google Docs menu bar.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.810
But you can't do it on the
menu bar in Google Sites.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.970
So, I guess if I didn't answer
your question, you can follow

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.750
up with us offline.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.012
Maybe just reach out to me on
Google+, and I can give you

00:26:01.012 --> 00:26:02.128
some more information.

00:26:02.128 --> 00:26:02.576
OK?

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:03.472
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah.

00:26:03.472 --> 00:26:04.370
ERIC KOLEDA: Great.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.100
So next up, can I edit and
create a forum on the fly with

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.930
Apps Script?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.840
Well, yes you can, is
the short answer.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:19.750
So this was actually the subject
of my talk at Google

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.940
I/O this year.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.270
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah,
I watched that one.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.762
That was really cool.

00:26:22.762 --> 00:26:26.470
ERIC KOLEDA: And so that was
the ability to do Google

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.190
Forms, manipulation
via the Forms app.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.300
So it's a whole new service in
Google Apps Script that allows

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.320
you to not just manipulate or
read the contents of a Form,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.680
but actually even create
new Forms on the fly.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.720
So one of the things I demoed
was the ability to use a

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.240
Google Form to create
a Google Form.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.210
So, I would fill out one Form.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.280
And then when I filled it out,
an Apps Script would run that

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.250
would trigger and create a brand
new Form and then send

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.990
that out again.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.500
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
It was for quiz

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.500
generation, is that right?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.090
ERIC KOLEDA: It was, yeah.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.700
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: You could
specify your quiz questions.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.060
And then it would spit out
the next quiz as a

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.015
Google Form, right?

00:26:59.015 --> 00:27:01.420
ERIC KOLEDA: So, I think
Flubarru is probably a bit

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.190
more robust and made
for longer quizzes.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.590
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Right.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.040
ERIC KOLEDA: The one here that
I was focusing on was

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.190
something where, you just
taught a subject.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.820
You know, I'd really love
to know if kids got it.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.140
You just type one quick
question, hit Send.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.220
It goes to the whole class.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.360
They fill out the answer.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.440
You get all the responses.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.540
It's a five minute process.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.710
And so, it was using Forms
to create Forms.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.204
So it's definitely possible to
create Forms with Apps Script.

00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:23.410
And we think it actually
can lead to

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.140
some really cool things.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.880
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah, and
it sounds like definitely on

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.120
the fly, if you can get it
running that quickly.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.550
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, great.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.500
And the other one here
we have is--

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.530
oh, we already answered
that one about the ID.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.430
All right, great.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.320
So, let's check back in
on the Hangout, and

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.710
see if anybody there.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.570
No one's there.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:43.220
All right.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.950
Well, that's all the questions
we have here on the Moderator.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:52.000
I'm just going to check
Google+ as well.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.550
And let's see if we have any
comments here that are

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.570
interesting.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.560
It looks like we did have
some problems with

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.370
the Livestream today.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.990
So we apologize for that, if you
were watching live, or you

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.110
didn't get a chance to.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.130
I'm sorry about that.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.620
So we will post this
recording .

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.330
And if you're hearing me
say this, you were

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.000
watching the recording.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.760
So, I don't see any
other comments.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.400
An how about Christian?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.985
Do you have anything else to
add, you'd like to say, before

00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:20.200
we say goodbye?

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.760
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
No, not really.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.890
I think, yeah, I mean, it's
just, as someone who's really

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.220
come into Apps Script
for the first time,

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.200
it's been very cool.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.770
Over the past, I guess, month
or so, it's been very cool

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.600
learning all the different
features and hearing things.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.990
Yeah, feedback from the--

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.080
it's very easy for me to ask
questions, because I've got

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.230
Eric here and the rest of the
team sitting across from me.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.420
But, I know I've had
a ton of questions.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.160
And I think, getting involved,
reaching out when you're a bit

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.090
confused is definitely
a good thing to do.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.360
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.216
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Having
been there myself.

00:28:54.216 --> 00:28:58.230
ERIC KOLEDA: So if you do have
questions, coming to these

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.450
Apps Unscripted is a great
way to get them answered.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.930
But we only do them about
once a month.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.940
So, in the meantime, we have a
support page on our website

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.870
you can check out.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.680
And we basically say, if you're
asking a very technical

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.610
question, a detailed question,
we have a Stack Overflow tag,

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.910
where a lot of people go there
and ask questions and have

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.220
some really great answers.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.780
So recommend using
Stack Overflow.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.200
And if you have a broad
question, you just want to

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.290
know, generally, can
I do something?

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.070
Generally, what's the best
way to do something?

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.350
We recommend maybe looking at
some Google+ communities that

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.680
are out there for Google Apps
Script, where there are some

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.040
really dedicated passionate
users who have a lot of good

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.060
experience as well.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.770
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI: Yeah, like
the education one seems pretty

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.670
active and very cool.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.000
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.050
A whole community just on Apps
Script for education.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.850
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
That's awesome.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:40.515
ERIC KOLEDA: Great.

00:29:40.515 --> 00:29:42.830
Well, with that, I think we're
going to wrap it up for today.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.850
Thanks everybody who tuned in,
or failed to tune in but is

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:46.960
watching it now.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.010
And we'll hopefully work
out all the kinks

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.180
for our next episode.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.300
Once again, my name's Eric.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.190
CHRISTIAN MOSCARDI:
And I'm Christian.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.990
ERIC KOLEDA: And we'll
see you next time.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.590
Bye.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:30:30.173
