00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:12.010
Language is an essential part of our lives
that we often take for granted.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.389
With it, we can communicate our thoughts
and feelings,

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.370
lose ourselves in novels,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.938
send text messages,

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.124
and greet friends.

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:25.468
It's hard to imagine being unable
to turn thoughts into words.

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.304
But if the delicate web of language
networks in your brain

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:33.556
became disrupted by stroke,
illness, or trauma,

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:37.484
you could find yourself truly
at a loss for words.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:43.505
This disorder, called aphasia,
can impair all aspects of communication.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:47.035
People who have aphasia remain
as intelligent as ever.

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.985
They know what they want to say,

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.246
but can't always get their words
to come out correctly.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:56.559
They may unintentionally use
substitutions called paraphasias,

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.684
switching related words,
like saying "dog" for "cat,"

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:06.055
or words that sound similar,
such as "house" for "horse."

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.254
Sometimes, their words may even be
unrecognizable.

00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:13.995
There are several types of aphasia
grouped into two categories:

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:16.325
fluent, or receptive, aphasia

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.966
and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.776
People with fluent aphasia may have
normal vocal inflection

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:26.457
but use words that lack meaning.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:29.526
They have difficulty comprehending
the speech of others

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:33.535
and are frequently unable to recognize
their own speech errors.

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:36.305
People with non-fluent aphasia,
on the other hand,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.206
may have good comprehension

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:43.367
but will experience long hesitations
between words and make grammatical errors.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.607
We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling
from time to time

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.488
when we can't think of a word,

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:52.818
but having aphasia can make it hard
to name simple, everyday objects.

00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:56.518
Even reading and writing can be difficult
and frustrating.

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:59.308
So how does this language loss happen?

00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:01.807
The human brain has two hemispheres.

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:05.567
In most people, the left hemisphere
governs language.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:07.978
We know this because in 1861,

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:10.677
the physician Paul Broca studied a patient

00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:15.506
who lost the ability to use all 
but a single word, "tan."

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:17.998
During a postmortem study
of that patient's brain,

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:21.338
Broca discovered a large lesion
in the left hemisphere

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:23.727
now known as Broca's area.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:28.158
Scientists today believe that Broca's area
is responsible in part for naming objects

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:31.078
and coordinating the muscles
involved in speech.

00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:35.878
Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area
near the auditory cortex.

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:39.008
That's where the brain attaches
meaning to speech sounds.

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:43.338
Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the
brain's ability to comprehend language.

00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:48.489
Aphasia is caused by injury to one or
both of these specialized language areas.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.829
Fortunately, there are other areas
of the brain

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.779
which support these language centers

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.218
and can assist with communication.

00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:59.078
Even brain areas that control movement
are connected to language.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:04.478
FMRI studies found that when we hear
action words, like "run" or "dance,"

00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:07.600
parts of the brain responsible
for movement light up

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.969
as if the body was actually running
or dancing.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.929
Our other hemisphere contributes
to language, too,

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.369
enhancing the rhythm and intonation
of our speech.

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:21.099
These non-language areas sometimes
assist people with aphasia

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.469
when communication is difficult.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.668
So how common is aphasia?

00:03:25.668 --> 00:03:28.913
Approximately 1 million people
in the U.S. alone have it,

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:32.530
with an estimated 80,000 new cases
per year.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.669
About one-third of stroke survivors
suffer from aphasia

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.260
making it more prevalent 
than Parkinson's disease

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.180
or multiple sclerosis,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.469
yet less widely known.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.880
There is one rare form of aphasia called
primary progressive aphasia, or PPA,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.771
which is not caused by stroke
or brain injury,

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.209
but is actually a form of dementia

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.061
in which language loss 
is the first symptom.

00:03:56.061 --> 00:04:01.232
The goal in treating PPA is to maintain
language function for as long as possible

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:04.560
before other symptoms of dementia
eventually occur.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.330
However, when aphasia is acquired
from a stroke or brain trauma,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.041
language improvement may be achieved
through speech therapy.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.911
Our brain's ability to repair itself,
known as brain plasticity,

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.480
permits areas surrounding
a brain lesion

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.994
to take over some functions during
the recovery process.

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:26.405
Scientists have been conducting
experiments using new forms of technology,

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:31.340
which they believe may encourage brain
plasticity in people with aphasia.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.254
Meanwhile, many people with aphasia
remain isolated,

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:39.941
afraid that others won't understand
them or give them extra time to speak.

00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.311
By offering them the time and flexibility
to communicate in whatever way they can,

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:47.105
you can help open the door 
to language again,

00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:50.034
moving beyond the limitations of aphasia.
