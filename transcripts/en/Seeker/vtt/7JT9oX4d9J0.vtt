00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.360
Hydrothermal vents are kind of like going
to another planet.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.820
It's hot, and acidic, and there's big black
plumes of chimneys coming out

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.040
of the bottom of the ocean,
that can be up to 50 meters tall.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.300
They're essentially underwater volcanoes.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.480
They can be beautiful and sparkly, or they
can just look like melting old styrofoam.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.260
They're usually covered with these amazing, huge, beautiful animals

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.820
that are just... nothing like you've ever seen before.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.020
In the deep sea, photosynthesis is impossible.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.600
Instead, this alien food chain is built off
of chemosynthesis, where microbes metabolize

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.480
harsh chemicals, and in turn are fed on, or
used by, larger animals.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.500
Because there is no sunlight, everything is
reliant on the chemicals

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.040
coming out of the bottom of the ocean, and chemosynthetic bacteria.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.480
Either the animals all graze the bacteria
or they live symbiotically with the bacteria.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.940
The bacteria break down the chemicals and
then feed the animals.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440
The model is probably similar to the origins
of life.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
It is nearly impossible to locate and investigate
hydrothermal vents,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
because they occur so deep in the ocean,
and emit an acidic soup of chemicals

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.940
that would be toxic to a diver.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.640
So instead, Shannon and her team at Monterey
Bay Aquarium Research Institute

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.560
first send an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, 
called an AUV.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.180
It really does look like what James Bond had
as a torpedo, but it's just a really cool

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.000
piece of scientific equipment that does all
the hard work for us.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.300
We send the fleet of AUVs out to map the bottom
first, and then that gives us

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
a really good, high-resolution picture 
of the bottom of the ocean.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.060
Then, it’s time to use the ROVs, or Remotely
Operated Vehicles, to collect data on water chemistry,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.100
temperature, and to bring back
specimens.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.860
When you collect the animals, they're changing chemistry, temperature, light, everything.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.180
Their proteins are pretty much unfolding,
and they're pretty unhappy by the time we see them.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.540
We have what we call Bio Box: basically a
closing box so that when you collect the animals,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.760
you can put them in kind of their environment
and bring them back to the surface.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.800
Once the specimens make it back to the lab,
Shannon uses advanced techniques to sequence

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.600
their genomes and identify them, which is
not always possible with the naked eye.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.020
There's a lot of "cryptic speciation" 
in the deep sea:

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.720
things will look very similar, and they'll
be wildly different species,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.180
or things can look very different, and it turns out it's
just a different life stage.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.680
When Shannon and her team have identified
the animals, which often turn out to be

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.780
species brand new to science, they compare 
the different vent sites

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.300
to determine whether these organisms 
are traveling between vents,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.860
or stay isolated in one place.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.640
A hydrothermal vent is a really great place
to study population genetics because

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.620
it's essentially a giant island of food in the
ocean; the next island of food

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.840
could be hundreds of kilometers away.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.820
And so we try to use the genetics of animals to
understand how those two islands are connected.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.600
Understanding how these different sites are connected helps paint a broad picture of evolution in action.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.700
When vents were first discovered, we thought
that these were the living relics, the living fossils

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.480
that started life on Earth, because
of chemosynthesis.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.860
Using genetics, we now know that most of the animals are relatively young,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.860
much younger than the shallow water species.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.430
The theory is still right; the model is
probably similar to the origins of life.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.800
In fact, NASA has a really cool program to
look at life on other planets,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.140
and how chemosynthesis could help that evolve.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.900
Recently, astronomers have been intrigued
by Saturn’s harsh and icy moon, Enceladus,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.720
and hypothesized, aided by NASA’s Cassini,
that it may actually be home

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.180
to hydrothermal vents of its own.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.440
After recent experiments in Austria and Germany,
scientists now believe that the life from

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.190
these hydrothermal vents on Earth could actually
survive and thrive on Enceladus.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.040
But understanding how these mysterious ecosystems
work is a race against time.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.260
Hydrothermal vents are sensitive to deep-sea
mining, and often are in international waters,

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.460
making them difficult to protect.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.400
They're also sensitive to oxygen levels.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.160
The deep sea is probably more sensitive to
the extinctions that killed off the dinosaurs, for example,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.840
because the oxygen levels dropped
throughout the world and throughout the world ocean.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.720
When we first started working on this, we
thought, "Oh, these things are going to be

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.150
the poster child for what animals can evolve to
and survive in climate change."

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.630
But it turns out the minute the oxygen levels
dip just a little bit, everything dies.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.740
Despite their hardcore reputation, extremophiles
may not be as resilient as we thought—

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.780
something to keep in mind as we continue to explore
other planets… and our own.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.790
We're very, very privileged to be able to
visit these environments.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.320
We've only scratched the surface of
exploring these vents.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.600
More often than not, we'll find new species,
new discoveries, new vent sites that are amazing,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.760
and nothing we could've planned for.
