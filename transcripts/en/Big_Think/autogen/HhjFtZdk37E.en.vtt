the two main main parts of what we do

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469
the two main main parts of what we do
 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.649
the two main main parts of what we do
one of which is building a better and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
one of which is building a better and
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999
one of which is building a better and
better transistor that's called the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
better transistor that's called the
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830
better transistor that's called the
process and one of which is they're

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
process and one of which is they're
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330
process and one of which is they're
putting those transistors together in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
putting those transistors together in
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.919

major areas you know we've we have

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499
major areas you know we've we have
 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.620
major areas you know we've we have
invested through every recession we've

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
invested through every recession we've
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.169
invested through every recession we've
invested we will continue to invest

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
invested we will continue to invest
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.820
invested we will continue to invest
through this economic crisis

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.740
 
well first of all I don't know what's

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
well first of all I don't know what's
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.180

well you know I can tell you a year from
 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.740
well you know I can tell you a year from
now how our business feared through the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
now how our business feared through the
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.760
now how our business feared through the
through 2009 we don't know today

fundamentally businesses are to meet the
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900
fundamentally businesses are to meet the
needs of consumers and whether that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
needs of consumers and whether that
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.640
needs of consumers and whether that
consumer be another business whether it

going to shrink along with that market
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.810
going to shrink along with that market
in the short term and then you have to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
in the short term and then you have to
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.790
in the short term and then you have to
make sure that you then use a full
