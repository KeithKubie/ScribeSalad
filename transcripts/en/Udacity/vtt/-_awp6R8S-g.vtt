Are you a proactive or a reactive job
seeker? Let's find out. My name is Martin

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.509
McGovern, with Udacity, and today we are going to be discussing the difference

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.480
between a proactive and a reactive job
search. Let's begin. On day 1 of a job

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
search, most people do the same thing.
They create accounts on all the major

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
job boards, turn on notifications, and
wait for the internet to do the work for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
them. On day 2, they begin receiving a
barrage of emails with recommendations

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.100
for jobs that may or may not fit their
experience and what they hope to work on.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.140
By day 3, their inbox is so cluttered
with notifications that they can't keep

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.920
up. And by the time they've sorted
through the mess, the job listing that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.050
they want is days, if not weeks old, and
they get lost in the competitive shuffle.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.030
This is a reactive job search, and if
you're doing it you're putting yourself

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.699
at a bit of a disadvantage. So let's take
a look at what a proactive job seeker

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.890
would do. Proactive job seekers start by
identifying the job title they wish they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.570
had, (Senior Developer, Content Marketer, etc.) The industry that they're most

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.119
interested in, (Transportation, Education,
etc.) and the companies in their local

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.640
market. With this list in hand they begin
targeting potential employers here's how.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.250
Number One. They learn everything that they can about the company and set up alerts

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
on Google, LinkedIn, etc. so they are
notified of any new jobs company

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.180
announcements or other news that may be going on, on a day-to-day basis. Number Two.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.869
They develop relationships with
people who work within their favorite

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.520
companies. They attend events, they go
join organizations, and they connect with

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560
people online via social networks. And
Number Three. They organize our search

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.759
and set reminders to keep in touch with
key contacts checking in periodically

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.030
and making sure they keep the
opportunity alive.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.979
It's easy to become reactive in your job
search and just let the emails come to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.479
you, but we need to know that this isn't
the most effective way, and if you really

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
want to take your job search to the next
level you have to take it into your own hands

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.240
and become proactive, and chase after the things that you want. Thank you so much

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.660
for watching. If you have any other
career questions that you'd like us to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.160
anyone who's searching for a job right
now tag them and let them know you're

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.480
thinking about them. We wish you the best of luck in your job search and will see

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.810
