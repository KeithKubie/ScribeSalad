00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.381
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:08.694
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.694 --> 00:00:11.800
SPEAKER 1: We're so excited to
have Wendy here from Austin.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.960
I think most of you know her.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.700
She has fought tirelessly,
first as a Texas state senator,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.880
and then in her
run for governor,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.460
for women's reproductive
rights, gender

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.472
equal pay, LGBTQ rights, justice
for sexual assault survivors.

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:32.619
Just has an incredible
track record.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.270
And I think you
probably also know her

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.410
for a somewhat historic
13-hour filibuster

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.420
in some pink sneakers.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.762
And most recently,
she has started

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:45.970
an advocacy group called
Deeds Not Words, which we're

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.600
going to talk about today,
that is all about channeling

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.090
energy and passion
for gender equality

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.230
into actionable change.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.020
So please welcome Wendy.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.390
WENDY DAVIS: Hello, everyone.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.982
SPEAKER 1: Why don't we
start with Deeds Not Words?

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.190
Tell us a little bit about
it and why you founded it.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.890
WENDY DAVIS: I started
Deeds Not Words--

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.980
it's a nonprofit organization--
about a year ago.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.680
Really, starting
from the perspective

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.460
of wanting to make sure
that we were giving the best

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
opportunity for that next
generation of young women

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.170
who are going to be the
filibusterers of the future

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.750
to find their way to that path.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.270
I travel and speak a lot.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.220
And I was frequently
asked a question

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.510
that I'm still asked a lot,
which is, what do we do?

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.070
And you see this incredible
knowledge and passion,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.380
but sometimes a
struggle about where

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.940
to connect that to action.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.700
And so Deeds Not Words
was born, really,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.840
with two big ideas in mind.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.030
One is to make sure that
we're putting together,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.840
in one place, an area
that you can go to,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.420
a hub, our digital
hub, and you can

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.980
find a variety of different
organizations and the work

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.080
that they're doing in the
gender equality world.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.374
And it's separated
by health, so things

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.540
that are happening in the
reproductive rights world,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.860
for example.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.610
Safety, which of course,
includes campus sexual assault,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.540
human trafficking, and sexual
assault criminal justice reform

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.250
work.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.220
Economic opportunity, which
includes a lot of organizations

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.620
that are working
on equality of pay,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.680
on affordable quality
child care, on increasing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.140
the minimum wage,
on family leave

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.600
policies, all of
those things that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.670
make such an important
difference in our ability

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.940
to equalize our economic
opportunity in this country.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.110
And then, leadership.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.870
There are so many
different organizations.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.440
You have one based right here
in California, Emerge, that

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.770
are really there for
women to make sure

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.160
that, where we have women who
are thinking about stepping

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.020
forward and running
for office, they

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.660
have the support around
them and the system that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.910
helps them to raise
money and to have

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.580
the resources and the knowledge
that they need to do that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.120
and to do it well.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.820
So that's what we do
in the digital space.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.870
We have a weekly
digital newsletter

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.880
called "The Deeds Digest."

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.220
And in that
newsletter, we inform.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.105
We try to inspire.

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:19.920
I hope we do, sometimes.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.560
And we end each "Deeds Digest"
with the do's of the week.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.990
And those do's always
tie in to the things

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.800
that we talked about in
that particular newsletter.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.570
And then we do a "Daily Deed."

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.860
We started doing that just a few
weeks ago, post-women's march,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.710
trying to make sure that, where
people were looking for a way

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.950
to plug in and some direction
and guidance in that regard,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.920
we do that.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.280
That's all the digital
part of what we do.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.550
The other piece of
it-- and certainly,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.570
this is how I found my way
into the political world--

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.770
is helping us to find
our power as advocates.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.900
It can be kind of hard to
navigate your way into that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.510
and to know exactly
how to do it.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.740
I think that Indivisible has
been such an important resource

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.950
in helping people to see how we
can use our voices in a very,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.080
very powerful way.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.060
And I love the structure
and the guidance

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.579
that they've put
together for that.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.290
We are doing tactical
trainings of advocacy work.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.240
So we started in Texas.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.520
We have our eye on
several other states

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.100
that we want to
expand into, but we're

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.450
working with both high school
and college-aged young women.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.860
And we're helping to
foster their voices

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.520
into the legislative process.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.310
So they're working
on two key issues

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.490
right now with a
number of legislators,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.560
from idea to how you write
a piece of legislation,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.750
to coming to committee
hearings and testifying for it.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.370
And how you present
yourself and how

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.340
to make a most
effective argument.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.580
And the areas that we're
really focusing on in that work

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.730
are sex trafficking of minors.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.720
And also, sexual assault reforms
in both the criminal justice

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.770
world, rape kit backlog, for
example, statute of limitations

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.620
issues, but also
campus sexual assault.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.910
And changing the landscape
of what our understanding is

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.210
about consent, how we define
that, how we define yes,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.620
rather than no means no.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.610
What does it mean to say yes?

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.370
So we're focused
on those things.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.415
And we find that
our young audience

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.130
is very interested
and passionate

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.690
about those particular issues.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.130
And so it's been
a really good way

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.611
to foster their advocacy skills.

00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:43.110
SPEAKER 1: What's been the most
surprising thing that you've

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.990
discovered since starting?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.590
WENDY DAVIS: I guess just the
challenge of taking an idea.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.820
I can do the political
thing pretty well.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.760
I know how to navigate
my way in that world.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.000
And that's a learning curve,
too, just like anything.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.910
But it's a learning
curve for me right now,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.050
how to take these ideas and
most effectively implement them.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.130
And just how hard it
is to be a startup.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.650
A startup nonprofit is
no different, really,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.020
than a startup profit
other than you,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.970
obviously, don't
need to make money.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.657
You need people to
donate money to you.

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:22.740
SPEAKER 1: The VCs are
maybe a little less excited

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.340
about the nonprofit
startup, right?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.840
WENDY DAVIS: I guess
that's so true.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.410
Yeah.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.150
But I think most surprising
is just how eager people are

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.170
to be connected
in ways that make

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.380
them feel like their voices
really make a difference.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.650
And they do make a difference.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.011
They truly do.

00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:42.760
SPEAKER 1: It sounds
like, from everything

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.176
you're talking
about, that to you,

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:45.815
the biggest way to
effect political--

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:48.190
to change the current political
landscape would be to get

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.570
more women out there, involved?

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.975
WENDY DAVIS: No question.

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:54.380
SPEAKER 1: What else?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.240
Obviously, you need to have
your focus on, say, advocacy.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.501
What other areas do
you think could be

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.750
making a difference right now?

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.230
I'm sure there are a lot
of people in this room

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.132
and on the livestream
that want to know how

00:07:05.132 --> 00:07:06.340
they could get more involved.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.710
What do you think is
the most effective?

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.440
WENDY DAVIS: You and I had a
great conversation a moment ago

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.640
before we came up here.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.750
And I thought you actually
characterized and crystallized

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.580
this perfectly.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.650
What you were saying was that we
have to pick those two or three

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.930
things that we are really going
to care about and dive into.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.020
And try to avoid the
temptation, because there's

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.540
so much going on right now, to
weigh in on every little space.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.300
So whatever that area
of passion is for you,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.980
whether it's the environment, or
LGBTQ equality, or transgender

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.110
rights, in specific,
or women's equality,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.190
and all of the different
realms of that,

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.250
find the place that
really connects to you

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.450
or that you connect to.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.580
Because what you'll find--

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.100
I've certainly always
found this in my life--

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.260
if you follow the thing
that you really care about

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.250
and you use your
energy on that thing,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.860
it's going to take
you to a place

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.320
that you wouldn't have expected.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.900
And it's going to be
unbelievably fulfilling.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.620
Both personally, but
also with your ability

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.630
to actually have an
impact on it because it's

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.090
coming from a place
that's really true to you.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.330
So whatever that is,
look for organizations

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.220
that are working in that world.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.049
If it's voting rights, ACLU.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.230
If it's women's
reproductive freedoms,

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.080
obviously, you know the
incredible organizational work

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.680
of groups like Planned
Parenthood and NARAL.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.780
But maybe you don't know
so much about the Center

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.520
for Reproductive
Rights, which is doing

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.190
all the legal work on this.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.670
And actually, were
the major impetus

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.220
behind the successful
Supreme Court case

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.360
that we won last year.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.700
Maybe you care particularly
about making sure

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.330
that women have access to
safe and legal abortion.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.420
And you want to really get
into the ground level of that

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.780
and support organizations
like the Lilith Fund, which

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.980
makes sure that women can afford
to have an abortion if they

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.390
otherwise don't have the
financial means to do that.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.517
So there are so many
different ways to plug in.

00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:25.225
And what we hope to
do with our website--

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:29.470
and we're actually in a revamp
of it right now to make it much

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.380
more meaningful if you're
looking for that place to plug

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.150
in--

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.370
we want to be a place
where you can go,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.310
and depending on that
area of interest,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.700
you plug in to one of
those organizations

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.460
and you will find, immediately,
two or three key ways

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.080
that they're asking
for you to get

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.000
involved on a real-time basis.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.240
Some more intense and
some less intense,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.300
but ways where you can
meaningfully be contributing

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.070
your time and your energy.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.630
SPEAKER 1: And what
about companies?

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.790
What role do you think companies
should or shouldn't have?

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.912
Have you seen their
advocacy be effective?

00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:06.370
WENDY DAVIS: I
think their advocacy

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.580
is tremendously effective.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.740
I'm sensitive,
obviously, to the fact

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.320
that companies walk quite
a fine line, in terms

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.370
of not wanting to get involved
so much in the partisan world.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.420
And that makes sense because
they have consumers who

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.967
sit on both sides of that line.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.425
They have, I'm
sure, employees that

00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:30.820
sit on both sides of that line.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.330
But I think we find our way
into the things that make sense

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.180
when we are being
very issue-focused.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:47.080
For example, last year in
my home state of Texas,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.380
American Airlines
became the title sponsor

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.030
of the Planned
Parenthood luncheon

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.520
in Dallas for the
very first time.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.200
I almost cried.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.260
I was so blown away by it.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.810
Because it made such a powerful
statement for a company

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.790
like that to say, we support
women's reproductive health

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.770
care and this organization.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.749
And in the face of
all the political flak

00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:13.540
that Planned Parenthood
is in the midst of,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.831
we're going to step forward
and we're going to do this.

00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:20.470
So I think, for companies
to find their way into issue

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.270
areas that really
matter to them,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.210
and to use their influence--

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.820
and there are many ways for
them to do that, of course.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.990
We certainly saw the incredible
impact in North Carolina

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.320
last year with the
transgender bathroom bill.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.380
Texas, by the way, is trying
to replicate that right now.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.890
And I am pleased to see we've
got some corporate pushback

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.430
already beginning to percolate.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.710
But that corporate
pushback in North Carolina

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:54.460
not only contributed to,
really, an economic impact

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.280
to the state, but it made such a
powerful statement economically

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.150
that it impacted the way voters
thought about that issue.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.030
So that in the last
gubernatorial race

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.080
that they had during the
presidential election cycle,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.230
they elected a
statewide Democrat.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.630
That was considered a
really long-shot thing

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.090
to do there, actually.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.160
And they did it because people
now were coming at this issue

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.020
from a variety of perspectives.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.330
Whether it was something
that they cared about

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.260
from their social conscience
or whether they cared about it

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.360
because they understood
it was having

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.490
an impact economically
to their state

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.950
and maybe to their
own pocketbook.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.280
That's what companies
have the power to do.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.670
And to broaden the conversation
in a way that really

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.630
does lift it up out of the
social and makes it something

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.540
that's much more meaningful in
the day-to-day lives of people

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.900
who have respect for
or who are impacted

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.275
by the decisions and the
actions that that company takes.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.441
SPEAKER 1: So where do you
think companies are still

00:12:57.441 --> 00:12:58.150
being silent?

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.180
On what issue do you wish
companies were speaking out

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.590
more about?

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.256
WENDY DAVIS: Well,
when I looked at what

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:08.410
happened in North Carolina,
with appreciation and awe

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.340
for the companies that stepped
forward so powerfully on that

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.580
and objected to
it, I found myself

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.430
longing for that same
response in other areas.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.020
I, of course, am very
focused on gender equality.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.060
And I wish we saw more of
that when it came to issues

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.390
that particularly impact women.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:38.290
In Texas, when we passed that
anti-abortion bill in 2013,

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.400
that was, in and of
itself, terrible.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.734
But what happened, actually,
two years prior to that

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.400
that a lot of people
didn't know about--

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.990
there was no big filibuster.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:52.030
It didn't capture the attention
of people around the world.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.590
In 2011, in an assault
on Planned Parenthood,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:01.360
there was a dramatic defunding
of women's health care there.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.760
And they couldn't
really de-select just

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.890
Planned Parenthood.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.780
And so what happened
was that there

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.090
was this wholesale
withdrawal of funds.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.660
Number one, the state decided
to no longer participate

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.000
in the women's
health program, which

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.360
was giving us about
$30 million a year

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.640
for women's reproductive
health care.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.060
It's aimed particularly at
lowering the Medicaid birthrate

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.580
and saving taxpayer money
by virtue of doing it.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.800
And it really was saving
a tremendous amount

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.560
of taxpayer money.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.810
We de-participated in that.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.730
And that affected not
just Planned Parenthood,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.650
but everyone that
was getting money

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.560
for birth control,
reproductive health care

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.170
services in our state.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.620
And then there was
also a $78 million

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.180
state defunding of these
women's reproductive health care

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.050
centers.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.540
None of these were
providing abortion care, not

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.860
a single one.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.910
And overnight, we had
over 80 clinics close all

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.230
over our state.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.880
Those that still remained
open were hobbled really badly

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.810
and could only see a small
percentage of the patients

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.550
that they'd been seeing.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.137
And there's a wide
range of estimates

00:15:14.137 --> 00:15:15.970
about the number of
women who were impacted,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.780
but it's anywhere from 100,000
to 180,000 women in one

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.190
fell swoop.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.250
And we see the circumstances
of that in our state.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.830
We have the highest
maternal death

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.164
rate of any developed
country in the world

00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:32.080
in the state of Texas.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.250
Our maternal death rate doubled
in about a six-year period

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.700
of time.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:43.300
So these are dramatic,
horrific human consequences

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.380
that women are getting
sucked into by virtue

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.870
of partisan politics.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.540
And I want to see companies
step forward and say,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.510
when these sorts of things
are happening, you know what?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.030
We were going to relocate
our corporate headquarters

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.480
to Dallas, Texas, and
now we've decided not to.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.130
Or we're the NCAA,
and we were going

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.819
to host the Final Four there
and now we've decided not to.

00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:08.610
Or we're the Super Bowl
and we were coming,

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.030
but now we're not going to.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.740
I want to see that
kind of response

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.830
when women are under
assault. Because it's not

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.860
just that we are
failing to realize

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.730
our full equal opportunity.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.300
It's that we literally
are the shrapnel

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.620
in these political wars where
human lives are being impacted

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.666
in devastating ways.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:34.790
And it's something that we
all ought to care about.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.640
Because at the end of the
day, it impacts everyone.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.460
And at the end of the day, it
impacts our economy as well.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.330
SPEAKER 1: So how do you do it?

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.830
This, obviously,
disproportionately,

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.595
dramatically affects
the poor, right?

00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:48.470
WENDY DAVIS: It does.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.260
SPEAKER 1: And then you
have wealthier women

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.220
who are at these companies.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.610
How do you get them to
stand up in the same way

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.730
that people have stood up
for rights for other groups

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.877
that they don't
necessarily belong to?

00:17:00.877 --> 00:17:02.460
WENDY DAVIS: I think
part of it starts

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.750
within the culture of the
organization, the company

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.579
itself.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.250
And what is the
makeup of that company

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.160
look like, in terms of the
number of women on its board,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.430
the number of women that
are in the executive suites

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.140
of that company?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.010
That has a lot of influence
in these conversations.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.119
And so continuing
for gender equality

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.670
in the positions
that women occupy

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.440
is a very important
part of that,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.060
just as is the case for making
sure that we have women fully

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.690
reflected at every level of
representative government

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.650
in this country.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.360
Unless and until
we have that, we're

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.150
not going to move this
conversation, really,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.040
where it needs to go.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.610
But we have an opportunity,
as employees and as consumers,

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.480
too, to exert our
own influences.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.990
We've been talking about that
a bit at Deeds Not Words.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.270
When I first was
hatching this idea,

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.680
one of the things I wanted us
ultimately to be able to do

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.490
is to weigh in as consumers
and to help direct consumer

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.770
decision-making
based on a company's

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:15.290
score with how well it's doing
to support gender equality.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.090
Is this a company where there
are a representative number

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.960
of women in the executive
suites and on the board?

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.900
Is this a company
that's, like Salesforce,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.320
done a self-examination
of pay equity

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.820
and worked hard to make sure
they were equalizing it?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.550
Is it a company that has a
good family leave policy, both

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.500
for dads and moms,
so that we do have

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.920
true gender equality in the
way that that's happening?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.980
And helping to drive
people's positive

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.410
buying decisions
based on companies

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.770
that score well in that regard.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.280
Right now, I'm sure you've
all seen Grab Your Wallet.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.890
And Grab Your Wallet
is doing, I think,

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.510
an interesting
job of making sure

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.720
that they're making
people aware of how

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.590
to take their dollars away,
as consumers, from companies

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.660
who aren't behaving well.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.560
I have found myself
responding to that

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.190
and thinking about which ride
share company I'm going to use,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.900
for example, or which
retail establishment--

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.170
not Macy's-- that
I'm going to shop at.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.880
I have my own
experience with Macy's.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.110
Because they actually
advocated against an equal pay

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.900
law in Texas and were successful
in getting the governor

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.380
to veto an equal pay law that
I worked very, very hard on.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.995
So if any of you are
shopping at Macy's, I'm

00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:42.140
just going to add my two cents
to what's already on the Grab

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.350
Your Wallet site when it comes
to that particular company.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.720
But we have influences
in that regard.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.490
And I think we're starting
to see some of the response

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.990
that private companies are
making to watching the way

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.540
consumers are responding.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.990
This young woman that we were
talking about earlier, who just

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:09.170
recently left Uber and who
shared her story, essentially,

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.400
for the outside world.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.820
And the immediate
impact that that's had.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.570
While she worked within that
culture for a very long time,

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.560
trying to change it, bringing
outside attention on it

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.800
and having the
executive offices have

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.850
to deal with the public
opinion of their company

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:35.120
based on that experience, it
has shown we have a lot of power

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.260
if we can really
kind of focus that--

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.150
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.440
I think it will be--

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.745
WENDY DAVIS: --magnifying glass.

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.911
SPEAKER 1: --interesting
to see as that gets easier.

00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:43.120
Right now, it's very almost--

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.720
it's an entirely,
almost, offline

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.390
or an individual
experience where

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.210
you can post on social that
you've boycotted something

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.169
or supported something.

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:53.168
But it'll be interesting
to see how that evolves

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:55.752
as, I think, the tech solutions
get easier for, like you said,

00:20:55.752 --> 00:20:57.584
the companies that are
doing the things that

00:20:57.584 --> 00:20:59.720
align with your values and
how that gets surfaced.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.520
So how did you
get into politics?

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.010
And what was the moment where
you were just like, oh, wow,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.760
I'm a big deal?

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.320
WENDY DAVIS: I promise you,
I haven't had that moment.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.695
SPEAKER 1: It
wasn't when you had

00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:14.792
a catheter during a filibuster?

00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:16.250
WENDY DAVIS: I know
we all do this,

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.010
but I think women
particularly do this.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.140
We take in all the things
that we're not achieving,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.960
as opposed to celebrating the
things that we're doing well.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.270
We tend to be very
self-critical.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.940
But my entree into
politics, and the reason

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.450
that I was really committed
to the advocacy training

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:37.190
work of Deeds Not
Words, happened when I

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.780
went to a city council meeting.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.110
I was in my 30s.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.160
I was arguing for something
in my neighborhood,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.100
along with a lot of other people
in the neighborhood community.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.190
And I walked into that council
chamber, expressed my opinion,

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.910
and then just got
the idea, well, I

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.040
could be one of those
people sitting up there.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.440
And this is
interesting, actually.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.730
And I think I would really
thrive in this environment.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.620
And so it just opened
up the idea for me.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.220
I had not been paying
attention to politics.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.870
I was one of those people that
I really work on right now.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.800
I was a young single mom.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.610
I was working two jobs
and going to school.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:24.980
And my struggles did
not include the thought

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.080
about how my voice
could make a difference

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.530
in the political world.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.790
And I really didn't sit
up and pay attention to it

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.060
until I saw Hillary Clinton
fighting for universal health

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.170
care as First Lady.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.940
That was my first
tug into it, where

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.970
it seemed relevant and
meaningful to me, based

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.610
on my own experiences and
struggles with health care

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.840
as an uninsured person.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.980
So we find our ways,
again, I think,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.450
when we're helped to
demystify that process where

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.140
we see that those fancy
capitol buildings,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.930
whether we're talking
about the one in DC

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:08.220
or the ones around our states,
those buildings belong to us.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.670
There's nothing really
mysterious or intimidating

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.510
about them.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.230
And I think we have
to demystify them.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.000
And I'm pleased to be doing
that for some young people

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.780
in my own state and helping
them to see that the people that

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.630
are elected there,
while they may refer

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.280
to it as my district or
my office, the district

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.710
is actually one that
belongs to the people.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.500
Their office belongs to us.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.260
They have to, at
least at some level,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.020
listen to us, even if they
do avoid us in town halls,

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.750
which some of them around
the country have been doing.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.344
But we have the power to speak
out by calling their offices,

00:23:48.344 --> 00:23:50.510
writing their offices,
coming to committee hearings,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.610
and letting them know
how we feel about things.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.730
And I hope that
the more people we

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:01.280
can encourage into that
venue, the more young women

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.310
will see that they
have every right

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.100
to be sitting up at those
decision-making tables.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.640
And that they'll begin to view
that as something that they

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.085
want to do for themselves.

00:24:12.085 --> 00:24:13.460
SPEAKER 1: And
yet, I imagine one

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.251
of the most discouraging
things when you're

00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:18.844
thinking about running for any
kind of office or speaking up

00:24:18.844 --> 00:24:20.510
is that you always
know that this is all

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.510
going to be seen through
the lens of your gender.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.200
I remember when you were running
for governor and there was--

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.410
how many hours a week did
you spend with your kids?

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:29.910
Right?

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.725
Or it was like, how
many days in a month

00:24:32.725 --> 00:24:34.100
did you go back
to see your kids?

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.735
Which never, ever,
ever would happen.

00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:40.110
And that's got to be something
that's quite discouraging,

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.290
not only just the public
aspect of this all,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.998
but knowing that you're
going to be-- you

00:24:43.998 --> 00:24:47.240
have to fight twice as
hard to be taken seriously.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.834
How did you navigate that?

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:52.250
You know, to a certain degree,
you have to play that game,

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.450
that you can't
transcend it entirely.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.924
At the same time,
you want to have

00:24:54.924 --> 00:24:56.090
control over your narrative.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.280
How did you approach that?

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.870
Or how do you approach
it today, too?

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.490
WENDY DAVIS: For
me, it's still one

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.040
of the most
frustrating experiences

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.500
that I've had in
the political world.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.020
And women face this in
every level of profession.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.210
One of the things that was
successfully done to me during

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.760
my gubernatorial race--
and it was really--

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.030
if I stand aside and just
look at it as a spectator,

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.070
I'm rather fascinated by it.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.430
Being in the middle of it,
it was horrific and painful.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.740
But one of the
clever things that

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.040
happens in the
political world is

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.990
trying to figure out how to
take a candidate's best asset

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.250
and make it their weakness.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.610
And that's what
happened with me.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.180
My asset was my story.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.840
The American dream story
of coming from poverty,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.920
struggling, fighting,
making my way,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.960
all the way through
Harvard Law School.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.600
First person in my family
to ever even go to college,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.550
never mind graduate.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:10.370
And then to have a
career where I gave back

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:15.120
to my own life experiences and
the things that I fought for.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.450
That was my feather, right?

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.980
That was the thing that I
could distinguish myself about.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.710
Well, my story got
ripped out from under me.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.410
I was a bad mother.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.540
I commuted back and
forth from Boston

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.560
to Fort Worth in my second
and third year of law school

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.810
because that first year,
taking my girls there

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:44.420
with me was not just really hard
on me, it was so hard on them.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.840
And where a man would never
have been questioned about that,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.520
my bona fides as a mother
was called into question.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.450
My two daughters actually
had to come forward.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.770
And they wrote a
very heartfelt letter

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:05.690
that they read publicly about
my bona fides as a mother.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.020
You just wouldn't see
this happening for men.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.270
But I understood why
they were doing it.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.540
And I also understood
with some of the labels

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.890
that they used with me,
why they were doing them.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.690
Abortion Barbie was a label that
was used quite often for me.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.080
And in fact, when I came to do
some fund raising in Southern

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.360
California during
that race, there

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.710
were these big posters that
had been put up all over LA

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.370
with-- they were 3D
posters with Barbie,

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:42.290
plastic, transparent
belly with a plastic baby

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:48.200
doll in the belly, and me
with scissors in my hand.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.650
So why would they do that?

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.790
Well, a couple of things.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.870
Number one, they wanted to
make me a candidate that

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.260
was all about abortion
and to take away

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.620
the entire body of work that
I had done as a public servant

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.790
and what I had to
offer as a candidate.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.700
But they also wanted--

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.030
the Barbie image
was very purposeful.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:12.200
If we can invite voters to think
about women candidates in terms

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.900
of how we look, then we dismiss
our capacity as leaders.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.650
We're inviting people to
think about them as mothers,

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.810
and bad mothers at that.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.620
As women who are no more
than the makeup of what

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.170
we look like.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.230
And to, therefore, take
away our perspectives

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.140
about our true value as leaders.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.420
It happens to women in the
political world all the time.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.250
I am not unique.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.170
It was particularly
bad in my race.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.870
And it was particularly
bad in Hillary's race,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.540
but it happens to
women all the time.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.320
And I think the best
way to ride through that

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.770
and to rise above
it is to continue

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.760
to fight back every single
time and to pop right back up.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.230
That was one of the things that
I always admired about Hillary.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.140
I have never seen anyone
that could pop right back up

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.080
and get back out there
and fight another day.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.470
And it's unfortunate
that we have to do it,

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.760
but it's the reality.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.550
And I think unless
and until we have

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.140
more women in those
gubernatorial mansions,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.070
unless and until we have
a woman in the White House

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.120
and we can show the
incredible capacity

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.600
that women have to lead in
those executive positions,

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.070
we're going to
continue to struggle

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.550
with these stereotypes.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.390
So I'm really
committed to just doing

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.760
everything we can
to chip away at it

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.280
in school boards,
in city councils,

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.870
in every state legislative
body in this country.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.360
And obviously, at the
congressional and, of course,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.330
the presidential level, too.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.100
SPEAKER 1: And so
you lost the race.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.945
And in the Valley, we love
to talk about failure.

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:03.980
How it makes us all stronger
and there's usually a story of,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.880
oh, I failed at this.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.052
And then, I was bankrupt.

00:30:06.052 --> 00:30:07.760
And I looked up at
the stars and realized

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.718
I would disrupt the auto
industry or something.

00:30:09.718 --> 00:30:12.210
And then you become
this billionaire.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.950
Did you have an
equivalent moment?

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.190
Did you take anything
from that failure?

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.900
WENDY DAVIS: Most definitely.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.200
I wrote an essay for Lena
Dunham's "Lenny Letter"

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.580
within a few months
of that race.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.000
And if it's OK for me
to say a curse word,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.080
the title of my essay was
"I Fucking Hate To Lose."

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.530
And I talked about what
a competitive person

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.660
I am by nature.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.980
I'm sure a lot of
you are, as well.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:51.070
But going back to that
beautiful Teddy Roosevelt

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.570
quote about what it
means to be in the ring.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.430
To be that person who sweats
and tries their hardest

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.990
and comes up short.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.850
But how much more glorious
it is to be that person than

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.200
to be the person who is standing
on the sideline as the critic.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.150
It's only when we put
ourselves out there

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:22.690
and we risk losing that we
will ever move the ball.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.550
There's value no matter what
in that moving of the ball.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.690
I know, in the political world,
that in places like Texas,

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.790
a lot of times
these conversations,

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.270
these hard conversations that
need to be had about policy,

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.300
they're not being
had except for when

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.780
we have these big,
statewide contests where

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.470
we can raise the conversation
and the level of consciousness

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.040
around them.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.260
And for me, that was a
really important part

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.500
of running for office.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.570
But the same can
be said of anything

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.760
that we are working to do.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.060
Anything we're striving
for that's hard

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.860
and that we may fail at.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.240
Every attempt we
make at it advances

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.040
it a little bit
and we, ultimately,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.030
will succeed in those goals.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.440
Whether it's me
individually or not,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.620
I will have played a part
in moving that ball forward.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:22.510
And so in my essay, what I said
was, if you're going to fail,

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.070
fail big.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.310
Fail gloriously
trying to do something

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.740
that really matters to you.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:35.320
And when you fail and you
deal with that consequence,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.950
in terms of how that
feels, really try to center

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.710
yourself around
how extraordinary

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.660
you are that you tried it
and that you moved the ball.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.960
And then, if you've got it
in you-- and I hope you do--

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.482
get back up and
try to do it again.

00:32:53.482 --> 00:32:54.940
SPEAKER 1: I've
got more questions,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.980
but I bet there's
probably some Dory.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.340
Are we doing live, as well?

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.112
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:32:59.112 --> 00:33:00.820
AUDIENCE: How do you
come combat and deal

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.090
with people who have violently
opposed views to you, even

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.910
on base principles, and then
get to talking policy with them

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.680
afterwards if their base
beliefs are different?

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.570
WENDY DAVIS: There are some
people that you can't talk to.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.576
I know that's not a very
constructive answer.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.140
In my legislative experience,
for example, I really

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.440
prided myself on
working across the aisle

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.310
and got quite a lot of
legislation passed doing that.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.260
You have to do that in Texas.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.570
It's a quite predominantly
Republican place.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.410
But there are some areas where
it's worth drawing that line,

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:46.030
where you can't find
a way to compromise.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.470
And I think the
most effective way

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.260
to communicate when you're
in that place, or any

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.130
of these places actually, even
where you do find that middle,

00:33:54.130 --> 00:34:00.790
is to do it through personal
experiences and human stories.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.070
A lot of times, we have
these conversations

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.940
up in the ethereal
world and we're

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.320
stuck in our own ideological
way of thinking about them.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.750
But when we can
make them more real,

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.100
it really makes a difference.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.480
So a great example of how
that can move the ball.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.159
In the conversation
around LGBTQ equality,

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.590
that really began to move
when a great deal of work

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.010
was done determining
how to talk about it.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.409
And to talk about
it in a way that

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.929
was more resonant than
had been the case.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:41.760
It had been talked about
specifically as equality.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.690
And that we all ought
to care about it just

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.230
to be living in a
full and equal world

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.179
and that we all ought
to be treated that way.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:52.120
But the conversation
shifted, purposefully so,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.010
to be much more personal.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.520
And a lot of work actually was
done in your state around that.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.800
Door-to-door
conversations with people

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.330
were had where couples
who were impacted

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.690
by the inequality of marriage
equality, for example,

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:13.150
would go to an older
Republican household and say,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.510
we want to talk to you about
why this matters to us.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:21.070
It really shifted people's
thinking about it.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.390
And it's because
it became personal

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.085
and because they saw it
as something personal.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.230
Storytelling is powerful.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.580
And I love seeing the
fact that it's becoming

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.270
more and more prominent.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.710
That technology has provided
such a great platform

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.520
for people to share stories
and to influence based on that.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:48.780
A lot of abortion story-sharing
going on online post-2013

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.870
in the filibuster and
people's consciousness

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.420
raising about that.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.310
And I think that's
our most effective way

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.470
to try to get through
hard conversations.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.530
But that doesn't mean everyone's
always going to listen.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
Monica, and I'm

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.190
so excited that you're here.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.410
I grew up in South Texas.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.820
And when I was growing up,
Ann Richards was the governor.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:15.030
So I'm going to ask a question
on the topic of failure again.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.460
She was the first governor
I got to vote for.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.750
I went on to work in President
Clinton's first White House.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:28.080
Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein,
all these women were running.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.530
And I felt so invigorated
as a young woman coming out

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.570
of college.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.400
It's a very different story now.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.264
And I look at that from when I
was young and where we are now.

00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:41.430
Everything that Hillary
Clinton's had to go through.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.820
Everything that Elizabeth Warren
is going through, et cetera.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.290
Everything you've gone through.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.370
And thank you, by the way,
for going through that.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.050
Where have we failed?

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.075
And what do I tell my daughter?

00:36:55.075 --> 00:36:56.700
WENDY DAVIS: It's
such a hard question.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.074
The "what do I
tell my daughter?"

00:36:58.074 --> 00:37:00.195
is such a hard question.

00:37:00.195 --> 00:37:01.320
The night of the election--

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.860
I have a 34-year-old and
a 28-year-old daughter.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.510
And I was at the
event in Manhattan.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.240
I had phone conversations
with both of my daughters

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:18.140
that evening, both of them
crying their eyes out.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.580
And both of them
asking questions

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.120
from a place of
what was real fear.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.712
What's going to happen?

00:37:25.712 --> 00:37:26.670
What's going to happen?

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.820
I feel really
optimistic right now

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.120
about the what's going
to happen because I

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.990
am so encouraged by
the personal reaction

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.930
that people have had to saying,
we're going to step forward

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.620
and we're going
to use our voices.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.810
What you tell your
daughter, I hope,

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:54.040
is to participate in that
with you to the extent

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.690
that you participate in it.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.890
Show her, through role modeling,
the power that you have

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.980
and how you're
going to express it.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.740
And show her that you're
going to sustain it.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.770
I think that's one of the
big questions right now.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:12.520
Are we going to
sustain this enthusiasm

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.730
that we have right now for
our values and our desire

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:19.840
to make sure that they're
going to be heard?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.200
But at that top
level, once again,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:30.184
I think it is our very
important responsibility

00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:31.850
to make sure that
we're doing everything

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.140
we can to create legislative
bodies that reflect

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.860
who we are as a community.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.650
And that doesn't just mean
making sure we have women.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.930
It means making sure we
have women of color who

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.360
are dramatically
under-represented

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.970
in legislative bodies
around this country.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.200
That we have transgender
representatives.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.930
That we have people
from different cultures,

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.260
and religions, and
backgrounds, both

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.230
socioeconomically and otherwise.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:07.150
Unless we're really reflected
in the decision-makers,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.330
we're not going to move things
forward as productively and as

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.910
effectively and as quickly
as we'd like to see.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.560
So if you're going to spend
your energy somewhere,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.010
I would say run for office.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.140
Or find a candidate
that you can get behind

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.130
and that you can help.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.670
Not just by writing them
a $5 check every week,

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.150
but making sure that you go
knock on some doors for them

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.060
and you have some conversations
about why their election makes

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.834
a difference.

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.250
Republicans, for
a long time, have

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.300
been very astute at
building from the base up

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.810
and making sure that
they are putting people

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.600
in places where they have
the potential to climb

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.320
in the political world.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.130
So the school board races
and city council races,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.930
which is where I started, too.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.982
It's a really important way
for us to make an impact.

00:40:02.982 --> 00:40:04.190
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Mina.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.460
And first, I just want
to say thanks for coming.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:13.130
And also, thank you because you
really personally affected me.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.470
I actually did knock
on doors for you

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:21.020
in Texas as part of
Battleground Texas.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.580
And I really want to say that
I feel like you revitalized

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.590
politics in Texas.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.630
Everyone that I
spoke to, we spoke

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.390
to a number of people
who actually said,

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.830
we're switching parties.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.500
They were frustrated
and I felt like you

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.970
had a big part in that.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.680
WENDY DAVIS: Thank you.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.720
AUDIENCE: And as
you mentioned, we

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.397
are seeing a revitalization in
interest in politics and people

00:40:46.397 --> 00:40:47.105
getting involved.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.220
My question is,
you also see women

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.250
voting against their own
interests a lot of the time.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.610
And I feel like it is because
they just focus on one issue.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.450
How can we make it a
larger conversation

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.640
so that they actually,
perhaps, want

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.930
to start supporting each
other rather than tearing

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.367
each other down?

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:16.700
WENDY DAVIS: I like the way
you ended that last question

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.370
because it made me think
of something that Chelsea

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:22.640
Handler said recently about
women, that we've been taught

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.040
to tackle, not to climb.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.610
And I do think sometimes we
can be each other's own worst

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.460
enemy because there's a lot
of judgment that goes on.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.140
Depending on the choices that
we've made in our own lives

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.310
and careers, or whether that
career is outside the home

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.890
or inside the home.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:43.580
This is the $20 million
question, though.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.040
How do we make sure that
people aren't voting

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.390
against their own interests?

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.480
And there's a lot
of education that

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.882
needs to take place
because people aren't going

00:41:53.882 --> 00:41:55.340
to vote against
their own interests

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.040
because they think they're
voting against their interests.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.289
They really believe they're
voting in their interests,

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:01.730
right?

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.090
And I think Democrats
have failed,

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.670
myself included,
in doing a good job

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:15.290
of communicating why it is that
our values are ones that really

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:20.680
are more in alignment with
most people's in this country.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.050
And there's a lot of work
being done right now on,

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.670
how do we reframe the narrative?

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:28.850
And how do we do a better
job of talking about that?

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.840
But back to that
personal storytelling

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:37.910
again, where we have
experiences that we

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.580
can share with people
who may disagree with us

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.780
and paint a picture of a
real person and an impact

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.810
that would feel more
compelling to them.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.890
Where you have
opportunities to do that,

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.880
I think that's the most powerful
way to cut through that.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.440
And particularly,
if there's a way

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.500
to paint within their
own perspective what's

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.680
happening to them
vis-a-vis a person

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.570
that they may have
thought was actually

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.095
aligned with their interests.

00:43:06.095 --> 00:43:08.351
AUDIENCE: First of all, I
agree with the optimism.

00:43:08.351 --> 00:43:10.100
And I think that's
just because everyone's

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.570
having such a big wake-up call.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.870
So when I came to this country
four years ago from London,

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.090
I was maybe a latent feminist.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.830
I've always believed
in equality, et cetera,

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.140
but it wasn't an issue for me.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.389
And then I came to the Valley,
where everyone was male

00:43:23.389 --> 00:43:26.900
and everyone was working in
tech and everyone was white.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.800
These issues became more
important for me, personally.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.860
But now, it's because
it's so bad with Trump,

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.307
it feels like the
entire middle ground

00:43:38.307 --> 00:43:39.890
of people who just
didn't care anymore

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.510
and didn't seem to be
caring about politics

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.250
have been awakened.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.708
So I actually think this might
turn out to be a good thing.

00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:46.160
I'm sharing the optimism.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.880
But I wanted to ask
you about this question

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.420
about personal storytelling,
which I totally understand,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.310
in terms of building tolerance.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.120
If you're relating to this
person, it's different.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.610
And it reminds me when I was
16, I was in upstate New York

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.350
as an exchange student in
a family that was un-eco,

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.630
blatantly racist,
all these things.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.800
And so my dad would shout at
black people out of this pickup

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.400
truck--

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.140
my host dad.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.420
But then, Bob, who
was the black guy who

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.980
worked with him,
somehow wasn't black

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.390
because he was Bob,
because he knew him.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.780
So I think that's what
you're getting at, right?

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.850
Once you know the
person, you can no longer

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.210
put them into this
category of otherness.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.580
But on the flip side,
with the politicians,

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.830
it seems like we're moving
further and further away

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:40.280
from issues and more and more
about the personality, in that

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.380
Trump got elected because
of his personality that

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.659
appeals to TV viewers.

00:44:45.659 --> 00:44:47.450
And it was nothing
about the issues, right?

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.710
Everyone ignored all the issues.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.880
So how can we
square those things?

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.860
Should we get politics
away from personalities

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.110
and more towards issues again,
or is that just impossible?

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.206
WENDY DAVIS: I don't
know if that's possible.

00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:01.580
But I think a lot
of people, too,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.900
would tell you
that they supported

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.990
Donald Trump because
they did believe

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.090
that he was
supportive of policies

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.730
that were going to have a
positive impact on their lives.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.250
So whether we were
talking about people

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.710
who had been impacted
by automation,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.590
but he gave an easy
target to blame,

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.144
which was an immigrant workforce
that had taken your job.

00:45:26.144 --> 00:45:27.560
Whether we're
talking about people

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.940
who worked in industries
where environmental evolution

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.550
and the protections
of environmental laws

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:41.510
had decreased the
employment capacity

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.480
in that particular sector and
they'd been impacted by that,

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.310
they heard him speaking
to them about that.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:53.030
Never underestimate the
misogyny that is out there

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:57.560
and even if it's not something
that people bring forward

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.140
consciously, their
own subconscious

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.620
feelings about the threat
that equality in the workforce

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.220
means to their own
livelihoods and success,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.940
he spoke powerfully to
a lot of those things

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.390
and people were
responding to them.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.570
But I love your example
about Bob, right?

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:22.280
Because that's the only way
that we can really counter that.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.010
There was a great story
in "The New York Times"

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:30.050
yesterday about a
Mexican gentleman

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.400
who was detained recently
and he's probably

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.230
going to be deported.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:41.229
And in this small Iowa
town, he was so well loved.

00:46:41.229 --> 00:46:42.770
And everyone's
saying, well, yeah, we

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:49.490
support rounding up and
deporting, but not him.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.630
I think his name is Carlos.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.430
We love Carlos.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.160
And Carlos had done all
these incredible things

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.530
in the community, like
supporting firefighters

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.139
and always being the person
there with the food drives

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:01.430
and different things like that.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.240
And everyone loves them.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.060
So making the reality
come to life for people

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.460
is really a way to
take a step back

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.210
and to look at
things differently.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.660
The real challenge
that we have is not

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.950
that there are
personalities in politics

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:26.360
that can be persuasive, but that
we have a media culture where

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.820
people self-select the
prism through which they

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.470
view their news.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.740
And they're going to hear
things and be told things

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.100
very differently depending
on that self-selection.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.740
That, to me, is the greatest
challenge that we have,

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.860
is cutting through
the version of things

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.680
that you find on
different news sources.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.570
And the decisions
or the opinions

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.740
that you form based on what you
hear coming from those filters.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.440
And we all owe a
responsibility, again,

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.530
to take the power away
from their version

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.510
and put the power into
a reality version that's

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.810
based on real human impact.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:13.400
It's hard, but we're each
an influencer and we each

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:19.260
have an opportunity to do it
to our spheres of influence.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.430
I'm Monique.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.830
I'm an immigrant, a
woman, and a Latina.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.340
So I 100% relate to
your daughter's fears

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.680
about what's going on.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.470
And on top of that,
like many others,

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.730
I have the opposite
concern from hers.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.210
I'm raising a white male
in the Silicon Valley

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.000
and I'm deeply
concerned about what

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.850
he's going to grow up listening
to at school and on the TV,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.290
and so on.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.910
It was very
frustrating not being

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:56.270
able to vote last election.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.690
So I guess my question
to you would be,

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:03.350
how do you think
we that do not get

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.720
to vote in this country
can have the biggest

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.865
impact beyond the ballots?

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.000
WENDY DAVIS: In myriad of ways.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.730
And again, find the thing
that feels most authentic

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.420
and of value to you personally.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.080
If it's in the political space,
obviously supporting candidates

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.510
and working for them, even
if you can't vote for them.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:31.490
For example in Texas, I had
a large number of Dreamers

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.970
who worked really, really
hard on our campaign.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.310
None of whom could actually
vote for me, but all of whom

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:40.820
had a vested stake in what
the outcome of that election

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.120
looked like, and who cared
very deeply about the direction

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.490
that we were going as a state.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:49.170
You have a wonderful
opportunity with your son

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.630
to be an influencer
in the way he

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.260
is going to view these issues.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:59.120
And I'm sure he's going
to grow up beautifully

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.140
based on who you are and what
your values are and making sure

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.290
that you pass those on to him.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.960
If you find yourself
really deeply

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:14.950
passionate about LGBT equality,
or the environment, or gender

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.380
equality, find an organization
that matters to you

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.390
and support the
work that they do.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.720
And ask them how you can
be valuable to the work

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.110
that they do.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:28.310
There's so much that's
needed, in terms

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:34.490
of our time and our
passion that, as long

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.670
as you find a place that
feels meaningful to you,

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.575
you will be making a difference.

00:50:39.575 --> 00:50:43.597
You really will, whether you
can ultimately vote or not.

00:50:43.597 --> 00:50:45.680
SPEAKER 2: And Wendy, we're
going to take one more

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.480
question from a man
who's been watching

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.930
over the livestream who asked,
"How do you see the role of men

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.070
as allies?

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.040
What can we do to
help this cause?"

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.480
WENDY DAVIS: That's a
really good question.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.420
First of all, I'll tell
you a story about myself

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.650
and the word "feminism," back
to what was said earlier.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.270
When I was in my 30s
and I was running

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.350
for city council for the first
time, I was asked by a reporter

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.390
whether I was a feminist.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.630
And I answered the question no.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.600
And I'm ashamed to tell
you that, honestly.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.180
But I want to tell
you because I want

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.090
us to do some self-exploration
about our own attitudes

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.500
and perspectives.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.560
Why did I do that?

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:29.000
Well, I felt like it
was categorizing me

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.600
in this limited way and
defining me in a way

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.590
that other people would
look at and disqualify me

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.530
based on that categorization.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:46.745
But by doing that, I was playing
a role in marginalizing women.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.750
What I would love
to see more of--

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:55.550
and I'm so pleased to see
so much of it right now--

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.460
are men stepping forward and
saying, I'm a feminist, too.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.200
Because to be a
feminist, really it just

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.283
means that you support the
idea that we should all

00:52:02.283 --> 00:52:06.830
be equal in society
and the economy.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.990
What's that bumper sticker?

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.830
Feminism is the radical notion
that women are human beings,

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.450
or something like that.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.450
I'm really encouraged
about that, too, though,

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.860
and where we are.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.070
The marches, the women's
marches that took place

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.270
around the country
and around the world,

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.640
there were so many men.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.580
There were so many
beautiful, wonderful men

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.680
stepping forward and saying,
this matters to all of us.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680
AUDIENCE: I'm with her.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.960
WENDY DAVIS: I'm
with her, exactly.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.230
And I think more men
are looking at this

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:41.930
from the prism of their
mothers and their sisters

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.670
and, especially,
their daughters,

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:49.970
and wanting to create a world
where they have the opportunity

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.780
to fulfill their
dreams and their best

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.830
opportunities for themselves.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:59.450
And so more and more, we're
joining this conversation

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.860
as one.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.570
And I think one of
the powerful ways

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:07.190
that we can talk about it is
the fact that when we are all

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.580
working toward gender equality,
we're actually all working

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.570
to a place where our
economy has the strongest

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.820
opportunity to thrive.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.250
And it really goes
back to looking

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.740
at what happened when women
were able to really enter

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.029
the workforce and stay in
the full-time workforce

00:53:25.029 --> 00:53:25.820
for the first time.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.260
It was in the 1970s.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:30.320
And I know a lot of the really
young people in this room

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.630
cannot even fathom.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.900
But as of 1971, birth
control was illegal.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.680
If you were not married, you
could not have birth control.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.920
In 1972, with a
Supreme Court decision

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.030
that's much less known than Roe
v. Wade, Eisenstadt v. Baird,

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.730
birth control became legal
for unmarried persons, not

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.716
just married persons.

00:53:50.716 --> 00:53:53.090
There had been a Supreme Court
decision a few years prior

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:57.620
to that that allowed married
people to access birth control.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.470
So birth control and then,
of course, Roe v. Wade.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.830
With our right to
make determinations

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.470
about our own bodies,
we could suddenly

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.570
decide that we were going
to enter the workforce

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:10.820
and we were going to stay
there if we wanted to.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.720
And the women's participation
rate in the workforce

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.250
took this huge climb.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:19.580
It went from about
the low-20 percentile

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:23.540
to the mid-40 percentile over
the course of the next three

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.940
decades and hung there.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.290
And because it hung there,
we contributed significantly

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.370
to the economic output the
economic growth of the country.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:40.730
About an estimated $1.7 trillion
in 2012, which pays for,

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:45.380
by the way, Medicaid, Medicare,
and Social Security combined.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.670
Just our participation, our
increased participation,

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.750
from the 1970s to that point
is responsible for being

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.840
able to pay for all
of those programs.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.300
So we all have a vested stake
in women's equality and women

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.320
being able to realize our
full economic participation

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.700
in this country.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.360
And I want to hear more
women and men sharing that

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.860
with their friends
and their coworkers.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.750
That this isn't
just a social issue.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.710
It's not just about saying,
we ought to treat everyone

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.510
fairly and equally.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.400
We all have an
economic stake in it.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.320
And it goes back to that saying
that a lot of people think

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.140
is just a trite,
little campaign saying.

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.390
When women do better,
we all do better.

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:34.080
It's really true.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.870
And so we all have not
only a stake in it,

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.750
but we ought to be
exercising our voices

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:40.670
and making sure that
we're spreading greater

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.317
understanding about that.

00:55:42.317 --> 00:55:42.900
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.060
Well, thank you so
much for coming.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.018
WENDY DAVIS: Thank you.

00:55:45.018 --> 00:55:48.010
[APPLAUSE]
