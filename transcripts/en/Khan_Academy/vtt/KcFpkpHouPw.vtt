00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.131
- [Voiceover] If x is the
median of the seven numbers

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:05.231
listed above, which of the following

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:07.809
could be the value of x?

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.251
So the median means that if we were to put

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:11.689
these in order, x would
be the middle number.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.178
We have seven numbers,
so it would actually be

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.524
the exact middle number.

00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:15.983
If we had an even number, then it would be

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.759
the middle two averaged.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.453
So let's think about this.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.800
Let's order this and let's put x

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.262
in the middle of that order.

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:26.594
So the smallest number here is three,

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:31.594
then we go to four, then the next one,

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:34.514
let's see, we go to 10.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.291
So those would be the three numbers

00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.885
that are less than x.

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:39.323
Then we go to x, and now we go to

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:41.766
the three numbers that are greater than x.

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:46.766
So then we go to 15, then we go to 18,

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.935
and then we go to 21.

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:55.758
So we've now put them all in order.

00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:58.117
I knew I could put x here
because x is the median.

00:00:58.117 --> 00:00:58.628
When you put it in order,

00:00:58.628 --> 00:00:59.526
it's the middle number.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.268
Notice there's three
numbers larger than it,

00:01:01.268 --> 00:01:02.477
three numbers less than it.

00:01:02.477 --> 00:01:03.871
So I've put x in the middle,

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.520
and so x has to be some number

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.634
between 10 and 15,

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.563
and it could be 10 or 15.

00:01:09.563 --> 00:01:10.736
But let's see the choices.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.860
Which of these choices
are between 10 and 15?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.125
Well five's not, eight's not, nine's not,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.598
14 is, we're done.

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.723
16 is not, it's larger than 15,

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:19.581
so we're done.

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.577
X could be 14, it could also be 13,

00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:24.121
it could be 11, it could even be 10,

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.762
it could be 15, but out
of all of the choices,

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:30.200
14 is the only one that
meets our constraints.
