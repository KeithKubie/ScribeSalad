00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.089
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Ok, so today we have Steve
Paulson in to give a talk about his book,

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.059
"Atoms in Eden." He's a contributor to "To
the Best of Our Knowledge" on Wisconsin Public

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:18.910
Radio and should be a very good talk about
science and religion. So, this is Steve Paulson.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.910
[applause]

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.770
&gt;&gt;Steve: Thank you. I'm delighted to be here
and I have been working on this subject for

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.910
about four years or so. So, I'm going to play
you, being a radio guy, play you a few excerpts

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.970
from interviews I've done and will, I'm sure,
answer all your questions about the connections

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.070
between science and religion. You've probably
heard about Stephen Hawking's new book were

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.540
he says, "We don't need God to explain the
design of the universe," but actually, what's

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.399
more interesting to me at least is his claim
that science can finally answer some of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.080
great existential questions, like "Why is
there something rather than nothing?" and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.989
"Why do we exist?" Hawking writes, "Traditionally,
these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.069
is dead because it hasn't kept up with developments
in science." Of course, Hawking is wrong.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.011
Philosophy is not dead and religion isn't
dead either, but what's really interesting

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:18.469
is how the intellectual assault on philosophy
and religion has come so far. And I can cite

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.369
another example. Sam Harris, the famous atheist,
has a new book out called, "The Moral Landscape,"

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.759
in which he argues that "we need a new understanding
of morality based not on religion, but on

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.279
science." He's out to demolish the idea that
science is, by definition, a value-free space.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:40.090
So, questions about meaning and purpose, those
very things that philosophers and theologians

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.200
have obsessed about for centuries are now
apparently in the realm of science.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.109
I have to say I love these books. I love talking
about them, love doing interviews about them;

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.209
about these kinds of big ideas. And that's
what my own book "Atoms in Eden" is all about.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.130
It's a collection of 20 interviews with a
lot of the major figures in the science and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.139
religion debate. From all different perspectives,
I talk with atheists and religious believers

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:09.590
and with people whose views I cannot possibly
even categorize. If there's an underlying

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.950
agenda to my book, it's my conviction that
we cannot understand the relationship between

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
science and religion without looking at it
from many different angles. We have to consider

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.680
recent findings from evolutionary biology,
quantum physics, cosmology and neuroscience.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.269
We also need a solid grounding in theology,
religious history and what William James called

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.269
"the varieties of religious experience." This
is a really complicated and fascinating subject.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.900
The science and religion debate is not just
about evolution and creationism.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.790
There's one basic question that animates all
of my interviews, "What is a scientifically

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.659
literate, rationally-minded person, someone
who's impatient with religious doctrine, but

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.400
open to spiritual experience, in other words,
me; what is that person supposed to think

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.920
about religion in the 21st Century?" So, what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna talk for about 40

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.349
minutes or so, and I'm a radio guy so I'll
play a bunch of short audio clips. They'll

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.189
all go roughly between one and three minutes
or so. These are from interviews I've done.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.981
Originally, they've aired on the radio, but
they also were always intended to be part

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:18.150
of this book that I've just written. Then
when I'm done, we'll open it up to questions

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.310
and comments from you.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.780
I first came up with the idea for this book
four years ago when I interviewed the renowned

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.129
biologist, E.O. Wilson, who grew up as a Fundamentalist
Southern Baptist in Alabama. In recent years,

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.129
he's become one of the most outspoken critics
of creationism. In my interview, he argued

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.799
strongly against the possibility of any kind
of divine intervention in the evolutionary

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.739
process and then we got to this point in the
interview.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.930
[plays audio clip]

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.040
&gt;&gt;Steve: I've heard you call yourself a deist.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.580
&gt;&gt;Wilson: Yea, I don't wanna be called an
atheist.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.580
&gt;&gt;Steve: Why not?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.620
&gt;&gt;Wilson: You know, being a good scientist
and having been drawn up short so many times

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.930
on my own theories, as all honest scientists
are, I don't want to exclude the possibility

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:19.530
of a creative force or deity. I think that
would be a mistake. And as Hans Kung, the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.480
theologian, once said, "How are we to explain
there is something and not nothing?" Well,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.230
that's a question I'm happy to leave to the
astrophysicists as to why, really, laws of

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.860
the universe came and what is the meaning
of the origin of existence? But I do feel

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.130
confident there is no intervention of a deity
in the origin of life and humanity.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.530
&gt;&gt;Steve: So, that's the distinction between
theism and deism, and so--

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.530
&gt;&gt;Wilson: That is the distinction between--

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.530
&gt;&gt;Steve: in, in, in--

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.140
&gt;&gt;Wilson: So, I'm not a theist, but I'll be
a provisional deist.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.880
&gt;&gt;Steve: But now, just so I understand this,
to be a deist, you're saying that maybe there

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.290
was some creators, some presence that--

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.440
&gt;&gt;Wilson: Wait. Well, maybe. That has not
been--

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
&gt;&gt;Steve: says the laws of--

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.590
&gt;&gt;Wilson: discounted. That's not discounted
yet as a hypothesis. That's why I put the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.590
word provisional--

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.980
&gt;&gt;Steve: But, it's fascinating because everything
you've said up until now suggests that you

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.660
should be an atheist. Why sort of hold out
that specter, that well, maybe there was some

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.600
divine presence that got the whole thing going?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.750
&gt;&gt;Wilson: Well, because there's a possibility
that a God or gods, I don't think it would

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:34.950
resemble anything of the Judeo-Christian variety
or a super intelligent force came along, started

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.130
the universe with a big bang and then moved
on to the next creation. I, I can't discount

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.130
that.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.130
[end of clip]

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.220
&gt;&gt;Steve: A lot of the conversation about science
and religion in terms of how you understand

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.590
a few key words like, God, religion and transcendence,
and a great deal also rides on how much of

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.910
reality you think can be explained by science.
One of my favorite interviews was with Karen

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.970
Armstrong, a British historian who's written
a number of best-selling books, including

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.020
"A History of God" and a memoir, "A Spiral
Staircase," which charts her own spiritual

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.300
journey from a young nun in a convent to atheist
to how she now describes herself: a freelance

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.220
monotheist. Don't ask. Her definition of religion
is really interesting. She says, "None of

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.280
the great religious prophets cared about big
metaphysical systems or even about theology."

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.490
[pause]

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.110
[plays radio clip]

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.310
&gt;&gt;Karen: Jesus did not spend a great deal
of time discoursing about the Trinity or original

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:43.350
sin or the incarnation, or the atonement,
which preoccupied later Christians. He went

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:51.290
around doing good, being compassionate. And
in the Koran, metaphysical speculation is

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:58.940
regarded as self-indulgent guesswork, [inaudible
 ], and it makes people, the Koran says, quarrelsome

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.650
and stupidly sectarian. You can't prove these
things one way or the other, so why quarrel

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:12.220
about it?" And, I think, sometimes the way
monotheists talk about God is unreligious.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.750
&gt;&gt;Steve: And unreligious, like, the personal
God, for instance?

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.200
&gt;&gt;Karen: Yes, because people very often talk
about it as though he's a kind of acquaintance

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.500
and whom they can second guess. People will
say, God loves that. God wills that and God

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.770
despises the other, and very often, the opinions
of the deity are made to coincide exactly

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.840
with those of the speaker.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.620
&gt;&gt;Steve: And yet, we certainly see talk of
a personal God in various sacred texts. I

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.620
mean, the--

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.620
&gt;&gt;Karen: Yes.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.620
&gt;&gt;Steve: people are just making that up.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.490
&gt;&gt;Karen: No, but the great theologians in
Judaism and Christianity and Islam say yes,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:52.330
you begin with an idea of a God who is personal,
but God transcends personality as God transcends

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.700
every other human characteristic, such as
gender. You know, very often people hear about

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.841
God at about the same time as they're learning
about Santa Claus.

00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:01.841
&gt;&gt;Steve: Hmm.

00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.890
&gt;&gt;Karen: But their ideas of Santa Claus mature
and change in time, but their idea of God

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.890
remains infantile.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.980
&gt;&gt;Steve: What about the supernatural, though?
Do you need any--

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.980
&gt;&gt;Karen: No.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.150
&gt;&gt;Steve: sense of the miraculous or of things
that cannot be explained by science, by this

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.150
world?

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:24.760
&gt;&gt;Karen: I think religions hold us in an attitude
of awe and wonder. People such as the Buddha

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.590
thought miracles were vulgar displays of power
and often displays of ego. If you look at

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.250
the miracles attributed to Jesus, the healing
miracles, they generally had some kind of

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:44.470
symbolic aspect about healing the soul, rather
than showily; showing off a supernatural power

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.050
because that can be an exercise in ego to
some, too.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.330
[end of clip]

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:53.110
&gt;&gt;Steve: Now, as you might guess, Richard
Dawkins has a very different understanding

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.571
of religion. Of course, Dawkins is an eminent
biologist and the world's most famous atheist

00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:03.020
and he's a really fun person to interview
because he does not mince words. And I'm gonna

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.030
play a short excerpt from our interview, which
was somewhat contentious, but a lot of fun.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.310
[plays radio clip]

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.570
&gt;&gt;Richard: I think that religious belief is
a scientific belief in the sense that it makes

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.080
claims about the universe, which are, essentially,
scientific claims.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.240
&gt;&gt;Steve: What about the old adage that science
deals with the "how" questions and religion

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.550
deals with the "why" questions?

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:33.240
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes, I think that's remarkably
stupid, if I may say so. What on earth is

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.460
a "why" question? There are why questions
that mean something in a Darwinian world.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.890
We say, "Why do birds have wings to fly with?"
They don't mean that though. They mean "why"

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.000
in a sort of deliberate, purposeful sense.
Those of us who don't believe in religion,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.480
supernatural religion, would say there is
no such thing as a "why" question in that

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.710
sense. Now, the mere fact that you can frame
an English sentence beginning with the word

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:04.880
"why" does not mean that that English sentence
deserves or should receive an answer. I could

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.170
say, "Why are unicorns hollow?" It's a perfectly
good English sentence. It appears to mean

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.680
something, but you don't think that it deserves
an answer.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.390
&gt;&gt;Steve: But it seems to me, the big why questions
are, "Why are we here?" and "What is our purpose

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.671
in life?" Ok, that's a "what" question, but
it's basically a "why" question, and--

00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:25.620
&gt;&gt;Richard: No, that's right. It is a "why"
question, but it's not a question that deserves

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.620
an answer.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.770
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, but I think most people would
say those questions which are central to the

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.570
way most people think about their lives, I
mean, those are the big existential questions,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.830
but those are also questions that are beyond
science.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: If you mean, what is the purpose
of the existence of the universe, then I'm

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.950
saying that is quite simply begging the question,
"If you happen to be religious, you think

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.760
that's a meaningful question." Those of us
who don't believe in a God will say, "That

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.850
is as illegitimate as the question 'Why are
unicorns hollow?'" It just shouldn't be put.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.580
It's not a proper question to put. It doesn't
deserve an answer.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.290
&gt;&gt;Steve: I guess I don't understand then.
I mean, doesn't every person wonder about

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.370
that? I mean, isn't that just this core question
of what are doing in this world? Doesn't everyone

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.370
struggle with that?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.340
&gt;&gt;Richard: Here's the, there are core questions.
There are core questions like, "How did the

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.050
universe begin?" "Where do the laws of physics
come from?" "Where does life come from?" "Why,

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.500
after some period of billions of years, did
life originate on this planet and then start

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.610
evolving?" Those are all perfectly legitimate
questions to which science can give answers.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.680
If not now, than we hope in the future. There
may be some very, very deep questions, perhaps

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.420
even "where did the laws of physics come from?"
that science will never answer. That is perfectly

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.779
possible. I'm hopeful, along with some physicists,
that science will one day answer that question,

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:48.080
but even if they don't, even if there are
some supremely deep questions to which science

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.671
can never answer, what on earth makes you
think that religion can answer those questions?

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:58.630
&gt;&gt;Steve: I'm not saying that religion can
answer, but I guess my point is that people

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.910
still ask those questions and as you very
articulately said, they seem to be beyond

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:09.010
the purview of science, but aren't they still
legitimate questions to ask? Even if, even

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.480
if you can't get any definitive answer.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.180
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well, a legitimate question is,
"Where do the laws of physics come from?"

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.481
An illegitimate question, in my view, is,
"What is the purpose of the laws of physics?"

00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:22.730
Because what is the purpose of the laws of
physics implies that there's some kind of

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.900
deliberate purpose-giver or purpose-thinker,
which begs the question we're trying to answer,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.110
which is, "Is there a God?"

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.110
[end of clip]

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.910
&gt;&gt;Steve: So, that is Richard Dawkins. Now,
I have to tell you it's really hard to get

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:40.000
a clear understanding of the words God and
religion. Take the case of Albert Einstein.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.760
There's a huge debate right now between religious
believers and atheists over who gets to claim

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.230
Einstein, the most famous scientist of the
last century. And it's because Einstein, himself,

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:54.740
made a number of rather cryptic comments.
He called himself a "deeply religious non-believer."

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.660
He said, "Science without religion is lame,
religion without science is blind." And most

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.020
famously he claimed, "God does not play dice
with the universe." So, the question is who

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.570
is this God that Einstein was talking about?
I'm gonna play you several different responses.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.370
The first is from Elaine Pagels, the famous
scholar of the Gnostic Gospels, whose late

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.529
husband was the noted physicist, Heinz Pagels.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:18.320
[plays radio clip]

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:25.300
&gt;&gt;Elaine: You know, part of the problem there
is that Einstein used the language about God

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.130
as a conscious metaphor. When he said, "God
doesn't play dice with the universe," that

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:34.560
is, he meant the universe is not put together
in an accidental way. Einstein was speaking

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.860
about God in the way that physicists would,
aware that language like that is always going

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.431
to be metaphorical; speaking about something
beyond our understanding.

00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:44.580
[end of clip]

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.880
&gt;&gt;Steve: The Nobel Prize winning physicist
and atheist, Steven Weinberg, has a different

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.529
take. He says Einstein was just using poetic
language when he talked about religion, which

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:56.230
from Weinberg's perspective was a big mistake.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.500
[plays radio clip]

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:05.250
&gt;&gt;Steven: Einstein, in a letter to a friend
of his, famously explained that he did not

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.070
believe in a God who cared about human beings,
who was concerned with human affairs; that

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.210
for him, God was a synonym for harmony and
order in the universe. In other words, when

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.970
Einstein says, "God," he really is talking
about the laws of nature or whatever fundamental

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:29.010
principle governs the universe. Clearly, what
he meant by "God" is so vague and so far from

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:36.620
conventional religion that it seems to me
a misuse of the word. I think the concept

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:42.040
of God has historically had a fairly definite
meaning, of course, people have argued endlessly

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.880
about the attributes of God, but there were
common features that God was conscious, that

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.250
God was powerful, that God was benevolent
to some extent. If you're not going to use

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:58.850
the word God to mean something like that,
something like its historical meaning, then

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.401
I don't think you should use the word.

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:01.730
[end of clip]

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.920
&gt;&gt;Steve: For a very different view, let's
turn to Einstein's most recent biographer,

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.180
Walter Isaacson. He says it's a mistake to
dismiss Einstein's comments as strictly metaphorical.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.649
Isaacson claims that Einstein knew exactly
what he was doing when he used words like

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:17.690
God and religion.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.210
[plays radio clip]

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:26.970
&gt;&gt;Walter: At one point, some cardinal in Boston
said, "Well, it still smacks of atheism cause

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:32.490
it's not a personal God." So, Rabbi Goldstein,
head of the Reform Jewish Movement in New

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.680
York, sends him a telegram and says, "Do you
or do you not believe in God, Einstein? Answer

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.600
in 50 words or less." And Einstein says, "I
believe in Spinoza's God; a God who's spirit

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.839
is manifest in the harmonies of the universe."
I think the most important thing for Einstein

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:55.640
is that there was a sense of humility. We
do not know the answer here, but he did say

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.080
he did have a belief in what he called his
God and a God as a creator.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.560
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, I think a lot of people just
see this as, "Oh, he was exercising his poetic

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:11.310
license." He wanted to use God a kind of a
synonym for mystery or something like that,

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.660
but he took that word more seriously.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:20.270
&gt;&gt;Walter: When he was asked whether he was
using the word just symbolically or whatever,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.630
he said, "No." He wasn't. He considered himself
having a cosmic religion. He thought there

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:32.300
was a spirit manifest in the laws of the universe
and to him that was his notion of God. Now,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.390
I know I've read Richard Dawson who say's
it's much more figurative. People kept saying,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.950
"Well, you're just speaking figuratively."
And he says, "No."

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.160
[end of clip]

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.000
&gt;&gt;Steve: There is, by the way, another really
interesting piece of history. Many of the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.720
major figures in the development of 20th Century
physics, especially quantum physics, were

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.730
fascinated by spiritual and philosophical
ideas. Schrodinger had a profound satory experience

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.640
and he was deeply influenced by Vedantic Hinduism.
Heisenberg had similar experiences. Wolfgang

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.909
Pauli was a patient of Carl Jung and they
carried on a correspondence for more than

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:10.419
30 years. In fact, Pauli became convinced
that certain strange paranormal experiences

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:15.040
were real and there was the well-known Pauli
Effect. When he walked into the labs of other

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.169
scientists, their equipment kept breaking
to the point where they actually told him

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:25.549
to stay away. Apparently, this did not happen
in Pauli's own laboratory. Then a little later,

00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:30.489
David Bohm, whom Einstein once considered
his successor, had a very intense friendship

00:17:30.489 --> 00:17:35.230
with the Indian mystic, Krishnamurti. These
were all great, hardnosed scientists, but

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.520
they were also philosophers who were humbled
by the revelations of modern physics. They

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.179
thought the nature of material reality was
profoundly mysterious and my guess is they

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:49.540
would find Stephen Hawkings recent comments
about God and the death of philosophy to be

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.590
a bit simplistic. I wanna come back to the
question of language because it's so important

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.460
to the public conversation about science and
religion. There's a really fascinating movement

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.980
right now among some secular scientists and
philosophers. They tend to go by the name

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.499
Religious Naturalists and these people want
to appropriate the word religion. And while

00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:15.399
they don't believe in God, they're impatient
with a hardcore atheists who simply want to

00:18:15.399 --> 00:18:19.980
dismiss religion. One of the most provocative
arguments comes from the biologist Stewart

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:25.799
Kauffman, one of the gurus of complexity theory
and a recipient of a MacArthur Genius Award.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:29.600
He doesn't just want to reclaim the word religion;
he wants to change the meaning of the word

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.429
God. Kauffman wrote a book called "Reinventing
the Sacred," but his notion of the sacred

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:39.351
is rooted in science. He talks about God as
the ceaseless creativity in the universe,

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:44.190
which he calls "stunning, awesome and worthy
of reverence." And he rejects the scientific

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.700
idea that everything can be reduced ultimately
to the laws of physics. Kauffman believes

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:54.619
that biology has its own unpredictable properties
and he says, "Life, value, meaning and consciousness

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:59.110
are all things that emerge as part of this
creative universe." But I still wasn't clear

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.489
why he wanted to invent a whole new meaning
for the word God.

00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:08.279
[plays radio clip]

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:15.090
&gt;&gt;Stewart: God is the most powerful symbol
humanity has created. We've been worshipping

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:21.230
God or gods at least since the sacred Earth
Mother, ten thousand years ago in Europe.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:28.279
Whether it's the creator, transcendent God
of the Abrahamic tradition or other notions

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:37.739
of God, God carries with it a sense of awe,
reverence, wonder that no other symbol carries.

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:45.389
Now, we have our choice. Is it more astonishing
to believe that a creator God created everything

00:19:45.389 --> 00:19:52.249
that has come to exist; the planets, the galaxies,
chemistry, life, consciousness, agency in

00:19:52.249 --> 00:20:00.549
six days? Or, is it equally or even more astonishing
and awesome to believe what is almost certainly

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:04.149
the truth? Namely, that all of this came to
be all on its own.

00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:08.100
&gt;&gt;Steve: Ok, you can say all that, but you
don't have to talk about God. And yet, you,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.929
for some reason want to invoke--

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:11.389
&gt;&gt;Stewart: I want to invoke God.

00:20:11.389 --> 00:20:12.389
&gt;&gt;Steve: Yeah, why?

00:20:12.389 --> 00:20:18.730
&gt;&gt;Stewart: It is precisely to say that God
is nature, or God is in nature. And that's

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:27.220
the God of Spinoza. That's the God that Einstein
believed in. If we can transfer our secular

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:36.249
humanist, consumerist world view into one
in which we have this sense of responsibility,

00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:45.919
awe and wonder for all life, we are inventing
a global ethic that we don't have now, yet

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:49.629
we need it to sustain the global civilization
that's emerging.

00:20:49.629 --> 00:20:51.159
[end of clip]

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:55.759
&gt;&gt;Steve: Clearly, one of the big landmines
in the science and religion debate is evolution.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:21:00.509
Various polls show that roughly half of all
Americans believe the Earth is no more than

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:04.749
ten thousand years old, and three quarters
of Americans say the Bible is the word of

00:21:04.749 --> 00:21:10.169
God. This may be partly a reaction to comments
by certain atheists, for instance the philosopher

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:15.039
Daniel Dennett has talked about Darwinism
as a kind of universal asset; it eats away

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:20.470
at everything it touches including, in his
view, God as creator. To me, the biggest intellectual

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.529
challenge that the theory of evolution poses
to religion has nothing to do with the story

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:29.440
of Genesis. It's very obvious that you cannot
reconcile a literal reading of the Bible with

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.179
modern science. The real question is whether
you can believe in both underlying purpose

00:21:34.179 --> 00:21:40.350
and natural selection; this very gradual process
of random genetic mutations. Steven Jay Gould

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.129
believed that if you reran the tape of evolution,
you would get a totally different result.

00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:49.230
You would certainly not end up with human
beings again. And his view has major theological

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.870
implications. It raises the specter that humans
are just a lucky, evolutionary accident with

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.409
no inherent meaning or purpose. So, I don't
think it's surprising that many religious

00:21:58.409 --> 00:22:02.779
believers find evolution very troubling.
Now in my mind, one of the most intriguing

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:08.779
responses to Gould comes from the Cambridge
University Paleontologist Simon Conway Morris.

00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:13.629
His theory of convergence argues that the
outcomes of evolution are highly constrained;

00:22:13.629 --> 00:22:17.940
there are only so many ways that creatures
can evolve. The most controversial part of

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.460
his argument is his claim that the evolution
of Homo sapiens, or intelligent creatures

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.029
very much like us, was inevitable once life
started on Earth.

00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:32.989
[plays radio clip]

00:22:32.989 --> 00:22:40.980
&gt;&gt;Simon: Practically everything which makes
us human is already present in a nascent form

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.820
in one or other group of animals. This is
not to say that every single species on a

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.570
planet is trying to turn into humans. What
I'm trying to say is that because of the striking

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:56.600
convergences in the mental worlds, famously
between crows and the great expert also, dolphins.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.649
From that perspective, if we're first on the
block, fine. But there are many other groups

00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:02.230
of animals which are really not so far behind.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.860
&gt;&gt;Steve: But aren't human beings here by a
massive stroke of luck? I mean the asteroid

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.019
that hit the Earth 63 million years ago that
wiped out the dinosaurs and if that asteroid

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:17.379
had never hit, wouldn't dinosaurs have continued
to dominate the Earth and prevent large mammals

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:18.690
from evolving, including humans?

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.940
&gt;&gt;Simon: Oh, I think that's absolutely correct.
I think that if the asteroid had sailed past

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.359
harmlessly and thank goodness many asteroids
do, then indeed, the dinosaurs would be here

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:32.100
at the present day. But what I want you to
now imagine, in fact, is we've now gotta fast

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.580
forward our conversation by about 30 million
years. And I'm afraid I have to tell you that

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.729
dinosaurs have now disappeared; they've been
hunted to extinction and we're still sitting

00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:43.309
in the studio and we are using an advanced
technology.

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:45.370
&gt;&gt;Steve: Who hunted the dinosaurs into extinction?

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:50.451
&gt;&gt;Simon: One or other group of warm-blooded
creatures. It could've been the birds, sometimes

00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:56.100
underestimated, but more likely I think the
mammals. So, the asteroid hits, bang, ok,

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.269
right, dinosaurs gone, big reptiles gone.
Birds and mammals look at each other and say,

00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:05.029
"Well, this is a wonderful opportunity. Let's
evolve." But, that asteroid misses; it's a

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:10.760
counterfactual history. What's gonna happen?
Well, my view is fortunately for us, but unfortunately

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.600
for dinosaurs, round about 20 million years
off, the asteroid missed, the world is actually

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.070
beginning to get surprisingly cold. We're
starting the great Ice Ages, which culminated

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:27.529
in the last three or four million years. Now,
in this counterfactual world, you've got the

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:32.360
temperate and the Polar Regions, which are
persistently cold. Now, we have good reason

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.950
to think that dinosaurs are not effectively
warm-blooded. We know that birds and mammals,

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.629
by and large, are more intelligent than the
reptiles. We know that they're more socially

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:46.090
adept and we know convergently, that they
evolve a prototechnology; they're tool-makers.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.739
So then one says, "What's gonna happen next?"
Well, my sense would be that sooner or later

00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:55.559
one or other group of hunters is gonna emerge.
It doesn't have to be exactly the same history

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:59.870
as what he had on this planet, but the end
result will be the same. What happened when

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.840
the hunting really got going, especially North
America and to some extent Africa and also

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:10.389
Australia, is all the big mammals disappeared.
What would have happened in that counterfactual

00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:15.129
world would have been that a Tyrannosaurus
going down under a hail of arrows and spears,

00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:18.149
rather than the mastodon, for instance, in
North America.

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:19.169
[end of clip]

00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:24.169
&gt;&gt;Steve: I should add that Simon Conway Morris
is a Christian. He believes evolution has

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:28.940
direction, but he's very cautious about saying
it has some purpose, or endpoint. He says

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:34.580
those are religious ideas rather than scientific
concepts. Francis Collins is another prominent

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.169
Christian scientist and he may be uniquely
situated in playing a key role in the science

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:43.239
and religion debate as the former head of
the Human Genome Project and the current Director

00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:48.139
of the National Institutes of Health. He's
one of America's most visible scientists and

00:25:48.139 --> 00:25:52.831
he has impeccable scientific credentials;
a medical degree as well as a PhD in Quantum

00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:58.130
Mechanics. He has a distinguished track record
as a gene hunter. He's also an Evangelical

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:03.460
Christian, someone who has no qualms about
professing his belief in miracles or seeing

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.259
God's hand behind all of creation. In his
book, "The Language of God," he tries to stake

00:26:08.259 --> 00:26:13.889
out the middle ground between Darwinian atheists
and religious fundamentalists. I asked Francis

00:26:13.889 --> 00:26:18.269
Collins the same question I asked Simon Conway
Morris, "Isn't it a lucky accident the asteroid

00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:22.570
wiped out the dinosaurs paving the way, eventually,
for humans?" Here is his answer.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.929
[plays radio clip]

00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:32.710
&gt;&gt;Francis: I don't think so. I can see the
arguments that you just voiced and why they

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.779
trouble people, but they are based upon the
idea that God has the same limitations that

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:44.629
we do. We are limited to the arrow of time.
We cannot contemplate what it is like to be

00:26:44.629 --> 00:26:49.220
able to affect the future and the present
and the past all at once. But God is not so

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.999
limited. What appears random to us, such as
an asteroid hitting the Earth, need not have

00:26:54.999 --> 00:27:00.019
been random to Him at all. As soon as you
accept the idea of God as creator, then the

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:02.359
randomness argument essentially goes out the
window.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:07.019
&gt;&gt;Steve: Now, is this to say that God set
that asteroid in motion that wiped out the

00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:10.019
dinosaurs so that eventually human beings
could evolve?

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:15.309
&gt;&gt;Francis: Oh, goodness. That's getting into
more specific details than I would dare to

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:22.159
imagine, but I would dare to say that God
had a plan of creatures like us. Need they

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:29.749
have looked exactly like us, or is "in his
image" an indication of the spirit, the moral

00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:35.989
law, the free will, the sense of who we are,
the consciousness? In which case, perhaps

00:27:35.989 --> 00:27:40.380
it didn't matter so much whether that ended
up occurring in mammals or some other life

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.380
form.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.810
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, I guess I'm trying to figure
out if you think that God intervenes in the

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:50.749
affairs of human beings? Because virtually
all of your arguments so far is no; God stays

00:27:50.749 --> 00:27:53.169
out of that realm of humanity.

00:27:53.169 --> 00:27:57.919
&gt;&gt;Francis: I think God can intervene. I think
that's what the great miracles are. Certainly

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:03.480
God intervened in the person of Jesus Christ
and in the most amazing miracle of all, the

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:10.580
resurrection. But I don't think God sort of
pops up in lots of circumstances and turns

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:16.679
around the course of events. I think those
are reserved for special moments of special

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:19.149
significance with a special lesson involved.

00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:24.391
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, I have to ask you about a couple
of the best known miracles in the Bible. Do

00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:25.460
you believe in the virgin birth?

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.460
&gt;&gt;Francis: I do.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.369
&gt;&gt;Steve: And the resurrection? Do you believe
that what was resurrected was the physical

00:28:31.369 --> 00:28:32.369
body of Jesus?

00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:37.380
&gt;&gt;Francis: Physical body, we should be careful
in terms of exactly what you mean by that.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.440
Does that mean the cellular structure was
exactly the same as it was when he was alive?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:48.559
I don't know, but I believe that he was resurrected
in physical form and seen by witnesses who

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:53.889
he spoke to before he then ascended. That
is the absolute cornerstone of the Christian

00:28:53.889 --> 00:28:54.889
faith.

00:28:54.889 --> 00:29:01.140
&gt;&gt;Steve: But how can you, as a scientist,
accept some of these ideas in the Bible because

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.769
they cut so directly against the laws of nature?

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:09.919
&gt;&gt;Francis: I have no trouble at all because
again, the big decision is do you believe

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:16.749
in God? If you believe in God and if God is
more than nature then there's no reason that

00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:22.479
God could not stage an invasion into the natural
world, which to our limited perspective would

00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:23.600
appear to be a miracle.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.250
[end of clip]

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.619
&gt;&gt;Steve: One of the major point of contention
in the whole science and religion debate is

00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:34.859
about consciousness, specifically, the relationship
between brain and mind. And the big question

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:39.020
is whether the mind is strictly a product
of the physical mechanics of the brain; the

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.570
neurons and synaptic connections. I actually
think this, and not evolution, is now the

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:48.109
cutting edge of the science and religion debate.
Think about it. If your mind can communicate

00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:53.009
with God or some kind of larger intelligence,
or if there really is life after death, then

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:57.929
consciousness must go beyond the purely physical
mechanics of the brain. There are really two

00:29:57.929 --> 00:30:02.470
questions here. First, is there any part of
the mind that can operate independently of

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.519
the brain? And second, will brain science
ever be able to explain how the mind works?

00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:11.479
I've asked lots of people these questions
and here's an excerpt from my interview with

00:30:11.479 --> 00:30:16.499
the philosopher Daniel Dennett, who makes
the argument for a materialist view of consciousness.

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:19.529
[plays radio clip]

00:30:19.529 --> 00:30:24.529
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Well, there's lots of puzzles and
there aren't any mysteries. I don't think

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:31.809
we have any truly, mind boggling, perplexities.
There's plenty of very hard problems out there,

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:33.489
but I don't consciousness is a mystery.

00:30:33.489 --> 00:30:37.320
&gt;&gt;Steve: But there are all kinds of things
I can't imagine how science will ever be able

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.200
to explain. For instance, the precise nature
of how we love someone else. I mean, I'm not

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.330
talking about the sex drive here, but I'm
talking about the mystery of love or why we

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:53.720
have certain kinds of dreams and dreams, of
course, are not rooted at all in the physical

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.909
world. I mean, if you dissect the brain somehow
and look at all the neural connections, you

00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:59.841
think science will ever be able to explain
those things?

00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:04.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Sure. In what sense of explain?
Let's, let's build up to it cause science

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.960
doesn't do this all in one, one fell swoop;
it's modest in-roads. Would you find it just

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:17.919
unimaginable that science might, in oh, the
next 15 or 20 years, be able to read people's

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:22.249
brains while they sleep and then write down
what they're actually dreaming? Would you

00:31:22.249 --> 00:31:23.599
give me that kind of mind reading?

00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:25.269
&gt;&gt;Steve: I don't think I would.

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:26.840
&gt;&gt;Daniel: We can't do it yet. We can do it
a little bit.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.250
&gt;&gt;Steve: I don't give you that, actually.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.250
[Steve laughs]

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.169
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Well, well, than hang on to your
hat.

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:32.169
&gt;&gt;Steve: Ok.

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:33.169
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That's coming. We can--

00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:37.399
&gt;&gt;Steve: You're saying science will be able
to do that without any kind of self-reporting

00:31:37.399 --> 00:31:38.399
by the dreamer?

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:42.489
&gt;&gt;Daniel: No, we'll use waking reports by
dreamers of course to calibrate the instruments

00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:45.359
and understand how to decode the neural signals.

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:49.299
&gt;&gt;Steve: See, that's my point. That's my point.
If you don't actually ask the person what

00:31:49.299 --> 00:31:52.460
their dreaming, will you ever be able to decipher
the dreams?

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.479
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Well, let's build up to it then.
So, we ask the person what they're dreaming

00:31:56.479 --> 00:32:03.859
for a hundred nights and we build up a nice
library and we translate the relevant brain

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:08.009
states for that person and it will probably
go person for person. I don't suppose it's

00:32:08.009 --> 00:32:12.029
gonna be the same from one brain to the next,
but then the idea that one might then be able

00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:17.539
to say a little bit later, "Oh, look, look.
Jones is having that dream about the old car

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:22.190
and look, he's falling over a cliff now."
And we wake him up and that's what he reports.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.700
If you think that's just beyond the reach
of science, I think you're wrong.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.549
&gt;&gt;Steve: But that's just correlation. That's
just--

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:29.549
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That's right.

00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:33.490
&gt;&gt;Steve: You're just looking at what so-and-so
has dreamed and you're just gonna match the

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:40.039
brain imaging to some future dream. That still
doesn't explain how, within the brain, that

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:41.779
particular kind of dream is generated.

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:46.029
&gt;Daniel: Well, so we'll have to do that, too.
But I think we're making good progress on

00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:50.019
that, too. We can't do that now. Might we
do that in the future? Certainly.

00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:51.769
[end of clip]

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:56.419
&gt;&gt;Steve: Ken Wilber is a very different kind
of philosopher. Unlike the reductionism of

00:32:56.419 --> 00:33:01.700
Dan Dennett, Wilber embraces what he calls
an integral philosophy; a theory of consciousness

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.820
with an explicitly spiritual dimension. He
says a materialist understanding of consciousness

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.229
simply doesn't get you anywhere.

00:33:08.229 --> 00:33:10.469
[plays radio clip]

00:33:10.469 --> 00:33:18.150
&gt;&gt;Ken: If you're looking just material stuff,
like a planet, it doesn't have life on it

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.200
or a rock. A physicist can tell you where
that planet's gonna be, barring other forces,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.739
a thousand years from now. But that physicist
cannot tell you where my dog's gonna be two

00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:30.451
seconds from now. It reduces everything. I
mean, if that's the case, then your statement

00:33:30.451 --> 00:33:35.710
itself and your awareness is nothing but neurochemical
fireworks and you can make no distinctions

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.649
of value. There is no such thing as love is
better than hate. All those value distinctions

00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:41.869
are erased.

00:33:41.869 --> 00:33:45.519
&gt;&gt;Steve: You can't make the value distinctions,
but is there still anything to say that that

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:46.610
scientific view is wrong?

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:52.859
&gt;&gt;Ken: Well, at this point of course, you
enter the philosophy of science and the argument

00:33:52.859 --> 00:33:58.580
is endless. Is there nothing but physical
stuff in the universe, or is there some sort

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.299
of interiority? Not, I'm not talking about
ghosts and goblins and souls and all that

00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:07.580
kind of stuff; just is there interiority?
Is there an inside to the universe? And if

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:13.649
there is interiority, as there is exteriority,
then that interiority is where consciousness

00:34:13.649 --> 00:34:17.860
resides and where values reside. And you can't
see that, but it's real.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.069
[end of clip]

00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:23.740
&gt;&gt;Steve: I've put the brain-mind question
to dozens of people in my interviews and I've

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.020
gotten lots of different answers. Even prominent
atheists are all over the map on the question

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.929
of consciousness. Unlike Dennett, Richard
Dawkins told me, and I quote, "Consciousness

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:39.980
is the biggest puzzle facing biology, neurobiology,
computational studies and evolutionary biology.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:45.210
It is a very, very big problem." Steven Pinker,
the well-known cognitive psychologist, does

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.750
not think science will ever figure out how
the mind works by studying neurons and brain

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:54.020
chemistry. To understand the mind, he says
you have to look at higher levels of mental

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.520
organization. Then there's Sam Harris, who
may be the most vicious critic of religion

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:04.029
of them all, but he's also a long-time Buddhist
mediator who's quite open about his own spiritual

00:35:04.029 --> 00:35:09.279
experiences and to my astonishment, he even
told me about having had telepathic experiences.

00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:11.661
Here's the very end of my interview with Sam
Harris.

00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:15.920
[plays radio clip]

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.579
&gt;&gt;Steve: You are a neuroscientist. Do you
think there's any chance that human consciousness

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:22.789
can survive after death?

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:30.549
&gt;&gt;Sam: I just don't know. One thing I can
tell you is that we don't know what the actual

00:35:30.549 --> 00:35:36.420
relationship between consciousnesses in the
physical world is. There are good reasons

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:42.569
to be skeptical of the naive conception of
a soul. We know that almost everything we

00:35:42.569 --> 00:35:47.340
take ourselves to be, subjectively, all of
our cognitive powers, our ability to understand

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:53.630
language, this is mediated by the brain and
yet, we do not know what the relationship

00:35:53.630 --> 00:36:00.450
between subjectivity and objectivity ultimately
is. And for instance, yeah, we could be living

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:05.309
in a universe where consciousness goes all
the way down to the bedrock so that there

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:11.390
is some interior subjective dimension to an
electron, say. And we would not expect to

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:16.900
see any evidence of this, and so I'm actually
quite skeptical of our ever being able to

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:22.300
resolve that question; what the real relationship
between consciousness and matter ultimately

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.300
is.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.460
&gt;&gt;Steve: That's interesting, though, because
most evolutionary biologists, I mean, particularly

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.500
thinking the secular ones, would say, "Of
course, consciousness cannot survive the brain.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.200
It will not survive death." You are not willing
to make that claim.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:42.860
&gt;&gt;Sam: Yeah, I just don't know. I'm just trying
to be honest about my gradations of uncertainty

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.130
and I think consciousness poses a unique problem.
And if we were living in a universe where

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:53.720
consciousness survived death, in some sense,
or just transcended the brain so that single

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.910
neurons were conscious, we would not expect
to see it by our present techniques of neuroimaging

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:04.140
or cellular neuroscience. And we would never
expect to see it.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.150
[end of clip]

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:10.000
&gt;&gt;Steve: Now, I should say that even if you
reject the materialist understanding of consciousness,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.779
you don't necessarily get to God. Sam Harris
certainly doesn't think so. What it does mean

00:37:14.779 --> 00:37:18.780
is that you believe there are other dimensions
of reality that contemporary science has a

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:24.400
very hard time explaining and it opens the
door to various spiritual realities. Now I

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.839
have to say, I'm particularly fascinated by
mystical experience and this is partly what

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:34.089
led me, surprisingly, to Jane Goodall, the
famed field biologist. Her discoveries about

00:37:34.089 --> 00:37:39.029
chimpanzees revolutionized the field of primatology
and really, our understanding of what it means

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:44.040
to be human. What is less well-known is that
Goodall also has a mystical side and in fact,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.720
even talks about having had a paranormal vision
of her dead husband. And on a personal note,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.170
I will add that Jane Goodall was my hero.
When I was growing up, I wanted be like her

00:37:54.170 --> 00:38:00.930
and I was an intern at the National Zoo's
field station in Front Royal, Virginia. And

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.029
right when I finished high school, I spend
six months out there because I wanted to do

00:38:05.029 --> 00:38:09.829
what Jane Goodall did. Well, it didn't work
out that way and here I am in public radio

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:14.190
and I have the great privilege of interviewing
people like Jane Goodall. And here is a portion

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.190
of that interview.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.130
[plays radio clip]

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:25.860
&gt;&gt;Steve: Did you find yourself wondering what
was happening inside the mind of a chimpanzee?

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:32.319
&gt;&gt;Jane: Constantly. I still maintain if I
could be inside the mind of a chimpanzee for

00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:39.599
just a few minutes, I would learn more about
them than another goodness knows how many

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:43.990
years of study. Cause we can guess what they're
thinking, but how do they think? How do they

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:49.849
think? Are they thinking in pictures? How
do you think without words? I spent ages thinking

00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:51.210
about that, wondering about it.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:56.180
&gt;&gt;Steve: Were there any particular moments
when you felt like you had a better understanding

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.180
of that?

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.869
&gt;&gt;Jane: One moment was very, very special
and that was when I was sitting in the forest

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:07.569
with David Greybeard and I picked up a fruit
and held it out to him and he turned his head

00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:13.020
away and I put my hand closer. And he turned,
looking directly into my eyes, he reached

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:18.059
out, took the fruit, dropped it; he really
didn't want it and then he very gently squeezed

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:25.289
my hand, which is how chimpanzees reassure
each other. And so, in that moment we communicated

00:39:25.289 --> 00:39:33.740
in a way that seems to pre-date words, perhaps
in a way that was used by our own common ancestor,

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.320
millions of years ago. And it was an extraordinary
feeling. It was bridging these two worlds.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.150
&gt;&gt;Steve: Sounds like you're very drawn to
this whole idea of somehow knowing the world

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.711
without language, without words.

00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:53.650
&gt;&gt;Jane: I am fascinated by it; I always have
been. When we think with words and when we

00:39:53.650 --> 00:40:00.869
don't think with words, I think we come close
to what mystics might describe as a mystical

00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:04.750
experience because I don't think that words
would come into that.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:09.220
&gt;&gt;Steve: Did you have any experiences like
that at Gombe? I mean, what we would call

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.269
mystical experiences?

00:40:10.269 --> 00:40:17.030
&gt;&gt;Jane: Yeah, sometimes. One was just when
I'd been following a little group of chimpanzees

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:23.619
and I was very wet and they climbed in the
evening up into this tree which had new shoots

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:29.150
of beautiful lime green and the sun behind
them was making them shine and the trunks

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:35.200
of the trees were still wet and the chimpanzees
coats were black ebony shot with little gleams

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.960
of chestnut and the smell of ripe figs was
strong in the air and then this beautiful

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.849
male bush buck appeared with his coat dark
with the rain, and his spiraled horns gleaming

00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:52.321
and just stood there. And it seemed I could
hear the insects really loud and clear and

00:40:52.321 --> 00:41:00.319
it was, it was just incredibly vivid beingness
and being at one with that beautiful world.

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:03.290
&gt;&gt;Steve: Sounds like you lost your sense of
your own self.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:08.710
&gt;&gt;Jane: Well, that's it. Totally losing sense
of one's own self and that's the only way

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.349
I can really study animals because if I'm
on my own, I forget that I'm there.

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:14.349
[end of clip]

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:17.950
&gt;&gt;Steve: Now, I was going to end with that
excerpt, but if you will indulge me, I wanna

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:23.690
play one last clip. This, from a second interview
with Richard Dawkins when he came through

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:28.500
Madison, where I live not long ago because
it pertains to these questions about how we

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.960
define religion. And frankly, for a radio
guy, Dawkins is just irresistible.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.190
[plays radio clip]

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:40.500
&gt;&gt;Steve: I came across a book that has just
come out by Chris Hedges, the former New York

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.950
Times reporter. The book is called, "I Don't
Believe in Atheists," and I wanna quote a

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:50.880
passage from his book and get your reaction.
He writes, "The question is not whether God

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.920
exists. It is whether we contemplate or are
utterly indifferent to the transcendent, that

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.619
which cannot be measured or quantified, that
which lies beyond the reach of rational deduction.

00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:06.400
We all encounter this aspect of existence
in love, beauty, alienation, loneliness, suffering,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.750
good, evil and the reality of death. These
powerful, non-rational, super real forces

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:17.619
in human life are the domain of religion."
What do you make of that assessment of religion?

00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:18.770
&gt;&gt;Richard: Bullshit.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.770
[laughter]

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:25.740
I mean, let's go, let's go through that. Was
the word transcendent, I'd forgotten what--

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.019
&gt;&gt;Steve: Transcendent was one of his words,
yes.

00:42:28.019 --> 00:42:32.369
&gt;&gt;Richard: Ok, yes. Now, in science, there
are plenty of things that we don't know. So,

00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:35.760
that's the first thing to get out of the way;
science is not a kind of know-it-all, we've

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.069
got it all taped. There are going to be, in
the next few hundred years, new scientific

00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:46.480
discoveries, new scientific insights, new
scientific ideas, theories, which will be

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.270
mind-boggling. So, that's the first point.
Now, he then went on to things like love and--

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.270
&gt;&gt;Steve: Alienation.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.270
&gt;&gt;Richard: alienation--

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.270
&gt;&gt;Steve: Suffering and the reality of death.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:02.030
&gt;&gt;Richard: suffering. Ok, now these are, of
course, not immediately understandable by

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:06.690
science in detail. Just as when I look at
a computer, I don't actually understand every

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.910
detail of how it's doing what it, what it
is doing. However, that doesn't mean that

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:18.070
anything mystical is going on. That passage
you read to me is obscurantus rubbish because

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:23.950
it implies that that which is complicated
and therefore, hard to understand, is therefore

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:29.160
in principle, impossible to understand, which
means there's got to be something supernatural

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.670
going on. Supernatural means nothing. It explains
nothing. It's a cop-out.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.670
[end of clip]

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:34.980
&gt;&gt;Steve: And that is all. Thank you.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:41.080
[applause]

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:47.010
And I am happy to take question, comments.
I understand that I think you need to speak

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:51.140
into the microphone here, if you wanna do
that. So.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:44:02.930
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: I was actually just wondering
with, it seems like in the political discourse

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:09.359
lately there's a lot of religious questions
or conclusions being drawn. And it sounds

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:14.089
like they're very different from the questions
and conclusions of the people that you interviewed,

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:18.930
even the more religious ones. So, I was wondering
if you ever spoke with them about that, or

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:23.819
if they had any comments on how it's shaped
what's going on these days?

00:44:23.819 --> 00:44:29.150
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, to some degree I think you
can't avoid it. I mean, I find how religion

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:33.579
enters the political discourse to usually
not be, not be very interesting because it's

00:44:33.579 --> 00:44:38.849
just, it raises all of these gut reactions.
I will say that I think if you wanna trace

00:44:38.849 --> 00:44:44.890
why there is so much interest and attention
to the so-called new atheist in recent years

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:52.710
of, most prominently, Dawkins and Daniel Dennett
and Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, I really

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:57.461
think a lot of that is a reaction to 9/11
and they will say that. In effect, Sam Harris

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:02.460
will say that the reason that he wrote his
first book, The End of Faith, was explicitly

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:09.339
a reaction to his horror of the motivation
of the people who threw the, who flew the

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:14.900
planes into the Twin Towers. And also the
reaction among a lot of Americans to use religious

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.599
language in the, immediately the post 9/11
era. I mean, going back to George W. Bush,

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:26.029
talking about the Axis of Evil, so, I mean,
it would start, religious language was clearly

00:45:26.029 --> 00:45:33.309
entering the political discourse there and
the other piece of this is if you're an aspiring

00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:38.740
presidential candidate, you gotta cite your
religious credentials. You sorta have to show

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:44.589
that you, if not actually go to church, you
are respectful of religion, I mean, you're

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:48.549
gonna be in trouble if you don't. In fact,
a few years ago, there was a Congressman,

00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:54.579
Pete Stark in California, who actually made
news because he was apparently the first national

00:45:54.579 --> 00:45:59.540
politician who ever came out and said he was
an atheist, which is astonishing when you

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:04.900
think about it. So, I mean, it's a very loaded
question here. The questions that I'm interested

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.789
in are more the intellectual questions and
it's really the, I mean, on one level it's

00:46:09.789 --> 00:46:16.760
clear that you can reconcile science and religion.
I mean, you can say you believe everything

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.170
about modern science and you also believe
in God. The question is does that hold up

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.809
intellectually? I mean, that's really what
I'm interested in. I mean, and that's why

00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:29.089
I go through a lot of these different dimensions
and I think there are different answers depending

00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:33.631
on what specifically, what the question is
you're asking. So, I mean, there are, there

00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:39.619
are a certain set of issues that come up if
you're talking about the mind and the brain;

00:46:39.619 --> 00:46:44.569
consciousness. I mean, those are sort of neuroscience
questions as well as philosophy of mind questions.

00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:48.869
There are different questions that come up
in cosmology; origins of the universe, the

00:46:48.869 --> 00:46:54.630
Big Bang. And then there are all kinds of
different questions that come up in evolution,

00:46:54.630 --> 00:47:00.019
in, are we, is it just an accident that we're
here and then there are also separate religious

00:47:00.019 --> 00:47:05.200
questions as well. I mean, a big question
is how do you read the Bible or the Koran?

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.640
How do you read a sacred text? And, I mean,
it's obvious that you cannot read that literally

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.760
if you're going to accept modern science.
Ok, if you don't read it literally, how do

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.030
you read it? And those are, that's, that's
a really complicated subject and so, I have

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:23.290
several, I didn't go into that in the talk
here, but there are several people who kind

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:28.539
of wrestle with that question. I have a Muslim
astrophysicist who talks about that; who's

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:34.440
an observant Muslim, but he would also say
he doesn't believe in miracles and, but he

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:41.720
has a very interesting nuance take on his
understanding of Muhammad and where his visions

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:47.789
came from. And Elaine Pagels, the Gnostic
Gospels scholar who I played a very short

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:54.509
clip from her and really her project is to
try to go back to the early, a lot of the

00:47:54.509 --> 00:48:00.339
early Christian texts and to interpret them
without resorting to supernatural explanations.

00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:03.910
So, unlike Francis Collins, for instance,
who would say that if you're gonna be a Christian

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:08.839
you have to believe in the virgin birth, you
have to believe in the literal resurrection

00:48:08.839 --> 00:48:14.220
of Jesus, she would say no. You can look at,
depending on which text you look at, you can

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:21.140
read some of those and the stories of the
resurrection and you could say people felt

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.720
something there; they didn't necessarily see
anything. And that's, I mean if you think

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.119
about it that, there are huge implications
there and for all those people who want to

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:36.250
embrace Christianity. Maybe that's the church
they grew up in, but stumble over that because

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:41.710
it's, they just can't wrap their heads around
what they would perceive to be the dogma that's

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.380
thrown at them and so, there are these different
ways of interpreting it. There was the, there's

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:50.900
another person in my book, John Haught, who's
a Catholic theologian at Georgetown; he would

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:56.690
say that if you had a camera at the resurrection
it wouldn't have shown anything. That was,

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:02.710
that's beyond science and this, he's a Catholic
theologian and he would say that this is not

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:07.500
that unorthodox a view. So anyway, this is,
it's really interesting and complicated when

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.039
you start digging down into a lot of these
issues.

00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:20.200
&gt;&gt;Male member #2: I just had a really quick
question. So, what was, from all these conversations,

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.069
a conclusion that you got for yourself? And
then, is this going to lead you to do something

00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:30.819
in the future to continue with this work because
this seems like the first step. So, what's

00:49:30.819 --> 00:49:31.819
next for you?

00:49:31.819 --> 00:49:37.809
&gt;&gt;Steve: Very good questions. I would say,
well, just a little bit of background about

00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:45.329
me. I was raised in a congregational church,
which never really did much for me, frankly.

00:49:45.329 --> 00:49:53.079
So, I stopped going around, I dunno, when
I was 12 or 13 or so. And I've never gone

00:49:53.079 --> 00:49:58.059
to church again other than the occasional
Christmas service. I don't meditate or pray.

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:05.079
I'm a pretty secular person. I'm also someone
who, I have a little bit of religion envy

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:11.970
in me and I am, I guess I look for the sacred.
I mean, I wanna have some sense of the sacred

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:19.700
in my life, but how do I get that without
the religious dogma that a lot of organized

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.990
religions have. And that's what led me to
this project and that's why I'm particularly

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:31.200
drawn to the people who are really wrestling
with some of these fundamental ideas about

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.269
how do we define religion? How do we define
God? I mean, you start asking people, I mean,

00:50:35.269 --> 00:50:40.820
I don't even ask my closest friends, "What
do you think about God?" That's, you just

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.640
have to be a little careful about going there,
but I get to ask these people I interview

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.849
about that. I mean, that's the great thing
about being a radio interviewer and they kinda

00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:55.140
have to answer me when the microphone is sitting
right in front of them. And it's just, it's

00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:03.760
tough to get a handle on that and so, I'm,
I guess I'm searching for ways. I would call

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:13.599
myself a lapsed Christian who's not a strict
materialist. How's that for a double negative?

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:19.369
So, someone who's out there searching for
something; I'm not exactly sure what it is.

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:24.640
I'm definitely not in the strict atheist camp
and I'm not your agnostic really, I'm not

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.599
even sure what that means and I don't think
that really describes me very well. I think

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:35.109
I'm something else. And in terms of where
this might lead me, I'm not sure. I still

00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:39.250
do interviews on the radio on these subjects.
I just interviewed Sam Harris about his new

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:44.470
book, The Moral Landscape, where he makes
this argument that we can come up with moral

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:50.279
arguments based strictly on science, obviously
not religion. I think he can make a few arguments

00:51:50.279 --> 00:51:54.059
like that. I think it's limited how far you
can go.

00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:59.369
I've thought about if I were to do a follow-up
book right now, I might do something that

00:51:59.369 --> 00:52:03.560
would be a little on some of the issues I've
touched on here, but it might be having to

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:13.039
do more specifically with people who invoke
nature; the nature spirituality intersection

00:52:13.039 --> 00:52:20.509
there. And there's a fascinating new book
by an animist philosopher named David Abram,

00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:27.130
called Becoming Animal, which is, he's someone
who has hung out with a lot of shamans in

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:31.840
Latin America and Asia and he's sleight of
hand magician as well. And he actually sees

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.190
his connection as a magician to, there's something
similar between that and what shamans do in

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:43.410
a lot of traditional practices, cultures.
He would say it's all about disorienting us

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:48.869
and taking us to another conceptual space
and again, he's not invoking God anywhere

00:52:48.869 --> 00:52:53.869
here. He's not really invoking anything supernatural,
but he is saying there seems to some sort

00:52:53.869 --> 00:53:00.431
of other dimension there. Anyway, it's like
I find that very interesting and I'm also

00:53:00.431 --> 00:53:05.151
interested in, this is gonna seem like a total
nonsequitor here, but I don't know if you

00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:13.160
know the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman, so, who
wrote Coraline and American Gods, and there

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.990
was just a big event, in fact, out near where
I live in Madison at House on the Rock, this

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:27.299
weird touristy attraction about an hour from
Madison. He set a key scene in his book American

00:53:27.299 --> 00:53:32.799
Gods there, sort of like the birth of modern
mythology, American mythology, at this tourist

00:53:32.799 --> 00:53:38.360
trap in the middle of Wisconsin and he says,
"This is like, this is the creation of a home

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:46.640
grown mythology." And it so, what he's trying
to do in his work is bring a sense of enchantment

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:52.700
of saying there's stuff that's going on underneath
the surface there. There's magic in a way.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:58.109
You don't necessarily have to invoke the supernatural
here, but there are different ways of looking

00:53:58.109 --> 00:54:02.150
at the world and I'm very drawn to that. I
don't know if that makes any sense, but sort

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:06.450
of a roundabout way of getting at this.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:12.549
&gt;&gt;Male member #3: Sorry, I came in late. I
just have a question, though. Have you seen

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:20.630
any scientific examples in the religious books,
the Torah, Bible or Koran, of things that

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:26.589
are explained there prior to when we know
humans discovered it, quote unquote? Are there

00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:27.589
examples--

00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:28.589
&gt;&gt;Steve: Oh, sure, there are all kind of--

00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:30.740
&gt;&gt;member #3: For example, like in the Koran,
there are examples of embryology--

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.740
&gt;&gt;Steve: Right.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.019
&gt;&gt;member #3: orbits of planets and stuff like
that before supposedly they were known about?

00:54:36.019 --> 00:54:37.369
So, are there examples that you know?

00:54:37.369 --> 00:54:44.779
&gt;&gt;Steve: There are lots, I mean, actually,
in Islam, I'm not an expert on Islam, but

00:54:44.779 --> 00:54:52.440
I can talk about this a little bit. The Muslim
astrophysicist, who I just mentioned, he talks

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.000
about how this is this huge thing in the Muslim
world of looking to the Koran, or looking

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.720
to some of those original scriptures and trying
to say, "Oh, look, this is what was said about."

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.490
Well, there's the creation story of Adam.
You know, that Adam of Adam and Eve was created

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:12.290
out of dust. I mean, that's the idea in the
Koran and so, I mean, you can go through a

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:17.020
lot of this and this just infuriates this
guy who I interviewed. I mean, this is just

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:23.160
nonsense to say, to try to go back and look
at clues that maybe something was said in

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:32.549
the Bible or the Koran that would somehow
show that these sacred texts understood science

00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:40.140
before modern scientists have come to that.
And I'll just, lemme, lemme tell you a little

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:48.710
story in fact, about Islam. Not quite on your
question, but there is a really fascinating

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:52.839
movement in the Islamic world; a creationist
movement. So, we tend to think of creationism

00:55:52.839 --> 00:55:59.869
as a distinctively American phenomenon and
actually, it's a huge growing movement throughout

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:04.180
the Muslim world. And there's a guy named
Harun Yahya, that's his pen name; his real

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:10.319
name is Adnan Oktar, who's in Istanbul and
he is the leading Islamic creationist. And

00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:16.410
he has a media empire and he's, he puts out,
he and his organization, he has maybe a few

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:24.519
hundred people, in Turkey, they put out all
this literature, really high-gloss books and

00:56:24.519 --> 00:56:29.260
videos and all of this stuff, and it is spread
throughout, not just Turkey, throughout the

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:35.289
Muslim world in Muslim communities, in Europe
and America and he's a reclusive figure, too.

00:56:35.289 --> 00:56:39.579
And I was in Istanbul actually, a couple of
years ago, and I went and interviewed him

00:56:39.579 --> 00:56:46.910
and it was a bizarre experience I have to
say. First of all, he is, well, he's been,

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:52.369
he's actually been convicted of a crime of
running an extortion gang and he is, he's

00:56:52.369 --> 00:56:58.579
not in prison right now. He's appealing the
decision and he's got very powerful friends

00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:05.569
and enemies in Turkey and so, I thought, "Well,
this is, I have to see what this Islamic creationist,

00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:10.009
what would that be like?" And so, I set up
this interview with him and one of his people

00:57:10.009 --> 00:57:15.089
came to my hotel and picked me up and drove
me across Islam at ten o'clock, I mean, across

00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:23.470
Istanbul, ten o'clock at night and they, this,
the driver pulled at one point off the road

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:29.940
and in hopped the translator cause Harun Yahya
doesn't speak English and these two guys started

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.859
having this friendly argument about one of
them has BBC English, the other has more Turkish

00:57:34.859 --> 00:57:38.579
English, which is better for picking up girls
and I was thinking, "This is not really my

00:57:38.579 --> 00:57:44.740
idea of an Islamic creationist." And then
I finally get out to Harun Yahya's house and

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:51.869
it's this really modern house with huge plasma
TV screen, swimming pool out the back through

00:57:51.869 --> 00:57:56.760
these glass doors and then the weirdest thing
of all was I walk into the house and it's

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:01.640
a stage set. There are these three klieg lights,
video cameras, and they were gonna tape my

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:06.000
interview, which is what they ended up doing.
So, I had my little radio thing and they have

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.950
all these TV cameras there and then, so when
I started the interview, and he was very gracious.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:16.539
I mean, they're all very gracious when I was
doing this interview and so, he, I asked,

00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:22.529
"So, how could all the evolutionary biologists
be wrong?" And he said, "Well, they're controlled

00:58:22.529 --> 00:58:27.309
by the Masons." And I said, "Wow, that's,
I think they'd be a little surprised to hear

00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:29.740
that they're controlled by the Masons." And
he said, "Well, that's cause the Masons keep

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:36.749
everything secret." And then he went on to
say that he equated the Darwinists with a

00:58:36.749 --> 00:58:42.579
Satanic cult and he said they're in league
with fascists and communists and, but they

00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:49.160
breed like mosquitoes in a pond. And I was,
this was not my usual kind of interview that

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.620
I did. I'm thinking, "Wow, where can I go
with this?" And then at one point, I asked

00:58:53.620 --> 00:59:01.999
him, "So, how would you assess your influence?"
And then he pulled out a loose-leaf notebook

00:59:01.999 --> 00:59:07.140
and he had clippings, cause he gets a lot
of media attention, and so he read articles

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.799
from Liberacion, I mean, various leading European
newspapers and magazines. They were all quoting

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:17.910
him saying "Darwinism is on the run," and
what I realized is what he wants is publicity.

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:24.970
And even bad publicity is good publicity for
him, which led to some moral quandaries about

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:30.869
what should I do with this story? But yet,
on the other hand, I came away thinking that

00:59:30.869 --> 00:59:36.069
he is making inroads; he's got huge influence,
he and his little empire, the media empire

00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:41.640
there. And if you don't say anything, they
will go, they go around to various countries

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:48.880
and they tell the Muslims there that you can't
accept evolution, you, modern science is on

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.220
the wrong track. And there are obviously other
people who just, I mean, there are lots of

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:59.269
people, Muslim intellectuals, who would disagree
with that, but one of the key differences

00:59:59.269 --> 01:00:08.759
between say, creationism in the Islamic world
and creationism in America is it's, here it's

01:00:08.759 --> 01:00:12.710
huge, I mean there are lots of people who
are creationists, but it's a subculture still.

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:17.839
I mean, it's not official culture. If you
are a creationist, it's, with maybe a few

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:21.390
exceptions with some of our elected officials,
I mean, you have to be a little careful about

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:25.749
how you talk about that. You don't have to
be that careful. I mean, it's perfectly accepted

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:30.900
in a lot of Islamic countries to be upfront
about creationism and just to say that evolution

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:36.049
is nonsense. So, it's, and that's a battle
that will play out more. It's more of an issue

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:41.599
right now in Turkey because they have this
peculiar history with their old president

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:46.800
Ataturk, who was the secular figure. So, evolution
has been taught for decades in Turkey. Hasn't

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.470
been taught in a lot of other Muslim countries
and so they haven't really come to the big

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.680
evolution debate which probably will happen
as they build up their science and technology

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.529
infrastructure. Anything else?

01:01:00.529 --> 01:01:02.509
[pause]

01:01:02.509 --> 01:01:06.940
Ok, thank you very much.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.079
[applause]
