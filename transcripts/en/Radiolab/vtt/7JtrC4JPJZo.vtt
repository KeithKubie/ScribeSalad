00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.790
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radiolab and today, hello?

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.960
Yes. Or as a dolphin might say, how would it often say it? I don't know.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.461
Well then that,

4
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:12.410
you know what that is exactly kind of the question of this next segment.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.160
I mean the dream that a human being and talk to a dolphin or any animal,

6
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.530
really getting their heads cross that gap.

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.950
This is a dream that humans have had for since like forever. Yeah.

8
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:26.570
St Francis of Assisi goes way back now and so far as dolphins are concerned,

9
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.580
after the John Lilly's situation, researchers did get a little tepid,

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.430
but they didn't stay tepid as you say, for long.

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.880
No, because along came this woman,

12
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.880
Dr Denise Hersey, director of the wild dolphin project,

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.080
who basically decided to take John Lily's experiment and flip it rather than

14
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.860
have the dolphin speak English. Let's have the humans speak dolphin,

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.970
or at the very least,

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.240
let's create a shared language where humans and dolphins can speak

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.300
or at least whistle. Well, you know, it's about finding,

18
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.400
finding a place you can meet back to producer Lynn Levy. Okay. So for Denise,

19
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.500
this dream of finding that meeting spot,

20
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.270
it goes back to when she was a little [inaudible].

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.440
<v 1>Well, when I was 12 years old,</v>

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.250
I used to page through the encyclopedia Britannica.

23
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.360
In the days when we had books and I would always stop at the whale and Dolphin

24
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.840
page, look at the dolphins and go, wow,

25
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:27.350
I wonder what their brains are like because they'd evolved in the water that

26
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:30.850
when you were 12 I was, I was, I was a total nerd. In fact, I,

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.960
I entered this contest in Minnesota.

28
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.970
Like what would you do for the world if you could do something?

29
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:36.020
And I actually wrote,

30
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:39.410
I would build a human animal translators so we could figure out what was going

31
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:41.840
on in the minds of animals. So yeah, I don't know.

32
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.370
I got the bug early and here I am.

33
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.160
<v 0>Do you have, were you having a fantasy about what you might learn or</v>

34
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.760
<v 1>a fantasy? No, I was just curious. So I don't know. You look in their eyes,</v>

35
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.730
there's definitely something behind there. You just want to know what it is.

36
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.650
<v 0>Fast forward many years.</v>

37
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.390
Denise got a boat and I went out to The Bahamas. She was like,

38
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.790
if I'm going to study these dolphins, I'm going to do it in the wild.

39
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
That's where they live. So she tracked down a pod of wild dolphins. Yep, Yep.

40
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.550
And she just tried to blend in.

41
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.510
I actually anchored the boat in one spot most of the time.

42
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.940
This spot in the Bermuda Triangle in the middle of,

43
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.250
I call it the Dolphin highway, where dolphins come and go.

44
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.670
They could come by if they wanted to and if they didn't, they didn't.

45
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.680
When they would come by,

46
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.520
she and her team would just slip into the water and behave ourselves.

47
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.920
Just sort of watch paying attention to who was who,

48
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:33.220
which dolphin had a crooked fin, which one didn't, and when they'd leave,

49
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.490
we'd get out. And that's really how we operated for the first five years.

50
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:37.840
And it had worked five years.

51
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.020
She spent five years just watching not doing anything else. Yes.

52
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.550
Doesn't this take an enormous amount of patients?

53
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.950
<v 1>Well, sure. I mean, but after about five years they started realizing, well,</v>

54
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.280
these guys aren't going to grab us and pocus and products.

55
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.680
So they started just going about their own business,

56
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.750
<v 0>like feeding, mating, nursing and talking</v>

57
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.053
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.900
<v 0>or at least making a lot of noises,</v>

59
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.530
which she and her team would record

60
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

61
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.320
<v 0>wow. That's all dolphin. Dolphin make things. They make all these, yeah,</v>

62
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:13.891
like that.

63
00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:17.460
That's like there's like a clicking kind of quaking sound that they make

64
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.980
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.570
<v 0>sounds like a zipper. Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:27.080
they make like whistles that are more kind of distinct and then they make sounds

67
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.870
that are like longer and weirder.

68
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:34.490
And do you have any sense that each of these sounds means something different?

69
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.210
Well that's exactly what we don't know.

70
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.390
I could tell you what kinds of sounds are correlated with fighting and with

71
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.870
mating or disciplining a calf. What we don't know is,

72
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.120
are there detailed kind of words in there?

73
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.070
Is there a more kind of encoded information?

74
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.520
But what they do know is that each dolphin seems to have its own kind of

75
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.160
signature whistle, which is basically a name.

76
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.610
Every individual has its own name. Peter had a name.

77
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.640
Nobody's ever asked me that. Here's Margaret again. And His name was

78
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.260
<v 4>s. S. S. S</v>

79
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.800
<v 0>really? It is almost saying Peter here. Right.</v>

80
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.980
So I can call you Lynn by your whistle and new Robert by your whistle.

81
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.910
Or I could be a dolphin going, hey Lynn. Exactly. Do they do that?

82
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.180
They do. Huh? Not only that, uh,

83
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.680
apparently dolphins will use the names of other dolphins who aren't even around.

84
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.590
Like they can't see them. Like they'll talk about each other behind their backs.

85
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.020
Yes, maybe. Wow.

86
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.110
That means that they're using representations of things which aren't in front of

87
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:39.850
them, which is sort of like the beginning of language.

88
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.920
If that's what they're doing and we don't know.

89
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.450
But if that's what they're doing, then yeah,

90
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.600
that's kind of like the edge of language. So, you know,

91
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.200
it gives us hope that there's probably more information going on there than we

92
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:50.920
know.

93
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.920
And now finally she has that device,

94
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.030
which device? The magical, you know,

95
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.600
human animal translator device that she was dreaming of writing about when she

96
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:07.434
was 12.

97
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.530
She has this box that can generate dolphin noises and it can recognize dolphin

98
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:17.790
noises. And if it works the way that you know that she's dreaming it all work,

99
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it could be the first like real two way back and forth conversation between a

100
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.870
human and a wild animal.

101
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.690
So we're looking forward to the summer and getting out and getting more data and

102
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:34.300
really exercising the boxes and see what happens.

103
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.650
<v 5>[inaudible] we're ready. So I begged my way. A board, everybody good?</v>

104
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.440
So you sick pills left

105
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.210
<v 0>on July 8th from Florida and headed for The Bahamas to see this pod that she has</v>

106
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:55.510
been following kind of forever, almost 30 years now.

107
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.070
Boat is called

108
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v 6>the RV stoneleigh stoneleigh is the scientific name for this particular type of</v>

109
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:06.780
Dolphin. The spotted dolphin. Have you seen the spotted dolphin?

110
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.990
I've never seen one in person. What is this boat like?

111
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.280
It's like not a tiny boat,

112
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.310
but it's not a big boat and it was just absolutely full of humans.

113
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.470
And who, who is it? Who are your humans? Well,

114
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:25.820
there's Denise obviously and you've got a captain. My name's curious man.

115
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.290
First mate. And Yeah, research assistants, Allison Meyers, Les Mason,

116
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.170
Bethany Olier volunteers.

117
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.320
There's a acoustics expert, which is Hoffman.

118
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.600
For a long time I couldn't even figure out where everybody was sleeping cause

119
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.620
the boat seems so small.

120
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:42.140
It was like there is not room for all these people on this boat.

121
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.140
I knew there's a soft hot soldering iron next to the fridge and I haven't even

122
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:45.974
gotten to this guy.

123
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.580
His name is dad Starner.

124
00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:55.060
So you didn't have like any dolphin experience before this, right? Oh Hell No.

125
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.290
He's one of the guys who invented Google glass.

126
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.110
I became a computer programmer so I'd never have to leave air conditioning.

127
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.450
Right. And I'm out here. And what is this a hundred degree weather to do what?

128
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.320
So his job on the boat is to, he's in charge of these these boxes.

129
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.460
Those boxes probably costs a hundred K at this point we're looking for funding

130
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.850
for funding. So he's the tech Wiz. When he came down to visit my lab,

131
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.840
I was telling about the two way work and the difficulty with underwater stuff.

132
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:21.261
And he said, oh,

133
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:25.100
I build wearable computers because how can you build me an underwater wearable

134
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.000
computer? That shoulder shouldn't be hard four years later,

135
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600
what does this machine look like? That looks like a toaster,

136
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.430
like one of those fancy chrome toasters,

137
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.360
except you wear it on your chest or they silvery and they are silvery.

138
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.510
They have a bunch of sort of knobs and buttons and speakers on them.

139
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.660
<v 0>It's got preprogrammed whistles in it.</v>

140
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.640
I can punch a key and it projects whistle eight. Here it was. So B,

141
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.070
<v 6>yeah, it was just c.</v>

142
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.090
She's programmed in signature whistles of some of the dolphins. Right.

143
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.400
Hellish piece. You

144
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.230
<v 0>and we uh, made signature whistles for ourselves.</v>

145
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.940
Oh, she can call their names and they can call her names. That's,

146
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.070
that's what you're saying. That is the idea. Yeah. And,

147
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.630
and if they do call her name, this name that she's made for herself,

148
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.660
then the box should be able to recognize it and can tell her that she's been

149
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:20.780
called by name. It'll actually say into her ear in English, Denise,

150
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.470
this is real time. I call it real time sound recognition, but it's real time,

151
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.560
whistle recognition underwater. How does,

152
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.690
if she's made up this name for herself,

153
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.090
how is it that they're going to know that that's her name? Well,

154
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.410
the idea is that they're learning.

155
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:36.700
So she gets into the water over and over and she says, you know,

156
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.690
it'd be equivalent of, hi, I'm Denise. Hi,

157
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.200
I'm Denise over and over and over and they learn it. You know,

158
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.590
they developed this little like maybe they'll just start to use it and call her.

159
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.930
So you hope you hope they call you.

160
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.320
I'd be really sad if they didn't call my name, but

161
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.620
Vegas at the very least you could call their names and see how they react.

162
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.630
Right. We'll see. That would be a Eureka moment.

163
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:02.631
I think if you hit the Lolita button and Lolita suddenly turned and look right

164
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:08.520
at you with a shock of what the heck? Wow.

165
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:12.030
That human call me by my signature whistle. Whoa, that, has that happened yet?

166
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.740
It hasn't happened yet

167
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.820
<v 6>and this is something I just did not appreciate for awhile. I was on this boat.</v>

168
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:22.940
I was like, why is this so hard? Like this seems like it should be.

169
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.160
These people are so smart, like this should be easy,

170
00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:29.720
but they're just like constantly being defeated by the ocean basically.

171
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:32.630
Which I'm the ocean is like a worthy foe,

172
00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:35.030
but it's like the first year,

173
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.150
first year was a complete disaster trying to get the hardware to work.

174
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.930
What happened the first year everything broke. It was leaks city.

175
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.170
Basically the boxes just kept shutting down. As soon as they would get in the

176
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.580
<v 0>that's not good. It's not good. That's sort of not what you want. No.</v>

177
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.220
<v 6>And last year the boxes working, but then we couldn't find the dolphins.</v>

178
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:54.530
The dolphins just disappeared. They go,

179
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.670
<v 0>uh, you know, they went a hundred miles away to another location.</v>

180
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.623
They don't know why.

181
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.860
<v 6>I kept up with my side of the deal. Today's your dolphins stood you up.</v>

182
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.120
Jeez.

183
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.360
<v 0>And one of the reasons I was on the boat is it felt like everybody was thinking</v>

184
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:11.410
like, this is it. This is the year we're going to go out there.

185
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.120
We're going to find some dolphins and we're going to make some history.

186
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.263
<v 3>You ready</v>

187
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.823
now?

188
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.190
<v 6>Any minute now?</v>

189
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.580
Okay. It turns out it's not that easy to find these dolphins.

190
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.660
They're not tagged.

191
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.740
You know they're wild dolphins so you just like you go to where you think they

192
00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:43.574
might be.

193
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.610
You know that song you stare at the water and you wait

194
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.800
for the first three days? Pretty much I would. We were just driving around

195
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.150
in circles like literally in circles, you know?

196
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:10.440
I feel like I had like a like a five hour conversation about game of Thrones.

197
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:14.250
I've never even seen an episode of game of Thrones. Any dolphins anywhere.

198
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.640
No.

199
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.540
<v 5>It was nothing else to do. All just come on dolphins. We need you now.</v>

200
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.970
Come on off and on. Dog. Come on dog to kick in.

201
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.370
Oh see piece of seaweed. It looked like a dolphin.

202
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.730
Dolphins wave that looks like a dolphin. I just say that I would be like,

203
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.900
everything looks like a dolphin to me right now. There are days like that

204
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.623
<v 3>open.</v>

205
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.120
<v 5>They are right there. All of a sudden out on the water we see one fin,</v>

206
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.990
two fins, three fences, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

207
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.740
Oh, there's so many of them and they're so cool

208
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.270
<v 6>standing there watching them. Denise turns to me and she goes,</v>

209
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.990
do you want to go in? I don't know, do you recommend it?

210
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.350
And I was not prepared for her to say that. And also it's holding,

211
00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:18.420
recording equipment, everything. And so I just,

212
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:20.760
I ended up just having to go in like in my clothes,

213
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.790
like wearing like my shorts and like a bra and I had like all modesty aside,

214
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.340
like thrown aside and they were like, you can go in. And I was like, Oh okay.

215
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.630
Okay, okay. Okay.

216
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.613
<v 5>Jesus Christ. Here we go.</v>

217
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.360
<v 6>I mean it's a total sensory shift.</v>

218
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.210
The temperature changes, everything goes quiet.

219
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.940
<v 3>No,</v>

220
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.390
<v 6>it almost feels like this, like the classic through the looking glass moment.</v>

221
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.361
Where are you?

222
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.630
Like you go through the looking glass and like everybody's walking on the

223
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.300
ceiling.

224
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.300
[inaudible] and I jumped in and there were two pretty big dolphins coming right

225
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.180
at me. Like maybe two feet from my head,

226
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.670
um, and staring at me and I was like, uh,

227
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.280
I don't know. What do you know? What did you do? I stayed very,

228
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:29.060
still pretty much froze now. How far were they from me? Two feet.

229
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.550
Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. Dolphins are not small.

230
00:13:31.551 --> 00:13:33.170
And they were looking at me in a way that was like,

231
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.280
we see you and also there they make these um,

232
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.710
sort of clicking sonar sounds, which are like,

233
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.840
they were talking to you or are just talking about. We'll know what I mean.

234
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:47.960
What I think they were doing is, is,

235
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.010
is sonar in me sort of looking at me with their, with sound. I mean,

236
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:55.880
my head was vibrating. I mean they can see not just body shape.

237
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:58.130
They can see your bones. Oh,

238
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.190
<v 0>they can see into you. Like you really feel looked at.</v>

239
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.530
Wow. It was heart stopping.

240
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.193
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

241
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.200
<v 6>Oh, is unfit? Believable?</v>

242
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.870
<v 7>Oh, that's so cool.</v>

243
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.330
<v 6>I thought when it's like the trip couldn't know and I go home happy, you know,</v>

244
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:24.620
and everybody was like, calm down.

245
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.320
<v 0>Those weren't even the right dolphins. What do you mean? Well,</v>

246
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:31.510
those were bottlenose dolphins. Denise studies spotted [inaudible]. Uh, but

247
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.970
<v 5>the next day, all right, onward for spots, spots or bust,</v>

248
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.930
we set out again, go for a few hours.

249
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.750
Bethany does this.

250
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:48.260
Dolphin daily's energetic spot it and okay.

251
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.390
God saw. Yeah. Floor. You saw them, right? Yeah.

252
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.640
Right there. Yeah. There we go. Gotta be spotted.

253
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.950
So then everybody's like, you know, it's like all hands on deck situation.

254
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.160
Everybody's like strapping on the boxes and strapping on the headphones,

255
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.880
which is a lot of scrambling. There's so much scrambling. Oh,

256
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:10.940
there's one off the bow here. It's like a fire. It's like a fire drill.

257
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.550
Now I'm putting on my box. Here's the problem.

258
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.140
<v 6>I'm just testing. I'm like a captive dolphin. Wild Dolphins.</v>

259
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.350
They have other things to do. They have, you know, fish to catch.

260
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.990
You kind of have to entice it into having a conversation.

261
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.520
Otherwise it'll just swim away.

262
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.840
But how do you do that when you don't know its language? Well,

263
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.640
turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves, skirt,

264
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.490
scarf flow. When you throw them a scarf,

265
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.060
they sweep it up with their tailfin and then they let it go and it wafts through

266
00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:44.570
the water and another dolphin comes up and sweeps it up with their rostrum.

267
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.510
So the idea is you use the scarf as kind of like a a bridge.

268
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.190
Denise and another diver will get in the water with a scarf.

269
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.160
<v 0>We'll get in the water and we'll just start passing it back and forth.</v>

270
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.780
It's human to human like, Hey, look at this funding we're doing. Let them watch.

271
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:00.850
If they want to get in the game, we let them in the game.

272
00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:02.770
Sometimes we'll take the toy over to them,

273
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.730
show it to them and press the word for scarf. Say, hey, this is a scarf.

274
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.850
<v 6>They just made up a whistle for scarf. Yup. And ideally, and this is the key,</v>

275
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.670
the dolphins will pick up the word and use it to,

276
00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:17.430
to ask for the scarf if and when they do that,

277
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.490
then you've got like a tiny bit of common ground that you can build on.

278
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.710
<v 5>Okay, well you got, yeah, four spotted dolphins. Yeah. Little candidates.</v>

279
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.930
Alex. Yes. We've been waiting for them, right? Yeah. Just before they jump in.

280
00:16:33.931 --> 00:16:36.110
Denise walks another diver through the game plan. Oh,

281
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.780
so you're going to hold it and you're not going to give it to him. Okay.

282
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.240
You're going to entice it with them. You're going be like, oh, this is fun.

283
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.750
I like dive down with it and like wave it or, yeah,

284
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.530
start at the surface and just really get them with you moments later.

285
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.170
All clear. Good. We're ready

286
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.890
and he's jumps in followed by three other divers.

287
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.820
<v 6>Where are you in the water at this time? No,</v>

288
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.580
I actually had to watch the whole thing from the deck and like you could see

289
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:05.600
from the surface,

290
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.630
three or four adolescents often see the nieces right up next to one of them.

291
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.090
You see the back of her head and her little snorkel. That's good.

292
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:18.070
She's surrounded right now. What are they doing? I'm not sure. Oh,

293
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.520
they're kind of like twisting around each other. I will say this.

294
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.510
She is tremendously graceful in the water.

295
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.210
She gets in the water and she's like totally at home so maybe she is a tough

296
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.580
that she might secretly be a dolphin going like around and around as she goes on

297
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:36.680
there. And what is happening under there?

298
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.180
This is what it sounds like underwater.

299
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.250
<v 3>This is the actual sound from the scarf</v>

300
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.460
<v 0>dance. They record everything that goes on under there.</v>

301
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.123
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

302
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.010
<v 0>I mean a lot of that is the dolphins just doing whatever they're doing.</v>

303
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.590
But some of it is nice with the box making this scarf whistle over and over like

304
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.030
scarf. You want the scar? Yeah. Scarf.

305
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.050
Cause she's like trying to get the dolphin to say the word right. Yeah.

306
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.920
<v 6>Eventually she and the dolphins surface and</v>

307
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.670
he's got the scarf. One of the dolphins is holding the scar. Hey,

308
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.910
it's like this flash of red and then they all go back under

309
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.213
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

310
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.380
<v 6>If Denise comes back up with it, that's real good. All right, wait and see.</v>

311
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.963
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

312
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.950
<v 6>after about a minute, she surfaces. I think the niece has it now.</v>

313
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.400
She dies one more time.

314
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.563
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

315
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.590
<v 6>a minute later, Dolphin has the scarf and this went on and on.</v>

316
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.390
They were passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe the Dolphin

317
00:19:16.391 --> 00:19:18.490
has begun to ask for the scarf by name.

318
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:25.540
Eventually lease gets gravity, sucks all the back up onto the boat

319
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.370
and we all just sort of gather around like, well, well yeah,

320
00:19:30.371 --> 00:19:34.390
the two juveniles picked up the scarf right away and played some signature

321
00:19:34.391 --> 00:19:36.190
whistles, played some scarf whistles.

322
00:19:36.191 --> 00:19:38.870
And then some sargassum paid flooding buys piece of seaweed showed up.

323
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.790
Matt played the Sargassum. Listen, you think you got an email?

324
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.730
Nothing that triggered the system, but you know, let's see what it looks like.

325
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.930
It's exhausting page. She didn't get anything. Well, I mean, nothing the box,

326
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.190
it's recognized as a match, you know,

327
00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:57.920
nothing that indicated the dolphin like learned a word.

328
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.983
<v 8>Ah,</v>

329
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.860
<v 6>sounded like they were right there.</v>

330
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.670
But there was this one thing that happened. She said that when she,

331
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.610
um, addressed one of the dolphins by its name, uh,

332
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.210
the dolphin turned around and looked at her and kind of cocked it's little

333
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:25.070
dolphin head. Really? Yes.

334
00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.420
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

335
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.790
<v 6>So, so for the insane, wow.</v>

336
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.010
Also there was this moment where that,

337
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:36.860
and Celeste were looking at the data later. Who's that?

338
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.300
And they saw that right after Denise made her signature whistle cause that

339
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.570
somebody's responding with her seizure was another dolphin made its signature

340
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.070
whistle. Sweet. Oh that's pretty, you mean like she

341
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.020
<v 9>said hi in it said hi back. Yeah. That's amazing. Well maybe, I mean</v>

342
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.920
<v 0>the thing is dolphins make their signature whistles all the time.</v>

343
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:02.080
So it could be nothing or it could be this.

344
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.520
I mean, she's a very rigorous scientist.

345
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:14.521
Like she wants that to happen another 30 times before even starting to take it

346
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:15.454
seriously.

347
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.800
But still it does make you think about the possibilities.

348
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.060
What do you want to ask?

349
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.890
<v 1>I don't know. I want to ask everything.</v>

350
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:27.310
So like what,

351
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.060
I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around.

352
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.660
And then how do you spend your day, you know, do they think about things?

353
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:38.830
I mean, do they think about the future? Did they think about the past? I mean,

354
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:40.780
we know they have longterm memories, you know,

355
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:44.290
do they remember their calves from 10 years ago? Do they think about death?

356
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.120
Yeah. And they certainly see it could be anything you'd ask your friends. Right?

357
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.463
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

358
00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.340
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

359
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.310
<v 9>although part of me wonders like,</v>

360
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.550
I think we're going to get even get there. What do you mean?

361
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.890
Well that's the goal is to have a conversation and he can't do it this way where

362
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:11.830
you're in the wild and you can't touch them and you've got to verify every

363
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.240
whistle 35 times.

364
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:17.020
What are they ever actually going to have a conversational because was like they

365
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.360
one of the language lesson I can I, yeah, I get it.

366
00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:21.240
But like don't you feel like Margaret was a,

367
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.930
all the problems with that experiment aside which she was actually getting

368
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.980
somewhere with Peter.

369
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.610
Like they were actually having a real exchange in the moment perhaps.

370
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.080
But thinking forward,

371
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.800
I believe that what you can accomplish by talking,

372
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.990
by having a two way conversation,

373
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.460
<v 0>infinitely greater. Yeah. And I totally agree.</v>

374
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:46.461
But if it's taken her 30 something years to get to a maybe hello?

375
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.990
Yeah.

376
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.800
She doesn't even know if she got to hello yet and if all she has is a just a

377
00:22:52.801 --> 00:22:54.810
limited amount of time with these dolphins every summer,

378
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.510
then 50 more times as you can tell you're 50 more years and I'm just like,

379
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.600
Oh God, the plant is going to be 17 degrees warmer. By that point,

380
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.080
dolphins are going to have all migrated to some other spot. It just feels like,

381
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.020
oh, come on. Just get in a pool and hold. Let, let,

382
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.670
let the Dolphin hold your foot. She's already got the hello going for her.

383
00:23:11.671 --> 00:23:14.340
Maybe so that's like a start and then yes,

384
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:18.630
in 50 years she may have moved past hello to a three word sentence.

385
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.670
How's your macro today? Yeah. I think that to a three word sentence. Yes.

386
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.450
I would put money on a three word sentence in 50 years. The question is,

387
00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:31.810
do we ever get to the point of exploring death? Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.230
I don't know. Lynn, do you have faith [inaudible]

389
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.200
I have faith that if Denise continues with what she's doing that we'll be able

390
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:46.220
to talk about concrete

391
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.870
<v 6>things. We'll be able to talk about seaweed and we'll be able to talk about,</v>

392
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.750
um, coral and we'll be able to have a scintillating conversation about scarves.

393
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.470
I do believe that, and that is not nothing. I mean,

394
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.570
that is pretty impressive in its own way.

395
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.770
Big thanks to [inaudible] to our producer.

396
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.800
I'm Jack. I'm Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thank you guys for listening.
