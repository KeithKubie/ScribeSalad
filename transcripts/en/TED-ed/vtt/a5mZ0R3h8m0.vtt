00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.846
To many, one of the coolest things
about "Game of Thrones"

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.197
is that the inhabitants
of the Dothraki Sea

00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:13.767
have their own real language.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.264
And Dothraki came hot on the heels

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:20.144
of the real language
that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar,"

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:21.781
which, surely, the Na'vi needed

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:26.778
when the Klingons in "Star Trek" have had
their own whole language since 1979.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.834
And let's not forget the Elvish languages

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:32.164
in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy,

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.780
especially since that was
the official grandfather

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.148
of the fantasy conlangs.

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:40.785
"Conlang" is short for
"constructed language."

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.452
They're more than codes like Pig Latin,

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:47.056
and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.000
that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak,

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:52.948
where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend."

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:57.240
What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have.

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.608
It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words.

00:00:59.632 --> 00:01:02.004
Dothraki has thousands of words.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.321
Na'vi started with 1,500 words.

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.093
Fans on websites
have steadily created more.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:10.778
But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:12.538
and what makes a real language

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.004
from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish,

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:18.309
a conlang with several thousands words.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:22.087
After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.788
and still be barely able
to construct a sentence.

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:27.367
A four-year-old would talk
rings around you.

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.475
That's because you have to know
how to put the words together.

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.210
That is, a real language has grammar.

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:34.692
Elvish does.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:38.182
In English, to make a verb past,
you add an "-ed."

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:39.688
Wash, washed.

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:42.224
In Elvish, "wash" is "allu"

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.315
and "washed" is "allune."

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:47.822
Real languages also change over time.

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.818
There's no such thing as a language

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.747
that's the same today
as it was a thousand years ago.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:55.417
As people speak, they drift
into new habits,

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.632
shed old ones,

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.733
make mistakes, and get creative.

00:01:58.757 --> 00:02:00.269
Today, one says,

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:02.380
"Give us today our daily bread."

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:04.130
In Old English, they said,

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:07.415
"Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg."

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:11.121
Things change in conlangs, too.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.578
Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.453
When the first Elves awoke at CuiviÃ©nen,

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:18.525
in their new language,

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.767
the word for "people" was "kwendi,"

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.289
but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri,

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:26.911
over time, "kwendi" became "pendi,"

00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:29.203
with the "k" turning into a "p."

00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.991
And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many.

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.224
When the Romans transplanted
Latin across Europe,

00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:39.572
French, Spanish, and Italian were born.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.533
When groups move to different places,

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.039
over time, their ways
of speaking grow apart,

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.078
just like everything else about them.

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:48.911
Thus, Latin's word for hand was "manus,"

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.751
but in French, it became "main,"

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:52.703
while in Spain it became "mano."

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.917
Tolkien made sure Elvish
did the same kind of thing.

00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.585
While that original word
"kwendi" became "pendi"

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.790
among the Teleri,

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.678
among the Avari, who spread
throughout Middle Earth,

00:03:03.702 --> 00:03:06.579
it became "kindi"
when the "w" dropped out.

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.051
The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:11.603
are Quenya and Sindarin,

00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:15.121
and their words are different
in the same way French and Spanish are.

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:16.859
Quenya has "suc" for "drink,"

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:18.490
Sindarin has "sog."

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.479
And as you know, real languages are messy.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.789
That's because they change,

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:26.577
and change has a way
of working against order,

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.399
just like in a living room
or on a bookshelf.

00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:32.071
Real languages are never
perfectly logical.

00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:36.062
That's why Tolkien made sure
that Elvish had plenty of exceptions.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:39.377
Lots of verbs are conjugated
in ways you just have to know.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.300
Take even the word "know."

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.381
In the past, it's "knew,"

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:47.090
which isn't explained
by any of the rules in English.

00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:48.132
Oh well.

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.298
In Elvish, "know" is "ista,"

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:52.671
but "knew" is "sinte."

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:53.794
Oh well.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.438
The truth is, though, that Elvish
is more a sketch for a real language

00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:58.589
than a whole one.

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.233
For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.953
rather than an attempt to create something
people could actually speak.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.456
Much of the Elvish the characters
in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.703
has been made up since Tolkien
by dedicated fans of Elvish

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:14.717
based on guesses as to what Tolkien
would have constructed.

00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:19.567
That's the best we can do for Elvish
because there are no actual Elves around

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.094
to speak it for us.

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:23.802
But the modern conlangs go further.

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.888
Dothraki, Na'vi, and Klingon
are developed enough

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:28.814
that you can actually speak them.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.144
Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon,

00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:33.359
although performing it
would mean getting used

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.247
to pronouncing "k" with your uvula,

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.201
that weird, cartoony thing hanging
in the back of your throat.

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:42.586
Believe it or not, you actually do that
in plenty of languages around the world,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.960
like Eskimo ones.

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:46.819
Pronouncing Elvish is much easier, though.

00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:49.364
So, let's take our leave for now

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.629
from this introduction
to conlangs in Elvish

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.734
and the other three conlangs discussed

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:57.300
with a heartfelt
quad-conlangual valedictory:

00:04:58.004 --> 00:04:59.219
"A Na Marie!"

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:00.281
"Hajas!"

00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:01.840
Na'vi's "Kiyevame!"

00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:02.965
"Qapla!"

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:04.586
and "Goodbye!"
