&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I'm really excited
to introduce our speaker for all you here

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.560
today. His name is Bill Wallauer. And he's
from the Jane Goodall Institute. So, let me

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.109
tell you a few fun facts about Bill. All right,
fact number one: For 15 years, Bill spent

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
almost every day following chimpanzees in
Tanzania and Africa.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.720
And during that time, he spent more time with
chimpanzees than he did with humans. Fact

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.590
number two: Bill has served as a cameraman
and scientific adviser for more than 30 shows

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.600
on the BBC, Animal Planet, and The Discovery
Channel, including the very popular "Planet

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.469
Earth" series. Fact number three: In the early
1990s, he successfully captured a video of

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:52.670
wild chimpanzees giving birth on tape and
got asked by Jane Goodall to join the Jane

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.070
Goodall Institute.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.070
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: So, thanks so much for coming
out. My name is Bill Wallauer. And I think

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.850
you can see from that video, I kinda like
my job. So maybe next to a Google employee,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.620
I'm probably the most happily employed employee
on the planet.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.620
[laughter]

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.770
Yeah, I keep reading how this is the best
place in the world to work. And I keep thinking,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.960
"They've never been in my forest."

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.640
[laughter]

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.700
Anyway, this next slide. Have any of you ever
seen a Jane Goodall talk? A couple of you.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.170
And Jane, I got a message from Jane to send
a greeting. And we've already heard that greeting.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.880
But let's hear it again. This is Jane with
her classic chimp greeting to all of you.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.909
[Jane Goodall makes chimpanzee sounds]

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.900
And that's that wonderful chimp call, which
we've been hearing in the forest now. Me,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.781
for 20 years. Jane, for about 60 years, as
we go through the forest. And that's just

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.790
a chimp greeting to all of you from Jane.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.649
Thanks so much for coming out. So, a lot of
people ask me now how do they get involved

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.079
in this work? And I have really three people
to credit, my mom on the left side. This is

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:14.360
my mom as she was growing up. She was from
the East Coast, a traveler, English teacher,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.709
very cultured, from Charlottesville. My father
on the top right, he was a professional rodeo

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.709
cowboy.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.400
Grew up in the mountains in California. And
so, I got this great mix of both worlds. So,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.000
we'd be at a Shakespearean festival in Ashland
one weekend and then Dad and I would go up

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.710
to Northeastern Oregon and go fishing the
next weekend. And so, I'm from Oregon originally.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.830
And so, I owe--. Is somebody from Oregon here?
Yay.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.830
[laughter]

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.110
A great state. And so, I owe them just so
much for giving me that sense of wonder about

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.580
both human culture and also about wildlife.
And it's just been a wonderful ride. And then,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.740
of course, Jane Goodall, who always a hero.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.400
I met her as a Peace Corp volunteer in 1989,
and instantly fell in love with her and her

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.879
mission. Yeah, to find out more about that
mission, I really encourage you to find out

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.099
more about her. She is certainly a pioneer
in more than just chimp research in conservation,

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.160
in the way she views the world. She is a true
living philosopher and visionary.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.350
So, from my background, climbing around these
hills and mountains in Oregon gave me a very,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.860
very good background to do the same kind of
work that Jane did in the early 1960s. And

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.670
so, it's not such a different forest. Very
different climate, but not such a different

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.260
forest. So I just, with my two years in the
forest as a Peace Corp volunteer and my knowledge

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.319
of Swahili, I was the perfect fit for Jane.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.400
And this is what I looked like in, when I
first went out. I was in my mid-20s. This

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.879
is about '92. And very, very green around,
green in the field; didn't know very much

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.430
about chimps or very much about film-making.
And within a year of the Jane Goodall workout,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.220
I had totally gone bush.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.220
[laughter]

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.910
You've all heard the Jane Fonda workout? Well,
that's got nothing on the Jane Goodall workout.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.910
[laughter]

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:20.970
So, I totally got into it, went completely
bush. And just Jane, I filmed this birth that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.150
Winnie talked about. And Jane said, "Well,
why don't you just do this full-time? Let's

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.420
get a research, visual imagery to go along
with the long-term data," which they had been

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.660
collecting at that point for 30 years.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.370
So, now we have a thousand hours of research
footage of every aspect of chimp behavior.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.860
But then, film groups would come, film crews
would come and they would realize, "Well,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.550
wow. This is really steep and really thick
and our scientific adviser can actually get

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.730
through this stuff just like a chimp can."

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.380
And so, I would be keeping up with the chimps,
trying to radio them, "Catch up, catch up.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.130
All this stuff's going down." And they would
be a hundred yards behind me trying to keep

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.990
up. And so, pretty soon they started giving
me the camera and teaching me how to shoot

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.630
for film-making, which is a very different
art than doing chimp research home movies,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.660
which I was learning how to do.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.210
So, I got this great crash course in chimp
behavior from the chimps and in film-making

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.820
from these visiting film crews. So, as Winnie
said, I worked on about 30, 35 films. And

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.191
this pinnacle now is this; I think many of
you have heard about the "Chimpanzee" film

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:35.130
by Disney Nature. I was one of the cinematographers
for that, which is, as a wildlife cameraman,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.570
just a dream job on so many levels.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.930
But particularly for me, because it gives
me a platform to actually come to people like

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.210
you and talk about not only how amazing chimps
are, but the fact that within my lifetime,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.280
at the rate we're going right now with the
Equatorial forest, the African forests, they

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.940
could be gone in my lifetime. So, that also
gives us a really amazing platform to talk

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.290
about chimps and chimp conservation.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:06.350
So, Gaia still very much has my heart. And
it was absolutely amazing when on my visits,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.300
I would be there for ten, eleven months out
of the year, and you could imagine, like during

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.390
the 90s, there was a lot going on technologically.
You might be aware of that. I missed all that.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.390
[laughter]

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.690
And I just heard rumors about this Google
thing. I'm a real map person. I love my maps.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:28.750
I love being able to see where I'm going and
see where I've been. And you could imagine

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:37.390
my delight when I could get on Google Maps
and mark the tree that Gaia was born in. I

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.030
mean, is that cool or what?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.030
[laughter]

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.970
So, you could go on Google Earth and check
out the tree that Gaia was born in. That is

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.180
absolutely intriguing. You hear about Jane's
Peak. It was just off Jane's Peak in the tree

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.130
that Gaia was born. But it's this tree.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.660
[laughter]

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.810
For those of you who are scientist-minded,
this is Parinari curatellifolia was the species

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.370
of the tree that she gave birth in.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.370
[laughter]

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:09.160
And this is Gaia now. This is now 19 years
later. She has a baby of her own. And guess

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.850
what we called the baby? We called it--. We
have G-family, so Gremlin had Galahad and

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.110
Gaia, and Goldy and Glitter.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.110
Do you see the pattern there? Fifi has Freud,
Ferdinand, and Faustino. So, we named them

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.680
through the female line by their--. And so
we thought, "Well, what would be an obvious

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.620
name to name another G-baby?" So, there we
go.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.710
[laughter]

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.800
[clapping]

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:48.620
Born about June 4th, within a day or two of
June 4th, 2009. So, Google, meet Google.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.660
[laughter]

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.780
And like the chimps, the chimps are obviously
aware that I am there, but don't think about

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.100
me at all. But hopefully, you'll be involved
and follow Google's life. And she will never

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.940
be aware of you. So, it's a very one-sided
relationship. But that's the way it has to

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.630
be because that's one thing this movie has
been able, something it's been able to do

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.610
for me is like, be a voice for chimps.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.490
And so--. We talked a little bit about my
background. Did you see the "Planet Earth"

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.470
series? I mean, I haven't seen most of these
series 'cause I spend all of my time in East

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.830
Africa filming, but "Planet Earth" was one
that I filmed, "Life of Mammals," both of

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.150
which were produced and directed by Alastair
Fothergill, who came to me with this Disney

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.150
idea.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.520
And that was one of the shortest decisions
of my life, next to saying "yes" to Jane,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:47.550
"Will I come to Gombe?" From 2008 to last
summer, I got to spend on and off three years

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:53.820
filming for this Chimpanzee project for Disney
Nature, which was just wonderful. But what

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.550
does it take to make it happen? They didn't
tell me about this part.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.550
[laughter]

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.080
I kind of pictured, 'cause often I'd get a
shot list, which is the list of shots that

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.562
a film crew wants. They don't even send a
producer. They'll just send a camera and a

00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:13.460
shot list and a tripod and I'll start my work.
We did that for "Planet Earth" and for "Mammals."

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:19.020
And I did a couple BBC series. But in this
case, I stopped by Bristol, England to pick

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.640
up equipment and I thought it was gonna be
a few boxes and bags.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.550
We had 22 hard cases plus our luggage plus
all our carry-ons. We were, my wife and I,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.400
my wife has done this with me for about ten
years now. She did the sound. So, when you

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.560
go see the film, she did--. Just close your
eyes once in a while and just listen to the

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.470
wonderful sounds of the forest. That's all
Kristin's sound.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:47.660
And she did the production stills as well
for this film. But yeah, the initial shock

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:53.250
at having to carry and be responsible for
about 500,000 dollars' worth of boxes and

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.380
bags and camera equipment was extraordinary.
And then the other thing, we get to our field

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:05.280
site and then we have to buy two months' worth
of food to add another ten, twelve boxes to

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.990
our boxes.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:12.090
And then, we'd also go to these wonderful
open food markets where--. I mean, I just

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.960
experienced your open food market, which was
quite nice I'll have to say.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960
[laughter]

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.870
But there's nothing like an African open market
with all the tropical fruit: the mangoes,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:30.170
the pineapples and just all the food that
we can get. And we loaded up and happiness

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.850
is seeing this city in my rear view mirror.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:40.590
You can imagine. Hit the open road and it's
just extraordinary. That shot on the left,

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:47.740
a beautiful lake in the middle of Africa,
but not every scene we see is amazing. I mean,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.240
this is chimp's habitat and the distance in
this upper right shot, but that's a tea plantation

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.000
surrounding it. You get the same in all over
West Africa: coffee, chocolate.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.010
There's a lot of unsustainable removal of
these forests for the things that we in the

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:09.880
West and East have a hugely high demand for.
So, part of our messaging is as far as a conservation

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.930
organization is make sure you know where you're
buying and eating that stuff. Make sure you

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.690
know where it comes from because if we don't,
the result of that, like the African hardwood

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:25.571
demand, which is pretty much developed country-wide,
you can buy all kinds of African hardwood

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.571
in this country.

00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:31.220
Just be sure you know where your wood's coming
from when you need to build something. Obviously,

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.130
we need to keep utilizing. We need to keep
building. It's just a matter of sustainability.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.460
I have a feeling I'm preaching to the choir
here, but it's still worth saying. And so,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:46.470
this is, as soon as we turn off the main road,
this is what the road looks like. It is extraordinary

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.040
getting to the field site, about a nine and
a half hour drive.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.870
And then, we enter this forest, this magical
kingdom of the chimps, which you'll see in

00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:01.730
the film. I hope you all plan on going. It's
just an amazing, amazing place, this magical,

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:11.350
150-, 200-foot canopy. Layers of canopy unlike
anything we see here anymore. It's still untouched,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:17.550
phenomenally beautiful and absolutely worth
saving.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.340
And this is home sweet home. We lived in this
tent, on and off. We have a little hut in

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:29.270
Gombe National Park, where Kristin and I have
lived for 12 years together. But in this field

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:35.490
site, we just lived in this tent. And on the
right is our technology base tent. So, I would

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.850
have my computer, hard drive, HD screen.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.130
Kristin would have her stack of hard drives
for all her sound and stills. We ran that

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.170
off both solar and a little generator. And
so, we would come back from ten, eleven hours

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:58.430
in the field and then have to download 50
Gigs of data from our computers. And we could

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:03.220
not have done this without the amazing crew,
the field assistance there.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.410
So, I wanted to show you, this is our group,
but Kristin's not in it because she's always

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:13.440
taking the pictures. So, I finally got her
in front of the camera for this one. This

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:24.530
is just on a break during a shooting day in
the forest. And this is our commute to work.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.490
[laughter]

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.990
There's no traffic except for the occasional--.
Occasionally, we would run into an elephant

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.990
herd and that's like, serious traffic because
you are stopped in your tracks for a long

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:42.200
time because they will spread out. And if
they run into you in this forest, it's like

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.870
you can't see the traffic. It's stopping you
because if you run head to head in a mom who

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.250
has a kid, it can be really, really dangerous.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.990
But you would know they were there. You could
hear them rumbling. They do this deep [elephant

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.350
rumble noise]. You hear this sound in the
forest like, "Oh, shh."

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.350
[laughter]

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:08.270
"What's gonna happen?" And so, you back off
and look where you need to go and try to get

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:14.200
around them. But I just thought this shot
was fun. Can we get those lights? I didn't

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.060
know those were so bright. Can we kill those?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.589
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Then we can't see you.

00:14:18.589 --> 00:14:23.510
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: That's OK. Oh, it's not OK
for you as a videographer. I have no sympathy

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.740
for you. I was filming in a black forest.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.810
[laughter]

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:32.500
Dark chimps in a black forest. Come on. Man
up here.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.490
[laughter]

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.670
Anyway, if there wasn't this light on me,
you could see the--. Well, you can see on

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.960
the left side. This is an elephant footprint.
[tearing sound] All the way around here. I

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.180
just love this because there's a chimp footprint
in it.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:55.030
There's a baboon. Bush pig. And up at the
top, just out of the frame, is a buffalo print.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:01.561
They also clog the road a little bit if there's
a herd of buffalo. You stop and reroute. Your

00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:02.960
GPS says, "Rerouting."

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.960
[laughter]

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:10.640
"There's a baboon trail a hundred yards behind
you and take a left." And we're also an all-weather

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.890
crew. A lot of our work, it's not rain-dependent.
And so, and you'll see in the sequence, actually

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:23.790
we got some really, really amazing rain dances
and rain displays as they were, as one community

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.680
was being aggressive towards another.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.700
And so, it actually turned out to be really,
really important stuff to be able to shoot

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.060
in this kind of rain. And also, watch where
you step. If you can't--. There are days that

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:41.620
you can't find chimps. And you just walk and
walk and search and search, but those days

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.470
aren't boring 'cause you've run into people
like this.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:51.310
This was about a seven-inch tall praying mantis
and rather than scurrying away scared this

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.540
thing--. I jumped out of my skin, I tell you,
because I'm always aware of snakes, whatever

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.490
might be on the ground. And this thing jumped
up like this--

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.490
[laughter]

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:04.300
and I jumped over there. Then, I walked towards
it to take a picture and the thing came towards

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.840
me like this.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840
[laughter]

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.420
It's like, "No way." So, I don't know. It's
like everything in that forest is fascinating.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.880
[laughter]

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:20.089
Even the snakes are fascinating. This is a
rhinoceros viper. You can see the little,

00:16:20.089 --> 00:16:26.540
I think those must be like nose smell sensors
that it's got. So, it has incredibly good

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.740
sense of smell and feel. And it was hiding
in the vegetation.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.810
And the chimps streamed right past it. You
think the chimps are gonna be tuned in to

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.601
all the dangers around them. Well, there was
an estrous female there at the time. There's

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:44.230
a very popular female. They didn't even see
the snake at all. And they walked right past

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.630
it. I saw it kind of move, so I got a few
shots of it.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.339
And so, I told everybody there was a snake
right there. Be really careful of that spot.

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:56.200
And you could hardly see it. And then, the
chimps started to compete over this female.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.510
And so what did I do? I pick up my camera
and run right over here and start filming.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.510
[laughter]

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.260
And it's only after the thing calmed down,
all this aggression calmed down, that I realized

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:11.290
I was standing right next to the snake, who
just took pity on my stupidity and allowed

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:18.339
me to live another day. Now, this guy came
right into camp. I thought it was a lobster,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.480
but--.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.620
[laughter]

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:27.410
It's a scorpion. Again, about six, seven inches
long, extraordinary and actually probably

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.440
less poisonous than the little tiny ones that
crawl into your clothes. Kristin did get stung

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.880
by one on the hand just going through paperwork.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.679
And it put her out for about three days. She
hardly moved. Just moving her arm was agony

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:47.480
for three days. It was just awful. But not
everything in the forest is awful. I had to

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.970
throw this in for the Disney talk just because
of the Bambi effect of this little guy. We

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:59.290
were listening for chimps one day and this
little person came out of the forest and just

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.410
looking around, looked a little bit lost,
couldn't find mom and it's just adorable.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.600
So, a lot of the wildlife, the birds and the
other wildlife, just fascinating as well.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:14.240
So, what do I carry on my commute? People
ask me this all the time. And so, I decided

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.930
to just spread invisible Bill out on a table.
And so, I wear these big rubber boots to get

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.950
through those swamps. Ankle braces on both
sides.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:29.080
Knee braces on both sides. I've been doing
this for 20 years. So, my joints are getting

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.600
a little bit stiff. Usually wear shorts. And
I take a little hand-held radio, so I can

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:45.110
talk in Swahili to the field assistance there.
Swiss Army knife, a pair of binoculars, GPS,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.550
compass. The GPS is amazing because I can
figure out fig trees that are fruiting.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.970
And then, if the chimps are hitting even remotely
there, then the next day I can swing and get

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.321
around them, be at the fig tree before the
chimps get there, being able to predict their

00:18:59.321 --> 00:19:03.430
behavior. So, that's another way technology
really helps out. And I threw a slide in here

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.970
about that later on and then, my camera.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.830
You can see the camera was about this big.
So, just to put that to scale. And there's

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:19.570
a rain cape underneath all that. There's plastic
bags to keep everything dry, a headlamp because

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:27.540
we leave at dark and often come back at dark,
extra batteries. A little bit of food. And

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.600
just some basic medical stuff and lots of
blister stuff. Go ahead.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.960
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So, they just released a whole
series of 4K cameras the size of SLR's. Don't

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.460
you wish you shot this later?

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.230
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: You know, there's never a
good time. That's a great question. And yes.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:52.190
And we did utilize some of the DSLRs for a
lot of the scenic stuff. But in 2008, the

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.340
Panasonic 3700 was the cream of the crop.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:02.950
I got the first one out in production in Europe.
I used the--. The drawback on some of these

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.820
cameras, like the Canon HJ series. So, I'm
carrying around equipment that's worth more

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.960
than my house--

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.370
[laughter]

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.880
through the jungles of Africa day after day.
So, it's kind of funny, but those are those

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:23.520
lenses that are just absolutely to die for.
And I don't even know if those smaller cameras

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:31.510
can utilize those longer lenses because with
the doubler, with the HJ 18, I think I can

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:36.670
shoot at the equivalent of around 12 to 15
hundred millimeter, which--.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.760
We follow no closer than 20 feet just so we
don't interfere with anything the chimps might

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.790
be doing. So, we can't go in and get close.
We have to bring the chimps to us with our

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:52.559
long lenses. And that allowed us to get tight
shots that we've just never been allowed to

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:54.360
get before. But thanks for asking.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.610
And if somebody else has a question while
I'm moving through this, shoot. Yeah. Go ahead.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.059
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, Google, I've seen on Cliff
bars and Cliffbuilders, things like that.

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:04.830
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Why don't they just sponsor
all of my work? That's what I wanna know.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.830
[laughter]

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.200
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Do you get any of the bars, too,
or are you foraging?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.730
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: I am a foraging machine,
yeah.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.730
[laughter]

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.270
And it's really interesting 'cause I've lived
in Gombe for all those years. And there's

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.130
some season that the food's not very nice.
And it's interesting. The chimps don't get

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:24.290
that excited about it. When they get really
excited it's over something super sweet. So,

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:31.650
there's that, there's a real connection between
us liking sweet and salty foods as well.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.290
They're pretty rare. And those are the ones
in the forest I obviously like. It's the ones

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:40.630
they like as well. Also, if you're high-ranking,
you get the top of the tree because that's

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:46.720
where, if you think about this, in your own
backyard, if you have an apple tree, the juiciest,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.670
ripest fruit is gonna be the highest stuff
in the tree because it's getting all the sunlight.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.620
So, it's ripening better. And so, if you're
low-ranking, you're going to the lower parts

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.170
of the tree eating the lower fruit. If you're
high-ranking, you can be right in the top.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:06.840
But yeah, Ilove chimp food. It's funny that
in certain times of year, I start craving.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.100
I think there's a real connection between
what we used to eat just for nutrition and

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.830
also for like, for medicine.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.950
There's a real correlation between that, because
I really crave some of this food that I no

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:25.800
longer get. There's something in arugula that's
really similar to what Jane called "chimp

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.670
spinach" all these years ago that I eat at
the end of the day that chimps just stuff

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.640
this stuff down at the end of the day. There's
some chemical in it that when arugula start

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.820
getting popular, it's like, "Oh, yeah. I feel
like I'm at home now."

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.820
[laughter]

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:43.780
&gt;&gt;Male #4: What percentage of the overlap
is it between what the chimps eat versus what

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.780
you'll eat? I mean, is there certain things
that they'll really go for that you don't?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.420
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: There are. Their sense of
bitter and sour, their ability to tolerate

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.660
that, is off the scale. But if I went with
you, mine would be off the scale compared

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.910
to most people 'cause my wife--.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.570
&gt;&gt;Male #4: You could cook it and that cuts
it though.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.140
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: You could cook it. You could
cook it, like some of the fruit. But I mean,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:08.140
some of it is to die for, like the wild plums
there or, the woodland fruits. They are, I

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.110
mean, better than anything we have here--really
just amazing.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:17.930
And I would say that's probably less than
5%of the chimp food. And a lot of it is just

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:23.110
like they're just eating because that's the
only thing around. Go ahead. Great shirt,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.590
by the way. What's that?

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.410
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Why are monkeys known to eat bananas?

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.410
[laughter]

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.600
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: It's because people feed
them bananas.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.210
[laughter]

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:42.429
It's not a natural food for them. And so,
I actually, it's sometimes to me, when I see

00:23:42.429 --> 00:23:46.660
chimps in captivity, when I see chimps dressed
up, it's just heartbreaking to me because

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.520
it's not where in my heart I know chimps belong.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:58.470
And so, that's why get that image because
have shown them eating bananas on television

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.841
and in pictures. But it's a not natural food
for them. Good question, though, and I love

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.049
your guy's shirts. You wanna stand up and
show everybody your shirts?

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:07.049
[laughter]

00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:13.000
Yeah. This is what we want.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[clapping]

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.740
And also, there is nothing like being side-by-side
for all these years with the person I love,

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:27.400
being able to film chimps in the wild. I mean,
it's just absolutely the best job in the world.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.100
In answer to your question about the tight
stuff that we can get.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:36.809
These are just screen grabs, so from my HD
screen that--. You all know what a screen

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:41.390
grab is, right? Like, you just--. Well, at
your desk somebody didn't know what a screen

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.030
grab was. I said, "I need to go on Google
Earth and get a screen grab." And they said,

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.580
"What's a screen grab?" So anyway a screen
grab is like an image of the image you see

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.840
on your screen.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.470
And as we were editing, I just threw some
of these up. And I mean, that is detailed,

00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:04.600
is just extraordinary. That's over 20 feet
away. In the bottom right, that face, half

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.299
a chimp's face at 20 feet away. You'll see
in the film these lovely, the hands moving

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.430
through the hair as one male will groom another.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:20.670
It just gave me an opportunity I'd never had
before with my little Sony camcorder, HD cameras.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:25.180
So then, we get into the characters. When
you go and see the film, you'll meet this

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:31.440
guy. And why is a chimp, if you look at this
picture, look at that eye versus this one,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.790
why would I key, as a cinematographer, on
this chimp?

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:43.179
Any ideas? Check his eyes out. Look at the
power of this shot when you can actually see

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:45.790
exactly where he's looking. Isn't that cool?

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.790
[laughter]

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.559
So, he's one of our bad guys. We built this
guy up as one of our enemies. And so,--

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:53.559
[laughter]

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:57.710
as the chimps were moving through the forest
and bearing down on Oscar and his family,

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:04.150
poor Pincer gets cast as the villain. And
it's simply because of his eyes, not because

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.550
he's a mean guy.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.570
[laughter]

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:13.751
And yeah, here's another one, Lofty on the
right there. You'll see him in the film. He

00:26:13.751 --> 00:26:23.580
is such a stud. A big, prime example of a
adult male chimp. And these guys are about

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.650
five times our strength. And so, they're just
extraordinary physical machines. Go ahead.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.290
&gt;&gt;Female #1: How do you keep track of who's
who?

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.940
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: The same way you all keep
track of who's who here. And it's really strange.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:41.480
The first time you get there, you think, "How
can anybody tell all these chimps apart?"

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.930
And now, I can hear their call from a half
a mile away and I say, "That's Freud. That's

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:50.340
Frodo. That's Apollo. That's Atlas." It's
just like we do in our own culture, but it's

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.340
interesting.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.760
I grew up in really rural Oregon and so, I
hadn't had a lot of cultural diversity, not

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.840
in the school that I went to. And so, when
I first went to Africa, there was, I didn't

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.110
have with African American faces, I didn't
have, or African faces, I didn't have that

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:14.480
ability to differentiate different traits.
And this is true right across the board that

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.400
we get used, in our own culture, the differentiating
traits that are familiar to us.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.630
And I had to learn that about chimps as well,
that though they all look the same, I need

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:34.730
to use different cues that I'm used to using
to recognize people. And you do see that Lofty

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:40.400
has a dark beard there. But they both have
black faces. So, in poor light conditions,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.650
you might get these two mixed up. But he has
a little bit of a tattered ear.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:50.450
So, over time, you get more and more accustomed
to figuring out who they are. And then after,

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:57.040
like with this community, after being in Gombe
for 15 years and then following these guys,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:04.540
I guess within 2½ weeks, I had 35 of the
chimps down, committed to memory. So, and

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.430
I'm not really very good with faces, human
faces.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.430
[laughter]

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:15.250
And I just threw this in just to shout out
for my wife. My job is hard as a cinematographer,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.929
but I can always dial in some game and the
chimps are moving. For her, to get chimps

00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:26.310
to stop at that slow shutter speed, if any
of you are photographers or technicians, every

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.480
once in a while all the elements come together.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.110
This beam of light came down onto Burg here.
And she can get these wonderful shots of his

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:40.510
beautiful amber eyes. But it's so hard. Her
job is much harder than mine even. And then,

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.320
here's our ultimate villain.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.320
[laughter]

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:50.140
And you'll meet Scar in the movie. And this
is Scar. He's a grumpy old man, who is the

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.330
leader of the villains.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.549
[laughter]

00:28:53.549 --> 00:29:00.480
And so, my job, a big part of my job was to
record this territorial behavior. So, we have

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.601
Oscar and his group in the film. And then,
we have Hair and the villains, who'd come

00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:14.390
in and that's very true about the nature of
chimp society. Each community has a home range,

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.340
which overlaps with three or four other home
ranges.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.430
And they compete for no man's land, or no
chimp's land, the overlapping territory. And

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:29.320
if a strong community can, they will completely
take over another community. So, in this case,

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:36.600
these guys--. And they're no better conservationists
than we've exhibited in the last 15, 20 years.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.350
These guys wiped out all of the colobus monkeys
in the home range.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:45.549
They hunted them down and ate all of them.
And so, they started going farther and farther

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:50.660
out to patrol and search for monkeys, which
means they move farther and farther into the

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:57.280
neighboring communities' range but also after
fruit and nut trees as well. The biggest challenge

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.150
for me, though, was to actually get around
them.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:04.541
So, they're moving in these beautiful long
patrol-like lines. They stop calling. They

00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:10.090
stop exhibiting other behavior. It's very
much like a military patrol. It's just extraordinary.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.650
And so, my job is to get them, and you'll
see in the film, these shots as they're coming

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.650
towards you.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:20.970
But that means I have to be traveling in faster-than-chimp
speed, which at times seems like it's faster

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.140
than light 'cause they move so quickly. But
I did manage to get enough for this film to

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.620
make a really powerful story. And another
thing I--. Oh, go ahead. Do you have a question?

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:36.720
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Would you say you had a story you
create in the movie?

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Or is this what you actually experienced
out there? Would you say they end up playing

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720
each other's characters?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yes.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Is not really there?

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.190
&gt;&gt;Male #5: And a lot of times, Disney is criticized
for doing the good versus bad, herbivores

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.190
versus carnivores.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:53.280
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Absolutely. And I had to,
as primarily a researcher and research videographer,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:00.169
I go to these conferences, the International
Primate Behavioral Conferences. And so, I

00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:04.830
have a status as a behaviorist as much as
I do as a filmmaker. And so, I have to make

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.540
sure my films are true to science.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.340
And of course, when you're shooting a film,
it isn't chronological. It doesn't happen

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.170
just in the way. There's always going to be
some license, but the line we can't cross

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:22.440
is the line of changing chimp behavior. And
of course, producers, who don't understand

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.300
chimp behavior, are constantly saying, "Can
we say this? Can we say that? Can we say it

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.470
this way?"

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:36.040
"No. No and no." So, I choose my battles.
And if it's one over maybe a subtle vocalization,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.740
I might not fight that one as hard as I would
as if they were like, completely changing

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.050
chimp behavior. But when they built these
villains up as villains, of course, in their

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:52.200
own community they're not villains. They're
the same guys that you'll see in Oscar's community,

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.559
Freddie and the bunch.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:57.559
But to the neighboring community, they're
very much. And those will be the guys that

00:31:57.559 --> 00:32:02.780
you see. Those are the chimps who you are
going to be scared of as a neighboring community

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.840
member. And so, it is telling that story of
the way these overlapping communities defend

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.750
and protect their territory and actually extend
their own territory into another's.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:20.440
And as far as character base, we did take
a little bit of licenses as far as Pincer

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.850
is not the toughest chimp in the world. But
does that matter as much as the demonstrating

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.330
the behavior well? And that's more important
to me. But it's a really good question. It's

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.320
one we should rethink over and over. And I
appreciate questions like that.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.200
So, how far should I push those bounds before
we can say, "That's something I'm not proud

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.690
of anymore." And I've actually taken my name
off films in the credits because I came to

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:51.419
such a split with the production team that
I could no longer be proud and want my name

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:52.419
on that production.

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:53.419
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So--.

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:54.419
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yes.

00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:59.910
&gt;&gt;Male #6: How much of the narrative did Disney
comes to and say, "This is the narrative.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.680
Can you go film it?" Where they said, "We
wanna film chimpanzees. You film stuff and

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680
we'll figure out the narrative."

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.090
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Luckily, we had our working
team was the same people who do the "Planet

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:13.941
Earth," "Blue Planet," "Life of Mammals" team.
So, it wasn't a Disney-based idea. It was

00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:20.440
the three of us sitting down and figuring
out, take chimpanzee behavior. What of chimpanzee

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.680
behavior do we want to run?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.919
And put a script and time-line together, leaving
room for things that might change. And sequences

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:35.900
like this; the hunting sequence was something
we could have never scripted. And guess what.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.550
After years of planning and putting this all
together, within about a year, we had thrown

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.730
two or three of the original scripts away
just because of things that happened on the

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.730
ground.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:51.280
And for me, it's just--. I'm just a documentarian.
I'm gonna follow the strongest story that

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.220
is going on. And so, the chimps really are
the ones who tell the best story. And it's

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.070
up to me to be able to follow and document
that story. So, even though we did have an

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.870
idea of what we wanted to do, in the end,
at the end of the three years, we had a stronger

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:09.369
story than anything we'd come up with. But
thanks. That's a great question. Go ahead.

00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:14.889
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So, when I wanna shoot animals
with dark fur and shadow detail and so on,

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:15.889
it's very hard.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:16.940
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: It is very hard, isn't it?

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.520
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So, are the days that are like
this just working and you can't shoot dark

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.490
or like, Disney films only stop?

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:27.119
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah. And for a Disney film
like this, every shot has to be a postcard

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:32.509
if you can imagine. That was my mantra. So,
there were days that I would get nothing that

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:37.039
made the film. So, I mean, you could follow
for--. 'Cause I think we'd do six days off

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:40.450
or, yeah, sx days off and one day on. That's
a pretty good schedule.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.450
[laughter]

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:46.739
No, it's six days off and then one day on.
You know what I'm saying.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.739
[laughter]

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:53.089
So, in that six days of working, we would
get, some days, almost nothing usable for

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:58.640
the film. And it would simply be because of
the light, because of something going on.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.460
And at the end of the third day, and you're
thinking, "I just wanna go back home. It looks

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.289
like it's gonna rain."

00:35:06.289 --> 00:35:10.869
You hang on for another two hours and then
you'd get a sequence like this that just makes

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:16.250
the film. And this was the African killer
bees on Oscar. He just dug into this nest.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.250
And--

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.250
[laughter]

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.249
I mean, it was scary, but this was within
like, three or four days of wrapping the whole

00:35:22.249 --> 00:35:27.359
film and that's what I loved about chimp behavior.
You never know what's gonna happen next. And

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:29.710
so, you can just keep following and following.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:35.339
And yeah, I mean, if you're not as enthralled
with your subject as I am, you do sometimes

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:41.239
wanna just say, "This isn't worth the time
I'm investing." 'Cause it is a huge--. I was

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:46.290
shooting at something like 150-to-1 ratio,
meaning for every minute that might make the

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.729
film, probably even more, there's an hour
and a half, yeah.

00:35:49.729 --> 00:35:54.210
Two and a half hours of footage sitting somewhere
that's never gonna be seen. And that's the

00:35:54.210 --> 00:36:03.709
stuff that I did shoot. And so, imagine the
ratio of time is just sub-fractional. Absolutely.

00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:08.420
And we just had to wait for the best light
and wait for the best situations. Go ahead.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.339
&gt;&gt;Male #8: What was the most dangerous moment
that you felt?

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:14.881
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: The most dangerous moment?

00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:15.881
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Yeah, with the chimps.

00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:18.910
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: The most dangerous moment
for me was the day that we got back to camp

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.819
and it was the day that I'd run a whole herd
of buffalo over my wife.

00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:23.819
[laughter]

00:36:23.819 --> 00:36:27.680
So, that was dangerous for me when I got back
to camp. It's much more dangerous for her

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.640
when she was in the field. But that was the
scariest moment that I'm saying. We'd gone

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.460
around this bend. Kristin was coming along
behind us. And I was saying "this is where

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:44.559
we are" and I was giving her some geographic
marker of where we were.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:48.770
And right then, I heard this thundering to
my left. And it was a herd of buffalo running

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:55.989
from me. They'd winded me. And they ran straight
in Kristin's direction. And they ran through

00:36:55.989 --> 00:37:00.150
a valley and could just come up the other
side and run right into them. Luckily, they

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.990
took the valley for cover. But they were really
scared.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:09.390
She and James were really scared and they
ran as fast as they could to get away. And

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.980
I'm sure there's a few times that I don't
even know about, like times that I stepped

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:19.319
over a snake and didn't know. But that's probably
the most dangerous stuff. And you pick up

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:21.690
malaria a few times. What's that?

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.160
&gt;&gt;Male #8: You never feel dangerous with the
chimpanzee?

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.170
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Never with chimps, never
ever. They've been followed by the researchers

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.410
for decades. And they're used to having people
around. And even in the heart of those battles,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:38.180
I never feel like they're gonna do something
to me. It's very humbling, though, when you

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.479
see that kind of power that they'll just grab
a branch and break a tree in two.

00:37:42.479 --> 00:37:48.079
It's just extraordinary. So, it's really humbling
in that respect. And they have canines, extraordinary

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:53.289
canines. They could do me in in seconds if
they wanted to. And so, after 20 years, you

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:58.539
feel like you have, hopefully, a certain report.
Go ahead.

00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:00.069
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Did they ever acknowledge you?

00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:03.470
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: They don't. I mean, my job
is to be a fly on the wall both as a researcher

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:09.069
and as a filmmaker. My best day is when no
chimp even looks up at me when I'm filming.

00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:15.680
And you'll see as you're watching the film
that there's very little eye contact between

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.719
the chimp and the camera.

00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:23.420
They're very seldom looking at us. They're
just doing their thing. So, this is the African

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.549
killer bee sequence. So, the bees are buzzing
around everywhere. And these guys are digging

00:38:28.549 --> 00:38:31.869
into this nest. It's just amazing.

00:38:31.869 --> 00:38:33.220
[laughter]

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.479
Look at that honey. It's just amazing. But
if that was me, I would probably survive about

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:45.060
30 seconds. That would just do a human in.
But they are going to town. And then there's

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.549
the fig-eating sequence that I went for two
weeks. I stood in a three by three platform

00:38:50.549 --> 00:38:58.450
in the top of the next tree over from our
big Mama Macuso fig tree. And just to get

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:05.040
a different angle of the chimps. And so, this
is that day's commute. This is my elevator.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040
[laughter]

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:11.779
And so, I took some self-portraits of myself
as I'm going up. But look at the ropes going

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:16.309
down into the abyss. [laughs]

00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:18.049
[pause]

00:39:18.049 --> 00:39:23.400
And so, I spent a couple weeks doing this.
And this was my little, that was my place

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:30.890
in the forest for about two weeks. But there
is on the way down--. Oh, it's not supposed

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:37.210
to, oh, yeah, I guess it is. Just to have
that kind of angle and be able to shoot down

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:42.200
and across as the chimps are in this frame
was a really extraordinary experience. And

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.260
one the way down, the first steps is a real
doozy.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.260
[laughter]

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:53.490
To be hanging like you're 120 feet up above
the canopy is it's funny. You're tied in,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:40:00.890
but there's a real freedom to that, that you
see the forest and hear sounds and experience

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:05.160
smells that you're just not accustomed to
down in the forest floor. So, it was a real

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:12.529
treat to get to do this. And during this sequence,
this guy actually made the film. And he so

00:40:12.529 --> 00:40:17.249
reminded us of that squirrel from "Ice Age"
with his bug eyes.

00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:18.249
[laughter]

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:23.249
And so, even if we didn't have chimps there,
we had all kinds of other species at this

00:40:23.249 --> 00:40:28.950
fig tree to keep us company. That's a red-tailed
monkey on the left and a grey-cheeked mangabey

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:34.779
in the upper right. And you can get shots
like this.

00:40:34.779 --> 00:40:37.209
[pause]

00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:43.450
And I was saying what I do on my GPS. Well,
these are my way points. And it actually does

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:50.869
make me a better filmmaker. I just grab this
off Google Earth's site. You'll see areas

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:56.089
like the elephant wallow up there. I'd always
want to get there first before the chimps

00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:59.969
did so I can have them coming into this area.

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:02.970
There were hunts right around in there, so
if I know that they're heading towards area

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:08.219
there are hunts, I'll go out in front, try
to figure out where the colobus monkeys are

00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:14.530
so I can get a jump on the hunt. And so, as
a tool, it's so much fun for me to come home

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.039
and relive. I have a date on all of these
way points.

00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:26.989
Relive on Google Earth all of my experiences
out in the forest. I filled my entire GPS

00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:30.299
with way points [laughs] during the filming
of "Chimpanzee."

00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:35.369
&gt;&gt;Male #10: You need to [inaudible] Street
View trailer.

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:38.750
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah, I do. [laughs]

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:44.680
And so, getting one of the luxuries of getting
to shoot for Disney Nature is we had a huge

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:51.430
budget and three years to do this film. So,
really time was very, very much on my side

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:57.789
for the making of this film. And sadly, as
a juxtaposition, I can't say the same for

00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:04.420
chimps. Time is definitely not on their side.
This is about what their range was, even within

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:12.519
the last hundred or so years, this whole equatorial
forest belt, incredibly wide, right across

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:23.131
Africa. And just in 80 years of technology,
chainsaws, demand for African hardwoods, these

00:42:23.131 --> 00:42:29.700
areas have been very, very much fragmented.
That whole central area completely gone, fragments

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.589
in the far West of Africa. And that's what
we're all about now is doing everything we

00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:38.349
can do to preserve chimps and chimp habitat.

00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:45.200
During the 90s, I shot this video of Jane.
And this was when she was realizing, and it's

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.509
the history of her realizing that she's gotten
so much from the chimps and it was time for

00:42:50.509 --> 00:42:55.780
her to do something for them. So, I'm gonna
play this video. Again, I shot this, I guess

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.640
around 1999, but it's still very relevant.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.979
[plays video]

00:42:59.979 --> 00:43:04.670
&gt;&gt;Jane Goodall: About seven years ago, I--.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.759
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: That's just outside of Gombe
National Park.

00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:13.180
&gt;&gt;Jane Goodall: And I was absolutely horrified
at what I saw. So quickly it seemed the environment

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.999
outside the National Park had been utterly
destroyed. The trees had gone. When I came

00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:30.750
in 1960, you could go in a boat and go right
up to Bolivia.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:36.789
It was chimp habitat. You could climb up the
hills of [ ] and look eastward--chimp habitat

00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:38.160
as far as you could see. And that's gone.
It's only within the 30 square mile path that

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.459
the original forest remains. The question
then was, when people are struggling to survive,

00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:46.959
how is it possible to protect the precious
oasis of the Gombe forest with its very famous

00:43:46.959 --> 00:43:47.959
chimpanzees?

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:51.359
And that's how TACARE came into being--a program
to try and improve the lives of the local

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:58.609
people and the villages surrounding the path
and up and down the lake shore.

00:43:58.609 --> 00:44:00.319
[end video]

00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:04.911
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: And so, that's our great
work is when you're working with people who

00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:12.809
are absolutely destitute in a country that's
arguably nine thousand miles away from the

00:44:12.809 --> 00:44:16.299
wealthiest country in the world, that is a
real challenge.

00:44:16.299 --> 00:44:21.009
You're seeing the forest on the outside of
the park disappear. You saw some of those

00:44:21.009 --> 00:44:29.499
shots. That was chimp habitat when Jane arrived
in 1960. And so, our huge challenge now is

00:44:29.499 --> 00:44:36.170
to slow down that tide and actually turn it
at some point. And Jane's visionary work not

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:42.240
only was research in 1960, but realizing that
absolutely you have to work with and have

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.780
people benefit from conservation work.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.359
And that's her other great pioneering work.
And so, we're not just a chimp conservation

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:58.529
organization. We're very, very much both humanitarian
and many, many, many programs that I very

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:02.710
much encourage you to check our website out
and look at Jane's vision. Read some of her

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.640
books. But what are the threats to chimps?

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:12.880
Certainly the global demand for African hardwoods
and the lumber that comes out of these forests,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:20.609
unsustainable agriculture, slash and burn
agriculture. The bush meat trade is also very,

00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:26.599
very devastating, has a very devastating impact
on chimps. And the illegal animal trade as

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:33.470
well has a huge impact on chimpanzee populations.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:39.359
And so, with this demand, these are local
people are just struggling to make a living

00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:45.740
cutting down more forest, creating--. This
is just outside of chimp habitat. Trying to

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:52.599
farm in these areas. And then resulting in
the soil washing down from the slopes and

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:57.299
that all goes away. So, they start the whole
process over again, time and time again.

00:45:57.299 --> 00:46:04.430
So, this TACARE program that we've started
around Gombe, we're trying to emulate in sites

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:12.000
right across Africa now. So, in Tanzania,
we have Tanzanian nurses going out, do interfacing

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.869
with local people. We'll go to a village and
find out "What are your biggest needs?" "Well,

00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:21.019
we don't have a dispensary here." And so,
we'll raise funds.

00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:27.109
We'll work with local people. We'll start
a dispensary. And we have staff who are absolute

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:32.559
experts in the field. We have a wonderful
savings and credit scheme, so that we train

00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:36.621
women up who actually invest in their own
scheme. A group of women will come and invest

00:46:36.621 --> 00:46:39.890
in their own scheme. We have a matching fund
for that.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:47.369
And that very much empowers women to be gainfully
employed using their own resources and their

00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:53.979
own businesses. In this case, this woman,
fabulous woman, had started a grain grinding

00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:58.400
system in her own little village. And now,
people are bringing grain to her and she's

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.749
exporting that and she's making a lot of money
where she wouldn't have had this opportunity

00:47:02.749 --> 00:47:04.059
before.

00:47:04.059 --> 00:47:10.300
Also, inexpensive ways to solve problems.
Our team developed the Vetiveria grass, which

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.529
is a bunch grass, which creates, when planted
across these slopes like this, creates terrace

00:47:15.529 --> 00:47:21.080
agriculture, which, terrace agriculture, there's
a real science, very difficult to do. This

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:28.859
system is incredibly cheap, incredibly effective,
and this field will now be used for decades

00:47:28.859 --> 00:47:31.700
rather than for two years.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:38.640
And also, once we start protecting the forests
and start doing forest management, cash crop

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.670
such as honey come into play in the villages.
And so, we have this honey distribution system

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:51.959
and honey bee program, which helps local villages
to actually make money by having forest maintained

00:47:51.959 --> 00:47:54.190
and healthy.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.699
And also, I don’t know if you've heard about
Jane's Roots and Shoots program, but this

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:03.369
is an amazing program. It's now in 130 countries
around the world. I encourage you to definitely

00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:09.069
look more into this. It's all about empowering
kids to make the world a better place for

00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:10.440
people, animals, and the environment.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:16.989
And what better message in this day and age
can you give kids? And it's got this global

00:48:16.989 --> 00:48:21.369
feel about it as well. So, kids in Tanzania,
they could be chatting with kids in China.

00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:25.940
They can be chatting with kids in the US,
all working towards those three main goals,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:31.859
which is just fabulous. And this story has
a very local feel.

00:48:31.859 --> 00:48:38.549
A very good friend of mine, Deborah Simons,
is a San Franciscan. And actually, she lives

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:45.160
right around here. And she is a manager of
the Wanda Bobowski Fund, which is a scholarship

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.240
for young girls. And she came and visited
Gombe years ago, fell in love with the place,

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.910
saw that especially young women had a very
rough time in the world there.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:03.180
And so now, over 200 young women have been
issued these scholarship. And Yaku Pica here,

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:11.440
the young woman on the left, was an orphaned
destitute, had absolutely zero future and

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:18.509
her headmaster identified her as a great student.
She applied for the fund. She got a scholarship.

00:49:18.509 --> 00:49:20.339
She worked up through college.

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:26.970
She got a position at a local elementary school.
I was there. I filmed her teaching science

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:31.190
to her kids and she was talking about the
qualities of the magnet to these, I guess

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:37.421
they would be about third grade kids. Just
so much fun. So enthusiastic. When you think

00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:40.989
about, "Well, what impact could this possibly
have?"

00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:44.979
Well, Yaku Pica's kids could grow up to be
the next leaders of the generation. She could

00:49:44.979 --> 00:49:49.829
grow up to be a government leader. She could
be the first woman president in Tanzania.

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:55.519
You get a generation of kids thinking differently
about the world, finding hope in the world,

00:49:55.519 --> 00:50:00.210
and you're really gonna have a major influence
on the next generation's philosophical ideals

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.210
and so forth.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:06.810
And it's so important in this day and age.
And so, this is Yaku Pica's challenge. This

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:12.460
is her classroom on the right. Its 70 kids
who she teaches. So, it is an extraordinary

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:19.849
challenge, but she's done a wonderful job.
Some of you in Google Earth know Lillian Pintea,

00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:29.690
who's our IT guy and our GIS guy. And so,
just for him, I threw a few slides in for

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.209
his benefit as well.

00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:39.910
We work a lot with Google Earth. We have this
new Open Data Kit program. So, we have forest

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:45.219
monitors who take--. And you're involved with
I don't know if anybody in this room is involved

00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:51.490
in this program, but Android phones, which
can be through the Open Data Kit program.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:59.849
They turned into these incredible, incredibly
powerful data collecting machines.

00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:08.599
And so, we have a whole bunch of forest monitors
and patrollers who are traveling through the

00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:14.959
forest and through the areas of West Africa
or of Western Tanzania. Oh, we have to wrap

00:51:14.959 --> 00:51:17.700
up pretty quick. Oh. Getting on this. What's
the time?

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.700
&gt;&gt;Female #2: It's two o'clock.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:22.239
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: It's two o'clock now? Oh,
gosh. 'Cause we have some Q and A, don't we?

00:51:22.239 --> 00:51:23.239
[laughter]

00:51:23.239 --> 00:51:26.910
So, anyway, we are doing some awesome work
with Google and Lillian's going to shoot me

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.569
because I didn't talk enough about this.

00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:29.569
[laughter]

00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:33.300
But anyway, these are our guys in the field
doing awesome stuff with Google. Yeah, look

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:39.779
some of that stuff up as well. But I would
love to answer some questions. I'm sorry I've

00:51:39.779 --> 00:51:47.450
gone on too long, but should we go straight
to some questions? Yeah? Anybody have any

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.839
questions? Not so much. [laughs] Oh, go ahead.

00:51:49.839 --> 00:52:02.749
&gt;&gt;Male #11: So, would you say that it's groups
of chimpanzees that will battle each other?

00:52:02.749 --> 00:52:03.749
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yes.

00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:04.749
&gt;&gt;Male #11: For their territory?

00:52:04.749 --> 00:52:05.749
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah.

00:52:05.749 --> 00:52:06.749
&gt;&gt;Male #11: You said they beat each other?

00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:07.749
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Really, they will kill one
another. Yeah, the adults will kill one another

00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:08.749
for sure. Absolutely.

00:52:08.749 --> 00:52:12.119
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Anyway, do the tribes merge or
groups merge?

00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:18.029
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: The only genetic, as far
as spreading genetics from one community to

00:52:18.029 --> 00:52:24.349
another, the females do that. So, at about
age 12 or 13, when the females become reproductively

00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:28.430
active, they're likely to transfer from one
community to another. So, they are the only

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:36.279
accepted ones. If a male gets caught on that
border trying, on that no chimp's land, he's

00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:37.989
definitely gonna get attacked.

00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:43.140
So, that's how genetic diversity is maintained
is through the female transfer from one community

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.140
to another.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.410
&gt;&gt;Male #12: If one group takes over another
group's area, will they just wipe out the

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.410
whole--?

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:51.170
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah. They will either be
shifted to a much smaller area or they could

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:55.819
be completely eliminated over time. And you
might incorporate the females from that community

00:52:55.819 --> 00:52:59.009
into your group. Yeah. Yes, go ahead.

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:03.999
&gt;&gt;Male #13: So, this may be more for your
wife then, than you. But what percentage of

00:53:03.999 --> 00:53:10.280
the sound in a film like this is fully, or
from other periods rather than actually being

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.280
live sound?

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:17.119
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: As far as sync sound versus
wild track or--? Yeah. I mean, we could do

00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:22.640
sync sound some of the time, but because I'm
a noisy cameraman, she would have to go off

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.799
with a different--.

00:53:24.799 --> 00:53:28.459
Within the community, there could be four
or five or six different subgroups. And so,

00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:34.410
she would hang out with other chimps. And
then, we'd sync sound up later. So, it's not,

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:38.900
the sounds that you hear are often not true
to the voice of the individual you're seeing.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:42.890
[laughs] But I think most people won't notice
that, but there are some.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:43.890
[laughter]

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:50.319
There are some sync sound shots, like the
drumming display that you'll see Scar do,

00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:55.289
that was sync sound. But that was your question
as far as the sync sound stuff? Yeah. Go ahead.

00:53:55.289 --> 00:54:04.880
&gt;&gt;Male #14: [inaudible] following bonobos.
[inaudible] their behavior [inaudible] see

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.719
one of them [inaudible]?

00:54:08.719 --> 00:54:14.989
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Bonobos live in such unstable
parts of the world. And I've been a chimp

00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:19.099
person for so long, I don't even get to many
of the other chimp sites. And so, I've never

00:54:19.099 --> 00:54:23.910
been south of the Congo in the Congo Basin
to see bonobos.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:30.219
For those of you who don't know, bonobos are
another one of our closest living relatives.

00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:35.739
They're very chimp-like, but they're not chimps.
But they have their own different cultural

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:40.489
repertoire and behavioral repertoire. They're
very similar looking to chimps, but they are

00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:46.069
very different in behavior. And no, I haven't
spent any time with them. I would love to.

00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:48.619
Absolutely love to. Any other questions? Go
ahead.

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:53.309
&gt;&gt;Male #15: Do you focus on a particular tribe
or do you familiar with all of them?

00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:56.400
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: There are about 12 study
sites across Africa. I've spent quite a bit

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:02.209
of time in three of those sites, but the vast
majority of my work has been in Jane's Gombe

00:55:02.209 --> 00:55:09.259
National Park in Tanzania and so, yeah. Most
of my work has been there, but for the film,

00:55:09.259 --> 00:55:11.519
just one or two sites for the film. Yep. Go
ahead.

00:55:11.519 --> 00:55:24.039
&gt;&gt;Male #16: You talked about some of the things
that you've doing with Google that are really

00:55:24.039 --> 00:55:25.039
great , particularly apps and some things
that nobody's thought of?

00:55:25.039 --> 00:55:26.539
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: That maybe none of you have
thought of? Well, it would be fun to sit down

00:55:26.539 --> 00:55:30.890
and have a creative meeting. We were talking
with Winnie before during lunch today. And

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:36.519
you can imagine from a filmmaker's point of
view, how much fun it would be to do live

00:55:36.519 --> 00:55:37.519
feeds.

00:55:37.519 --> 00:55:42.890
Like, you could get on Google Earth, double-click
and it's Bill, right now, real time, following

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:48.619
Gremlin and the twins. I mean, that would
be unbelievable. And I was also brainstorming

00:55:48.619 --> 00:55:54.590
there. I mean to have a fig tree, like the
one I showed you here, that has a 24/7 live

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.519
feed to see who comes into that tree over
the course of a day.

00:55:58.519 --> 00:56:02.890
We could also do really nice conservation
work with it, too. So, I mean, I think there's

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:06.469
some really interesting applications. It would
be great to sit down with some Google minds

00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:13.880
and have some brainstorming sessions about
how we could actually--. And that's my whole

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:19.579
work is capturing people with chimps and chimp's
behavior, but then going to the next level

00:56:19.579 --> 00:56:24.609
and saying, "Yeah. Chimps are seriously endangered.
Let's see what we can do to get more and more

00:56:24.609 --> 00:56:27.900
people interested and engaged and involved."

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:33.589
And that would be a wonderful goal if you
wanna talk to me afterward. [laughs] Anything

00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:34.589
else? Anybody else? Yeah. Go ahead.

00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:37.849
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Are there estimates as to how
many chimps are left in the world right now?

00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:42.339
&gt;&gt;Bill Wallauer: Yeah. That slide I showed.
Around 1900, there were one to two million.

00:56:42.339 --> 00:56:47.119
Now, there are fewer than 300 thousand. So,
we probably lost 60% of them in my lifetime.

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:53.400
They could be completely gone. I always have
this slide in here. Again, preaching to the

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.420
choir, I'm sure you all are aware of this.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.299
Just be very, very sure of where your dollars
are going. Check out our institute. Support

00:57:00.299 --> 00:57:05.729
the Jane Goodall Institute. It's very difficult
to do conservation work nine thousand miles

00:57:05.729 --> 00:57:10.130
away from where people will ever have contact,
the species you're trying to conserve.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:16.170
So, we have some really, really big challenges,
but it's with people's support like yours

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:21.329
that we will make it so the next generation
so, these kids can maybe someday go to Africa

00:57:21.329 --> 00:57:26.609
with their kids and see chimps. And that's
my goal, seven generations away. So anyway,

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:31.880
thank you so much for your time and your interest.
And thank you so much.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.380
[applause]
