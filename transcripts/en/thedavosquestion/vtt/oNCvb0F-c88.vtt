[BACKGROUND VOICES]

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.370
NANCY LUBLIN &gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube. My name is
Nancy Lublin. I'm the CEO of DoSomething dot

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.089
org.
So, I have a suggestion for President Obama,

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.280
or any world leader who wants to engage in
the Middle East peace process. I think that

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.110
we should ban clothing in the Middle East.
Imagine this: Everyone in the Middle East,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.700
all the Palestinians, all Jews, everyone,
was naked. There would be no more suicide

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.650
bombers because you wouldn't be able to hide
any of those things in your clothing. And

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.570
there would be a much greater sense of humility
because people would walk around going, "Ooo,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.960
that looks like me. Ooo-ooo, that's kind of
small."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.410
So, um, that's my solution for Middle East
peace.
