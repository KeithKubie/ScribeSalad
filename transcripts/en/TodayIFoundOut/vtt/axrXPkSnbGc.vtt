00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:15.879
In 1991 two men by the name of Doug Bower
and Dave Chorley rocked the worlds of ufologists

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.120
and paranormal experts alike when they claimed
to be the driving force behind the crop circle

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.539
phenomenon of the late 1970s and beyond using
little more than a plank of wood and a length

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.539
of rope.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.890
This was a claim self-professed experts on
the phenomenon dismissed as ludicrous, until

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.420
the two men showed everyone how they did it.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.140
Flanked by members of the press from across
the world, in a small field in Warminster,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.890
the two men proceeded to methodically push
over wheat using wood planks.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.730
A few hours later, they stood in the middle
of a crop circle so perfect actual aliens

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.010
armed with a Spirograph would have struggled
to make one that looked any better.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.280
The men then explained to the waiting cameras
that they’d been making crop circles this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.080
way for well over a decade, starting in 1976,
shortly before similar looking crop circles

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.560
suddenly started cropping up in other areas
of the world.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.580
According to Chorley and Bower, the decision
to first start flattening wheat in 1976 was

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.780
inspired by two things- a story Bower had
heard while living in Australia about mysterious

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
circles appearing in sugarcane fields, and
a few too many pints of beer.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.009
In regards to the former, Bower was referring
to a series of large circular patterns that

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.659
appeared in fields in Tully, Queensland in
the mid to late 1960s.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.570
Unlike modern crop circles which often feature
amazingly complex patterns and uniform pressing

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.450
of crops, the Tully Saucer Nests were simple,
somewhat crude circles of destruction.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.289
Ufologists have long maintained that these
circles were caused by UFO's landing and subsequently

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.549
taking off, hence the name “Tully Saucer
Nests”.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.799
The more accepted alternate theory is that
they were simply caused by whirlwinds touching

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.799
down briefly.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.130
Whatever the case, after Bower moved back
to England, the two men became friends over

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.770
a mutual appreciation of art and their favourite
hobby- watercolor painting.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.780
They eventually began a weekly tradition of
meeting for a few drinks on a Friday evening

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.930
at the Percy Hobbs pub in nearby Winchester.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.459
One day in 1976, they decided to have their
usual drinks outside and noticed the acres

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.620
of pristine wheat surrounding them, which
is when Bower recalled the story he’d once

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.180
told Chorley of the mysterious circles that
had baffled experts in Australia.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.439
With a glint in his eye, Bower turned to his
friend and said, “How would you like a bit

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.439
of a laugh?”

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.730
crop-circle-creatorsThat night the men, using
nothing more than a five foot iron bar Bower

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.530
used to secure the door to his picture-framing
store, created a huge circle in the middle

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.530
of the wheat.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.450
Over the next two years, the men continued
to create large circles in wheat fields, mostly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.319
around the area of Warminster in Wiltshire,
because it was, according to Bower, a “well

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.340
known centre for UFO sightings”, mostly
limited to mysterious lights in the sky.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.920
After two years of creating crop circles with
little to no interest from either the public

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.549
or the press, Chorley expressed the desire
to throw in the towel (this activity being

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.040
quite time consuming and physically intensive
for a pair of elderly gentlemen).

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.530
After contemplating the problem, Bower theorised
"for people to really take note of our circles

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.959
we needed a site with a viewpoint, so people
could sit having picnics and look down in

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.049
wonder on our work.”

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.319
In early 1978, Bower noticed that they were
planting a new wheat crop in an area known

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.940
as Cheesefoot Head, which was located in a
well-known beauty spot popular with tourists.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.430
That summer, when the wheat was sufficiently
grown, the men came and made an 80 foot wide

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.430
crop circle.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.069
24 hours later, it was national news.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.190
Almost immediately after the circles came
to public attention, numerous “experts”

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.050
began to come forward with varying explanations
about their cause, attributing them variously

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.739
to aliens, ghosts, supernatural entities,
spirits angry with humanity about global warming,

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.680
and even God.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.800
This amused Bower and Chorley to no end, with
Chorley later remarking, "They called us 'superior

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.170
intelligence' and this was the biggest laugh
of all."

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.590
To further their little joke, the pair approached
some of the self-professed experts saying

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.030
that they were wildlife enthusiasts who often
trudged around the region and they'd be happy

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.629
to keep an eye out for any more crop circles.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.420
Under this guise, the men would go make a
crop circle and then place a few phone calls

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.079
the following day telling the experts that
they’d “found another one” in an effort

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.370
to keep the hoax alive.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.530
Eventually, this became unnecessary as enthusiasts
flocked to the region.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.490
In addition to stringing along the host of
pseudo-scientists who became fascinated with

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.210
the crop circle phenomenon, Bower and Chorley
also took note of what real scientists were

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.080
saying about them and adjusted their designs
accordingly.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.550
For example, when meteorologists, who were
specifically trying to debunk the same ufologists

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.110
and pseudo-scientists Bower and Chorley were
encouraging, suggested that because all the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.460
crop circles up to that point had been, well
circles, they were likely caused by “downward-spiralling

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.139
winds”, they began creating crop circles
featuring a variety of geometric shapes.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.680
crop-circles2Though the designs of the crop
circles became ever more elaborate, the materials

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
Bower and Chorley used didn't change much
over the years.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.940
It was noted that the most sophisticated piece
of equipment used by either man was a sighting

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.949
device made from a loop of wire hung through
the visor of a baseball cap such that it dangled

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.770
in front of the left eye, allowing them to
check if the lines they were making were straight.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.819
Other than this, their standard equipment
was a plank of wood with some rope threaded

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.710
through each end so they didn't have to bend
over to pick it up.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.480
The designs for individual crop circles were
usually drafted by Bower in his workshop.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.750
In 1985, about a decade after the two men
first started creating crop circles, Bower’s

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.250
wife became convinced that he was up to something
when she noticed that their car’s odometer

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.449
was unusually high- far more so than could
have been explained by simply heading off

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.890
to the pub with Chorley every Friday night.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.979
When Bower confessed that they'd been traipsing
around the countryside flattening wheat, she

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.069
didn't believe him.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.220
To prove that he wasn’t lying, Bower asked
his wife to design her own crop circle, which

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.480
he then dutifully went and created in a nearby
field for her.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.990
With his wife’s blessing, Bower and Chorley
continued making crop circles for six more

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.289
years until they both decided it was time
to come clean.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.270
This brings us back to 1991.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.021
Despite the evidence, including among other
things detailed designs of every crop circle

00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:15.229
they'd created over the years (over 200 in
all), many didn't believe them.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.330
Those who’d made a career talking about
crop circles and in some cases playing up

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.400
the phenomenon to tourists (still a staple
industry today in this region, which is largely

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.300
why the farmers put up with it) flatly refused
to believe that the two were telling the truth.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.099
Cereologists (the name crop circle experts
refer to themselves as) cited the fact that

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.449
other crop circles had appeared in other parts
of the world that neither Bower or Chorley

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:39.349
could possibly take credit for.

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.090
One cereologist, Pat Delgado, was quoted by
the New York Times as derisively saying: “Yesterday

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.000
there were circles discovered on a prairie
in Canada.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.039
Have these guys been out there with their
board?”

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.200
Of course, the less tinfoil-hat explanation
for the other crop circles is simply that

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.199
Bower and Chorley’s crop circles inspired
other, like-minded pranksters, which is why

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.130
they have appeared in places neither man visited
after the pair started their little prank;

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.819
the circles are, after all, quite easy to
create.

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.560
On the other hand, perhaps the extraterrestrials
or spirits simply have a sense of humor too,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.000
deciding to copy Chorley and Bower's crop
circle idea...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.970
When asked about why they decided to dedicate
such a significant portion of their lives

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.940
to flattening wheat into visually pleasing
patterns, in a 1999 article, Bower waxed poetic

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.580
about the time he’d spent with his friend
(who sadly died in 1997 after a battle with

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.580
cancer):

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.500
It was just pure enjoyment, on those beautiful
summer nights for two artistic people under

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.870
the stars amid all those cornfields.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.050
We were both 19th Century people really.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.099
We were in another world.'I don't consider
being on a planet for 60 years is much use

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:42.729
if you don't leave your mark.

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.430
We didn't want to make publicity.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.939
We just wanted to make fools of the experts
who were springing up everywhere.

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:52.810
My wife said Dave and I were like chalk and
cheese, but we were a team in tune with nature...

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.139
Other people made money out of the corn circles
The experts, the farmers who charged entry,

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.699
but all Dave and I got was a really big laugh.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.919
But its been a wonderful experience and I
wouldn't have missed it for the world.

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:08.039
As to whether Bower believes in extraterrestrials,
he stated, "It's obvious that in all those

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:26.330
millions of planets we saw out there in the
night sky, there must be people out there."
