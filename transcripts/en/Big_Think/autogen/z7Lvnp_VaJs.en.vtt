00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.670
to 20 year time horizon on it I think
it's a little farther out but again

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
it's a little farther out but again
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.040
it's a little farther out but again
we're gonna see it sometime in the next

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
we're gonna see it sometime in the next
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.770
we're gonna see it sometime in the next
50 years and you have to understand what

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
50 years and you have to understand what
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.660
50 years and you have to understand what
this means you know they did they did a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670
this means you know they did they did a
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.670
this means you know they did they did a
they did a study where they looked at

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680
they did a study where they looked at
 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.770
they did a study where they looked at
the amount of gold contained in just a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780
the amount of gold contained in just a
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.530
the amount of gold contained in just a
typical middle-of-the-road asteroid not

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540
typical middle-of-the-road asteroid not
 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.000
typical middle-of-the-road asteroid not
even like a metallic asteroid just a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010
even like a metallic asteroid just a
 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.100
even like a metallic asteroid just a
typical middle the road one and it was

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
typical middle the road one and it was
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.699
typical middle the road one and it was
double what Fort Knox held at the height

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
double what Fort Knox held at the height
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.040
double what Fort Knox held at the height
of Fort Knox right so there's enough

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050
of Fort Knox right so there's enough
 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.310
of Fort Knox right so there's enough
gold in one asteroid to kind of devalue

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320

every currency market on earth so that's

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
every currency market on earth so that's
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.960
every currency market on earth so that's
what's coming and it's really really

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
what's coming and it's really really
 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.490
what's coming and it's really really
interesting right it sounds like this

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
interesting right it sounds like this
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.740
interesting right it sounds like this
crazy science fiction technology but

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
crazy science fiction technology but
 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.050
crazy science fiction technology but
it's going to have real-world economic

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
it's going to have real-world economic
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.940
it's going to have real-world economic

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950
impact on this planet within this
 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.920
impact on this planet within this
century and so we have to kind of be

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930
century and so we have to kind of be
 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.720
century and so we have to kind of be
prepared for it at the same time they

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
prepared for it at the same time they
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.310
prepared for it at the same time they
were thinking about it's still science

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320
were thinking about it's still science
 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.580
were thinking about it's still science
