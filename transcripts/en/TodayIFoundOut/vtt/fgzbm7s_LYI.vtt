00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.300
An appropriate response to nearly any rhetorical
playground question from “What’s up?”

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.480
to “Guess what?”, “chicken butt” has
been an important part of the childish lexicon

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
for many decades.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
The retort’s origins are usually speculated
to have come from a practice common to street

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.269
merchants when they would call out what they
were offering and how much it cost.

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.000
One particularly delicious item was advertised
as:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Chicken butt!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.109
Five cents a cut!

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.719
Butt, in this sense didn’t mean the back
end of the bird, but, rather, its shoulder.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.670
A long time ago, butchers would pack less
desirable cuts, like shoulders, into barrels,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.829
either to store them or ship them.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.690
Barrels like these had been called butts since
the late 14th century, after the Modern French

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.460
word for a barrel or wineskin, botte and the
Latin buttis (for cask).

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.920
Over time, the term was applied to the cuts
of meat within the barrels as well.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.590
It’s hard to verify when a chicken shoulder
cost $0.05, although historical data on the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.010
cost of a whole chicken is relatively easy
to find.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.450
For instance, during the Roaring Twenties,
hens were sold for between $0.36 and $0.38

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.920
per pound (about $4.43 today), but at the
height of the Great Depression, the price

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.270
of a hen had dropped to just $0.21 per pound
(about $3 today).

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.810
One theory as to why the expression became
so popular is tied to the 1930s.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.229
In 1935, George Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess
debuted, and in it, Maria compares Sporting

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.529
Life to a chicken, invoking the merchants’
chant:

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.329
I hates yo’ struttin’ style,

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.829
Yes sir, and yo’ god d*mn silly smile

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.619
an yo’ ten cent di’mons an’ yo’ fi’
cent butts.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.039
Oh, I hates yo’ guts.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.240
All that said, as far as I can find, there
is no documented evidence of anything to the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.350
effect of “What’s up?” or “Guess what?”
(or any of the many variants) followed by

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.539
“Chicken Butt!” until Mississippian Charles
G. Bell’s 1962 novel The Married Land.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.539
In it, we find:

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.309
…but what as a boy he had spoken with boys,
white and colored, when they ran and fought

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.919
together (“What, what, chicken butt, come
around the house and lick it up.)

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.539
Disregarding a rather interesting, though
seemingly unrelated, 1970 work Psychoanalytic

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.660
Study of the Child – Volume 25 in which
one Ruth S. Eissler describes a girl named

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.849
Naomi who uses some peculiar terms such as
“chicken-butt” to mean “sex” and “cookie”

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.170
to mean “vagina” and is described as “confusingly
using words that she senses are somehow inaccurate…”,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.380
next up in the known documented instances
of this phrase we have a rather telling instance

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.470
appearing in the 1973 book Black Language
by Malachi Andrews and Paul T. Owens.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.240
On page 73 it contains the following entry:

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.780
Chicken Butt- When someone calls out, “What?”,
because they didn’t hear, a reply might

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.320
be the rhyme, “Chicken Butt.”

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.230
It means forget it; I am not going to repeat
it.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.290
Junior flip usage.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.630
In that same year, it was noted in the National
Education Association of the United States’

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.370
Today’s Education Volumes 62-64 that at
least some children were using “chicken

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.540
butt” as a slang insult: “‘Mrs. Pratt,
come check me off.’

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.620
If I paid no attention and helped somebody
else, he might yell again, ‘Mrs. Pratt!’

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.380
If I still paid no attention, he might mutter
something about my being a ‘chicken butt.'”

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.340
Following that up, the next documented instance
I could find of the general phrase in question

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.020
was in the 1983 work The Black Nation.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.860
In Volumes 3-5 of that work, the following
appears:

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.710
…chicken cacciatore, chicken-alla-wendy,
chicken — alla-king ir poor folks eat chicken

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.480
feet, chicken necks chicken gizzards, chickenstew
(with no chicken) chicken backs SAY WHAT!?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.739
CHICKEN BUTT!!!!!!!!!!! don’t you wish that
all rich folks would turn into a plucked chicken

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.680
&amp; fly into a vat of hot grease &amp; let us poor
folks eat good for a while…

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.280
So, from the documented evidence (and quite
a bit of somewhat less reliable personal anecdotes),

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.340
it would seem as if, whether actually connected
to any early 20th century merchant slang or

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.960
not, the phrase and its variants originated
in southern black-American culture at least

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.720
as early as the 1960s and probably a bit before.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.319
However, if the documented evidence is any
indication, this phrase didn’t catch on

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.620
among a wider audience until sometime in the
late 1970s and 1980s, at which point it soon

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.110
became a somewhat ubiquitous expression among
all American youth, along with variants like

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.250
“Guess what?” and rhyming offshoots like
“Guess why?

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.130
Chicken thigh!” and “Guess who?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.569
Chicken tattoo!”

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.720
Several years ago, an undercover video surfaced
showing egg hatchery workers glibly tossing

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.690
baby chicks into a grinder alive.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.150
An accepted industry practice called “instantaneous
euthanasia,” it accounts for the slaughter

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.810
of 200,000,000 male chicks each year (the
males were culled because they couldn’t

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.720
produce eggs and supposedly would be prohibitively
expensive to raise as meat chickens).

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.520
While acknowledging the situation wasn’t
ideal, a spokesman for The United Egg Producers,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.220
Mitch Head, noted, “There is, unfortunately,
no way to breed eggs that only produce female

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.220
hens.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.150
If someone has a need for 200 million male
chicks, we’re happy to provide them to anyone

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.150
who wants them.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.190
But we can find no market, no need.”

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.900
He also noted that, while seemingly brutal,
the use of the grinder “is the most instantaneous

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.630
way to euthanize chicks.”

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.710
However, things are looking up for male chicks…
kind of.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.840
Technology has advanced so that it is possible
to detect the sex of a chick early on while

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.850
it’s still in the egg.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.030
Expected to be commercially viable within
four years, the egg producers industry group

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.020
has recently announced that by 2020, they
should be able to end the practice of grinding

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.780
newborn baby chickens to death.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.360
Instead, they’ll just sell the fertilized
eggs as, well, eggs.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.919
So the question to you, dear readers, is this-
is it better to exist somewhat consciously

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.690
for an exceptionally short while only to have
your fate be to get snuffed out in a grinder

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.380
shortly after emerging from your shell, or
to never really exist at all on any conscious

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:56.650
level?
