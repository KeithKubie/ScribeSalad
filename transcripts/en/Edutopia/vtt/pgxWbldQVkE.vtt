00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:02.466
&gt;&gt; Milo: Which one shows me looking sad?

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:13.706
&gt;&gt; Krista Stephens: Milo is a humanoid
robot that is specifically designed

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:15.296
to work with students with autism.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:23.316
He can make a sad face, he can make a
grimace, he can make a surprised face.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.606
He does that so that the student
can look and be able to imitate.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:41.066
&gt;&gt; Audrey: When he was two, my
pediatrician brought it to my attention

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.616
that Nathaniel was not speaking.

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:46.656
He said, "You may need to get him
looked at, he may have some things going

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:49.136
on that you're unaware of,"
and that's when it came

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:51.356
to our attention that
Nathaniel had autism.

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:52.656
It was intense.

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:55.316
He couldn't tell me what his needs were.

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.146
I had to figure it out.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.276
It took him a while to actually
start to point to things.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.256
He started when he was three
years old here at Lester,

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:06.276
in their preschool program,
and it was a success.

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:10.216
They have all kind of tools, resources
I wouldn't have begun to think about.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:14.756
&gt;&gt; Janette Williams: Our school
specializes in autism. At Lester,

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:16.636
we provide a whole realm of services.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:21.416
We have speech, we have OT,
PT, extended nursing services,

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:23.556
and then assistive technology.

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:32.486
&gt;&gt; Krista Stephens: Milo works with the
student on a different set of modules.

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:36.286
It's nice because it scaffolds as
far as how difficult the modules are.

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:40.466
Nathaniel is working on the
happy, angry and sad module.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.406
So he started out recognizing
Milo happy.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:46.136
Then he had to choose
between happy and sad.

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:48.146
Then they go between
three different emotions.

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:51.416
So he's having to visually discriminate
between those three emotions.

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:58.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Denny: We started participating
with Milo in October of 2017.

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:01.506
We thought it was a unique
opportunity for us to be able

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.566
to provide our high autism population

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:06.066
with a service they probably
wouldn't get anywhere else.

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:11.006
&gt;&gt; Cassandra: I had read about
Milo, and the first thing I asked

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:16.086
when I got here was, "Hey, do
you guys have Milo? I want to get

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.046
down with this, I'm interested."

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.156
For years, nothing else was working
but now JJ has been progressing.

00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:25.906
There's less prompting, there's
more independent thought.

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:30.066
&gt;&gt; Brian Denny: We've seen
students respond to Milo

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.026
where they might not
respond to another adult.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:35.166
Children with autism, they
pick up on human affect,

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:38.016
but Milo doesn't have any
emotion, doesn't get upset.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.426
Milo didn't have to stay up
too late the night before.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:44.126
None of that effects Milo, he
responds the same way every time.

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:50.706
&gt;&gt; Krista Stephens: The changes
that I have seen is they are able

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.836
to follow directions better and
their visual attention is better.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:57.596
It's a challenge every day to
try to get my students to sit,

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:01.646
focus and answer questions
and do a task.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.626
So if I can get Milo
to help me with that,

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:07.226
that's another way to reach my kids.
