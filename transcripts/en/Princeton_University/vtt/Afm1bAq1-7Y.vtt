[music]


00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.090
Craig Arnold:
Cars, cell phones, laptops.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.660
Craig Arnold:
We all rely on batteries every day.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.230
Craig Arnold:
My name is Craig Arnold.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.750 position:56%
Craig Arnold:
And I want to make better batteries.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.820
Craig Arnold:
Lithium-ion batteries are good.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.150
Craig Arnold:
But we all know that they tend
to lose their capacity over

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.470
Craig Arnold:
time, and they don't last forever.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.980
Craig Arnold:
Batteries are complex.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.460 position:84%
Craig Arnold:
They're made up of many layers of different materials.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.040 position:81%
Craig Arnold:
If we take these layers apart, we could see the dark

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.840 position:61%
Craig Arnold:
electrode material and we could see the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.330
Craig Arnold:
white separator membrane.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.100
Craig Arnold:
This membrane keeps the
electrodes from touching each

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.600
Craig Arnold:
other in this tight pack.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.600
Craig Arnold:
In my lab, we try to simulate
what happens to the separator

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.610
Craig Arnold:
membrane over its lifetime.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.020
Craig Arnold:
We roll up the material and
expose it to high pressures.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.220 position:63%
Craig Arnold:
On a microscopic level, this has effects

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.470
Craig Arnold:
similar to years of use.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.080
Craig Arnold:
These mechanical stresses can cause

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.460
Craig Arnold:
changes to the separator.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.510
Craig Arnold:
But what does that have to do
with your battery failing?

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.970
Craig Arnold:
Well, let me explain.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.480
Craig Arnold:
Here's an ordinary sponge.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.030 position:63%
Craig Arnold:
You'll notice it has a bunch of holes in
it to allow water to pass through.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.910
Craig Arnold:
If I were to press on it, it
would close these holes and

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.100 position:72%
Craig Arnold:
prevent water from passing through the sponge.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.690 position:64%
Craig Arnold:
This is not unlike the battery separator.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.520 position:58%
Craig Arnold:
In this material, there is also a lot

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.830
Craig Arnold:
of little tiny holes.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.550
Craig Arnold:
If I were to squeeze it, these
holes would also close up,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.810
Craig Arnold:
preventing lithium ions from
passing through the membrane.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
[music]

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.450
Craig Arnold:
We can see these holes if we
use an electron microscope

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.800
Craig Arnold:
with high magnification.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.860
Craig Arnold:
In a new separator, the holes
are all over the membrane,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.370 position:58%
Craig Arnold:
allowing lithium ions to easily pass.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.010
Craig Arnold:
After simulating long-time use
and storage, we can see the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.820
Craig Arnold:
holes disappearing from the
membrane, making it more

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.000
Craig Arnold:
difficult for lithium ions to pass.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.460
Craig Arnold:
So, what can we do about this?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.020
Craig Arnold:
One way to fix this is to prevent
the pores from closing up.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.610
Craig Arnold:
Imagine a battery separator
that's strong enough to resist

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.230
Craig Arnold:
mechanical stress.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.740
Craig Arnold:
So in fact, batteries are not
just electrochemical devices.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.130
Craig Arnold:
Their mechanical properties
can also affect their performance.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.960
Craig Arnold:
By better understanding the
science of batteries, we can

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.250
Craig Arnold:
begin to engineer ways to keep
the current flowing longer.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.100
Craig Arnold:
Boy, I could really use
that in my smartphone.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:38.100
Photographer:
Hey, Craig.
That was fun. [laughter]
