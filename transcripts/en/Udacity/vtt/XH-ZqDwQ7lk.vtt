00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.804
So let's think about what other repeated code can be factored out here.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:08.128
Even though it's a tiny piece of logic, the code that adds a .loc property to

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:10.670
a new car object is being written twice here.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.340
How do you think we could go about factoring that out?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.520
Well, we can use the same technique we did of writing a function that does work

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.180
for us over and over again.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.630
Now, I'm going to give this function the name carlike.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.840
Since it's job is to augment an object with the properties needed to be

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.110
considered a car.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.580
Now it's true that in this oversimplified example,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.280
the function we're going to be writing will do almost nothing.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.560
Since car seems to be pretty simple,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.030
they really only have a .loc property on them.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.991
But in a real program, objects have a lot more properties.

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.308
So this carlike function should be made to take some car object as an input,

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:46.720
then do some work on it and then return it.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.320
And when we call it on our car objects,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760
we expect it to add this .loc property for us.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.520
As such, we'll need a pass the location value into carlike so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.140
that it knows what to set the car's location to.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.669
When a function like this one, takes in an object as it's input and

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:06.276
then augments that object with some properties or functionality.

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:09.270
The carlike function here would qualify as a decorator.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480
It's common to use adjectives as the names for

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.970
your decorator functions, hence the name carlike
