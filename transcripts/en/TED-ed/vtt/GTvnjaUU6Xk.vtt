00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:14.119
Flatulence, or passing gas,
is a normal daily phenomenon.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.232
Most individuals, yes,
that includes you,

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:21.542
will make anywhere 
from 500-1500 milliliters of gas

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.146
and can pass gas ten to twenty
times a day.

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:27.942
But where does this bodily gas come from?

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:33.792
A small proportion may come from
ingesting air during sleep, or at other times,

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:38.318
but the majority of gas is produced by
bacteria in our intestines

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:41.768
as they digest parts of food which we cannot.

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:44.367
Our intestine is home to
trillions of bacteria

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.454
living in a symbiotic relationship with us.

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:50.985
We provide them with a safe place
to stay and food to eat.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.536
In exchange, they help us 
extract energy from our food,

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:58.760
make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,
boost our immune system,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.462
and play an important role in 
gastrointestinal barrier function,

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:07.436
motility and the development of 
various organ systems.

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:11.456
Clearly, it's in our best interest
to keep these bacteria happy.

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:15.333
Gut bacteria get their nutrition
primarily from undigested food,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:20.131
such as carbohydrates and proteins,
which come to the large intestine.

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.077
They ferment this undigested food
to produce a wide range of compounds,

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:29.036
such as short-chain fatty acids
and, of course, gases.

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:32.667
Hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
are the most common gaseous products

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.746
of bacterial fermentation, 
and are odorless.

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:40.996
Some people also produce methane due to
specific microbes present in their gut.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:44.001
But methane is actually odorless, too.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.689
Well then, what stinks?

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.010
The foul smell is usually due to 
volatile sulfur compounds,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.829
such as hydrogen sulfide and
methanethiol, or methyl mercaptan.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.798
These gases, however, constitute
less than 1% of volume,

00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:02.960
and are often seen with ingestion
of amino acids containing sulfur,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.963
which may explain the foul smell of gas
from certain high protein diets.

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:11.623
Increased passage of gas is commonly
noticed after eating foods

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.601
with high amounts of 
indigestible carbohydrates,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:21.436
like beans, lentils, dairy products,
onions, garlic, leeks, radishes,

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:29.287
potatoes, oats, wheat, cauliflower,
broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts.

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.657
Humans lack the enzymes,

00:02:30.657 --> 00:02:35.509
so the bacteria able to ferment 
complex carbohydrates take over,

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.530
and this naturally leads to more
gas than usual.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.061
But if you feel uncomfortable,
bloated or visibly distended,

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.868
this may indicate impaired movement
of gas along the gastrointestinal track.

00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:49.394
It's important not to just 
blame certain foods

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.894
for gas and bloating and then avoid them.

00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:55.685
You don't want to starve the bacteria
that digest these complex carbohydrates,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:03:00.047
or they'll have to start eating the sugars
in the mucus lining of your intestines.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:03.544
Your personal gas will vary
based on what you eat,

00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:05.734
and what bacteria are in your gut.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.013
For example, from the same starting sugar,

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:12.836
the bacteria clostridium produces
carbon dioxide, butyrate and hydrogen,

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:18.804
while propionibacterium can produce
carbon dioxide, propionate and acetate.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:22.695
At the same time, methanogens
can use hydrogen and carbon dioxide

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:26.245
produced by other bacteria
to generate methane,

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:31.213
which can reduce the total volume of gas 
by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:34.271
So there's a complex web among
intestinal bacteria

00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.438
allowing them to flourish by either
directly consuming undigested food,

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:41.751
or using what other bacteria produce.

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:46.160
This interaction largely determines
the amount and type of gas produced,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.409
so gas production is a sign
that your gut bacteria are at work.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.500
But in some instances, people may
develop abnormal increased flatulence.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.784
A common example is lactose intolerance.

00:03:58.784 --> 00:04:02.101
Most individuals have the enzyme for
breaking down lactose,

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:05.760
a sugar present in milk and
milk-derived products.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.163
But some people either lack it entirely,
or have a reduced amount,

00:04:10.163 --> 00:04:12.901
such as after a gastrointestinal infection,

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:16.954
so they're unable to digest
lactose products and may experience cramping,

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:21.304
along with increased flatulence 
due to bacterial fermentation.

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.668
But remember, most gas is produced

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:27.142
as a natural result of bacterial 
fermentation in the intestine,

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.081
and indicates healthy 
functioning of the gut.

00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:34.673
The amount and type can vary based on your
diet and the bacteria in your intestine.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:39.611
Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,
and do try to forgive your bacteria.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.774
They're only trying to be helpful.
