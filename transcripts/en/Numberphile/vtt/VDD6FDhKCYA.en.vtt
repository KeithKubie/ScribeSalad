00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.890
TONY PADILLA: The guys at
Aperiodical launched a little

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.170
competition to find the integest
sequence 2013.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.445
It's a little bit fun.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:09.980
It's not a serious thing.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.670
But basically, they've looked at
the online encyclopedia of

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.750
integer sequences and they've
basically run a competition to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.120
see which one is the best.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.000
And it's based on various
categories, like aesthetics,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.010
novelty, explicability,
completeness,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.860
these sorts of things.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.600
But it's just a bit of fun.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.410
But we thought we'd go through
these sequences.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.375
And I'm not going to tell you
which one I like best, so I'll

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:33.770
leave that to the end.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.210
I'm going to do my best
poker face to try

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.450
and keep it a secret.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.370
So the first one in the sequence
is to do with the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.270
decimal expansion of a
particular constant.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540
So the decimal expansion of
Khinchin's constant is the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.170
following 2.6854.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.990
OK, so that doesn't look
very exciting, just

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.660
by looking at it.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.240
Khinchin's constant is a
remarkable number, actually.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.860
Basically, if you take any
number, or almost all numbers

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.250
to be more precise-- almost
all numbers--

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.190
and you work up the
continued fraction

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.550
expansion of that guy.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.120
So for example, we just take a
general number, x, and we can

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.270
know that we can write this
is a0 plus 1 over a1

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.220
plus 1 over a2 plus--

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.800
and so on.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.050
You keep going on like this.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.710
This is called-- these are a0,
a1 [INAUDIBLE] and all those

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.940
are called the continued
fraction expansion.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.910
Well, let's say I take the
product of all these a's.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.600
I take a1 times a2--

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.290
forget a0--

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.990
times a3 and so on, to an.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.500
And I take the geometric
mean, so I just take an

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.390
n-th power of that.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.140
And I see what that gives
me as I go to infinity.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.680
So as n goes to infinity, it
goes to Khinchin's constant.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.800
And this is true of
almost any number.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.690
That's amazing.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.520
I think that's an
amazing fact.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.290
It's almost like now, obviously,
you're going to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.720
immediately tell me, well,
it's not true of a lot of

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.880
numbers that you know about.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.310
It's not true of a half, for
example, because the continued

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.480
fraction expansion of
a half is not--

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.970
clearly, just any rational
number, you can get basically

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.690
any number out doing
this process.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.670
But most numbers do, that's
the amazing thing.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.500
Almost all numbers.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.530
No irrational numbers will do
it, but most numbers do.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.450
Pi, for example, is thought-- so
when you take the expansion

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.970
and calculate this number for
pi, you're expected to get

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.730
Khinchin's constant.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.030
In fact, Khinchin proved that
almost all numbers do it.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.260
By that, he means all numbers
except for a sort of--

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.960
potentially, an infinitesimally
small set.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.550
And the great thing about this
is, is that k0 itself, which

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.010
seems to know about almost
all numbers,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.250
also knows about itself.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.730
Because it's thought, although
this hasn't been proven, that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.540
k0, when you do this expansion
for it, averages to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.540
Then take this average,
it recovers itself.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.040
So if you like it, if there
was a number that had--

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.160
if God had a number, it would
be this number, because it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.450
knows about almost all of
the numbers and itself.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.940
It's kind of like beautifully
self-contained.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.490
OK, so next one in the
sequence, this is the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.073
Wieferich primes.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.550
And basically, there's only two
numbers in this sequence

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.690
that we know of, 1,093
and 3,511.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.480
So what are these guys?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.130
The Wieferich primes are any
prime number p, such that p

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.700
squared divides 2 to the
p minus 1 minus 1.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.410
And it's true of these
two numbers.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.670
We don't know if it's true
of any other numbers.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.800
In fact, I was interested to see
if there were any higher

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.900
ones than this.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.720
And I actually found a paper
which says that, well, they've

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.100
done a search for Wieferich
primes all the way up to 6.7

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.440
times 10 to the 15th and they
haven't found any more.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.040
So you got these two low guys,
and then nothing all the way

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.410
up to that.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.800
So the next one in the sequence
is going to be some

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.810
huge number if, indeed,
it exists.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.760
Well, the reason Wieferich was
interested in them is they

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.390
seem to have something to do
with Fermat's last theorem.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.810
He was trying to prove Fermat's
last theorem.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.730
The reason is that Wieferich
proved the following results.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.370
You take x to the p plus
y to the p plus z to

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.660
the p equals 0.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.010
X, y, and z are integers.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.560
And you say that p does not
divide zyx, then you can

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.970
prove-- this is what
Wieferich did--

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.020
that p has to be one of these
Wieferich primes.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.970
OK, so next up is Golomb's
sequence.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.290
So this is Golomb's sequence.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.620
BRADY HARAN: Gollum, like
"Lord of the Rings?"

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.790
TONY PADILLA: Yeah.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.310
Well, actually, this guy's
got an amazing name--

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.240
Solomon Golomb.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.180
It's just the coolest names
in the world, right?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.720
So he's actually quite
an interesting guy.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.950
He's a mathematician that
invented pentominoes, which is

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.000
this mathematical game.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.510
But it was the forerunner
of Tetris, actually.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.120
So Solomon Golomb
was the guy who,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.330
essentially, invented Tetris.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.290
What is his sequence?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.120
His sequence is the
following--

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:54.330
1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4,
5, 5, 5, and so on.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.700
And what does this
sequence tell us?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.460
Well, this sequence kind of
knows about itself, because

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.660
the sort of n-th position in
the sequence tells you how

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.965
many times the number n appears
in the sequence.

00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:06.880
I'll start with the
first position.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.410
Then the question is, how
many times does 1

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.590
appear in the sequence?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.600
Well, the answer is it
only appears once.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.630
It can only appear once.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.520
I couldn't put a 2 here, that
wouldn't make sense.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.570
Then I go to the next point.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.022
Now I'm asking, how many times
does the number 2 appear in

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:20.530
the sequence?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.040
Well, you can see
that it is 2.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.140
It had to be 2.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.490
It couldn't be 1, because then
1 would have appeared twice

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.120
and I'd have had to put
2 here, you see?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.250
So it kind of makes sense
that it has to be 2.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.460
So then I go to the third point
in the sequence, which

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.580
is this position here.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.150
Now the question I have to ask
is, how many times does 3

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.630
appear in the sequence?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.120
But I've already said that
2 had to appear 2.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.790
So I better put 2 there So the
number of times that 3 has to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.030
appear in the sequence
has to be 2.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.090
And so there they are, the next
points in the sequence.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.830
And you keep going.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.430
You keep going in this manner.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.330
This position the question is,
how many times does 4 appear

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.940
in the sequence?

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.040
Well, here you are.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.550
It appears 3 times.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.940
And so on and so on.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.550
And you build the sequence
up this way.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.330
It kind of knows about itself.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.980
It's almost like it doesn't--

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.460
maybe it's had a bit of
therapy or something.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.370
It really knows its inner
being sort of thing.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.960
Now, there is a little--

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.090
another feature of this sequence
is that as you get to

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.250
very, very large numbers,
where does

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.280
this sequence go to?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.480
Well, it goes to
the following.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.360
The n-th put position of this
sequence will tend towards phi

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.610
2 minus [INAUDIBLE]
phi n phi minus 1.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.200
Now, what is this?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.120
OK, this is n.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.880
What's this [INAUDIBLE] phi
thing I've written down, this

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.930
Greek letter?

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.720
This is the golden ratio.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.700
It just appears everywhere.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.050
So the next one are the
largest metadromes.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.730
So what is this?

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.080
Well, a metadrome is a number
which appears in--

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.070
where the numbers appear in
a strict descending order.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.640
Let me write down the
sequence first.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.820
0, 1, 5, 27, 194,
1865, and so on.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.320
It's the largest metadromes, so
the largest number you can

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.640
write where all the numbers
are in strict

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.370
descending order base n.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.710
OK, so the first position.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.080
This is 0 base 1.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.360
OK, first position, so
it's going to be

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.800
something that's base 1.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.190
And it's the largest number we
can write at strict descending

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.570
order base 1 is 0.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.970
So this is 0 base 1.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.030
This guy, the next one,
1, what is that?

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.790
Well, that is 1 base 2.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.120
So it's the largest number
we could have written.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.780
They're all in strict descending
order, base 2

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.380
because we're in the
second position.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.680
Those two aren't
that exciting.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.560
It gets a little bit more
interesting when you get to

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.660
the next number.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.260
So we know what this
number should be.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.380
Well, it's five.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.050
But what's that?

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.000
That is 1, 2 base 3.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.450
OK, well of course it is,
because 1 2 base 3 is

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.460
basically 3 plus 2.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.760
Next one, keep going--

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.830
27.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:10.870
This is 1 2 3 base 4, which is
4 squared plus 2 times 4 plus

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.780
3, which is 27.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.500
OK, and you keep going
like this.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.250
And this is how the
sequence emerges.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.670
Well, the next on the sequence
would be 1, 2, 3, 4 base 5.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.070
BRADY HARAN: And the next would
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 base 6?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.360
TONY PADILLA: Exactly.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.080
And so on.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.636
I think that one's a bit
duller than that is.

00:08:28.636 --> 00:08:31.362
That doesn't push my buttons,
unfortunately, that sequence.

00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:32.940
BRADY HARAN: I haven't figured
out what one's

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.909
your favorite yet.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:34.250
I think--

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.309
TONY PADILLA: It's
not that one.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.474
I'll give you a clue on that.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.929
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.630
TONY PADILLA: OK, so
moving swiftly on.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.450
It is all the 7's.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.535
I think this is your favorite,
isn't it, Brady?

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.320
BRADY HARAN: I have to admit,
I don't know why--

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.600
I don't know much about it yet,
but it appeals to me.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.950
TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.140
So what is all the 7's?

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.930
Well, it does what it
says on the tin.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:56.240
It's 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, and so on.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.380
BRADY HARAN: This is just
a nonsense sequence?

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.500
TONY PADILLA: I think it's just
a nonsense sequence, but

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.465
it's a bit of fun.

00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:04.270
You can relate it to some math
if you try hard enough.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.390
BRADY HARAN: I'm not sure that's
my favorite anymore.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.220
TONY PADILLA: Have
you gone off it?

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.370
BRADY HARAN: I thought it,
actually, there was some

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.360
equation for that.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.980
TONY PADILLA: OK, so now comes
the last of the sequences

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.900
that's been nominated, and these
are the wild numbers.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.790
Woo, that sounds exciting.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.200
OK, so what are the
wild numbers?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.300
Well, they are 11, 67, 2.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.420
There's supposed to be
an infinite number,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.210
but what are these?

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.180
What is this sequence?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.350
Well, it's actually a completely
made of sequence

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.850
that has come out of fiction.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.750
There was a guy called
Philibert Schogt--

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.820
I hope I've pronounced
that properly--

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.870
who wrote a novel about a
mathematician and he solved a

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.630
problem called the wild
number problem.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.260
So what was the wild
number problem?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.710
The idea was that you would
take any whole number, you

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.820
would apply some--

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.930
what are described as simple
operations to that, that would

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.530
turn that number
into fractions.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.995
And then you would keep applying
these operations

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.630
until you get back to a
whole number again.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.380
The claim is that those numbers
that you end up with

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.610
are the wild numbers.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.100
And of all the examples that
were supposedly known, these

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.680
were the only numbers that
were popping up.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.050
So the question would be, are
there an infinite number of

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.210
wild numbers?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.420
Are there numbers that
aren't wild numbers?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.390
Well, in the book, apparently
3 is a tame number.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.710
It's been proven that this
can never be reached.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.880
And what the guy in the
story does is--

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.830
his idea is that he proves--

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.370
he's supposed to be a mediocre
mathematician who's

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.020
disillusioned with his career.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.050
But he proves that there are
an infinite number of wild

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.680
numbers, which has been this
long-standing problem.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.310
There's a nice little account on
the archive, actually, that

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.450
we use by the author of the
maths behind it and the

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.870
ideas behind it.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.550
He's written a novel, but this
is a paper about the novel.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.180
So this is what he's done.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.590
He says something quite
interesting in it, in that the

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.070
idea was there would be this
mediocre mathematician that

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.180
ended up sort of solving
Fermat's last theorem, which

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.140
of course at the time
hadn't been solved.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.500
But of course, now it has
by Andrew Wiles, but

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.890
at the time it hadn't.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.975
And so the idea was there's this
mediocre mathematician

00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:10.130
that comes up with a proof
of Fermat's last theorem.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.240
And OK, he sort of pitched this
idea to a mathematician

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.800
friend of his and the
mathematician friend just sort

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.785
of shot it down straightaway.

00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:20.760
He Said, there's no way a
mediocre mathematician would

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.880
be able to actually
come up with--

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.480
solve a longstanding
proof like that.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.250
It would always be somebody
who's an established genius.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.970
Now, obviously, that's true in
Andrew Wiles's case that a

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.430
genius did ultimately
find a proof for

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.360
Fermat's last theorem.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.210
But recently, of course, we did
a video about this prime

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.820
number theorem, the twin prime
conjectures, and that was

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.200
solved by what was essentially
not a star of mathematics.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.000
So maybe the author's friend was
a little bit unfair there.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.850
But anyway, it gave the author
license to then go away and

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.550
invent these wild numbers.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.150
BRADY HARAN: So he made up wild
numbers instead of using

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.060
Fermat's last theorem.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.345
TONY PADILLA: Exactly.

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:00.645
BRADY HARAN: It's a bit of a
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:01.260
though, isn't it?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.380
If you do solve one of these
theorems, you become a genius.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.150
TONY PADILLA: Well, I think so.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.415
Yeah.

00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:07.430
BRADY HARAN: So it's always
going to be a genius.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.840
TONY PADILLA: Sure, exactly.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.290
But I think the claim was that
these people would have been

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.220
noticed before because
they would have--

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.140
these theorems get built up and
you build towards them.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.530
And the proof [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.730
BRADY HARAN: So you've
shown me all six?

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.870
TONY PADILLA: Yeah.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.850
BRADY HARAN: Which was
your favorite?

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.530
TONY PADILLA: It's got to be
Khinchin's constant, right?

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.540
The decimal expansion of that.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.030
I mean, that number is just--

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.860
I'm blown away by that number
and what is it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.790
Conceive it-- almost all
numbers, when you take this

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.410
property to do with the
continued fraction expansion,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.730
almost all numbers give you
back this constant.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.530
That's amazing.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.260
That's an amazing fact.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.690
BRADY HARAN: Except the
numbers you and I use

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.660
almost every day.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.060
TONY PADILLA: But that's such
a tiny fraction-- that's a

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.760
minuscule fraction of all
numbers that are out there.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.890
It's a measure zero fraction
of it, in fact.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.750
So the vast majority
of numbers--

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.240
the truly vast majority
do give back this guy.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.070
Pi gives it.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.560
Well, that's what we think.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.900
So that, for me, is absolutely
incredible.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.200
And so that's why
I like that guy.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.710
As I said, if there is a number
which has any kind of

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.370
divinity to it, it's this one.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:20.050
I think I read somewhere that
if we're going to send out

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.610
some information to aliens,
we should send out--

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.900
and it's going to be numeric,
we should tell

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.680
them about this constant.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.080
So I do like that number.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.420
But I do have a sequence, a
personal sequence that I like

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.000
more, though.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.250
I'd like to share
with you, Brady.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.990
BRADY HARAN: I don't know what
this is going to be.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.738
Actually, I know what this is.

00:13:38.738 --> 00:13:40.938
TONY PADILLA: OK, well, let me
write it down, and then you

00:13:40.938 --> 00:13:42.220
see if you can guess
it, Brady.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.340
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:42.980
TONY PADILLA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.230
BRADY HARAN: You write it down.
