00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:10.986
&gt;&gt;Okay, so now what
games did you make?

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:11.876
How do you win this game?

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.976
&gt;&gt;There's still like the score.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.926
It's like one hundred
points per shot.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:19.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At this end of
semester fair at Google headquarters

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:20.396
in Mountain View, California,

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.646
dozens of middle school students
are presenting work they've done

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:26.656
in after school apprenticeships,
to an audience of parents,

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.966
teachers, and business people.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.956
&gt;&gt;That is so cool.

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:34.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Similar events around
the country celebrate the work

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:37.816
of Citizen Schools, which
operates a national network

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:40.366
of apprenticeship programs
for middle school students,

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:44.326
connecting adult volunteers to
young people with hands on projects.

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:47.436
&gt;&gt;We need to take a whole different
look at how we do education,

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:51.506
and do more enrichment and really get
back to looking at the whole child.

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Citizen Schools
co-founder, Eric Schwarz,

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.726
believes education is everyone's job.

00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:02.326
&gt;&gt;I think this is a big idea, and
the idea of tapping into millions

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:06.396
of citizen teachers and mentors,
and democratizing what it means

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:09.046
to be a teacher in America,
is the wave of the future.

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:15.526
&gt;&gt;At its essence, Citizen Schools
partners with public schools

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:19.716
to expand the learning day and
then fill up that longer day

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:22.686
with all kinds of cool stuff
that turns kids on to learning,

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.126
and helps them be successful.

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:25.736
&gt;&gt;So you can add a
little bit of blue.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:28.876
&gt;&gt;Students spend three
hours, four days a week

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:32.096
in Citizen School after
school programs.

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:34.486
Two times a week, they
work with mentors

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:35.566
in their chosen apprenticeship.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.346
&gt;&gt;So you're gonna hold
the bezel roller--

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:42.956
&gt;&gt;In the remaining time, paid Citizen
Schools staff teachers offer students

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:46.096
homework help and coach them
on school navigation skills.

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:50.926
&gt;&gt;When I go to Citizen School,
the next day, I listen more,

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:57.056
I practice more what I'm doing,
math, sciences, and reading.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:03.926
&gt;&gt;I now know that I can do so many
things and it's fun doing them.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:05.376
&gt;&gt;Francisco: [translation] My
daughter has improved her English

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:09.416
and her ability to
express herself in public.

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:12.746
&gt;&gt;I'm very pleased with the
program because it has helped her

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:16.416
with everything, her studies
and her class participation.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.146
&gt;&gt;How to make it double.

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.416
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so we double them up, right.

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.776
&gt;&gt;The internships cover
a wide spectrum,

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:27.016
from jewelry making
to robotics to sewing.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:29.656
&gt;&gt;And now you have to do the
same thing for the other one too.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:30.956
&gt;&gt;I love sewing.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:35.956
I've been sewing half of my life
and I am happy to share what I know

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:39.266
with the kids, and they
seem to be liking it,

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.666
enjoying it, and they're learning.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:42.456
You can see it.

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:43.596
&gt;&gt;We know what you're gonna teach.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.076
We know the skills that you
want the kids to get out of it.

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:46.476
We--

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:49.576
&gt;&gt;In a three hour session,
before the semester begins,

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:53.966
Citizen Schools trainers help the
volunteer mentors refine what they're

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:54.676
like to teach.

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.436
&gt;&gt;So if you wanna teach computers,

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:59.196
let's narrow that down
to web design--

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:02.616
&gt;&gt;And mentors receive staff
support throughout the semester.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.666
&gt;&gt;Some Citizen teachers need a lot
of support, ones who haven't worked

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:09.036
with kids before, especially
when we go to different places,

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:11.106
like a law office or Google.

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:14.106
It's my role to support them,
however they need to be supported.

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:16.766
&gt;&gt;They've been good about
making regular contact

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:20.446
with me once a week just to see
how things are, helping me sort

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:26.096
of in a gentle way to sort of develop
my ability to organize how I teach

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:29.566
and what I teach a little bit better,
given that I'm not a professional

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.346
by any stretch of the imagination.

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:34.376
&gt;&gt;Well, there's two things I
can think of right off the bat.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.586
&gt;&gt;Google software engineer,
Doug Felt,

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.296
taught a robotics apprenticeship.

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:41.286
&gt;&gt;As a software engineer, I
spend a lot of my time dealing

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:45.116
with very intricate,
detailed things and this is

00:03:45.176 --> 00:03:46.646
so completely separate from that.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:50.926
It's personal, it's
immediate, and gives me a chance

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.326
to do something different
that is giving

00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:55.546
to the community in some sense.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:59.726
&gt;&gt;Citizen Schools introduces the
talented adults in a community,

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:03.836
who probably don't have kids in
that school and kinda connects them

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:06.006
to kids in that school and
allows them to be a resource.

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:10.656
And that's exciting, because I think
too often, schools are isolated

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:11.956
from the larger community.

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:15.586
&gt;&gt;The after school program
forges a community of volunteers,

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:17.826
parents, teachers and students.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:21.776
&gt;&gt;I talk to their teachers once
a week to keep up on homework

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:24.526
and how they're doing and
then I talk to the kids

00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:25.646
about what their teachers say.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.756
Also I talk to their parents once
every two weeks and sorta update them

00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:33.316
on how the kids are doing in program,
you know, socially and academically,

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.226
and also what their teachers have
said, to sort of complete the circle

00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:37.416
between everyone involved.

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.186
&gt;&gt;And then where does the chain go?

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:42.336
&gt;&gt;The chain will go into the--

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:45.546
&gt;&gt;It's win-win for me, because it's
just like I have an expanded staff,

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.606
and so everybody is a team.

00:04:48.696 --> 00:04:51.786
Everybody is focused on a
connection between the classroom

00:04:51.786 --> 00:04:54.036
and the after school program.

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:57.596
And I think that the real key to the
Citizen Schools' success is the fact

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:00.446
that the Citizen Schools staff
is considered part of our staff.

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:02.426
So when the students
see them walking around,

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:04.286
they don't consider them any
different than the teachers

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:06.946
or anybody else that's on our
campus, and so it's seamless.

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:08.966
&gt;&gt;You're still working
on your pictures, right?

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:13.096
&gt;&gt;The Citizen Schools program has
also generated positive results

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:16.136
in the form of higher
attendance rates and test scores.

00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:20.886
&gt;&gt;We're trying to pack more and
more stuff into a fixed six hour day

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:24.946
in the schools, and achievement is
highly variable and Citizen Schools,

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:28.416
by turning that around and saying
achievement ought to be fixed

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.446
at a high level, time ought
to be variable and kids ought

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.056
to have nine or ten hours to learn.

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:36.936
We're kind of an escape valve for
the pressure that schools are under.

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:40.106
&gt;&gt;Well, all I know is, it's
better than my last program,

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:43.476
because you get to
go to explorations.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:44.956
You get more time on your homework.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:48.826
You get to do really cool
apprenticeships, have fun.

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:53.406
So at Citizen Schools,
this is the perfect place.

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:57.666
&gt;&gt;We needed the servo module, the
motors and we put those tires there

00:05:57.666 --> 00:06:00.056
in the front so it could
make it turn faster.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:05.746
&gt;&gt;When kids realize that the
learning has a real link to careers,

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.566
a real link to college and
a real link to these kind

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.936
of cool experts who've just
invited them into their office,

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:16.086
that sets off all kinds of
positive alarm bells for the kids

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:19.266
and really incentivizes them to
try harder, to care about school.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:21.006
&gt;&gt;Okay, they win.

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.406
I won. Okay.

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.606
