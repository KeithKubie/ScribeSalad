LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.560
Today I'm meeting
with Michelle Haq,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.109
who's a product manager on
the Google Fit platform.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.130
Now, the Google Fit
platform is capable of doing

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.130
so many things, and
Michelle is going to tell us

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.960
all about them today.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.174
Michelle, thanks so much for
coming having coffee with me.

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:18.590
Everybody wants
to know about Fit.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.880
Everybody wants to
learn more about Fit.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.830
What exactly is Fit?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.260
What exactly is
the Fit platform?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.240
What does it do?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.198
MICHELLE HAQ: The main
goal of the Fit platform

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:27.960
is to have a place for the
entire user's fitness history

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.430
consolidated.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.600
So this means that if
I have one app that I

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.384
use to log my
calories, a heart rate

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:35.050
monitor that I'm using
when I'm running,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.980
and a third app where I log
my cycles or my bike rides,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.300
then all of the data can
be in Fit and these apps

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.772
can interact in
a meaningful way.

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:43.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.550
MICHELLE HAQ: And then the
other cool thing that Fit does

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.280
is that it basically creates
a computation layer where

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.480
we detect your active time,
your steps, your distance,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.790
your speed, et cetera, and we
basically turn the 1 billion

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.340
Google Play Service Android
devices into free fitness

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540
trackers, and then we allow
developers to access the data

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.849
from those computations.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:05.390
And then you've
probably also noticed

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.724
that we have a Google Fit app.

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:07.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Of course.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.790
MICHELLE HAQ: So
the app, I think,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.490
really illustrates
very well the power

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.140
of the platform
because in it, you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.310
can see the user's
full fitness history.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.000
You can see your weight
from any smart scales that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.940
are connected to
Fit, you can see runs

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.490
from any of our
running partners,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.929
like for example,
RunKeeper, Strava,

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.720
and then you also see
our all day activity.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.680
That showcases the
fitness tracker

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.010
computations that we have.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I
love how it reminds me, hey,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.250
you've met your
goal for the day,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.208
and every day when it
gets earlier and earlier,

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:36.095
it feels really good.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.970
Not meeting you goal
for the day at midnight,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.915
yet meeting your goal for the
day at 4:00 PM feels good.

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:42.040
MICHELLE HAQ: That's great.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.210
We're happy about that.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
that's a great user story

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.589
there about it, but
what about developers?

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:47.048
What's the developer
story for Fit?

00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:48.713
MICHELLE HAQ: So as
a developer, there's

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:50.280
a few things you
can use Fit for.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.530
One of the cool
use cases is taking

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.980
advantage of the computations.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.970
So if I want to build,
say, a running app,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.180
then I don't have to do
that from scratch anymore.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.760
I can subscribe to all of the
data that Fit is computing.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.400
Another cool thing
I can do is use Fit

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.570
as a proxy to get access
to the user's fitness data.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.327
So I can get access to the data
from the user of other apps

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:10.910
that connect to Fit,
the hardware that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.210
connects to Fit, et cetera.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.690
And then one cool
thing you can do

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.880
as an app maker or
even a hardware maker

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.040
is use Fit as your
API for getting data

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.320
to other developers in
lieu of building an API.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.180
And even if you
already have an API,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.880
Fit is a good proxy for the
fragmented fitness ecosystem

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.830
that we have, and so
it's still a good idea

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.020
to integrate with
Fit in order to get

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.620
more access to the people who
might want to read your data.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.520
There's one thing
there that sometimes

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.900
makes the spidey senses tingle
when you hear about people

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.260
reading your data,
that there might

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.210
be like some privacy
implications or anything

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.630
like that.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.850
MICHELLE HAQ: Yes.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: What
you do to address that?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.135
MICHELLE HAQ: This is
really important to us,

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:49.400
making sure that the user
knows who's reading their data.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.740
So as a developer, if I
want to read a user's data

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.350
or write to it, then
the user has to give me

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.610
explicit permission to do.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.180
So the user will get a pop
up, and it's going to say,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.400
this developer wants to
read this data from you.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.710
The user has to say yes.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.820
And then at any time,
the user can also

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.770
go into the Google Settings app
and revoke access to their fit

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.370
history from any app.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.320
So at the end of
the day, the power

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.720
to distribute your
fitness history

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.394
is in the hands of the user.

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:17.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I can imagine

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.760
when building a platform
like this, testing

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.301
is something that's a little
different with a fitness

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:22.800
platform.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.425
It's not like an app
where you can just

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:25.660
get automatic testing of it.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.544
You've got to go out
and actually do stuff.

00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:28.460
How did that work out?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.669
Did you have any fun with it?

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.459
MICHELLE HAQ: Yeah.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.912
Well, I can say
the entire team is

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:33.370
a lot fitter because
of the testing

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.450
because you do have to go out.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.116
You have to run.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:35.980
You have to cycle.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: I think
I need to join your team.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.060
MICHELLE HAQ: Yeah.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.830
This is the only team I've
been on where going for a run

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.600
during lunch is adding value to
your project, which is really

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.100
fun.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.020
Nice.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.853
MICHELLE HAQ: There was
a guy on our QA team

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:49.770
who used to tell me, I
don't run, I'm not a runner,

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.510
but he wanted to test out
Fit so he started running,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.520
and recently he did his first
four mile run, which I think

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.590
is a pretty long distance.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.060
It was kind of nice
to see him up his game

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.640
because he wanted to use
our product and test it out.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
impacting his life as well as

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.840
his career.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.451
MICHELLE HAQ: Yeah, I hope so.

00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:08.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
Michelle, one of the things

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.174
is when you're building
a platform like this,

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:13.590
there's always somebody who
comes up with something really

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.839
innovative that just comes
out of the blue and totally

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.050
surprises you.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.599
Were there any with Google Fit?

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.390
MICHELLE HAQ: Yeah.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.980
There have been a few, actually,
but one that comes to mind

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.360
is a Wear app, and
it's using Fit,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.249
and it's called
Max My Fitness Dog.

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.790
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Max My Fitness Dog.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.170
MICHELLE HAQ: Yeah.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: I love it.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.806
MICHELLE HAQ: It's a virtual
pet, and it's this dog,

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:35.080
and to take care of him,
you have to stay active.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.110
So it's kind of a cool,
gamified fitness thing,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.560
and it's also on Wear.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.060
I love that they
were this creative.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.768
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
sounds really fun.

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:45.745
I've got to give that a try, but
my real dog might get jealous.

00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:46.709
MICHELLE HAQ: He might.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: So just
come back to developers again

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.660
for a moment.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.050
We've seen like there's
lots of great scenarios

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.550
you've mentioned,
and maybe somebody

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.760
wants to build the next
virtual pet or something

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.105
along those lines, but how
does a developer get started?

00:04:58.105 --> 00:04:59.980
MICHELLE HAQ: So you
can get started by going

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.170
to developers.google.com/fit,
and all of our documentation is

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.010
there.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.260
We also have a pretty
burgeoning G+ community,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.162
and the developers in that
community are amazing.

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:12.120
They're very competent.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.390
They even respond to
technical questions

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.849
and report bugs and
make suggestions.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.390
LAURENCE MORONEY:
The best community.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.470
MICHELLE HAQ: It's
the best community.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.400
I encourage everybody to go join
that community once they get

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.050
started.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.925
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:25.594
So developers.google.com/fit?

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:26.510
MICHELLE HAQ: Correct.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.400
First of all, thanks Michelle
Haq for coming and joining us,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.730
and you heard it here,
developers.google.com/fit

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.180
if you want to get started
building fitness apps,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.390
or if you want to start
integrating data from sensors

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.790
that maybe you don't control,
or if you want to build the next

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.410
great virtual pet
or another great,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.420
innovative scenario
like that one.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.260
Thanks so much for
joining us, Michelle.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.260
It's been a real blast.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.110
MICHELLE HAQ: Thanks
for having me.
