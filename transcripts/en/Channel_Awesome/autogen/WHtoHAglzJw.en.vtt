science what fire things like even the

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:18.940
science what fire things like even the
 

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.880
science what fire things like even the
science in the first movies pretty

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:20.890
science in the first movies pretty
 

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.890
science in the first movies pretty
suspect and the decision yeah I have

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:22.900
suspect and the decision yeah I have
 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.270
suspect and the decision yeah I have
decisions made in the first like the

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.280
decisions made in the first like the
 

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.510
decisions made in the first like the
first movies full of holes yeah yeah but

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.520
first movies full of holes yeah yeah but
 

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.560
first movies full of holes yeah yeah but
it tries it tries it still it is the

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:31.570
it tries it tries it still it is the
 

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.240
it tries it tries it still it is the
difference and the science has been

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.250
difference and the science has been
 

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.690
difference and the science has been
getting more and more just crazy and

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.700
getting more and more just crazy and
 

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.130
getting more and more just crazy and
like Jurassic world I'm just like

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:38.140
like Jurassic world I'm just like
 

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.720
like Jurassic world I'm just like
alright we don't even care about the

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:39.730
alright we don't even care about the
 

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.190
alright we don't even care about the
science here's a fun theme park there

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.200
science here's a fun theme park there
 

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.700
science here's a fun theme park there
you go

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:41.710
you go
 

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.880
you go
this one I think is actively like

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:44.890
this one I think is actively like
 

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.580
this one I think is actively like
murdering science whereas Jurassic world

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.590
murdering science whereas Jurassic world
 

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.470
murdering science whereas Jurassic world
was just ignoring science I think this

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480
was just ignoring science I think this
 

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.050
was just ignoring science I think this
one is littering like we've got some

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:52.060
one is littering like we've got some
 

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.940
one is littering like we've got some
science II ideas here because you're

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:56.950
science II ideas here because you're
 

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.860
science II ideas here because you're
right the first one is essentially a

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:58.870
right the first one is essentially a
 

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.510
right the first one is essentially a

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:00.520
Disney film these are like Disney
 

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.880
Disney film these are like Disney
characters you know going in like a

characters you know going in like a
 

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.640

pg-13 science fiction film and but but

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:05.650
pg-13 science fiction film and but but
 

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.740
pg-13 science fiction film and but but
even Disney films have a humanity that's

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:07.750
even Disney films have a humanity that's
 

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.360
even Disney films have a humanity that's
why we still connect with them and said

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:09.370
why we still connect with them and said
 

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.890
why we still connect with them and said
it's like it's like a kiddie film but

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:10.900
it's like it's like a kiddie film but
 

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.480
it's like it's like a kiddie film but
there still is like humanity to them now

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.490
there still is like humanity to them now
 

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.130
there still is like humanity to them now
it just does not have any humanity but

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.140
it just does not have any humanity but
 

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.360
it just does not have any humanity but
if you're gonna make the science go

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.370
if you're gonna make the science go
 

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.950
if you're gonna make the science go
crazy that's fine

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:16.960
crazy that's fine
 

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.270
crazy that's fine
this was my problem with Jurassic world

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:18.280
this was my problem with Jurassic world
 

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.310
this was my problem with Jurassic world
now we have this new dinosaur we can

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320
now we have this new dinosaur we can
 

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.340
now we have this new dinosaur we can

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.350
gene splicing great go to town with it
 

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.740
gene splicing great go to town with it
not are we gonna see then no yeah we get

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:25.750
not are we gonna see then no yeah we get
 

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.730
not are we gonna see then no yeah we get
that we don't get any we get a

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:26.740
that we don't get any we get a
