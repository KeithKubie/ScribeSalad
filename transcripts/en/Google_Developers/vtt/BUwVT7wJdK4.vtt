TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's talk
about sharing contacts.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.690
Now, the user will see these if,
say for example, they take

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.790
an image, tap on that image,
they'll see a Share menu item.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.120
Tap on that Share menu item and
then there's a list of all

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.470
their sharing contacts.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.780
And they look a little
bit like this.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.500
Now these sharing contacts might
be their Google+ circles

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.890
for friends or family.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.140
But they can also be something
that you add.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.340
That means that the user could
share an image or a video that

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.960
they take on Glass directly
with your service.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.740
Now, to make your service
available as a sharing

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.380
contact, you're going to want to
insert it into the contacts

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.050
collection.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.770
This is similar to the timeline
collection, except

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.820
you're going to be inserting
a contact.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.630
Now you need to provide just a
little bit of information, for

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.860
example, the ID, the display
name that you want presented

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.760
to the user, and a image to show
the user along with that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.010
sharing contact.
