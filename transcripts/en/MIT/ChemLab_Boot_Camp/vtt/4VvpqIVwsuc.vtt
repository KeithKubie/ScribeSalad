00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.472
ANTHONY: The history of
5.301, right here.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:42.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.070
IKE: It's over.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040
And I miss it already.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.800
NARRATOR: It's the last
day of 5.301.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520
Next week, everybody will turn
in their lab reports.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.850
And the week after that, they'll
all pass the class.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.495
IKE: I came with no
lab experience.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.660
This is my first ever lab.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.110
ETHAN: I didn't have any
research experience coming

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.190
here at MIT, at least
in the sciences.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.360
LINA: In the beginning,
I understood nothing.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.290
IKE: I learned a lot.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.240
I actually knew the whole
theoretical part of it.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.420
But I was always interested in
getting to know this part too.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.770
LEALIA: And I learned a lot
about chem lab techniques.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950
IKE: I got a hang of it.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.260
Starting, I was really bad.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.550
You could asK Phil or anyone.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.310
LINA: As I've progressed in
this class, I think I've

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.960
gotten a lot better.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.090
NARRATOR: It's been a journey
for everyone.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.140
But it's not all about
the science.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.160
LINA: The best thing
about 5.301 was

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.430
getting to meet the people.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.390
It was really, really fun.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.590
ETHAN: It was a lot of fun.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.660
DAN: I had a ton of fun
in lab, meeting

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.300
everyone, making friends.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.560
ETHAN: We really bonded a lot
in those three weeks.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.000
LEALIA: I'm going to miss the
class and the atmosphere.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.340
HANSOL: Everybody's talking
to each other.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.970
And we're all getting
to know each other.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.240
And we're all loud.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.440
ETHAN: The spirit of
5.301 will live on.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.320
NARRATOR: The chemistry
department is getting a few

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.210
more majors this year.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.620
DAN: Taking this lab class
especially strengthened my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.970
desire to pursue chemistry.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.440
ANTHONY: I actually switched
my major from chemical

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.850
engineering to chemistry.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.480
I think it was the right
choice for me.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.000
After 5.301, I realized that I
really did like being in lab.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.940
I do have a strong passion for
chemistry in that I could do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.520
it for the rest of my life.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.000
NARRATOR: Hansol doesn't
know it yet.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.110
But she'll declare chemistry
as well.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.840
At the end of the day, Dr.
Dolhun meets with every

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.650
student individually to
say good bye and help

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.640
them find a UROP lab.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
EMILY: He just wanted to say
that he enjoyed having us and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.775
asked us what our plans
were for our majors

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:35.260
and stuff like that.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.660
ANTHONY: I just talked to him
about how the class was, what

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.500
I was thinking about doing.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770
And he was letting me know that
he'll be here to help us,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.690
read our drafts of emails
to professors and stuff.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.920
NARRATOR: And just a few weeks
later, Emily, Hansol, and Ike

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.190
all have UROPs.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.520
EMILY: The research that I'm
doing in the Essigmann lab is

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.510
we are looking at some
chlorouracil derivatives.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.510
And we're putting these
lesions inside DNA.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.010
And we're testing it to see if
it causes any mutations.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.550
And this can lead to diabetes
and cancer.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.650
We're studying this just to
locate exactly what each

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.300
lesions do and how they
affect the body.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.250
HANSOL: Hi, I'm in lab.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.820
The whole purpose of what I'm
doing is to figure out how

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.250
fast we can make peptide
Fmoc chemistry.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.800
And right now, I'm currently
designing an experiment to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.340
take a peptide at room
temperature and compare it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.980
with how it couples under a
microwave at 60 degrees, which

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.970
is the optimal temperature.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.400
IKE: I got a UROP.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.035
Yeah, so they delivered
on their promise.

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:40.200
It's working with metal organic
frameworks, or MOFs,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.010
which are really well structured
organic molecules.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.390
The most important
thing was 5.301.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.510
I took that.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.150
It was like, all right, this
guy is prepared, you know?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.078
See ya.

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:53.263
I'm out.

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.530
I'm out.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.030
Monday, I wake up at
2:00 PM, yeah.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.300
NARRATOR: 5.301 was tough.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.760
But Anthony, Lina, Ike,
Emily and the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.530
others met the challenge.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.760
IKE: Don't feel intimidated.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.820
You're still here, right?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.530
You still made it.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.709
Make the best of
what you have.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.990
You're just like
everyone else.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.190
You're as smart as
everyone else.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.300
That's why you're here.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.240
You're here for a purpose.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.330
So do your thing, study
hard, and you'll pass.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.480
I won't guarantee an A though.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.730
But you'll pass.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.520
PHIL: Oh no, don't film this.
