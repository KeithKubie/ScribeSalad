MATT SULLIVAN: Welcome
to the "Developer Show."

00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:03.700
I am Matt Sullivan,
and I am here

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.420
at DartConf with Emily Fortuna,
who works on the Dart team.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.500
EMILY FORTUNA: Hello.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.730
MATT SULLIVAN: Why don't you
tell us a little bit about what

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.072
you do on Dart?

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:13.030
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, so
I'm a software engineer

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.800
on the Dart-to-JS team.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.950
So I work on compiling
Dart to JavaScript.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.970
And that is an interesting and
fun and challenging problem,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.390
because Dart has different
semantics from JavaScript,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.220
as you may be well aware.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.460
And there's lots of
challenges in terms

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.745
of making the resulting
JavaScript code perform,

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:37.810
and making it small enough so
that download sizes don't take

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.690
too long, and making the
actual compilation process not

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.800
take too long.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.960
MATT SULLIVAN: So Dart
2 is on the horizon.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.970
How does it affect
what you're working on?

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.070
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah,
so we've been working

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.700
for the past year
pretty hard on keeping

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.880
the outside of
Dart-to-JS working

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.760
for all of our existing
customers with the old version

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.990
of Dart.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.610
But on the inside,
working really

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.690
hard to do lots of engineering
to get ready for Dart 2.0.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.940
And this involves strong mode.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.550
And this will be super
exciting, because that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.990
means that we can do a lot
more compiler optimizations,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.940
because we can
trust those types.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.490
And we can do better
type inference.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.100
And so we can get a lot
better at determining

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.190
what code is used, what code
isn't, do better inlining.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.495
It's going to be great.

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.203
MATT SULLIVAN: So
you're here at DartConf

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.369
to talk about Flutter
with a fabulous co-host.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.660
What excites you about Flutter?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.560
And why are you here
to talk about it?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.200
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, so I'm
super excited about Flutter,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.780
because it's an
amazing tool that's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.840
built with Dart that
allows people to develop

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.890
mobile applications and
run them on iOS and Android

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.850
with one code base, not having
to write the same logic twice.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
And Dart is a really powerful
and concise programming

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.340
language to do that.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.070
And Flutter is
really taking off.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.514
Since we initially debuted
it at I/O last year,

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:02.930
we have a lot of
new improvements.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.550
There's things like support
for any gifs or gifs,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.330
depending on who
you're talking to.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.200
And we've got a lot
of new plugin support.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.795
There's things like support
for different location

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:17.090
APIs with the cell phones.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.910
And I'm super
excited, because there

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.730
are-- we're getting a lot
of third-party contributions

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.140
from people on GitHub.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.000
And this means
people are starting

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.661
to take a look at Flutter,
and using it, and contributing

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:29.160
back.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.052
So I've been working on
reviewing those poll requests.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.010
MATT SULLIVAN: Thank you,
Emily, for your time.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.620
This has been the "Developer
Show" from Los Angeles

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.480
at DartConf.
