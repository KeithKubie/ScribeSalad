00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:02.326
 Which x values ​​make the ordered pair 

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:04.520
 x seventh minus 7 decision of 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.262
 the following inequality? 

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:07.864
 Inequality is 2x minus 7e 

00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:09.802
 less than 25. 

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.660
 And we have several options, as I recommend you 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 pause the video and see if you can find it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.748
 alone. 

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.025
 Okay, now let's solve it together. 

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.440
 We are given the condition that y should be equal to 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.763
 minus 7. 

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:21.203
 And if we mean that condition, we can substitute 

00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:23.199
 this y with a minus 7. 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.866
 So we can write inequality as 2x minus 7 

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.604
 by minus 7 because we limit y to be 

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:35.122
 minus 7, is less than 25. 

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.802
 And this will be 2x minus 49 

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:43.616
 or 2x plus 49 is less than 25. 

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:46.464
 Now if I want to isolate only x on one side, 

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.157
 what we see in these inequalities here above, 

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:52.756
 we can get 49 on both sides. 

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:56.018
 So we get 49 on both sides and we get 

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:00.963
 2x is less than, let's see, 49 minus 25 

00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:03.506
 will be plus 24, so it will be 

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.502
 minus 24. 

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.498
 Now, to isolate x, we just have to divide both sides into 2 

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:09.879
 and we will not change inequality because 

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:12.224
 multiply or divide by a positive value. 

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:13.501
 Plus 2. 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.274
 This will be x is less than minus 12. 

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.956
 And luckily, this is one of the answers listed. 

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:23.496
 Therefore, while, if y is equal to minus 7, 

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:26.840
 while x is less than minus 12, will 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.603
 we are grateful for this inequality. 

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.077
 Let's solve one more of these tasks. 

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:34.316
 Like this one is a little bit more apparent. 

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:37.253
 So what values ​​do the ordered couple do, 

00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:40.898
 in the last task we had a condition for y, 

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:43.475
 and we found the x values 

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.252
 will satisfy this inequality. 

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.761
 Now we have the opposite case. 

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.036
 We have a x condition and say, 

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.474
 what values ​​of y will make the ordered pair true. 

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.157
 Or they will make a decision. 

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:55.560
 Which values ​​for y will make the ordered 5-digit pair y 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.917
 a solution to the inequality presented by 

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:58.834
 the graph below? 

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.599
 This is not given us algebraically, it is given to us 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.992
 visually. 

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:03.455
 To be a solution, that means we have to be 

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.009
 in this blue area. 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.176
 So, this pair, minus 5 

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:12.119
 comma 6. 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.579
 It will be a solution to the inequality that is depicted. 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.144
 Something that sits right on the right, 

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:21.720
 it will not be a solution because you pay attention to the rights, as you see 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.239
 this lower boundary line is interrupted. 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.294
 If it was dense, then all rights would be 

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:26.921
 solution. 

00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:28.720
 But since it is interrupted, things from the rights 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.637
 are not solutions. 

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:32.655
 Only the things that are above the rights will be 

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:34.420
 solutions. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.438
 So let's see what we want to find. 

00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:40.236
 It is said, the condition is x to be 

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:41.641
 equal to 5. 

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.694
 So, x equal to 5 is everything, 

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.180
 to see if I can draw it. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.056
 x equal to 5 is all on 

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.482
 this is where I am. 

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.583
 Now, assuming x is equal to 5, 

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.650
 we will be somewhere on this right, 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.612
 how should we restrict y to make sure, 

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.945
 that we will be in the decision zone? 

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:05.010
 Well, we have to limit ourselves so, 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.947
 that we are above the rights to 

00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:12.347
 x equal to 5, just to clarify. 

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:15.201
 We must be above, 

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:22.068
 the possible points will be those, 

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.598
 once again, we limit x equal to 5, 

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:28.349
 possible points are those, 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.428
 which I stain with purple. 

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:34.551
 And in fact, I can go on if I want to. 

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:37.871
 y must be greater than, 

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.636
 it can not be greater than or equal to 7, 

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.331
 it should be greater than 7. 

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:43.212
 If it was greater than or equal to 7, 

00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:45.092
 we would include the point of rights, 

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.776
 but I have already explained about this interrupted right, 

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.749
 so we do not want to include the rights points. 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.746
 We want to include the points over the rights. 

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.434
 Therefore, y will be greater than 7, 

00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:01.775
 which is the answer there. 

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.072
 If x is equal to 5 while y is 

00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:08.114
 greater than 7 we will be 

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.413
 in the multitude of decisions.
