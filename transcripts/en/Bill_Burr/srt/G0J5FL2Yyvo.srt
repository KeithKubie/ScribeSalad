1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,643
Yeah

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,400
[inaudible]

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,530
Like a boss.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,880
I saw a couple, I actually saw a couple
of them went out and I saw, I go,

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,170
I saw that. And um, I liked it,

6
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:20,710
but it was funny when Ben Affleck, they
say, what's your name? And he goes,

7
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,300
my name is Tony Mendez.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,703
Okay.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,510
My name is Tony Mendez. I'm from New
York. My father worked construction.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,180
My mother teaches elementary
school. I have one.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,060
I remember thinking in my head going
Mendez, I think that's a Latino name.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,770
I know it's not a white name.
I know. I've never met anybody.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,700
I never met a white guy. Hey, what's
your name? I Larry. Larry. What?

14
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:52,360
Rodriguez. Larry Mendez.
It's not, you know,

15
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,510
it's not like one of those crossover
names. So in the end of the movie,

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,490
spoiler alert, they had, this
is just shit in the credits.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,250
They just have a, you know, they
have a picture of everybody,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,030
you know, each cast. Cause it was
a true story. So each cast member

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,660
is, um, you know, I should talk to
this, I should talk to Nia about this,

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,630
you know, this is, this is it.
We're going to do a fucking, uh,

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,700
another Neil log this week, and I'm going
to talk about this because they had,

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,240
you know, the six actors who are
fucking unreal, who played the, uh,

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,890
the people trying to get out of Iran.

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,750
They showed a closeup picture of the
actor right next to a closeup picture of

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,070
like the photo id of the person that
they were playing and it was fucking dead

26
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,170
on. They looked exactly like the person

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,650
[inaudible]

28
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,120
and then there's like another minute or
so credits and then they finally show

29
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,410
the real Tony Mendez.

30
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:04,180
And the picture is like a full body shot
of the guy from like halfway across the

31
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,010
room shaking hands with Jimmy Carter.

32
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,190
And you're looking at the guy and he
looks like Bartolo Cologne's dad and me.

33
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:16,790
And Nia just started laughing our
asses off and you know, it was,

34
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,400
it was one of those moments,
one of those Hollywood moments.

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,330
And then I looked on the internet
and it was people complaining going,

36
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:27,650
what the fuck? You know, how come you
couldn't get a Latin actor to do it?

37
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:31,610
But Bob [inaudible] done
all that shit. You know,

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,630
now you play a character in this film
by the name of Tony Mendez and a lot of

39
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,990
your fans don't realize that
you speak Spanish very well.

40
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:44,670
So I have to ask you and Espanyol to own
the upper in these Dale Espanol. Econdo

41
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,040
[inaudible] [inaudible] uh, you
know [inaudible] [inaudible]

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,500
this is what I got to say about that.
I definitely think it's fucked up.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,880
Why don't I just say what I had to set
about say about that? Like, like what?

44
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,190
I was just going to present all this
shit and then move on. All right.

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,100
I don't know how to say my points
without having some sort of intro.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,320
And now here is what I think about that.

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,240
I think it's fucked up cause it
was a real dude and he's a hero.

48
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,460
He did some unreal shit.

49
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,900
So because it's a real dude
who did some real heroic shit,

50
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:31,590
you should have a Latin dude play the guy.

51
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,210
So everybody knows that that win
is in their column. You know,

52
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,610
that's one full Latinos, you know,

53
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:42,390
so the next time you get into
a barroom argument, you know,

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,930
well doe way Fed on the airplane and
then the Latin guy could be like,

55
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:48,470
yeah,

56
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,800
well we're the ones who got those six
motherfuckers on the plate and got him

57
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:56,200
into Canada. Right. And all of your shit,

58
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,400
both sides. You're in a bar, so none of
your read. It's all based on the movies,

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,460
but now it's going to cause a fight
in a bar because some of them,

60
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,680
yet it was a white guy. The guy's good.

61
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,100
No, it was fucking Tony Mendez
Essay his way. Fuck you.

62
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,610
The why was it played by Ben Affleck?
And then there's going to be a big fight.

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,710
But on the other side

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,240
is if you got a fucking million
dollars and you need the movie to sell,

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,120
what do you do? I still think they
should've. They should've gone.

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,110
Really should've got Luis Guzman.
Where the hell is he coming from this?

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,060
Why is he saying this?

68
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,860
Luis Guzman is Tony Mendez. I
know. Fucking know. You know what?

69
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,800
That's one of the ones that I got
to talk to the about that shit.

70
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:50,010
But it's a good movie. You
should definitely go see
it. But I got to tell you,

71
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:54,510
that was inadvertently
fucking hilarious. I'm like,

72
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,940
me and Nia walked out and
started joking about it,

73
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,250
and by the time we got
out of the movie theater,

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,280
we were crying and laughing and everybody
was looking at us like we were out of

75
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,834
our minds.

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,890
And the fake movie crew Mendez
was the production manager.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,070
And for the cover to work,
he had to become a real one.

78
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,330
He opened a production company in Los
Angeles. He had business cards made.

79
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,290
Mendez played his part so well
that you could say at the time,

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,830
he might've been the best actor
in the world. And in a way,

81
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:31,430
you should've won an academy award for
the, for the role you played in it. Yeah,

82
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,264
that'd be a good idea.

83
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,100
We could have an academy
awards were spies for Mendez.

84
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,080
That's what passes it. Sarcasm.
