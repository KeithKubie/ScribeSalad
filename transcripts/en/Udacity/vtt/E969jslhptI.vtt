00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.650
So what are the challenges that we're
going to face when we have this

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.510
task of managing cyber security for the
organization that we're talking about?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.780
We said we have to know what
are the assets that are of value and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.390
are they under risk?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.980
Also, sort of understand the threats.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.168
And, how serious are those threats?

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:24.945
So when we talk about risk, actually
we're going to look at this a little bit

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:28.965
more, but risk is really
the likelihood of an attack, okay?

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.810
So probability of an attack.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.910
It's not the worst case but
the worst can happen.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.110
It's sort of trying to compute
the likely case in some sense.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.495
So continuing with the challenges,
even if I sort of identify my assets and

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:46.805
threat source, and
perhaps the likelihood of attacks,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.970
then I have to worry about,
well what can I do about it?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.247
What sort of solutions are out there or
controls that exist?

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:58.970
Deciding that of course is a challenge.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.250
We did talk about cost-benefit and
the trade off that are there

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.290
when you think about
the deploying various solutions.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.220
So, of course we want to do
into a cost effective manner.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.230
It sounds simple, but doing that,
again, is a serious challenge.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.720
Obviously we have to argue
that the cost is less than

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.875
the reduction in risk
we're going to have.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:24.265
Finally, we know that when you look
at sort of the threat landscape, and

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:26.905
I think in the context
of database security,

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:30.417
we did the question where we said,
what are the threats?

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:34.542
External hackers or insiders,
and we say in one of the surveys,

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:39.312
insiders and unauthorized access was
ranked higher than external hackers.

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:44.332
So we have to of course, understand
the people and the process that we have.
