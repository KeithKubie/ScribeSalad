00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.070
Now that we've used docker to
start multiple instances Of our

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.330
Inganest container.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.939
I want to show you how to
communicate with them.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.730
What we can do is look
at the container ID

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.820
of a docker instance
using the PS command.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.180
I'll copy the container ID and
use a docker inspect command

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.670
to find out more information
about a specific container.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.249
&gt;From the output I can see the IP
address of the container.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.130
I can then use curl to hit
the engine next instance

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.360
running inside of the container.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.730
And there you go,
we're talking to that instance.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.550
Now that we're done with our instances,
let's clean up.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.935
When we want to stop these docker
instances, we'll use the docker stop

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:45.365
command with the container IDs of the
instances we want to remove, like this.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:49.485
And we'll use the docker rm command
to remove our docking containers from

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:52.365
our system and
any file they may have left behind.

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.695
And we can verify the three inganest
instances are no longer running

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:00.079
using the docker ps command.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.910
And we'll use the docker rm command to
remove our docker containers from our

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.660
system and any files that
they may have left behind.
