To add the chipmunk effect, we will have to raise the audio's pitch.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.320
Let's take a listen one more time.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt; My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.860
&gt;&gt; So then the real question becomes how can we change our audio's pitch?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.290
As a hint, I can tell you that AVFoundation can help you.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.490
There's a link in the instructor notes that lists out all the classes

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.170
within AVFoundation.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.340
Scan through them and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.540
see if there's a class you can find that can help us change the audio pitch.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.050
