Two weeks ago you and I voted. What, you didn’t
feel my cursor right there next to yours?

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.460
Heheh.
Welp, the winner is… (imitating drums)…

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.400
BADAAH! K-k-keep ‘em separated.
This was TRICKY. 65% of click voters want

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.900
two separate channels but 80% of commen'ers
want just one! That's "commenTers", not "commoners". (Tongue twisted.)

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.410
After re-scrutinizing those YouTube notes and chatting with pookums about your collective happiness, my personal creative

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.390
pursuits will move off to a new channel opening
November 7! Look for a video invitation then!

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.350
But enough distractions, next Friday we’re
back to language in a Halloween special.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.890
(Excuse me, something in my throat there.
Uuuhm...)

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.430
So subscribe if you haven’t! And send in
any good fan art that might fit this picture

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.079
frame here.
