PRESENTER: Ladies
and gentlemen, Google

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.580
is happy to welcome Image Comics
creators of the title "Black

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.560
Jack Ketchum," Brian
Schirmer and Jeremy Saliba.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.270
We're going to hear from
them about "Black Jack

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.260
Ketchum," the title,
and their work on it.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.917
Gentlemen.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.000
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Thank you.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.647
JEREMY SALIBA: Thanks, Chris.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.230
BRIAN SCHIRMER: As
he said, I'm Brian.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.610
He's Jeremy.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.570
We started out doing
comics five, six years ago.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.560
And what we're going to
be talking about today

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.050
is how we broke
into the big time

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.510
and now have a book
with Image Comics,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.221
the premiere creator-owned
publisher in the US.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.720
And probably the
best place to begin

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.430
is explaining what a
creator-owned comic

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.520
is versus any other kind.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.120
Most people are obviously
familiar with your Batmans,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.830
your Captain Americas, your
Avengers, your Justice League.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.660
These are specifically owned
by companies-- DC Comics,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.130
Marvel Comics.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.770
And when someone is fortunate
to do work for either of them,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.220
it is considered work for hire.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.810
Conversely, when
you do something

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.460
that is creator-owned,
well, it's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.800
exactly what it says on the tin.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
That means that we as the
creators own everything.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.679
We own the characters.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.470
We own the stories.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.890
We own the IP, most importantly.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.850
And that's a cornerstone
of Image Comics.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.350
JEREMY SALIBA: It's one
of those crown jewels

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.150
to be able to have your
own book, your own IP

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.930
with a book like this.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.890
DC and Marvel are referred
to as the big two,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.490
because they're the big dual
monoliths of the comic industry

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.330
and the ones that are
the most successful

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.820
in terms of reach
and publication

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.960
and amount of sales
and everything.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.480
But Image is fast
approaching all that.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.230
And there's a few
other-- there's actually

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.080
quite a few creator-owned comic
book publishers out there,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.515
which is great.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:00.640
And if you are the kind of
person who really values

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.750
getting into the
comic book industry,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.950
and you do eventually want
to get to the big two,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.325
it's also a great
place to start,

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.560
is the creator-owned area.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400
Because the big two
oftentimes want proof

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.900
that you can make a
book, and making a book

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.850
is the best way to prove
that you can make a book.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.900
So usually, that's the
route that gets taken.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.670
Not everyone is lucky enough to
get started at Image in terms

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.070
of a creator-owned publisher
that they get to work with.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.820
But we somehow managed
to get that to happen.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.820
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Somehow.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.640
And we'll talk
about that in part.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.430
So we're really
going to be charting

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.550
the course of how-- kind of
like how a bill becomes a law,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.070
this is how a comic goes from
a basic idea up into actually

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.340
being published.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.910
In our case, I write.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.850
I do a really bad ass stick
figure Batman that pretty

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.460
much only my students
ever get to see.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.790
Jeremy wears many hats.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.370
He edited the book.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.940
He did the covers.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.120
He was co-creator on it
along with Claudia Balboni,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.740
who is the interior artist.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.490
JEREMY SALIBA: She did
a tremendous amount

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.698
of work and a tremendous job.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:09.930
She lives in Italy,
so she wasn't

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.510
able to make it here today.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.120
Do we know where
in Italy she lives?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120
BRIAN SCHIRMER: In Roma.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.290
JEREMY SALIBA: In Rome
itself, which is awesome.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.694
BRIAN SCHIRMER: I'm sorry if
I'm-- I've got to apologize.

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:21.860
Claudia, I'm sorry if I
butcher your name or butcher

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.040
your accent.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.122
I'm going to have the equivalent
of an Italian fatwa on me,

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:28.372
which is a vendetta, actually.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.090
Moving on.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.770
So every story, whether it's
a comic, a film, a book,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.680
comes from a basic idea.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.160
In this instance, Black Jack
Ketchum came from two places.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.070
The first one was family ties.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.460
My great-great-grandmother
on my mother's side

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.747
was a cousin of a gentleman
by the name of Tom Ketchum.

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:56.080
This is probably one of the
more famous pictures of him.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.630
Unfortunately, he came to
a rather dire end in 1901,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.370
I want to say.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.950
And if I'm getting that
wrong, that's embarrassing.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.750
That's a more favorable
picture of him to a degree.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.520
I think this was actually taken
shortly before he was hung.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.360
So he was a wanton,
rapscallion outlaw

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.459
in the late 19th century.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.530
And as I say, he was cousin
to my great-great-grandmother.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.200
And this was the story that
was passed down from when

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.730
I was four or five years old.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.769
I would hear my aunts
and uncles and my mom

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.560
and my grandparents
talking about Blackjack

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.960
Ketchum, Blackjack Ketchum.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.300
I didn't really know
anything about the guy

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.140
until I got older and
started to research

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.860
and found out that he was
a little touched, I think,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.820
is probably the best way, a
favorable way of saying it.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.256
He had issues.

00:04:43.256 --> 00:04:44.880
And there are various
stories out there

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.020
talking about how he
was too crazy to ride

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.620
with the Wild Bunch and too
crazy to hang out with Butch

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.760
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.330
And eventually, he robbed the
wrong train at the wrong time

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.180
and got himself shot,
got himself captured,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.000
and eventually got himself hung
in a very mismanaged execution,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.010
shall we say.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.710
So I never really
had any, necessarily,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.350
plans to do anything
with the story

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.570
until only a few years ago.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.560
I had a dream.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.740
I had an actual dream that
involved a Western setting

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.270
where the typical
tropes had basically

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.110
been turned on their heads.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.500
It was a very surrealistic
fever dream involving

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.070
guys in duster coats that had
no faces, kind of like Nazgul

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.310
in the Old West, and saloons
where you would enter one

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.720
saloon and you could
exit any other saloon

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.050
anywhere in the world.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.620
And just a myriad
of bizarre things.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.340
And I woke up.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.442
I woke up, and
believe it or not,

00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.400
I found just this
morning without-- this

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.300
is the actual notebook
where I scrawled down

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.615
the dream that I had.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:59.240
And at the very top
on the second page,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.200
it says this all came at the end
of a post-coffee sleep of about

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.730
five hours on the morning
of February 20th, 2012.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.839
So combining those,
about a year or so later,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.880
started to put together
the idea for a comic that

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.620
would be called
"Black Jack Ketchum,"

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.790
and taking this
historical figure

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.710
and throwing him into
this surrealist landscape.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.240
And then we were
off and running.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.073
JEREMY SALIBA: One of
the interesting things

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:29.030
about when you have a story
is that there's always

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.730
a few avenues in which you can
tell it-- movies, television,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.860
comics, books, web blog,
whichever avenue you choose.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.940
And in terms of mass
production and strong visuals

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.810
accompanying it,
comics seems to be

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.210
one of the last American
storytelling art forms

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.140
where it's really still pure.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.069
One person, if talented enough
to write and draw and do

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.610
all those things together, can
sit down and make their story.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.860
And they can assemble it in
the way that they want to,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.120
and then bring it to a
publisher, or perhaps a few,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.937
before they're told yes and
have it released that way.

00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:05.020
You can also self-publish.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.520
There's a lot of
ways you can do it.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.820
But it's one of those,
again, art forms that

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.080
seems to be one of
the last ones where

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.524
if-- obviously, on a movie,
it's a much larger production,

00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:15.940
and many more
people are involved,

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.273
and there's a lot more money
involved in making a movie.

00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:21.440
So the money people tend to want
to have their say in how things

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.420
go so they make sure they get
a return on their investment.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.190
But with comics,
it's a lot more free.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.320
It's a lot more open
and experimental.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.180
And it's a really
exciting place.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.420
And there's a
legitimacy in comics

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.910
that wasn't there when I was
growing up reading comics.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.315
People look to them
for great storytelling

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:42.140
now-- be it outside of
fantastical elements

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.080
and outside of
superhero pow, bang,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.860
punch, which is really exciting.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.880
And so Brian has written for
several mediums over the years,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.444
but had started getting into
comics at this point, which

00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:56.110
is probably, I think,
one of the reasons

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.035
why one of your first ideas was
to make it into a comic book.

00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:00.910
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yeah.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.511
And because we had-- we had
been doing some self-publishing

00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:05.010
for a while.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.430
We did some stuff
via Kickstarter

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.280
and basically
opened a few doors.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.510
And one of those
doors was opened

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.900
to Eric Stephenson, who's the
publisher of Image Comics.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.162
And he basically said,
well, what do you guys got?

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:19.620
And one of the
things-- we sent him

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.190
a couple pitches,
and one of them

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.930
was indeed for
"Black Jack Ketchum."

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.890
And this is the cover
that Jeremy mocked up

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.590
for when we were
submitting the proposal.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.470
When pitching to-- it
varies by publisher

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.700
what they want to see when
you're pitching a new project.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.510
In this instance, I think
he wanted to see a cover

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.410
and I think about five pages.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.495
And it was basically a
one-page proposal of here's

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:47.995
what the story is
going to be about.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.860
It's about a C-grade outlaw
who's mistaken for an A-lister

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.370
and has to try and clear his
name in a surrealist version

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.472
of the Old West.

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:00.930
And we went into a little more
detail and talked about some

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.150
of the characters.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:07.370
And based on all of this--
it was all done via e-mail.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.620
Except I met him in person,
and the actual pitching process

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.840
was completely handled by email.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.600
And I'd say over the course of
maybe five, six weeks-- which

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.990
isn't a long time in comics--
finally got the green light

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.850
to go ahead and make the book.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.810
As fate would have it,
though, we got the green light

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.190
September, 2014.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.950
And about six weeks
later, our artist

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.800
had to leave the project.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.285
He was a young man
named Valerio Fabbretti.

00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:43.660
We had worked with
him previously

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.860
on some self-published stuff.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.250
However, in that time, his
star had shone very brightly.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.080
And after about six weeks, he
contacted me and said, look,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.580
I've got these other
deals going on.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.100
I'm not going to be
free for 18 months.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.670
And the prospect of having to
put this on the back burner

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.680
for over a year did
not sit very well.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.530
And we all agreed
that it would be

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:13.780
best if we went ahead and found
someone new to take the reins.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.280
JEREMY SALIBA: We did, and
it was-- first it was panic.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.300
What do you mean, you
can't do the book?

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.894
Oh no.

00:10:19.894 --> 00:10:21.060
How long do we have to wait?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.710
And then, yes, OK, well,
let's try and figure out

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.499
who we can get.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.040
And one of the nice things about
having a book that's already

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.630
been approved to be made
at Image Comic Books

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.130
is that people are a lot more
interested than if you're just

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.936
some person who has a story
who says, oh, you can--

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.810
it's great experience,
great exposure for you

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.960
to work on the book.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.810
It was a little bit
more to offer with that.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.200
So we had a unique
situation in that

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.620
we wanted to find
another artist,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.830
but we didn't have any
one lined up per se.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.680
And we sent out some feelers.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.045
And a smattering of artists
were introduced to us via email,

00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:53.170
and said all these people
heard about your project,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.520
thought it sounds awesome,
they want to work on it.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.561
So we were trying to think
what would be the best

00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:58.814
way to sift through all this.

00:10:58.814 --> 00:10:59.980
Some of them had portfolios.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.969
Some of them didn't.

00:11:00.969 --> 00:11:03.510
We ended up having-- everyone
agreed that they would go ahead

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.857
and do some test work, some
tests rough pages for the book

00:11:06.857 --> 00:11:08.440
so we could take a
look at all of them

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.410
and see which one
was the best fit.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.710
It was amazing.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.780
Everyone was awesome.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.550
We had some tremendous
artwork delivered our way.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.432
They were very generous
with their time.

00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:21.890
We did our best to make sure
everyone knew exactly what was

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.075
going on up front, that
we were trying to pitch,

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:26.200
and we're not sure which
artist we want to go with.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.325
Would you be interested in
trying some and donating

00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:29.240
your time?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.410
And they said yes, sure.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.710
And great work all around.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.790
Unique choices, really
cool art styles.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.470
But ultimately,
Claudia's was the one

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.720
that just seemed like it was
the best fit for the book

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.670
and the style and
the storytelling

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.260
that we wanted to do.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.080
We got the pages and
immediately-- her pages

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.770
and went, oh yeah.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.870
That's the one that
seems to really resonate

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.670
the most with the story
and the character.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.357
And it was, again,
a great position

00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:56.940
to be in, because there was no
bad choices put in front of us.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.690
But hers was a good one.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.094
And we ended up putting
to the publisher a few

00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:03.510
together, saying here's some
great artwork, the best stuff

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.477
that we think we got.

00:12:04.477 --> 00:12:07.060
We're leaning towards Claudia,
because we like her work a lot.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.290
And that was when we heard
back, and Eric Stephenson

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.860
said yes, she seems
like a great fit.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.700
Let's go ahead and
move forward with her.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.741
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And then
we were off and running.

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.800
And that was January of 2015.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.890
And so it was like, OK.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.400
We've got the green light.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.690
You've got the artist.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.920
You've got the creative team.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.700
Go make your book.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.310
That's basically
how Image operates.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.251
They say, oh, OK, sure.

00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:29.750
Go do it.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.600
Don't pester us until it's done.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.880
And so we spent the better part
of last year putting this book

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.200
together.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.140
So then begs the
question, well, OK.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.370
You got the green light.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.320
What do you do?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.870
How do you make the comic?

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.000
What are the steps?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.440
And, well, we're
here to tell you.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.100
This insane-- yeah,
that's a comic, folks.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.830
That's basically
what it looks like.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.620
The very first
thing before-- you

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.490
have a cursory idea, the
first thing that you typically

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.990
want to do is outline.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.005
Outlining-- it terrifies
a lot of people.

00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:05.630
A lot of people just
hate the prospect,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.520
because they figure, oh, it's
taking all the creativity out

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.292
of it.

00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:11.020
It took me a long time to
get over that bridge myself.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.630
I am very much of the
mind that outlining

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.304
is one of the freest parts
of creating anything,

00:13:17.304 --> 00:13:18.970
because you're not
locked into anything.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.930
Nothing is set in stone.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.070
There's a Brian Eno
quote that is something

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:29.040
along the lines of, you're
not building a wall,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.270
you're making a brick,
which I translate

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.770
to it's not a wall between
you and your creativity.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.095
It's the foundation of what you
are going to do with the story.

00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:39.470
JEREMY SALIBA:
Speaking of walls,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.803
it's interesting, because
this is somewhat conservative.

00:13:41.803 --> 00:13:43.254
I've seen you do
outlines before.

00:13:43.254 --> 00:13:44.670
As he mentioned,
he and I had done

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.656
some-- we just did some
self-publishing for a while

00:13:47.656 --> 00:13:50.030
just to make books, because
we just wanted to make books.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.159
And one of the times that
you were really working out

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:55.450
one of your biggest stories,
it was a whole entire wall

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.630
you had mapped out with
all the beats of stories

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.910
and all the different options.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.130
BRIAN SCHIRMER: To be fair,
what we're looking at here,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.980
I believe on the one side
is my chicken scratch

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.890
and stuff scribbled out
for part of one issue.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.170
And then what you see in
the multi-colored note

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.260
cards on my bed was, I
think, the final issue

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.320
and being able to move all of
that around as needed and hit

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.830
the right beats.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.610
But if we had something
that was the entire series,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.735
need a much bigger monitor.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.750
So you start with an outline.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.870
You get it to where
you want it to be.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.140
And then the next thing is my
bailiwick, which is scripting.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:45.190
You Googlers might recognize
this little program here.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.280
Yeah.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.800
I've long since moved on
from anything like Word.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.150
I'm not one of the
guys-- there are

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.634
writers and comics out
there who use Final Draft

00:14:55.634 --> 00:14:56.800
and various other softwares.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.850
Google Docs, for me, is ideal.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.770
It's a one-stop shop.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.540
I can share it with all of the
artists and the creative team

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.860
and anybody else that needs it.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.330
I can put links in there.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.830
You might see-- it's just great.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.600
For reference for the
artists, it can't be beat.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.480
And I sound like I'm kissing
Google ass right now,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.420
and that's not my intent.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.330
But it's just been
a fantastic tool.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.930
Unlike screenplays,
as some of you

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.990
might know-- so screenplays have
a very, very strict and rigid

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.230
format to the degree that
there are plenty of stories

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.844
out there in Hollywood where
if a producer or a reader

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:40.760
gets a script and it's
not properly formatted,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.460
they don't even bother.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.060
They just delete it.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.601
They throw it in
the trash, whatever.

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:44.920
Comics are not that at all.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.500
There is no formalized
comic script.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.240
And right now, my
students are screaming,

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.370
because I tell them a
lie, because I don't want

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.280
to see 20 different formats.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.160
But mine is a
hodgepodge of what I've

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.239
seen others do in the industry.

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:02.030
And so it's a little
bit like a screenplay.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.059
It's a little bit
like a stage play.

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:05.850
Basically, what you're
doing in a script is

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.080
you're telling the
artist what you

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.770
think, what you as the writer
think will appear on a page,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.580
what you think will appear in
each panel-- and for my money,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.910
using as few words as
possible so you're not

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.636
miring them down in detail.

00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:22.760
JEREMY SALIBA: Now, in
terms of formats of scripts,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.440
there's the Marvel method
for script writing,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.410
for instance, which is where you
just give suggestions of what's

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.327
happening on the page.

00:16:29.327 --> 00:16:30.784
BRIAN SCHIRMER:
What he's referring

00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:33.270
to as the Marvel method was
something that, ostensibly,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.340
Stan Lee pioneered
back in the '60s when

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.910
he, if you believe
the apocrypha,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.630
was writing basically everything
that Marvel was putting out

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.220
at that point.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.010
And he didn't have enough time.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.930
There weren't enough
hours in the day

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.410
to do a detailed script.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.600
So he would, on occasion,
do an entire script

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.130
for, say, Fantastic
Four or the Avengers,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.250
and it would be one page.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.170
It would be one page
of just a synopsis.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.700
And he would give it to the
artist and say go make this.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.890
And the artist, who might
be Steve Ditko, Jack Kirby,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.660
would go away, sometimes
for as brief as a weekend,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.200
and come back with 20 pages
of art and say, here, Stan,

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.260
take all the credit.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.099
JEREMY SALIBA: And
then from that point,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.210
then you start crafting
dialogue and doing

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.619
it to fit the images
that were drawn as well.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:13.535
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Right.

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:16.650
So Stan or whomever
would be putting

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.286
in the dialogue and
the captions and sound

00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:20.869
effects and everything
after the fact,

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.720
after all the art
had been completed.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.462
Whereas the more common
scripting method these days

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.170
is probably the full
script method, which

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.600
is pretty much what I do, where
you are, as the writer, saying,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.340
again, this is what
happens on each page.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.340
This is what happens in
each panel on each page.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.280
This is the dialogue.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.910
These are the captions,
so on and so forth.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.770
A big thing that I
advocate and that I do

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.600
is every script that
I send to an artist,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.570
I begin first by praising them.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.450
Because who doesn't love praise?

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.710
But also, by saying, look,
you are the illustrator.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.690
You're the artist.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.300
I can write.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.010
I can do story.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.760
I can do dialogue.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.900
I can do character work.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.320
But you are the visual artist.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.270
If you see something
in here and you

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.540
think you can do
it better-- if I

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.280
say this needs to be
done in five panels,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.560
and you think you can do it in
two, or in one big panel, one

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.430
splash page, go for it.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.840
I trust you.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.590
And we're in this together.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.710
JEREMY SALIBA: It's that
collaborative aspect

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.334
that starts to make
it really exciting.

00:18:13.334 --> 00:18:15.420
That's where the magic happens.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.110
Because obviously,
with scripting,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.610
it runs the full gamut of here,
Spider-Man fights Dr. Octopus,

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.410
go, all the way to page 1,
panel 1, Spider-Man wakes up,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.920
Peter Parker turns off
his alarm clock, whatever.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.100
And Brian, as a writer, working
with him and his writing

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.740
over the years, he's
a generous writer.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.910
As he says, he says
he has links in here.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.060
He'll provide reference.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.950
He'll provide an
outline of the page.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.680
But it's totally
malleable in terms

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.590
of what can happen on
there, because we're

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.640
after the best product.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.145
And theoretically,
the assumption

00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:50.520
is that the artist
will also have

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.410
a really good knowledge of what
will look good on the page.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.437
And that's the best
of both worlds.

00:18:55.437 --> 00:18:57.770
Because you're getting a
version of it, and you read it.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.982
And I know that having
drawn his words before,

00:18:59.982 --> 00:19:02.440
reading the words, you start
to form a picture in your head

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.990
as you read it, and
sometimes it disagrees

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.960
with what he's written.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.043
So you make a note, and
then you go back and forth

00:19:07.043 --> 00:19:08.140
about it a little bit.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.630
But that collaborative aspect
tends to really not only just

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.990
get the best possible result
out of what you're making,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.170
but also, it tends to-- you have
that trial by fire a little bit

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.304
where you start to question
things a little bit

00:19:20.304 --> 00:19:21.720
and make sure that
you're arriving

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.750
at the best possible
conclusion for all of it.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.960
And it's also the one
that's the best fit, too.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.420
Sometimes, the artist--
there's been some interiors

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.340
that I've drawn for Brian
before where he said, OK.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.730
Brian is a guy who likes--
he's always been a fan,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.540
he's read comics of almost
schematic-like drawings.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.250
If Batman is going
to the Bat Cave,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.307
and it's a hugely detailed,
full-page drawing of the Bat

00:19:41.307 --> 00:19:43.640
Cave, and every little bat
computer and all the trophies

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.992
he has-- he's written
pages like that for me,

00:19:45.992 --> 00:19:47.700
and I would not like
to draw that at all.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.850
That sounds very
difficult and not fun.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.386
So I said, how about
instead we have

00:19:51.386 --> 00:19:53.260
him walking past some
things and some panels,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.240
and you see one thing
here and one thing there?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.070
And we get the same idea
across, because my weaknesses

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.050
were going to be on display
too much for a page like that.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.195
And he'll go OK, yes.

00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:03.070
That works just fine.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.695
We can do that.

00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:06.600
So that collaboration
hopefully finds the best fit

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.930
as well, which should result
in the best-looking book.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.050
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And the
initial proof of this

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.590
is, again, send the
script to the artist--

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.710
in this case, Claudia.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.430
And so she takes it.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.430
She goes away.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.010
She reads it.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.750
She thinks about it.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.458
She puts it under her
pillow-- virtually,

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:23.952
of course, because it's
all in Google Docs.

00:20:23.952 --> 00:20:25.660
And then she takes
her time and does what

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.690
are basically called roughs.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.300
So what we've got
here are the roughs

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.140
or thumbnails--
another colloquialism--

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.630
for every page out of the first
issue of "Black Jack Ketchum."

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.680
You want to talk about
that a little bit?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.830
JEREMY SALIBA: Well, sure.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.720
The rough process is just
like the outlining process

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.220
for writing.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.030
It's one of the more exciting
ones, because anything goes.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.780
The most common question
I get from people

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.905
who are starting off with
the roughs will be, well,

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.210
how rough can they be?

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.830
And as long as
they're readable, it

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.020
can be stick figures if it's
readable and understandable

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.020
what's going on.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.190
Usually, it's a little
bit more than that.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.080
But the main part here
is that you're really

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.114
blocking in stuff.

00:21:05.114 --> 00:21:07.030
You don't want to spend
a lot of time on this.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.660
This is something
where you're just

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.350
getting that initial
idea out and hoping

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:17.070
to communicate it really
well and leave enough room.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.020
This is disposable
artwork, usually,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.600
at this stage of the project,
because something might not

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.280
be working.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.187
Oftentimes, changes need to be
made, quick little adjustments.

00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:28.520
Then there are some people
who can just do these roughs,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.870
and it's perfect
right from the start.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.259
Most people, it's
obviously a combination.

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:35.800
Some things are good and some
things are not working as well.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.258
But you can see,
too, there's a lot

00:21:37.258 --> 00:21:41.087
of-- in terms of a comic page--
and Claudia was obviously

00:21:41.087 --> 00:21:43.170
here dealing with the black
and white aspect of it

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.090
and the heavy black
inked areas as well as

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.780
the more open white areas.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.210
And these black areas are
what we call spot blacks.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.790
And they're a design
element as well.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:57.130
You try to not only do good,
solid work that represents

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.220
people, places,
things like that,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.470
but also try to lead
the eye with those spot

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.460
blacks around the page, or set
the mood or anything like that.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.310
There's also a flow that
goes into a comic book page

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.200
that you've got to
try and keep in mind.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.580
Basically, we all read from top
to bottom and right to left.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.470
So we want to--

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.720
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Left to right.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.980
JEREMY SALIBA: Left to right.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.290
Top to bottom, left to right.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:23.320
And a comic book page
should flow similarly.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.110
And you want the
page, when it ends,

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.650
to go off out the bottom on
the right side of the page

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.800
off to the next one.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.110
And so the idea is that
you kind want a backwards S

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.090
curve to go through the page
as much as you can with all

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.000
those different elements.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.920
And hopefully, again,
starting up here,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.320
coming down through it, and
then ultimately swooshing out

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.560
there, which leads you
right up, of course,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.900
to the next page or to
turn the page depending

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.970
on the spacing there.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.640
And this is also--
as much as you

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.640
don't want to spend too
much time on the drawing

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.056
aspect of it, it's
because there's

00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:57.320
a lot of planning going on
at this stage-- not just

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.200
in the layout of the panels
and the layout of the design

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.116
of those spot blacks and
everything like that,

00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:04.569
but also the continuity
of what's going on.

00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:06.110
A very specific
example of that would

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.420
be the 180 rule or
crossing the line, which

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.300
is when you're having two
characters deliver dialogue

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.100
to each other-- and
this applies to movies

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.750
or whatever-- when
they're facing each other,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.410
there's an imaginary
line between them.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.576
And you want that camera
that goes between them when

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:22.720
one talks and the other talks to
stay on one side of that line.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.460
Otherwise, it
starts to disorient

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.461
the viewer a little bit.

00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:27.710
If you want a scene to be
confusing-- which sometimes,

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.690
you do-- you do move
the camera around more.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.090
But if you want it to just
be something easy to follow,

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.620
you keep on that same
side of that line.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.650
So essentially, as it works
out, the person talking

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.372
may be in the foreground on
the left side of the panel,

00:23:41.372 --> 00:23:42.830
and the person in
the background is

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.930
on the right side of the panel.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.210
And then you cut
to their back side.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.050
Well, then they're still on
the same side of the panel.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.830
It's very easy to
follow and read.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.913
And you want to make sure
that's organized as well

00:23:50.913 --> 00:23:53.040
and flows as easily and
smoothly as possible.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.740
Because if you're
making the reader

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.900
do hard work to
decipher and understand

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.390
what they're trying
to see, they're

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.820
going to put the book down.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.950
We don't want that.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.860
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
as he was saying,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.840
these are very, very akin to the
outline that the writer does.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.510
So there are a lot of
changes that can be made.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.247
Again, sometimes you
will get in roughs

00:24:13.247 --> 00:24:15.330
like what Claudia gave us,
and we'll look at them,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:15.970
and it's like, great.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:16.886
Everything is perfect.

00:24:16.886 --> 00:24:19.403
I can't wait to see, blow
this up into an actual page.

00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:20.986
But every once in a
while, it will be,

00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:22.402
oh, no this is in
the wrong place.

00:24:22.402 --> 00:24:25.650
Or you didn't
really-- what I wrote

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.910
did not communicate clearly
what would happen in this panel

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.090
or on this page,
and there will be

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.410
adjustments that would be made.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.670
And usually, that
was not a problem.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.760
And then so once we
receive all of these

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.499
and Jeremy looks at
them as the editor,

00:24:41.499 --> 00:24:43.040
and I look at them
as the co-creator,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.280
and we both give the thumbs up,
then Claudia is off and running

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.190
and starts moving forward.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.990
So this is actually a
closeup of one of the roughs

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.390
that we were just
looking at featuring

00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:00.620
the dusters who, again, came
from my dream, god help me.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.270
And this just shows
you the process

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.080
of going from a rough of a
page actually to the final.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.800
So this was the rough
thumbnail that she

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.330
did, which we scaled up a little
bit for these purposes, which

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.290
then became this.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:22.170
And Claudia works digitally,
so these were her digital inks.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.870
These are her final inks, right?

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.560
And then the next step was
bringing in some color,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.930
which we have there.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.630
And you get a little more of
the depth and otherworldly

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.990
nature of these characters.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.980
And then finally, the
unsung hero of comicdom--

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.864
you get some letters.

00:25:41.864 --> 00:25:43.780
You get some words in
there, a little dialogue

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.410
balloon for this poor guy.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.640
Speaking about dialogue,
I think I might be jumping

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.460
a little bit, but that's OK.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.700
So once the final art
comes in, like I say,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.470
the unsung hero, the
letterer, comes in

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.635
and has to do all
kinds of crazy things.

00:26:03.635 --> 00:26:05.260
JEREMY SALIBA:
Actually, if you go back

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.270
to that rough real
quick-- even further

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.960
back to the page of roughs.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.570
One of the things
that-- he's right,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.130
it's an unsung hero of the
comics world, the workhorse.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.649
Not only do you have to
make room for everything

00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:20.690
to happen on the page,
but you have to leave room

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.489
for dialogue, too.

00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:22.780
That's one of my greatest sins.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.730
Whenever I do a panel or a page,
Brian goes, that looks great,

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.840
but where am I going
to put my words?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.360
And words, who needs those?

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.150
It's the art.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.070
That's what's important.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.790
So it's a phase of the process
that not everyone talks about,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.380
not everyone focuses on.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.900
But it ends up
being-- I don't know,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.890
a large amount of
work, one could say,

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.990
a decent amount of work in
terms of laying out the dialogue

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.996
balloons and choosing a font.

00:26:48.996 --> 00:26:50.870
These days, most lettering
is done digitally,

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.030
and one of those arts that's
getting a little bit more

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.720
homogenized, I guess,
to a certain degree.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.950
But there is a lot of
rules regarding lettering.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.960
And it's something that
can be easily overlooked,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.360
and it's something really
important keep in mind.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.500
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yeah.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.730
In my experience, it
is not uncommon to have

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.290
at least a couple
pages per issue

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.240
come in where I will need
to write back to the artist

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.112
and say, this is gorgeous.

00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:16.820
This is gorgeous.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.410
Can you cheat it down
like 25%, because I've

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.620
got to put the little
dialogue balloon right there.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.140
But oddly enough, one of
the happiest experiences

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.149
I have in making comics is when
a page of art will come in.

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.940
It could be a page.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.170
It could just be a panel.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.690
And I look at it, and I
realize that the artist

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.360
has captured everything
that needed to be said.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.290
So the words that I had
written-- dialogue, caption,

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.860
whatever-- I can
just throw them out.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.110
On the one hand, that's great.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.568
It's just like,
ah, that's awesome.

00:27:44.568 --> 00:27:45.830
You took that away.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.600
That's fantastic.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.183
On the other hand,
it's like, awesome.

00:27:48.183 --> 00:27:51.070
A little less lettering
that I have to do.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.120
Because yes, I did the
lettering for the book as well.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.020
I enjoy it.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.420
It's a sickness.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.230
And so basically, what
we're showing here

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.760
is you can actually--
peeking through those two

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.950
images is a copy of the script.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.030
And that's-- we're just
basically copying the text

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:12.080
right out of there, dropping
it into Adobe Illustrator,

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.410
and making dialogue balloons,
and putting in the words,

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.519
and making it right.

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.310
JEREMY SALIBA: There's
an art to that, too.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.460
Some words need to be bold.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.550
Some words need to be a
little bit more pushed.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.460
Do you change the
color of the dialog box

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.492
to add clarity of who's talking?

00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:27.450
You never want to leave
too much negative space

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.480
around the dialog
in a dialog box

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.040
or a word balloon or a
caption or anything like that.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.418
There's a lot of things
to balance with that, too.

00:28:35.418 --> 00:28:40.846
It's shocking how much needs
to be done with that stage.

00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:42.470
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
then that brings us

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.630
to a little more breakdown
of the various stages

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:53.520
of single pages from the roughs
at the very top, to the inks,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.180
down to the colored and lettered
portions of various pages.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.321
I think this is out
of Issue 3 maybe.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.575
JEREMY SALIBA: As someone
who co-created and edited

00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:08.310
the book, some of these
pages, I remember them

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.350
in the late nights.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.490
Because there can be there
can be a lot of organization

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.400
to do and clarity.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.760
And this is one of the scenes.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.620
Is this from Issue 3
or is this Issue 4?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.435
BRIAN SCHIRMER: 3.

00:29:18.435 --> 00:29:21.460
JEREMY SALIBA: In Issue 3, this
is a shootout that takes place.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.210
And there's a lot of
different characters.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.330
And you try not to have
anything be too superfluous.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.850
You want it to all have
a reason and be there.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.981
And for someone who
maybe goes back and wants

00:29:30.981 --> 00:29:33.230
to re-read the book or look
for something they missed,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.240
I like to give them
something that's there.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.384
So organizing all these
multiple staged elements,

00:29:38.384 --> 00:29:39.800
and where people
move, and does it

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.669
read clearly-- that was
where I was up late a lot,

00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:45.210
looking at these
things and squinting

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.430
my eyes as they watered.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.590
And staring at a screen,
and making sure that,

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.680
hopefully, it all
moved through clearly.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.030
But it can be pretty fun.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.860
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And this
is actually something

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.150
I haven't thought about.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.890
A random page, how
much time do you think

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.890
is spent cumulatively?

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.567
How much time does
she take to do

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:08.025
the roughs, and then how much
time to do the inks, and then

00:30:08.025 --> 00:30:08.540
the colors?

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.287
And the letters are minuscule.

00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:11.870
JEREMY SALIBA: With
her in particular,

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.120
it would be hard
to say for sure.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.036
Typically, most artists,
it takes them a month

00:30:15.036 --> 00:30:16.830
to do a 22-page book.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.711
And some artists are working
16-hour days six days a week,

00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:21.960
and some artists are working
eight-hour days five days

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.072
a week.

00:30:23.072 --> 00:30:25.280
So it depends, because some
people draw a little more

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:25.844
quickly.

00:30:25.844 --> 00:30:27.510
Some people do a
little more graphically

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.950
and have a more simplified,
edited-down style,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.795
where some people go a
lot more illustrative

00:30:31.795 --> 00:30:34.020
and have a lot more
detail into it.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.417
But the rule of thumb in
comics is you've got a month.

00:30:37.417 --> 00:30:39.000
And if you're not
very fast, then that

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.640
means you don't have much of
a weekend or evenings, either.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.859
And if you are a little quicker
or find a way through it all,

00:30:46.859 --> 00:30:48.150
you can get a little more time.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.680
Now, these days
in comics, that's

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.090
a pace that doesn't always
get held for very long.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.800
And artists-- what
they'll run on a book,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.850
if it's an ongoing
series-- something

00:30:55.850 --> 00:31:00.080
like, again, from the big two
or an ongoing image title,

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.670
an artist typically
will go-- you

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.960
see them run for about
six months-- six months,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.379
maybe a year where
they're keeping that pace.

00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:07.420
And then they switch off.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.545
They'll take some time off.

00:31:08.545 --> 00:31:10.770
Another artist
comes in, steps in.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.980
Another very popular
book from Image Comics,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.830
Saga, they do
annual breaks where

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.877
they put out a trade
collected version of it,

00:31:17.877 --> 00:31:18.960
because the artist needs--

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.668
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Which
is kind of becoming

00:31:20.668 --> 00:31:22.520
the norm for the
publisher at this point.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.290
So they'll basically do four,
five, six issues of an arc.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.427
They'll take a break.

00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:29.010
They'll put out the
collected edition,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.140
and then they'll resume,
allowing the artist

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.160
time to get ahead, basically, so
that they don't miss deadlines.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.840
So that everything
comes out as scheduled.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.480
Do you want to talk about
cover process a little bit?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.560
JEREMY SALIBA: Sure.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.850
So the covers-- I have
done covers more often

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.370
than I've done tiers in comics.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.520
So I offered-- said if you guys
need covers, I can do that,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.701
but I'm happy to edit.

00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:58.450
And Claudia was very
gracious and generous

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.730
and said, oh, I would
think that would be great.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.710
So we had a lot of
ideas for covers.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.960
And this is just a small
sampling of some of the ideas

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.269
we explored.

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:07.810
I did more thumbnails
for these books

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.790
than I've done
for any other book

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.331
ever before, because
we really wanted

00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:13.970
to-- the purpose of a
cover is to sell the book,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:14.887
to grab someone's eye.

00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:16.345
If it's sitting on
the shelves, you

00:32:16.345 --> 00:32:17.930
want it to stand
out from the rest.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.710
And we had some great
concepts initially.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.500
We had one where we knew we
were going to have four issues,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.249
so what if we did each
cover was a playing

00:32:23.249 --> 00:32:27.720
card, like a face card,
like jack, king, queen, ace.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.485
And how would we handle that?

00:32:29.485 --> 00:32:31.355
But nothing was
really standing out.

00:32:31.355 --> 00:32:32.980
And usually, thumbnails
are started off

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.050
with just liner value.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.090
So I was referencing
some other ideas.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.330
This was a play off of
the movie The Professional

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.820
up there at the top, and just
staging some different things

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.320
around it.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.260
We weren't hitting it.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.390
Nothing was happening.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.460
And one of the big things
was it wasn't weird enough.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.580
And the iconography of the
West needs to be there.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.710
If I changed away from dusters
and horses and guns and rifles,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:56.880
then it didn't feel
like the West anymore.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.838
But at the same time, it
just felt a little bit

00:32:58.838 --> 00:33:00.990
just too Westerny.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.490
And then I said,
well, I think color

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.090
is going to be the next phase
that we need to think about,

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.010
then.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.489
I needed to sit
down and do color,

00:33:06.489 --> 00:33:08.030
because that's where
I can get weird.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.060
We can keep the Western
iconography intact

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.050
so it's very clearly a Western.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.480
But then if I do psychedelic,
more surrealistic colors,

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.490
then that's going to be
that right combination.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.870
And this particular page--
I did these all in a day.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.710
And normally, I
could do something

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.180
like this in half a day,
but it took me the full day

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.036
to do these, and a
lot of concentration.

00:33:28.036 --> 00:33:30.410
I had to have all the music
off and the door to my office

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.540
closed, and really sit
and think about the ideas

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.660
that I wanted to put down.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.100
And a lot of it-- it's color
theory, warm versus cool colors

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.640
and things like that.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.700
And then from there, it goes to
a lot of feedback and getting

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.110
impressions from people.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.090
So after months of--
really, literally

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.605
months of doing
different thumbnails

00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:50.730
and sending them to Brian,
us going back and forth,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.410
I sent him this and
he went, this is it.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.839
I think he was
very, very excited.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:56.880
There was lots of exclamation
points in the email

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.440
that he sent back in return.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.880
And he said, I think we might
have covers for all the books

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.650
here if look
through them enough.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.900
Some of my favorites just
didn't make the cut, though.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.775
It just doesn't work.

00:34:06.775 --> 00:34:07.781
I like these a lot.

00:34:07.781 --> 00:34:09.739
But everyone is like,
oh, so the Japanese flag?

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.230
Does it take place in Japan?

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.830
As much as I wish
Japan didn't own

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.770
the idea of a white background
with a red circle on it,

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:18.800
they do.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.758
You can't do it without
getting away from that.

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:23.000
So we had to just scrap
those ideas out of hand.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.368
But this is the cover
for the first one.

00:34:25.368 --> 00:34:27.659
This is the cover for the
second one and the third one.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.960
And then the fourth one was a
little bit more of an original,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.270
straight from Brian's
head, I think.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.969
BRIAN SCHIRMER:
These were the four

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:41.110
that we initially went with,
with the original logo that we

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.156
had for the book.

00:34:42.156 --> 00:34:43.530
JEREMY SALIBA: I
loved this logo.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.510
We had this little
hang man game.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:51.900
Because obviously, the real
Ketchum had been hanged.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.030
And what Brian had mentioned
is that at Little Grizzly,

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.969
they had botched his
hanging, and he was

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.900
decapitated when he was hanged.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.180
Yeah.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.550
So it's a fun thing to play
with with the character.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.400
So that was a logo.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.314
That was a logo that
we brainstormed,

00:35:09.314 --> 00:35:10.230
and I really liked it.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.880
But we ended up
going with something

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.280
a bit more streamlined.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.320
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And these were
the final that we went with.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.270
But as Jeremy said,
those first three

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.270
were right from
that one day of him

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.710
sitting down and
brainstorming that about eight

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.080
or 10 different covers.

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:29.660
I hadn't thought
about it in a while,

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.480
but reflecting
back on that, it's

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.900
like, wow, you nailed--
especially those two

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.756
in the middle, I
had seen nothing.

00:35:37.756 --> 00:35:39.630
He did those on that
day, and we carried them

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.740
through to the final.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.680
And that one on the
end, the fourth one,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.013
which is actually going to
be the cover of the collector

00:35:45.013 --> 00:35:47.820
edition, was-- I think
we basically sat down

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.470
and emailed back and
forth saying, OK.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.570
So this is going to be Issue 4.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:52.945
It's going to be
the trade cover.

00:35:52.945 --> 00:35:55.194
I'll probably make a banner
out of it for conventions,

00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:56.670
so it's got to have everything.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.480
How are we going to fit it
all in there and make it cool?

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.310
JEREMY SALIBA: This is where
his generosity comes into play

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.476
in his collaborative aspect.

00:36:02.476 --> 00:36:04.609
It made it easy,
because he showed me

00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:07.150
the compositions that he liked,
and ways we could arrange it,

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.525
more of a triangular
composition.

00:36:08.525 --> 00:36:10.360
Which I always think
of Frank Frazetta

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.026
when I think of
triangular compositions,

00:36:12.026 --> 00:36:13.540
which is a cool way to go.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.655
And the "Star Wars"
poster, the original one's

00:36:15.655 --> 00:36:17.030
kind of a triangular
composition.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.510
It has a lot of elements in it.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.510
And Brian knew he wanted
that crazy cast that

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.230
shows up throughout the
book, all in there as well.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.150
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
then-- basically, hey, we

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.790
did everything.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:30.860
We put it in.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.500
And this is-- God help me.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.630
This is me in a comic
shop in New York

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:45.400
City, Fall of 2015-- that
was last October-- holding

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.980
previews.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.710
So Diamond Distributors is the
one-stop shop comic distributor

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.627
for the United States.

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:54.835
And they have a catalog they
put out every month that

00:36:54.835 --> 00:36:55.970
goes to every retailer.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.090
And your average person
can buy it as well.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.574
And this is the catalog
they use to market books

00:37:02.574 --> 00:37:04.740
as they're coming out,
issues as they're coming out.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.670
And this was my first
time seeing it in print

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.224
and documenting it.

00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:11.890
JEREMY SALIBA: In the
wild, as they say.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:12.990
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
so this is, again,

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.590
what retailers would be looking
at and deciding, hmm, am

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.715
I going to order this book.

00:37:16.715 --> 00:37:19.530
And if so, how many
am I going to get?

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.580
So we did OK.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.730
I'll say that much.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.660
And then-- so there's
previews, which

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.510
was the magazine, catalog.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.900
Then we have reviews
and interviews.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.580
And that's all on the
promotional trail for it

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.750
to get-- first to get
retailers to order the book.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.500
Because it's one thing
to be in a catalog,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.874
but what I didn't
really show you

00:37:43.874 --> 00:37:46.600
on there is the catalog for
previews is over an inch thick.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.183
It's probably about
an inch and a half

00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:49.390
thick on an average month.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.140
So you're competing
with hundreds of pages

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.537
of thousands of other titles.

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:55.370
So we had to get out
there and wave the flag

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.170
in any way we could doing
interviews, doing interviews,

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.710
doing podcasts, sending people
advance previews of the book,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.951
so on and so forth.

00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:07.200
And then eventually putting
together things like this,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.100
where we were taking quotes from
other folks in the industry,

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.450
other writers and artists, other
websites that had covered us.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.400
And then use that for
further marketing,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.770
sending that to both stores and
just putting it on social media

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:28.739
to raise awareness
amongst potential readers.

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.280
JEREMY SALIBA: It's
one of the things

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.070
about comics, too, is that
the retail side of it-- the

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.000
stores themselves are what
dictate what your sales are.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.580
You think it's the neutral
person, the customers going

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.163
to the stores.

00:38:38.163 --> 00:38:40.400
But it's really how
much can you get

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.365
the retailers to
get interested in it

00:38:42.365 --> 00:38:44.690
and assure them that
they'll make money buying

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.340
a lot of copies of your book.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.330
They have small shops.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.490
They're not sitting back in the
back with fat cigars going, ah,

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.120
this is the life, a comic shop.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.910
They have to be very
judicious about what

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.790
books they order, not having too
many not selling or whatever.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.280
So with a new book
like this, they

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.196
tend to be cautious, so
we knew that was going

00:39:01.196 --> 00:39:02.940
to be a big target for us.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.810
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
then once everything

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.230
came to fruition--
this was seconds

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.540
after opening my box of comps,
which every creator gets

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.760
a certain amount of free
copies of their own book.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.207
And this is when--
oddly enough, I

00:39:17.207 --> 00:39:19.665
expected that when this arrived,
when I held it in my hand,

00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:21.080
it's like oh, it feels real.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.960
And I was a little disappointed.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.418
I took it out, and it was like,
it still doesn't feel real.

00:39:24.418 --> 00:39:26.512
This doesn't feel legit.

00:39:26.512 --> 00:39:28.924
And I'm not too sure when that
moment actually kicked in.

00:39:28.924 --> 00:39:30.340
It might have been,
actually, when

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.870
we finally-- when
the book was out,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.190
and we started doing signings.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.810
And some of these are
from the first day

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.900
it came out, and did a signing
in a store in the East Bay.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.450
And then being able to
go out to other shops

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.790
and just seeing it
sitting on shelves.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.470
And occasions like this
where it was actually a staff

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.170
pick with some little
handwritten promotion

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.686
from one of the
workers there, which

00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.561
is always kind of cool
to see it in the wild.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.079
I think that's us.

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:04.870
PRESENTER: Should we
cut to some questions?

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.230
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yeah.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.470
PRESENTER: So thank
you, Brian and Jeremy.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.960
Does anybody have
questions for these guys?

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.220
Anne.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.290
AUDIENCE: Do you have an
international audience?

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.760
The French are into
graphic novels.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.710
BRIAN SCHIRMER:
Short answer, yes.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.710
Longer answer, the
book is already

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.680
out in the United Kingdom.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.490
Image Comics partners
with a company

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.830
down in LA who handles
international rights

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.370
and distribution.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.380
So from what I've
been told, this

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.737
should start happening for
us sometime this summer,

00:40:36.737 --> 00:40:38.570
where they will go in
and they will actually

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.810
do translations of everything,
which I'm very, very eager

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.120
to see.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.500
And I mentioned to the woman
who is the rep for Image Comics

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.362
from this company that
our artist is in Rome.

00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:52.820
And she said, oh,
that'll be great.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.440
I was like, can we set
up a signing in Italy

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.271
and go there and have the
Italian version of "Black Jack

00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:58.770
Ketchum?"

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.390
It would be fantastic.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:03.280
JEREMY SALIBA: (WITH ITALIAN
ACCENT) "Black Jack-a Ketchum."

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.524
BRIAN SCHIRMER: He said it.

00:41:03.524 --> 00:41:04.024
I didn't.

00:41:04.024 --> 00:41:05.345
PRESENTER: Other questions?

00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:07.720
AUDIENCE: About the financing--
you described the process

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.090
from getting a green light.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:12.130
And how does the finance
process, and maybe even

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.000
distribution go, for
the slightly different,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.426
nontraditional Marvel or DC?

00:41:17.426 --> 00:41:19.800
BRIAN SCHIRMER: By and large,
there is no money up front,

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.174
which is also one
of the things--

00:41:21.174 --> 00:41:24.010
when Jeremy said we were
vetting replacement artists,

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.630
we had to basically tell
people, hey, on the plus side,

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.162
if you get chosen, you're going
to have a book from Image.

00:41:29.162 --> 00:41:30.870
The downside is you're
probably not going

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.930
to see any money from
that for several months.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.110
So Image pays on the
back end, which basically

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.300
means the book gets released,
the book gets ordered

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.380
by stores, the
stores pay Diamond,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.250
the distributor, and
then Diamond pays Image,

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.650
and then Image pays us.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.890
So to put it in a
similar perspective,

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.570
the first issue of
"Black Jack Ketchum"

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.580
came out last December.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.450
We didn't get paid
until February.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:42:01.770
And that was over a
year since Claudia

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.960
was approved to be the
replacement artist and almost

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.420
a year and a half from the
moment we got greenlit.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.797
So it can take a while.

00:42:09.797 --> 00:42:12.130
JEREMY SALIBA: It will vary
a little bit from one book--

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.754
obviously with the
big two, it's a job.

00:42:13.754 --> 00:42:15.580
It's a contract,
freelance kind of job,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.730
so you get paid
a rate as you go.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.287
But someone like big names--
we're not quite there yet.

00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:22.370
But with some of the bigger
names in the industry,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.830
they can give a
little money upfront

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.371
to get things going
on for the books.

00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:27.470
But otherwise, the
benefit is that Image

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.610
handles all the production costs
and everything with regards

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.260
to printing and all
that kind of stuff.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.310
And then they take
a flat rate for what

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.730
it costs to print it
out of your profits.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.752
And again, from there,
deals work out individually.

00:42:40.752 --> 00:42:42.710
Sometimes they have a
little bit of percentage.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.880
I don't know if that's
all the time that they

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.130
have a percentage from things.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.830
But ultimately, they handle all
that stuff on the front end,

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.260
and we just work
it out ourselves

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.579
on the back end,
the different rates.

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:55.870
AUDIENCE: I'd love to hear
more of the process of being

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.560
the lead artist but not
the lead illustrator,

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.521
and how you project
manage that and make sure

00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:02.520
it executes your guy's
vision without creatively

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.220
stifling any of your partners.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.707
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah.

00:43:05.707 --> 00:43:08.040
It's funny, because I definitely
had a vision in my head

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:08.810
for everything.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.379
And then Claudia, she's
got a really unique style,

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:13.420
and it's very specific to
her, which was awesome.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.280
We wanted that.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.450
So what it comes down to is the
more academic side of things.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.020
Does it read?

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.690
Does it work?

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.910
Are we crossing the line at
all, those kinds of elements.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.870
So for the most part--
every now and then,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.490
something would be a little
bit more pushed design-wise,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.160
or a little bit more loose,
or a little bit tighter, even,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.304
than maybe I had imagined.

00:43:32.304 --> 00:43:33.970
And I'll have an
initial reaction to it,

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.910
and I'll talk to Brian and
say, hey, does this read?

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:37.660
Does it look good?

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.950
And he'll go yeah, it looks
great, or I'm not sure either.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.510
And then I might even seek out a
few other friends at that point

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.180
and say, look.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.750
Because I don't-- I know
that I have preferences,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.500
and I don't always
trust myself with that.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.842
Because there's a lot of room
for a lot of different styles.

00:43:50.842 --> 00:43:52.800
So I'll seek out especially
people whose tastes

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.120
are different from mine and see
if it reads really well still.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.640
But for the most part, I just
try to keep it as-- in terms

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.510
of perspective and anatomy
and things like that,

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:06.300
as long as it's-- it's hard
to define the cool factor,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.660
but as long as it's cool.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.660
And that's where, I think,
spending the last-- whatever,

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.217
30 years of my
life reading comics

00:44:14.217 --> 00:44:16.800
and going through them all, you
start of get a sense for yeah,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.080
this can play.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.010
I'm the one-- out
of the three of us,

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.141
I was the one who was
most concerned about.

00:44:22.141 --> 00:44:23.890
Are people going to
want to buy this book?

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.340
Brian's writing is
little more esoteric.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.715
He's a little bit
more-- he likes

00:44:26.715 --> 00:44:29.460
to push the boundaries of
realism and things like that.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.261
And Claudia was totally on
board with that and yeah,

00:44:32.261 --> 00:44:32.760
let's do it.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.176
And I was like,
OK, but let's also

00:44:34.176 --> 00:44:36.030
make sure it's
accessible to people.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.270
And yeah, you with your
traditional whatever.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.980
So I would be the one who
leaned that way, I think,

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.870
the most out of the three of us.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.859
So I was the strict
school mistress

00:44:47.859 --> 00:44:50.150
smacking the back with a
ruler or something, and going,

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.320
does this work?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.115
Luckily, though, Brian knows
exactly what he wants out

00:44:54.115 --> 00:44:54.990
of these things, too.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.470
So there would be things
where I'd say, I don't know.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.310
This is a little bit weird.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.250
And he's like, that's
how it's going to be.

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.520
That's part of what
I made this book for.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.350
And I'm smart enough to know.

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.050
Cool.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.110
Awesome.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.217
Then let's do that.

00:45:06.217 --> 00:45:08.050
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Jeremy
and I worked together

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.640
for a long time, and we play
off each other very well.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.260
And so it's always
a challenge to see

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.593
how it's going to be when a
third party gets introduced.

00:45:14.593 --> 00:45:16.590
But Claudia just hit
the ground running

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:23.130
and was just very,
incredibly open to feedback.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.480
I don't think we
ever had any-- fight

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.370
would be a very strong word--
disagreement about anything.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:36.710
She was always-- they
are both of a kind

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.395
that they accept
that they have not--

00:45:39.395 --> 00:45:41.770
they don't know everything,
that they are still learning.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.690
I think they're both kindred
spirits in that, as artists,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.409
they are continually growing and
evolving and listening to what

00:45:47.409 --> 00:45:48.450
other people have to say.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.460
And to have them both being
able to have that dialogue

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.320
was something really
cool to experience.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.790
JEREMY SALIBA: She was amazing.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.880
She was so generous
with everything.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.260
Is it good?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.380
Do you guys like it?

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.640
Is this cool?

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.519
And it was always--
more than anything,

00:46:02.519 --> 00:46:04.310
it was us saying, oh
yeah, this is awesome.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.550
What do you mean is it cool?

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.050
Look at it.

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.650
It's great.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.186
You did a great job.

00:46:08.186 --> 00:46:09.810
So then anytime where
we would be like,

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.150
maybe a little bit-- she'd
be like, oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.720
I did it wrong.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:11.990
No.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.550
Not at all.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.400
Not at all.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.740
But we're thinking maybe
trying something different

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.281
on this page.

00:46:15.281 --> 00:46:17.580
And she would immediately
dive in and do it.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.970
And she was amazing.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.470
In terms of collaborating and
everything and communication--

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:25.540
because she was all the
way in Europe-- tremendous.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.865
Email becomes this insane
thing at that point

00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:32.804
where you have to really be on
that same page, pun intended,

00:46:32.804 --> 00:46:33.470
with everything.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.924
And she was awesome.

00:46:35.924 --> 00:46:37.340
Anytime anything
was going on, she

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.270
would send us a quick email.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.436
Oh, I'm going to-- this day
I have to do this thing,

00:46:40.436 --> 00:46:42.250
so I'll get the
pages to you later.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:43.850
At one point, she
got really sick.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:45.200
I'm not going to be
going as fast right now.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:45.783
We understand.

00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:46.330
You're sick.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.150
Then we'd get a ton
of pages anyways.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.900
Oh, I had to work.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.774
I had to get it done.

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:55.082
So there was no egos in
that side of things, which

00:46:55.082 --> 00:46:56.790
is probably, I guess,
the biggest concern

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.620
in a situation like that.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.240
Well, I think it
should be this way.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.060
And we were all trying
to impress each other.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.667
So I think that made it nice.

00:47:04.667 --> 00:47:06.500
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of feedback, what kind

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.180
of fan engagement
have you gotten,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.650
feedback from your fans?

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.711
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Social media
has been very kind to us.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.260
Twitter was a big one.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.297
Tumblr is a big one.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.595
To a degree, you can actually
measure such things these days

00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:25.970
with when the book
gets announced

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.450
and you start to get a
little press out there,

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.200
people will start
following you on Twitter

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.190
or they'll start
following you on Tumblr.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.800
And then some of
the biggest kicks

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.110
have been since the book-- so
the book came out in December.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.570
It was only four issues long,
so we were done by March.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.690
And then the first show that
I did, a comic convention,

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.310
was Wunderkind down in LA.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.600
And I had my first
Image Comics panel.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.730
And then just having
people come up to us,

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.200
doing signings--
I honestly got--

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.060
I was on the floor
with our other editor,

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.616
and talking to some friends.

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.990
And these two women came up
and tapped me on the shoulder

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.290
and said, oh hey, I
saw you at the thing,

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.873
and I really like
what you had to say,

00:48:10.873 --> 00:48:14.001
and I really enjoy your
book, and yada yada.

00:48:14.001 --> 00:48:16.000
That guy just took things
to another level there

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.910
of fan engagement, if you will.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.180
And I think having our first
signing at the Image Comics

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.890
booth at a convention, and then
showing up there and actually

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:33.369
having a few people in line
was really special, too.

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:35.785
JEREMY SALIBA: It freaks me
out when someone recognizes me

00:48:35.785 --> 00:48:36.409
at conventions.

00:48:36.409 --> 00:48:38.375
Can I get your
autograph, and sign this?

00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:40.000
And you check for
the person behind you

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.125
and all that kind of stuff.

00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:42.440
There's no way.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.860
Are you sure you want me
to ruin what you have here

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.960
with my marker and
pen all over it?

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.700
But it's been really exciting.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.660
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And I
hate to harp back on this,

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.350
but it's a significant
element of making comics

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.310
these days, which is,
it is social media.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.832
And having people contact me
on Twitter and say, oh, hey,

00:49:03.832 --> 00:49:05.290
I read this, and
I really liked it.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.850
Or oh hey, my
great-great-uncle was also

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.290
related in such and such way.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.090
And I work at my
local comic shop,

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.310
and I'm going to push the book.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:17.975
And that's just surreal.

00:49:17.975 --> 00:49:19.850
AUDIENCE: So maybe you
answered this already,

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.550
because that was
kind of my question.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.210
You talk about all
these activities

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.230
other than actually writing
and drawing things that

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.260
are part of what you're doing.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.070
It seems like a cross
between starting

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.360
a small business and
a lifestyle choice

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.740
that you're going to live this
whole life and make this stuff.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.730
What's your favorite
part of all the things

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.660
you have to do to
actually get to the point

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.872
where you have the finished
product, and it's being sold?

00:49:48.872 --> 00:49:50.580
JEREMY SALIBA: Is it
the outline for you?

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.840
You like outlining a lot.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.265
BRIAN SCHIRMER:
I like outlining.

00:49:54.265 --> 00:49:57.500
JEREMY SALIBA: Is it getting
the artwork back and feasting?

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.900
Feasting your eyes?

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.200
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Part
of it-- part of it

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.510
is still, for me, the writing.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.350
I think I realized a few years
ago that I will always write.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:11.730
I tried to quit
writing a few years ago

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.800
and realized I couldn't do it.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800
So there will always be
that sense of discovery,

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.780
and the whole
notion of characters

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.030
taking on a life of their own.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.970
And I'm writing
something, and realize

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.010
that, oh, I thought this person
was going to die on this page.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.300
Well, no.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.360
They're going to say this
and do this and this.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.010
And that's still cool.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.300
But definitely
getting the art back

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.150
and seeing it and
realizing, huh, that's

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.310
not really what I
wanted, but it's

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.280
way better than
what I envisioned.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.030
And that happens a lot.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:43.110
And that's something
where it becomes--

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.760
dare I say it becomes
kind of magical.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.560
It's like, OK, I had
an idea for something.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.520
I wrote it down
into Google Docs.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.840
And someone on the
other side of the planet

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.250
drew something and
sent it back to me

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:56.190
with their interpretation
of what I wrote.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:00.250
And it's better than what I
originally had in my head.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:04.990
That's probably the
most uplifting aspect

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:06.770
of the whole thing,
I would have to say.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:07.900
JEREMY SALIBA: I would say
that on the art side of it,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.840
you have to enjoy just the
process of drawing and painting

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.752
or whatever.

00:51:11.752 --> 00:51:13.460
You have to enjoy it,
because it's a lot.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.650
And if you don't enjoy
sitting down at your desk

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.830
and doing those things, then
you'll end up being bummed.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.830
Because you do it a lot.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.040
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And what you
said is not entirely untrue.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.030
Especially when
it's creator-owned,

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.700
it's not-- even though
we have a publisher,

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.020
it's not too different
from self-publishing.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:34.980
Image is great.

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.300
Image gets a lot done for us.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.384
It spreads us around.

00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:38.300
It gives us promotion.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.595
It's fantastic.

00:51:39.595 --> 00:51:40.970
But we are still
the ones who are

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.492
taking the ball from the very
beginning to the very end.

00:51:43.492 --> 00:51:44.950
One of the things
we didn't mention

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.640
is Image does not have editors.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.750
Image did not weigh in one
iota on content, what the book

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.750
looked like, any of that.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.200
All the choices were left up
to us, even down to the paper

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.340
stock in the comics.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.610
And on the one hand, that's
unlimited freedom, which again,

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:09.340
compared with making films,
is completely different.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.250
But it's also a bit daunting.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.080
It's a lot of
decisions that need

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.470
to be made, sometimes
on a daily basis,

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.420
frequently on a daily basis,
and sometimes several in a day.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.600
So it's a level of
commitment that I

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.562
think somebody really needs to
have to make something happen.

00:52:24.562 --> 00:52:26.520
JEREMY SALIBA: As much
as Image does, they also

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.603
have a lot of other books.

00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:30.960
And you could just rely on
them solely to promote it.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.750
And hopefully that
works out well.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.750
Or you can dig in and
say, well, let's go ahead

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:37.820
and do some of our own,
too, to really make

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.170
the most out of this.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:45.750
And that ties into, I think, the
belief that you did a good job,

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:48.060
the pride you have in a
product that you made,

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.550
and saying, I like this.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:50.920
This is really good.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.820
I think it's worth
getting in people's faces

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.782
about, posting it on
media feeds, and saying,

00:52:54.782 --> 00:52:57.240
I think you should buy this
book, because it's really cool.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.930
I'm very modest with
that kind of stuff.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.638
I don't ever say, oh,
look at my artwork.

00:53:00.638 --> 00:53:01.910
I have a hard time with that.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.590
But with this book,
I really liked it.

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:04.798
I thought we did a great job.

00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:08.076
So that was a fun element.

00:53:08.076 --> 00:53:08.950
PRESENTER: All right.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:09.670
That's our time.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.350
Thank you, Brian and
Jeremy, for coming in today.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.752
And if you're on Livestream,
thanks for tuning in.

00:53:14.752 --> 00:53:15.710
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Thanks.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.610
Thank you.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.960
[APPLAUSE]
