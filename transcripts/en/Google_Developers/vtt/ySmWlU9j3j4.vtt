[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.364
This might look familiar.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.335
You've got a different
tool for every task.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.860
Firebase can help you
simplify, making it easier

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.240
to create an app with
features that work together,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:37.375
all in one place, packaged
into a single SDK.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.670
With Firebase, you'll
get real support

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.639
so you can build
faster and focus on

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:48.805
the things that matter most.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.250
Develop your app
across platforms

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.830
on iOS, Android, and the web.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.830
But we know success starts
with your first users,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.460
so we've got tools for this too.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:17.600
Firebase Crash Reporting helps
you make your app stronger,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.350
with the details you need
to fix the trickiest glitch.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.070
And at its core,
Firebase Analytics

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.300
gives you more insight so you
can act on the latest trends

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.390
and stay close to
your users, growing

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.890
with them into the millions.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.000
It's app success made simple
for whatever you're building.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.270
Develop, grow, and
earn with Firebase.
