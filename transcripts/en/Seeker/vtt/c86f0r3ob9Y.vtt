00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.800
Have you ever wanted to go to Mars but just
couldn’t find the time?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.260
Well, you might be in luck!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.450
Hey guys, Julia here with DNews.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.640
People continue to be fascinated with Mars,
with numerous planned missions from the US,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.470
Russia and China as well as private companies
preparing to colonize the Red Planet.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.779
But, it’s not that easy, getting to Mars
takes money, fuel and well, time.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.779
How much time?

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.980
Well, not taking into account developing technology,
training crews, and the fact that the Earth

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.059
and Mars are constantly moving, forcing missions
to have to wait until the two planets are

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.260
at an optimal alignment, the distance from
here to there is really far and the journey

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.239
takes a really long time.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.670
The average distance between Earth and Mars
is about 140 million miles (225km.)

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.760
And let's say we send the fastest spacecraft
we’ve ever launched, NASA’s New Horizons,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.850
on a mission to Mars.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.000
If it maintained its launch speed of 36,000
mph, which it wouldn’t, the journey would

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.489
still take 162 days.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.890
That is a lot of time for something to go
wrong.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.059
So what if I told you that in the near future
we might be able to do that exact same journey

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.329
in just three days?

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.509
Sounds impossible, right?

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.229
But it very much could be a reality all thanks
to photon driven propulsion.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.390
A paper written by physicist Philip Lubin
titled A Roadmap to Interstellar Flight outlines

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.640
this technology and how we can use it to further
explore the universe.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.329
Currently NASA uses chemical propulsion, or
burning fuel to accelerate and launch their

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.500
spacecraft.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.520
Photon propulsion is an idea that would use
light particles, called photons, instead.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.229
It is similar to the idea of solar sails that
use light rays from our sun, which bounce

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.729
off a reflective surface, creating a small
amount of energy that propels the craft forward.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.299
But instead of the sun, this plan would use
a hypothetical space laser that would be launched

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.909
into orbit around Earth.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.510
The laser, in theory, would be powerful enough
to project the craft, which is currently proposed

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.649
as a wafer thin vessel, to interstellar speeds.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.609
Lubin suggests this could propel small vessels
to 26% the speed of light.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.799
And even though this project is similar to
a solar sail, it’s also very different.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.820
Light from a laser will be highly concentrated,
opposed to the light coming off our massive

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.539
sun, which gets weaker the farther away it
travels.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.700
A concentrated laser beam would effectively
be more efficient at long distances in order

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.910
to propel an object faster and further.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.720
So, all this means we can start sending people
to Mars over a long weekend, right?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.800
Well, not any time soon.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.590
Even though the math might be there to prove
this theory, the size of this project would

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
be expensive.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.280
That’s why Lubin proposes to start small,
and eventually scale up to one day accommodate

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.030
manned photon propulsion flights.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.290
But keep in mind the name of his paper, A
Roadmap to Interstellar Flight.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.319
He is thinking bigger than Mars.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.010
Photon propulsion would be able to send small
crafts to the farthest reaches of the universe

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.659
with no fuel to worry about and in a fraction
of the time currently possible.

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.310
That would mean the ability to visit and document
other stars and exoplanets.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.940
In fact, Lubin calculates it would only take
17 years to send a small craft to Alpha Centauri,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.940
the closest star system to us, about 4 light
years away.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.310
Again, this isn’t science fiction, Lubin
is currently working on proton propulsion

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.190
with NASA in a program called DEEP IN, or
Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.190
Exploration.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.190
And others have been working on the idea of
photon propulsion.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.190
Dr. Young Bae, who is also working with NASA
on photon propulsion actually has a video

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.190
showing a one pound weight moving across a
track using just light from a laser.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.300
But there is still a lot of obstacles to overcome
to achieve intergalactic space travel.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.531
Like how to slow down something traveling
that fast, how to send back data from 4 light

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.760
years away and creating a laser strong enough
to make this all possible.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.209
But for now, let’s just sit back and dream
of a world where you can send a care package

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:36.739
to your friend living on Mars in 3 days or
less.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:48.750
So, where would you send a probe to if you
didn’t have to worry about how long it would

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.750
take?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.119
