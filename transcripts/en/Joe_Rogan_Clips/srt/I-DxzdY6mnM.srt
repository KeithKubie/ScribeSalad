1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,100
Hello freak bitches. This
fights about to go down.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,220
[inaudible] what do you think Eddie?
Bravo initial thoughts. I don't know.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,900
Does Luke Rockhold get the same guy after
getting CalEd by Bisping? It's a hard,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,110
hard one to call. Been a long time
outside the octagon. Jim Norton,

5
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,350
what do you think? You're the host of
UFC uncensored on taking David Branch.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,130
Woo new Yorker goes to the new Yorker,
David Branch moving towards him,

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,320
dropping some shots. Luke Rockhold
is got a powerful left kick. Yeah,

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,770
strong left kick. And he landed at
a few times to the body already.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,920
It's a legit kick and he
catches you with it way outside.

10
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,110
And Luke Rockhold super hard to take down.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,400
He trains all the time with Daniel
Cormier. [inaudible] and Cain Velasquez.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,890
He's got all these monster
wrestlers over there.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,070
How be you've never got mad off and you
think branch wants to take him down?

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,110
He might. He's got a
very good ground game.

15
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:56,520
He sends a black spinning
sidekick. Kayla finish.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,721
Is that? No,

17
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,280
he got wheel kicked in the head by
[inaudible] Belfort and then he got um,

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:03,840
uh,

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,290
Chris Weidman tried to wheel kick him and
he took Weidman to the ground and beat

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,750
the fuck out of him. And that was
the beginning of the end right there.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,450
It was crazy cause up until that, it
was like a really competitive fight.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,800
Branches Cirque doing a
good job of circling to his
leftover boy that left kick.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,280
He's not old, but he landed it right
there. Branch is doing a real good job.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,790
Oh he's, he's putting Rockhold
in danger and Rockhold

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,960
he teed off on him. Oh my
God. Rockwell is in trouble.

26
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,900
This is a real fight and he's, Oh
my God, he's taking Rockhold down.

27
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,850
That's how you know
Rocco's in big trouble.

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,780
I brought you super hard to take
down, should have stayed standing AB,

29
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,520
but he lets him know you can take
them down. God damn, this is legit.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,940
And he just looked over at his
friend and waved and said I'm okay.

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,480
Or his coach his corner.
But it didn't look okay.

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,170
He got hit with bombs,
man. You never, okay.

33
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,990
When you get hit with those kinds of
bombs, you might not have gone out,

34
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,670
but you're not okay. She's a fucking
ham. I may so much different than boxing.

35
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,900
These two fights.
Highlight it like you do.

36
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,950
You guys barely know who Mike Perry
is, right? Yeah. But meanwhile,

37
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:11,400
he's so invested in that fight.
Chaos. Right? And this fight,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,960
this is fucking chaos in
so many different ways.

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,680
One 18 to one 10, I'm not going to
let's get a room or a fucking weekend.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,740
Adelaide Burj is a very nice lady.
I can't say anything terrible,

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,750
but that's where it is.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,940
She's always very pleasant. She
always waves and says hello.

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,200
I mean just cause I don't think
I agree with her in boxing. Yeah.

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,190
Not mad at lady.

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,820
Do judges get removed for poor officiating
to good questions that ever happened?

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
Well, back in the old days,

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,680
the Nevada state athletic commission
wasn't being run very well. Um,

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,980
Bob Bennett, the guy who runs it now
as an animal, he's, he's on the ball.

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,970
He's really good.

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,380
And he's really smart and he's just
a real easy guy to talk to too.

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,110
And you know he wants
to commission though.

52
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,660
Right now he's Devonish date at same.
Same. It's the same thing. Yeah, he's,

53
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,130
yeah. He handles all that stuff,

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,800
so most likely he'll probably
be looking into that. That's,

55
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,780
do they ever get booted
though? If it's not corruption,

56
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,420
if they literally just think this
guy sucks and making decisions,

57
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,860
do they ever get kicked out? Like
you've fucked up too many times?

58
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,610
It's a good question. I don't
know enough about boxing about,

59
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,550
I know when there's a bad decision
and I know names that I keep hearing,

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,740
but it's not like I know a MMA judges
that was a T. that's a disgraceful score.

61
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,520
Disgraceful. I agree. And
has she had an another? Yeah,

62
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,430
they're just terrible decisions in
terms of what I think about the call.

63
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,790
Ooh, look out for the Nissan I,
he's trying to trip branch down.

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,430
Luke Rockhold super strong, super strong.

65
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,490
Top game branch might be
fade and had been here. Nope.

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,550
Branch still looking at wings, some shots.

67
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,030
One of the things that branch thought
was a big factor in this fight was his

68
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:52,020
boxing, but he's got to avoid those
kicks. Especially the left one man,

69
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,620
the left one's the big one for Rocco
and he'll do it off the switch. Ooh,

70
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:56,700
that's a nice bright light kick.

71
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,760
He'll do it off the switch
and he's got a nasty question.

72
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:03,450
Mark kick is question Mark kick is what
he used to crack Bisping with cause he

73
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,210
hits you with the body shots like
over and over and over again,

74
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,500
and then he gets your reaching.

75
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,480
So he throws one like this to the body
and then at the last minute he whips it

76
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:16,080
around over the top. He's nasty
with that. Really good with that.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,460
It's like one of his best techniques

78
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,050
that in his left power kick that left
power kick to the body. It's just so good.

79
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,290
He stopped Casa Philipo with
that left body kick as well. Oh,

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,950
we went jumping round, kicking. Nice
straight left. He said, no, no, no, no.

81
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,510
He certainly looks like he recovered.
Yeah, he recovered for sure. Oh,

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,600
he just clipped David Branch
with a right hook. Look,

83
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,510
Rockhold does not want to go out
like that. Bisping fight. See,

84
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,780
here's the clinch, what you're
talking about. Yeah. See,

85
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,650
it's just way harder to pull off.

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,910
This is too much scrambling in MMA
and looking for take downs and stuff.

87
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:56,830
Look at that. Recruit crock hold, get
in the back, get in the back. Oh shit.

88
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,230
David Branch almost goes down. Oh, Luke
Rockhold on top. Very dangerous on top.

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,410
Super strong and branch
is tired as fuck man.

90
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,630
Rockhold looks like a surgeon here.

91
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,820
Branch is doing a good
job at protecting them.

92
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,430
One thing Rockwell has got
to watch out for is his legs.

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,560
What branches from the
Henzel Gracie school?

94
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,190
What's his motive and put him up against
the cage. When he's smashing a wall,

95
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:27,690
they can't move. He wants to just hold
them somewhere. Ooh, look up. Not makeup

96
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,290
dude. What do that shit
[inaudible] yeah, just smash them.

97
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,870
Rockhold came on strong
towards the end of that round.

98
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,140
There's nothing more claustrophobic than
washing that when someone's mushed up

99
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,370
against the cage like that. A
a, it could be a Johnson fight.

100
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,660
That's probably the most claustrophobic
I've ever been watching your fight.

101
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,840
That was one of the worst ones over.

102
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,990
There's an a to smashing a guy
against that fence for sure.

103
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,560
Keeping him there and land in shots and
wearing them out and just smashing them.

104
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,090
It takes you back to
when you're 10 years old.

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
That's how I got beat up when I was a kid.

106
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,710
Like you're just helpless
in a corner. Dude.

107
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:03,170
That happened to me when I was 14
that's why I started wrestling.

108
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,250
This guy took me down in the locker room
and he was like gonna punch me in the

109
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,220
head, but he decided not to because it
was so easy for him to take me down.

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,210
He just grabbed me in a headlock. I
didn't even know if we were fighting.

111
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,350
Like I didn't know what was going on.

112
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:19,460
Like we were looking at each other and
he was talking some shit and I wasn't

113
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,920
exactly sure like what we're going to
do and then all of a sudden we were

114
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,890
grabbing each other and he just got me
in a headlock and threw me on the ground

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,040
and held me there and could
easily punch my face in.

116
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,920
To this day I owe him a debt of
gratitude. Changed your life.

117
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,400
He did change my life cause he
made me realize like, Oh my God.

118
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,830
And then I had a friend,
my friend Steven Arduino,

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,030
he was a wrestler in high school
and I was already doing uh,

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,060
martial arts then and I just had no idea
how easy it was for someone to take me

121
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,720
down. And we went outside, we went
outside on the grass and it was like,

122
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,330
I could take you down easy. I was like,
no, you can't. And he's like, boom.

123
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,530
I was like, fuck that. Try again.
Boom. I was like, Oh my God,

124
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:58,550
I got to start wrestling.

125
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,530
So those two events led me to wrestling
class in high school and I was terrible.

126
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,810
I was probably one of the worst
wrestlers in high school history.

127
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:08,840
I got one one take down. I
would never take anybody down.

128
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,450
I was always afraid that I was
going to catch a knee in my teeth.

129
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,380
So I would just brawl on dudes that took
down. Oof. They tried to take me down.

130
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,860
That was my game plan. But regular
people, when I'd get in a fight,

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
I would take them down and I
always felt like I was cheating,

132
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,800
but I didn't care cause you use
wrestling. I go, you know what?

133
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,050
I don't give a fuck if someone
fucks with me. I'm a double leg. Um,

134
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,600
and then I'd get like twister
cyclotron punch their stomach.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,340
I did that to a soccer player. He
was talking shit in school and um,

136
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,990
I took him down. [inaudible] think that
it would be cheating. I thought it was,

137
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,870
I didn't think it was real fighting
back then. So when I saw hoists,

138
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,000
when I saw hoists and nosy
too, I'm like, Oh shit,

139
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,880
you could take dudes down and
fight. That's, that's legit.

140
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,160
He's hurting that leg. By the way.
Rockhold is really hurting that leg.

141
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,800
Bolt guys are hurting the
legs. Rockhold has been landed.

142
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,480
A bunch of hard leg kicks on branch
two. This is a serious fight. No,

143
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:58,130
that's what I mean. He's been, he's
been hurting branches like, Oh yeah,

144
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:01,520
but rock holds her to men. This
is a, this is a real fight.

145
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,960
Very good fight. Is it funny now?

146
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,500
Like a fight where two guys take each
other down. It's like totally standard.

147
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,040
Like you had no kids today would
ever think that would be cheating.

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,570
Like that's how you fight motherfucker.

149
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,610
If someone takes someone
down like Oh shit,

150
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,310
ground and pound kids know
the moves so I can draw.

151
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,380
Oh you guys I see fight videos.

152
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,290
Just street five videos where someone
takes him down and they tap like that's

153
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,550
like the understood moving now.
That's hilarious. But it, look,

154
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,520
if people can tap in street fights, the
world would be a better place. Yeah.

155
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,640
Because if somebody leaves you alone
after you tap and they let it alone,

156
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,640
like you two guys agree to fight
and then someone taps in there,

157
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:42,020
the guy respects the tap. That's
good. That will, that opens. Yeah.

158
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,510
I hope it does. I hope
it happens more often.

159
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
I guess it all depends on what push your
fight to begin with though. Yeah, sure.

160
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,590
You're not signing the contracts. I've
got fucked your chin. Yeah, exactly.

161
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,050
Exactly. Boom.

162
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,440
And what's some of the craziest shit is
girls fighting? Cause it's so primal,

163
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,360
especially when they
don't know how to fight.

164
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,060
And that grabbing hair and
just screaming come off

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,420
a law's wailing at each other.

166
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,480
See the thing about Rockhold is he's so
used to this shit cause he's in the gym

167
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,860
with D C and Kane doing this.
So like there's very few guys,

168
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,760
they're going to have the kind of clinch
game that Rockhold is going to have and

169
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,480
the kind of grappling like grinding
skills that Rockhold is going to have

170
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,440
because he's been doing it with
these fucking monsters. Yeah,

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,510
I mean Ron was past, he's like,

172
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,520
Oh there's a lot of time left to
full Mount cha not good for branch.

173
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,420
Super bad for branch. Let's see if he
gives up his back and trying to get out.

174
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,070
That's, that's super dangerous.
Don't panic. Let's see if he panics.

175
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,090
He's got to figure out a way to
defend himself. Oh look at this.

176
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,930
He's giving up his back. He's
given us back. Give it up his back.

177
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,030
It's going to handcuff him. Oh, he got
that back. Oh, flat place to base flat.

178
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,300
This is terrible branches
in a world of shit. Dude.

179
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,640
Rockhold does this to
everybody, man. Yeah.

180
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,490
He gets on top of you and he just
smashes you. It's so impressive.

181
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,210
Look at his top-mount. No,
he did it to, um, uh, uh,

182
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,590
the Odo Leo Machida. Oh, Bryson Futura
wheel kicked him in the head. Remember?

183
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,320
Oh, that's right dude.
Ranches at serious trouble.

184
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,200
He's going to flatten them out.
That's a serious mountain man.

185
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,150
That back Mount is out of control.

186
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,220
His Mount and his back Mount or sees his
top game. It's just fucking ferocious.

187
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,130
Oh, branch has done. He's done. Did the,

188
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,000
he's just covering up Dan's
give him a lot of chances here,

189
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,480
but he's taken a fucking bad
beat. Tap, tap, tap, tap,

190
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,340
tap the strikes.

191
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,910
Tap the strikes. Great fight. Fuck
yeah. That was a great fight, dude.

192
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:53,240
Brock holds top game. Might be
the best in the fucking division.

193
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,170
He might be better than Romero. He
might be better bloodshot, right? Yeah.

194
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:00,410
He's a black belt under who? I don't
know. I don't know who they're. Um,

195
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,120
it's not, um, Oh, it's an
AKA Dave camera. Rio Cameleo.

196
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,460
How long has he been find out? It's
forever. Was still in AKA? No, I think,

197
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,790
but a lot of guys train with them still.
A lot of guys still go over there.

198
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah, we'll throw it to somebody. That's
a joy. Would you suck on that? No,

199
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:22,370
I wouldn't. Would you put it in your
mouth? No, I wouldn't. Girls would.

200
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,160
Some girls would. Some girls want
to get pregnant with that. Spit

201
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,820
get you pregnant. I used
to depend on the fighter.

202
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,720
Boom. I got a text message from
Vinny Shoreman fucking Adelaide bird.

203
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,613
Again,

204
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,980
a lot of people are aware that Allie
birds does know the best decisions. Boom,

205
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,150
boom, boom, boom. She's trending.
Jamie knows who's trending.

206
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,410
Would you ever know who's
trending? Never. Not. You never.

207
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,400
Would you ever had any idea
ever who's trending or was that,

208
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,110
would you ever have any idea who's
trending? No. SAS. Jamie. Oh,

209
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,490
that's Justin Bieber's look. Trending.
Trending is, he's still on top.

210
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,380
Can't you try two different ways to like
locally like I've had guys go, dude,

211
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:14,260
you're trending, but I'm not. It's
like a fucking local, like in Jersey.

212
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm trying to compare it to other
Jersey people. Nice. Which is,

213
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,900
how does that work? How do you, how
do you train in Jersey? I don't know.

214
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,490
There's a way to do it location wise.

215
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,370
Like when it gets your hopes up and
utilize all snowing fucking cares.

216
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,140
Luke rock hold put the beat
down. But I'll tell you what man,

217
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:33,490
David Branch made it a scrap made a scrap
for the beginning till Luke Rockhold

218
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,080
wore on him with that pressure,
that clench and that wrestling too.

219
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,050
I'm telling you man, all
those years with Cain and DC,

220
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,410
I mean you don't get any better wrestling
than that. You don't get any better,

221
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,300
more Savage, big giant dudes
than those two. Think about it.

222
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,310
Olympic class wrestler and the arguably
arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight

223
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,020
ever. Well who puts,

224
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,290
who helps cane like that cause he's
obviously he's heavier than [inaudible].

225
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,480
Not much. Not much. DC walks around
all the time at two 35 to 40.

226
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,410
You know, he'll,

227
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,670
he even said he was feeling kind of
slim like this time after the fight.

228
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:13,780
You know, we did commentary last
weekend and he said, uh, he was a,

229
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,190
usually he'd be at like two 35 by
now, but uh, he was lighter than that.

230
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,590
I think you'd be like two 15 or
two 20 or something like that.

231
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,250
But he'll get up to two 35 so
he canes two 40 so in there,

232
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,450
in the neighborhood of each other,

233
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,110
like five pounds difference with a
world-class grappling like those two guys

234
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:33,160
have. They just go on war constantly.
Always a problem though for big guys guys.

235
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,170
Two 50 and above finding training
partners. Sure. Tough jujitsu schools,

236
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,950
man. It's tough. We don't have
very many big guys we got right now

237
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,280
in my class, I think the
biggest guy pro 200 pounds.

238
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,880
It's crazy. What a fight man. Huh?

239
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,650
I'm not crazy Luke Rockhold I'll tell
you dude, when that guy gets people down,

240
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,180
they're not getting up. He has
one of the best fucking top games.

241
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,410
You don't see a lot of tap outs due to
strikes. A lot of people don't do it.

242
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,244
They don't believe in it.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,830
A lot of people have said
that like that's a bitch move.

244
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,980
I don't think it is
even even a little bit.

245
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:17,860
I think it's a smart move when you're
getting hit and you're getting fucked up

246
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,900
and you know you're not
going to recover, you know,

247
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,500
and the fights over does no need to
take extra shots if you know that you're

248
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,340
done, just tap. But it's seen as a
bitch. They see fighters say this.

249
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,040
Well a lot of people
like George Saint Pierre.

250
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,580
That's one of the things that BJ Penn
was taunting him about how he tapped his

251
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,950
strikes against Matt. When Matt beat him,

252
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,180
Matt beat the shit out of him and clipped
him with a big right hand early gun on

253
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:44,350
top of him, banged out and then
GSP tapped strikes and BJ was like,

254
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,610
I would never tap the strikes,

255
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,260
but really maybe some of those career
fights he should have. You know,

256
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,560
you got nothing left. Why
not? Yeah, I'm going to get

257
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,170
the more you still can get
out of what is my client.

258
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,740
This is my fight and I'll be there soon.

259
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,800
Okay. That sounds a bit, I don't know.
That's some bad trash. Again, it's a,

260
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,270
it's Bisbing cause he's
saying it's his fight.

261
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,120
I think he feels he should be
fighting for the belt nuts. GSP. Yup.

262
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,630
Yeah. I want to be patient. Like I said,

263
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,450
Oh man. You getting credit for taking
that and, and so I in the first round,

264
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,790
yeah, he was in trouble, dude.
He was in trouble for sure.

265
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,810
That Thai clinch stopped the strikes.
Yep. This, this is what stops everything,

266
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:32,310
man. His fucking smush game. Look at
that step over Mount may no resistance.

267
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,070
And getting that Mount,
he just overwhelmed.

268
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,420
Branch branches couldn't
keep up that pace. You know,

269
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,440
Luke rock holds, I mean, he's
the reason why he was the champ.

270
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,240
He's fucking world-class

271
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,453
in November,

272
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,680
November Madison square garden.

273
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,433
[inaudible]

274
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,730
wow. He's so, he's telling
GSP to back out. Yeah.

275
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:01,450
[inaudible].
