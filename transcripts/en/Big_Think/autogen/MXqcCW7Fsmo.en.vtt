is a correlation and probably the reason

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420
is a correlation and probably the reason
 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.790
is a correlation and probably the reason
for that is because again the

shown this link between germophobia and
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.400
shown this link between germophobia and
xenophobia so for example there was a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
xenophobia so for example there was a
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.680

paper actually it's about to be
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.849
paper actually it's about to be
published and I think they looked at two

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859
