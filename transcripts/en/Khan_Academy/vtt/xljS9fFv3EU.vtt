00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:04.651
- The cost of safely disposing
of the toxic chemicals

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.224
is approximately five times

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:10.881
what the company paid to purchase it.

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.901
And maybe we have no error.

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.377
So this first part reads
a little bit weird,

00:00:15.377 --> 00:00:16.171
but I think it's right.

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:16.640
Let's see.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.362
The cost of safely disposing
of the toxic chemicals.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.442
Yeah, there's a lot of of's
there, but I think that's right.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.242
I mean, we could have said
the cost of disposing of,

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:27.062
and this safely is just an adverb

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:28.698
describing how we're disposing.

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:29.752
We're safely disposing.

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:30.668
So this seems reasonable.

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:33.660
The cost of safely disposing
of the toxic chemicals.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.385
It's a little bit a lot of wordy.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.842
It's got the of's there,
but it doesn't seem wrong.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.202
The cost of safely disposing of

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.592
the toxic chemicals is approximately.

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:46.162
So we're talking about the cost.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.942
So it's a singular subject,

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:51.895
and so it makes sense that we
would use is right over here.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:52.780
We'd use the singular verb.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.482
The cost is approximately five times

00:00:56.482 --> 00:01:00.862
what the company paid to purchase it.

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.463
Now this it is a little bit fishy.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.522
What is this it referring to?

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:09.866
Is this it referring to the cost?

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.189
Is it referring to the cost?

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:12.742
No.

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:16.122
The it, I think, based on
the meaning of the sentence,

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.702
they're referring to the chemicals.

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:23.045
The company paid to
purchase the chemicals.

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.620
So this right over here
should be the chemicals.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.204
The chemicals, or if they
want to use a pronoun,

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:33.761
this is a plural noun right
over here, the chemicals,

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.328
you would use to purchase them.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.761
You would use to purchase them.

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.202
You wouldn't use it right over here.

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:43.081
What did they purchase?

00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:47.341
They purchased the toxic chemicals.

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.230
So it's plural.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.701
So you would either say
to purchase the chemicals

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.181
or to purchase them.

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:57.181
So let's just read it with them.

00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.501
The cost of safely disposing
of the toxic chemicals

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.161
is approximately five
times what the company paid

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:04.581
to purchase them.

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:05.761
Yeah, that makes a little bit more sense,

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.517
or if you want to be very clear,

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:08.421
you could just write the chemicals there.

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.201
The cost of safely disposing
of the toxic chemicals

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:14.701
is approximately five
times what the company paid

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.101
to purchase the chemicals.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.801
Yeah, that makes it, at least in my mind,

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.821
that's how I would have written
it, making it very clear.
