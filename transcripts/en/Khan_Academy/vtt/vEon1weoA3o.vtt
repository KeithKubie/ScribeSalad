00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Instructor] Nkechi took a random sample

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.340
of 10 countries to study fertility rate.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.160
And life expectancy.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.710
She noticed a strong
negative linear relationship

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.980
between those variables
in the sample data.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.570
Here is computer output

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360
from a least-squares regression analysis

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.260
for using fertility rate

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.460
to predict life expectancy.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.480
Use this model to predict the
life expectancy of a country

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.120
whose fertility rate is
two babies per woman.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.360
And you can round your answer

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.750
to the nearest whole number of years.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.583
So pause this number

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:28.416
and see if you can do it,

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.420
you might need to use a calculator.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.320
All right now let's do this together.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.440
So in general,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.010
this computer output is actually
giving us a lot of data,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.640
more than we need actually,
to do this prediction.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.420
But it's giving us the data we need

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.740
to know the equation
for a regression line.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.540
So the general form of a regression line,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.440
a linear regression line would be,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.590
our estimate,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.880
and that little hat means
we're estimating our y value,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.250
would be equal to our y-intercept

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420
plus our slope, times our x value.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.010
Now in this situation,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.700
we're using fertility to
predict life expectancy.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.100
Or let me circle all of life expectancy.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920
So the thing that we're trying to predict,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130
that is y, life expectancy.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.810
And fertility, is the thing

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.060
that we're using to predict that.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750
So that is going to be
our x, right over there.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.420
Now what are a and b?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.540
Well, our computer output gives us that.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.110
It's these numbers right over here.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.460
Our constant coefficient
right over here, this is a.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.743
And our slope, is going
to be negative 5.97.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.120
You could view it as the
coefficient on fertility.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.800
Remember, this right
over here, is fertility.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800
You could even write,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.570
rewrite this as

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.563
our estimated life expectancy,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.340
estimated life expectancy.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.370
I could put a little hat on it

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.780
to show this is estimated life expectancy,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.750
is going to be equal to 89.70

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.890
minus 5.97

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.650
times fertility,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.560
times fertility rate.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.300
I'll just call it, say fert.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.990
And period, right over there.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.770
Notice, this is the
coefficient on fertility,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.860
and then this is the constant coefficient.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.970
We could do that right over there.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.520
And now, we can use this to
estimate the life expectancy

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.900
of a country whose fertility
rate is two babies per woman.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.870
For fertility, you just put a two here.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.460
And then you get your
estimated life expectancy.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.570
So what's that going to be?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.970
We can get out a calculator.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.220
So we can say,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.330
5.97

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.910
times two is equal to that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.120
and then we wanna subtract that from,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.660
so put in a negative there,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.700
and add that to 89.7

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.760
is equal to,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.810
and we wanna round to the
nearest whole number of years,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.880
so that's approximately 78 years.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.570
So this is approximately

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.750
78 years.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.970
And we're done.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.680
And just to be clear
what even happened here,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.253
is that Nkechi, she did a regression,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.800
on the x-axis with fertility,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.633
fertility,

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.100
on the y-axis is

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.080
let's call it l period dot e period.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600
That's our y-axis.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.000
Took 10 data points,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.070
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.320
Put a regression line on,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.153
try to fit

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.740
try to fit a regression line.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.200
Saw a negative linear relationship,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.950
and then using this
regression line to estimate,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.560
hey, if fertility is,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.750
let's say this is two right over here,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.620
what is the estimated life expectancy?

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.503
And we just saw that that
would be roughly 78 years.
