00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.590
JOEL: I just wanted to
introduce you to Brad.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.050
He's a friend of a former
Google manager of mine,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.250
and we connected.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.990
Brad has worked in
the technology space,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.350
but has a background in
the liberal arts space,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.980
so got roped in,
became a coder, and has

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.190
been doing all sorts of
great projects since then.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.680
He's coming back to his roots
in terms of this liberal arts

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.970
and wrote this book.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.380
It has a technology slant in
it, so really applicable to us.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.530
Something I read recently
of Brad's, he did this Op Ed

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.900
in "New York Times" about
how technology and art

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.660
and the humanities really
need to go together

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.220
for successful outcomes.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.820
I think, at Google,
we talk about how

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820
diversity is important.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.730
And we think of
diversity in terms

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.090
of male/female,
different backgrounds.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.910
But certainly, one of the
kind of diverse backgrounds

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.940
we can think about at
Google is this idea

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.650
of not just I grew up,
learned a lot of math,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.600
started, got CS degree
and came to Google.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.990
But maybe there's different
ways people can get to Google

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.080
and provide good computer
science without necessarily

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.310
that CS degree.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
And hopefully, we can ask Brad
some questions about that.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.822
So without further ado, I'd like
to give the time over to Brad.

00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:33.030
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: Thank you.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
Thanks, Joel.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.180
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.230
Thanks for your patience.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.029
So I'm going to--
the good news is I

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:42.320
won't be reading from an Op Ed.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.140
I'm going to be reading
straight fiction.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.120
So you can close your eyes,
hopefully get somewhat absorbed

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.310
in the story.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.520
As Joel said, I--
one of the, I guess,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.522
animating ideas for
me for this book,

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:56.980
which is called
"The Adventurist"--

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.313
I guess I'm supposed to,
should I hold it up and plug it

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:04.880
properly-- is the fact that,
in a lot of the reading I had

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.990
done, I did not see much in
literature that really made

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.050
much in the way of attempting to
depict the work world that many

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.630
of us certainly in this room,
but collectively as a country

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.130
inhabit.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.430
I think, by and
large, the work world

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.480
is usually depicted satirically,
which is funny and fun.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.700
But it's obviously also
a very flattening lens.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.537
So one of the things
that interested me, not

00:02:33.537 --> 00:02:35.120
the only thing with
the novel, but one

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.540
of things that
interested me was,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.130
what would it be
like if you attempted

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.020
to write a book that actually
took the work world seriously?

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.990
Not in the sense that you didn't
find things to gently poke fun

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.010
at, but that you actually
recognize the fact

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
that a lot of us come to work
in offices like these-- actually

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.370
not usually this good-- but
in offices similar to these.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.880
And we find a range
of experiences.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.970
We find experiences that
are both affirmative.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.060
We're applauded for our
innovation and our work.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.520
And we also find
conflict and rivalry.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.470
We may find crushes.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.880
I think the full
range of human emotion

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.980
does occur inside the work
world, inside these offices,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.860
even though that's
not typically,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.790
at least in popular culture
terms, the way it's reflected.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.352
So that, as I said, that
was an animating idea.

00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:26.060
When I was thinking
last night about what

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.920
to read out of the book here,
I was wrestling a little bit.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.200
And I wound up gravitating
toward some of the earlier

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.080
scenes where the work
environment is being anchored.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.130
And I thought to myself,
that's a great idea.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.160
And then when I
showed up, I'm like,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.380
these folks have stepped
out of the work environment

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.150
to have a break.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.889
And now I'm going to read
something that may thrust them

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:45.680
right back into it.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.040
But let's give it a shot.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.150
I'm not going to read for
too long, 10-15 minutes.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
And then if there are
questions about the book

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.670
or, as Joel said, anything
else you want to talk about,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.770
we can do that.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.115
And I'm also happy to inscribe
books if folks are interested.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.520
I've taken a slight liberty.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.490
I'm going to concatenate
two scenes here.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.965
So the way I'll read it
is not precisely the way

00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:07.840
it flows in the book.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.040
But that's not really
material to you.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.040
So this is "The Adventurist."

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.890
There are three
characters you care about.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.390
The narrator's name is Henry.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.344
The person that's
going to show up

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.510
the most in the scene with
him is a guy named Barry.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.030
Barry heads up sales.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.980
Henry, the narrator,
heads up engineering.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.900
They work for a company called
Cyber, which, as you see,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.326
is having some struggles.

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:33.700
And the only other
name, I think,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.860
that isn't introduced here is
a guy by the name of Keith.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.270
And he's the general manager.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.160
They work for Keith.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.375
So Henry, narrator, Barry,
head of sales, Keith, the boss.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.310
"The Monday management meeting.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.390
There are five of the us,
department heads each,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.080
Sales, Marketing, Engineering,
Operations, Finance.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.680
There's also Keith.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.150
We report to him.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
It is his meeting.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.400
I'm aware that nothing
conjures the tedium of business

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.620
so much as a weekly meeting.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.810
And it is true we deliver our
reports in the most nickel

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.460
plated of monotones.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.520
The worst you can do
here is to insist.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.940
We are authoritative by
our very bloodlessness.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.910
Yet the truth is I
crave these sessions.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.550
Here, commercial necessities
are turned to concrete actions

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.450
with measurements and
owners and due dates,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.420
and there is no
Paul to speak of.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.090
Barry is last to present.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.730
He concludes his report
by saying he remains

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.150
pleased with the pipeline.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.580
Keith flips the few pages of the
Sales report with a sour look.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.880
'You're pleased with the
pipeline,' he says finally.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.420
The pipeline is a list of
sales prospects and dollar

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.350
values along with the percentage
chance of our winning the deal.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.940
'Well, I am pleased you're
pleased.' Barry shakes his head

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.906
and gives the table
a vaudevillian look.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.530
'I know I said this
for a couple weeks.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.700
But if some of these don't
hit next week.' Some chuckle

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.040
supportively.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.580
Keith does not.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.850
'Then what?'

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.060
'Sorry?'

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.090
'If some of these don't
hit next week, then what?'

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.710
'Well, then I should look
for a new head of sales.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.496
Ha!

00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:24.410
Ah, no.'

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.150
Keith waits, an ear cocked
in Barry's direction.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.020
In these meetings,
the role of listener

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.650
also carries with it certain
affectations, eyes narrowed,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.230
legs crossed, pen to
lips, the occasional nod

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.570
or frown, the corporate
world's skeptical punctuation.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.400
None of which applies to Keith.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.500
Keith doesn't go
for affectation.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.050
'I feel excellent
about these Keith.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.590
Maybe not the ones listed
at 20% probability.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.250
But these 60 and
above ones, oh boy.'

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.500
'That's two, two
opportunities at 60%.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.310
What's your revenue target?'

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.320
'Right at 15 for the quarter.'

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.780
'4, $4 million.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.700
What's the total value of these
two, assuming we get them,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.330
which I most certainly am not?'

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.550
'One million.'

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.670
'One million?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.230
It's not even that much,
friend, not according to this.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.130
You've got 750 here.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.760
$500,000 for Marketel,
250 for Delta.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.360
Any deal north of
a million is still

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.390
sitting in sub 20 probability,
which means we have what?

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.340
Two three quarters of coaxing
ahead of us for any of those,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.550
best case.'

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.540
Barry's phone buzzes
in its holster.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.410
He consults it
seriously, hopefully.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.729
'OK,' Keith says, 'All right.

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.020
Let's take these one at a time.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.540
Focus on the birds in hand.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.360
Marketel, it's the biggest
of the 60% probabilities .

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.090
You see them this week?'

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.990
'Thursday,' Barry affirms.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.120
'Talk to us about the strategy.'

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.190
Having pressed him,
Keith will back off.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.580
It is important that Barry
leave on a note of confidence.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.420
Buyers can smell
panic on a salesman.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.570
'Well, I've got a
new contact there.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.290
My old guy was bumped.'

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.877
'Uh-oh,' says Keith, but
not without sympathy.

00:08:05.877 --> 00:08:07.460
'No, it might could
work in our favor.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.600
The G2 I have on this new guy
is that he's pretty respected.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.950
He could probably
move things quick.'

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.480
'What do we know about him?'

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.185
'Not a ton.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:16.060
He's from the inside.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.620
I know that.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.100
I don't have to re-educate
him on who we are.'

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.030
'Good.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.772
No lost ground.

00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:21.980
He's from inside the company?

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.434
What group?'

00:08:23.434 --> 00:08:24.350
'Engineering, I think.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.770
90% sure.'

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.370
'A tech guy?

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:26.869
OK.

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:28.640
Take Henry with you.'

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.810
Barry nods energetically
as though he were

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.900
about to propose just this.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.740
But what he says is, 'Yes,
although I'm thinking on this

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.740
one, since I haven't met this
guy myself yet, I fly solo,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.200
build the relationship, then
bring in a heavy hitter like

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.410
Henry.' He means he doesn't
want to share credit if the deal

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.630
closes.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.820
I don't blame him.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.270
It's not my desire to
go along in any case.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.690
Business travel no
longer suits me.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.670
An ominous glow comes
into Keith's face.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.490
Through sheer
professional will, he

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.850
appears to consider
Barry's plan.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.930
Then he says, 'No.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.826
No time.

00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:05.200
We need to hit this guy with
everything we've got in this

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.570
week.'

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.509
'Agree 100%.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.050
My only thing is I don't want
to scare the guy off, you know?

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.370
He hasn't even met me.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.790
And all of a sudden, I'm up
there with an army of folks.'

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.080
'Not an army.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.770
One other person, our director
of engineering, which shows

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.110
how much we value his time.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.360
We're sparing two
of our directors.'

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.860
'Yup.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.420
The only other thing,
because of our situation,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.750
Barry,' Keith interrupts,
his temper slipping again.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.110
'Our situation is this.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.820
It's January 12th.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.860
We have about 10 weeks to get to
4 million.' He catches himself,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.102
nods, addresses the table.

00:09:36.102 --> 00:09:36.810
'And we'll do it.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.530
No question.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.000
But we don't have a lot of room.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.300
Marketel is key.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.570
Barry's done a great
job priming them.'

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.050
Here, Barry studies
his lap modestly.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.620
'And the deals worth
half a million,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.490
so we would be a
good ways along.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.470
And I think we'll
nail it,' Barry adds,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.650
though he's distracted again by
his phone and is tapping away

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.266
even as he says this.

00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:57.020
This is too much.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.490
Keith sets a careful
hand on the table.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.570
'Barry, next week, I want
to hear what you know,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.570
what you have made happen, not
what you fucking think.' He

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.250
slapped shut his portfolio
and is first out of the room.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.540
There is a brief, even
apologetic clearing of throats.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.720
People rise and fall out.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.050
Berry touches a
hand to my sleeve.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.490
He shuts the door
behind the last person,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.980
ducking his head to scan
the terrain for the room's

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.430
low portal windows.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.830
Satisfied the hall is free
of spies, he faces me.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.090
'That guy.'

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.030
'Keith.'

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.910
'Keith, yes.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.802
I mean sometimes he
gets to me, you know?'

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:39.140
'He'll catch twice as much hell
when he delivers his report,'

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.740
'Oh, I know.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.850
I know,' Barry replies quickly.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.760
He is silent for a moment,
nodding his agreement

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.010
while pacing a tight circle.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.270
He has tucked his hands in
the pockets of his trousers

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.860
so that the thumbs
remain exposed.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.870
It is an unnatural stance.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.190
He has to stiffen at
the elbows to hold it.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.660
A lawyer, delivering impassioned
closing to skeptical jury.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.436
The poor bastard.

00:11:03.436 --> 00:11:05.310
'Might have waited to
make his point though.'

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.970
'Exactly.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.827
That's exactly it.

00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:07.910
I'm not saying he's wrong.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.650
I'm on the hook here.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.530
No two ways about it.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.030
But in front of everyone else?

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.970
That's what gets me.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.270
That's all I'm saying.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.240
And then you get dragged along,
which I'm sorry about that.' He

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.700
wags his head and sighs.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.740
'It just makes you wonder,
you know, this place,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.650
whether it's all worth it.'

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.560
Ah.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.500
But already he is recovering.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.480
I know that sigh.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.510
In it is captured the
entire American romance

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.820
of moving forward, moving on.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.840
A job well done or not well
done or not done at all.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.030
Never mind.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.100
Turn the page, a blank
sheet, a fresh start.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.470
And this time, yes, Barry
is a true wax and waner.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.290
Whatever his dejection is now,
it will not last the week.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.570
Sunday morning will come again.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.240
The sales call is a
disaster from top to bottom.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.710
For starters, there
is the weather.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.930
A warm front has heaved
north from the Gulf

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.902
and rolled the landscape under
fathoms of invection fog."

00:12:04.902 --> 00:12:06.860
Marketel, the customer
they are going to visit,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.770
is in Minneapolis.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.590
And they're based in the South.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.980
"In the gloom, we
miss an exit and carry

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.500
on for a full 20 minutes
before realizing our mistake.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.880
When finally we arrive
at the Marketel offices,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.552
Barry is in a state.

00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:22.010
He leaps from the
rental car and is

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.610
nearly across the
parking lot before

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.610
remembering his portfolio.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.530
I wait by the entrance.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.260
The building is part of a
newly tilled office park,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.140
near the Mall of America.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.490
A long two-story brick
affair, its architecture

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.699
is as square and
utilitarian as boxcars.

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:41.740
There is little to inspire
in these office parks,

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.690
yet the companies
they house are usually

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.100
as stolid and
profitable as banks.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.240
Sponges for every bit of
available local talent

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.310
and run by top graduates of the
state's best public university.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.200
Some of the most
frank, rooted people

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.580
I've met, people who've
never in their lives

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.550
coveted a more epic
context go gladly

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.470
to work each day in these
anonymous pill boxes.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.550
I envy them.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.240
Barry returns with
portfolio he is wired even

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.510
by his own electric standard.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.180
'Let's hit it.'

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.090
Our contact is waiting
at the security desk.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.850
His wide face burns
with cheeriness.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.590
'You're the Cyber guys?'
He extends a hand.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.510
'Mike Catrell.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.840
I'm the new sheriff, I guess.'

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.290
Barry clasps his arm and
snaps it like a well pump.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.004
'Glad to put a face to the name.

00:13:29.004 --> 00:13:30.170
This is my associate, Henry.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.730
He directs our
engineering group.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.190
We brought all the big guns.'

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.190
Mike is perhaps 40.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.840
He carries a sort of
pregnant girth in his belt,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.520
slung over a pair of
creaseless trousers.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.080
His loafers are
stained with road salt.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.150
I'm tempted to read in this mild
sloppiness, a genial spirit.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.410
But there is a beady-eyedness
that puts me on my guard.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.520
'Mike, I'm sorry about
the time,' Barry says,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.290
'The usual travel
hiccups, I'm afraid.'

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.390
Our host lets drop my hand and
turns to face Barry directly.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.150
His movements are oddly sedate.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.976
'Hard stop at 11.'

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:08.290
'Oh, I thought-- I could've
sworn we booked through lunch.'

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.170
'11,' his tone is
mild, even benevolent,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.950
'You guys were any later,
I would've canceled.'

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.440
We follow Mike to a conference
room on the second floor.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.080
It is a narrow
hall like chamber,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.450
featureless but for a
bank of slatted windows.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.610
The carpet is gray.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.920
An immense oval table
commands the floor.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.950
This is a room built
to vet vendors, I know.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.960
Solemnity is its point.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.960
But someone has made a mistake.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.950
The screws have been
turned a little too tight.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.690
With its mass slab
table and grim colors,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.440
its narrow dimensions
and hyperbaric air,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.260
the seriousness of
the room is in danger

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.730
of turning over on itself.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.820
It is very nearly hilarious.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.730
Four other men are
clustered at one end.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.620
Each is introduced
somberly as one kind

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.670
of specialist or another.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.130
When we are acquainted and
seated, Mike nods to Barry.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.390
Barry hops from
his seat to begin.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.080
'My apologies all
around for the delay.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.060
I'll get straight in because
I know our time is limited.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.393
Can we skip all the song and
dance on Cyber's background

00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:12.580
and standing as a company?

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.430
Everyone's nodding yes.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.930
All right.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.140
So we'll start with
the technical portion,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.410
my colleague Henry's portion.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.780
We can circle back for any
more general questions.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.080
So I'll just dim the lights.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.090
And the switch is where?

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.610
Here.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.400
Yes.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.760
Henry?'

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.760
It is a part of the job, a day
to help sales, make pitches

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.630
of a certain type, often to
large, cynical prospects who

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.240
want to see and hear from
the person whose team will

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.710
make sure the software behaves.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.690
And once the oddness of arrival
and introduction has passed,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.950
I find it's a job I can do.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.070
I like to explain
our technologies.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.230
Even the idioms of our
science appeal to me,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.850
wedding cakes, fish
bones, bit rot.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.430
And usually, among
other engineers,

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.130
I'll encounter a shared
interest, an appreciation

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.220
at the least, for the
decisions we've made,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.800
for the strategies we've
studied and rejected,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.170
and the reasons for
their dismissal.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.550
Only today, what
I find is silence.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.740
Mike studies the table.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.320
The others regard my slides
with the wax and look

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.770
of actors feigning death.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.820
I can see nothing
to do but press on.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.530
Barry, however, is itchy.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.950
After several slides, he
begins to hear interjections

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.370
in every cleared throat.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.070
'Mark, you had a question?'

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.810
Our host looks up
from the table.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.730
There is a moment's confusion.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.640
He folds his arms
and squints at Barry.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.740
'Are you speaking to me?'

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.510
'Yes.'

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.520
'Mike.'

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.020
'Mike.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.150
Forgive me.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.120
You had a question?'

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120
'No.'

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.820
"i thought you
looked like you did.'

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.700
'You'll know if I
have a question.'

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.279
'Of course.'

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:45.070
The best sales pitch
I ever heard about was

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.910
made by a cyber competitor.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.100
It was told to me by
the salesman himself

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.950
whom I met one evening at
a conference in Washington.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.440
He told me about
a sale he had once

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.730
made to the Central
Intelligence Agency,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.370
as jaded and bored an audience
as you could ever hope to find.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.170
There is nothing, but
nothing a mere salesman

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.619
could tell the CIA
about security.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.440
But it became suddenly
inclined to buy

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.290
when it was revealed that the
salesman's analyst, pounding

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.150
away on a keyboard at
the back of the room,

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.720
had contrived to deface the
agency website in the time it

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.250
took to pass around the coffee.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.859
But here there are only
mannequin faces in the room.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.839
The minutes drip.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.800
When I'm finished, Barry
stands and raises the lights.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.300
He smacks his hands together,
rubbing them and making

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.700
a slight bow to our host.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.550
Mike remains as he has
throughout, absorbed

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.830
by the area of the
table in front of him.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:39.560
'So Mark,' Barry prompts,
'Now, what are your questions?'

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.707
We are lost.

00:17:41.707 --> 00:17:43.290
This emphasis on
name is meant to show

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.256
he's taken special
care to get it right,

00:17:45.256 --> 00:17:47.130
except because he has
fumbled the name again,

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.320
the effect is opposite.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.010
It seems he's making some
bizarre point of defiance.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.060
Mike says nothing.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.580
He stares at the table,
his arms crossed heavily

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.070
over belly, a forelock of
hair drops onto his eyebrow.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.980
He smooths it into place with
his ring and pinky fingers.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.560
The gesture is ominously
dainty, bottled.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.734
Barry sees his mistake.

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:06.233
'Mike.

00:18:06.233 --> 00:18:06.732
Mike!

00:18:06.732 --> 00:18:08.610
What is wrong with me today?'

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.900
Our host picks microscopic
lint from his trousers.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.040
'I don't know.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.690
What is wrong with you today?'

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.830
The question is posed
offhandedly, almost kindly.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.250
It is possible to
imagine he's as

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.060
curious in the answer as Barry.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.071
'It's the cold,' Berry pries,
'Us southerners don't do well

00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:24.570
in the snow.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.510
Our brains freeze.'

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.780
Mike leaps from his chair
and thrusts out a hand.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.830
'I want to thank you.' He is
grinning, shaking Barry's arm.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.940
'A revealing presentation.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.700
Guys, am I wrong?'

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.227
His team swaps private glances.

00:18:37.227 --> 00:18:38.310
Mike calls to one of them.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.990
'Tom, what was your
favorite part.'

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.460
Silence.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.240
Mike lears at the group.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.490
His eyes pop with
goodwill of expectancy.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.240
One of the men
clears his throat.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.730
'Tim, I think you mean.'

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.440
'Tim.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.120
Yes,' he throws back his head
in marvel. 'How stupid of me!

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.489
Goddamn brainless!

00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:58.030
You're critical to
our business here,

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.960
so to not get your name
right, I feel like a turd.'

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.140
Tim smiles uncomfortably.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.760
Mike paces to the window.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.200
There he stands nodding,
tapping his lip.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.880
'I wouldn't be
surprised, Tim, if you

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.840
wanted to walk right out of
here, never talk to me again.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.300
Wouldn't blame you a bit.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.430
Quality in everything,
that's what we preach.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.513
So the least you'd expect
is that I could remember

00:19:19.513 --> 00:19:20.810
your name, no?'

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.840
'Yes, absolutely right.'

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.030
He turns to Barry whose face
has gone bland and waxy.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.270
'Safe travels, friend.'

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.850
In the stairwell, Barry pulls
off his spectacles and digs

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.990
at his eyes with
thumb and forefinger.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.850
'Barry, the man is certifiable.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.920
Forget it.'

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.590
'No,' Barry replaces his frames,
blinking at me through glass,

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.230
'We don't talk about
customers that way.'

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.940
This is how he will have it.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.740
His dignity will be
restored by lesson giving.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.800
As engineer, I misunderstand
the dynamics of selling.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.730
It falls to him to show
how the licking just

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.300
received is, in fact,
a small sacrifice

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.350
for fealty to the high
cause of customer service.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.520
It's no small alchemy to
turn a humiliating episode

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.230
into a business lesson with
Barry as a master of subtleties

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.640
and my poor nuts and
bolts brain has missed.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.465
Having been condescended
to, Barry would condescend.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.840
And if I were a bigger person,
I might allow him his pose

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.780
at sensei, might
sit as apprentice

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.440
while Barry lectures
himself back to level.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.326
A smart thing where
Cyber is concerned

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:26.700
because a salesman
with doubts is

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.856
like a prostitute with
inhibitions, only--

00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:29.980
'Getting their names wrong.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.360
That's how we speak
about our customers.'

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.720
He glares. 'By the way,
thanks for the assist.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.250
Really tremendous.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.080
Just sit there while I
get'-- even when he's angry,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.740
cursing comes hard to
Barry-- 'screwed up the rear.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.780
Big help.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.510
Your problem, Henry,
if you want to know,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.551
is you always think
discretion is the better part

00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:50.500
of valor.' Nothing useful
could come of this.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.380
When at last we part company,
I'm glad to be rid of him."

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.090
Thank you all.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.684
AUDIENCE: It seems
like, recently, there

00:21:01.684 --> 00:21:04.100
has been an uptake in the
number of books that are written

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.970
about people at work
who aren't detectives

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.359
or soldiers or something.

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.650
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: No vampires.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.275
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:10.776
Right.

00:21:10.776 --> 00:21:11.750
At their jobs.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.130
Do you think that-- well,
do you think that there's

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.470
a particular reason for this?

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.470
And do you think it has
anything to do with the fact

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.430
that it seems like today,
it's harder than ever

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.310
to make a living
just as a writer,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.809
so maybe more people are
working at regular jobs?

00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:26.850
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: It
could be connected to both.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.690
I don't-- you guys
probably have the data.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.970
I don't have the data on
how many works of literature

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.640
actually now attempt to do
anything with what we would

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.890
commonly call the work world.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.760
It still seems to be
pretty thin on the ground.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.460
But by the same token,
I think the reality

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.214
is almost every writer you've
ever heard of had a day job.

00:21:48.214 --> 00:21:49.630
You can probably
count on one hand

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.284
the number of writers that don't
have other means of income.

00:21:54.284 --> 00:21:55.700
I think the
difference, of course,

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:01.650
is that, maybe traditionally,
those day jobs were academic.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.160
I don't know how
many campus novels

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.180
we saw in the '50s and '60s.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.180
And it may be simply
that, you're right,

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.850
that we're beginning to
transition out of that period

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.680
and that writers, probably for
the better for the work anyway,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.270
are finding themselves with
more diverse and different

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.490
positions.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.330
But the other thing
I will say is--

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.040
and maybe people are
waking up to this.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.680
I don't know.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.590
But I said elsewhere, and
this sounds like hyperbole.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.590
But I mean it.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.860
I think, after the battlefield,
the work environment

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.994
has the richest set of human
drama you're going to find.

00:22:34.994 --> 00:22:36.910
And that's, I think, for
a variety of reasons.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.740
But one of the big reasons
is, like a battlefield,

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.210
we're all thrust together.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.790
We don't necessarily have much
say over who our coworkers are.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.130
And that's going to lead to all
kinds of interesting things,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.600
both positive and negative.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.950
So I think it winds up
being an environment

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.570
rich in fictional possibilities,
if you see it that way.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.460
This is a little bit my
slight soapbox remarks

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.290
about the satirical
view that people take.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.220
That's such a failure of
imagination ultimately.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.595
It's such a flattering way
to think about what we do.

00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:12.470
I think if you don't
think about it that way.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.860
The fictional possibilities
are everywhere.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.302
That was a good question.

00:23:16.302 --> 00:23:17.860
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.776
had like a favorite
quotation that you've ever

00:23:19.776 --> 00:23:22.182
written in when you reread
it, you're like, wow,

00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:22.510
that was really good?

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.735
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: Oh, that
I have personally written?

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:24.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.370
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.630
Do I have a favorite quotation
that I've ever written?

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.790
I have hundreds.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.290
No.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.590
Let me-- I would have
to think about that.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.330
There is one--
this is shameless.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.621
People are going to think I
planted you in the audience

00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:39.890
to ask that question.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.430
There was one-- there's
one in this book.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.340
I don't-- maybe I can find
it as I'm fumbling along.

00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:52.350
Maybe I won't because I've
just put a lot of pressure

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.558
on myself, and it's got to
be something amazing given

00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.050
the question you asked.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.605
A broader answer is, yes,
there are certain phrases that

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.730
are in the book that stick
with me because I think,

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.590
as a writer-- I don't know
if other folks in them

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:08.130
are writers, but the condition
of a writer, generally,

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.590
is you spend most of your
days in agony with things

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.860
not working and looking
terrible and basically

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.870
thinking and feeling
like you're a fraud.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.579
But from time to time, you
have a moment where you connect

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:25.870
to something, and it comes out.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.536
And the words arrange
themselves the way

00:24:27.536 --> 00:24:29.500
they need to be
arranged, and it speaks

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.620
to a sentiment or an
experience that you don't think

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.300
is commonly spoken to.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.610
And when that happens,
it's just a little moment

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.654
of catching lightning
in a bottle.

00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:40.320
And so, yes, there
are several of those.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.990
Not lots and lots, but several.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.020
Thank you for that question.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.260
AUDIENCE: I don't know what
other people's experience

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.926
coming to work is,
but my own experience

00:24:47.926 --> 00:24:50.920
is that the percentage of my
personality that comes out

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.470
in the work world
is rather small

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.540
relative to what could come
out in the rest of my life.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.800
Was that challenging
for you to create fully

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.430
three dimensional
characters in this setting?

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.860
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: Maybe.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.120
So one general observation
is-- I agree with you.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.790
I think it sounds
like a negative thing.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.550
But we almost have to live
these bifurcated existences.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.580
And there's one mask
we're going to dawn when

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.600
we come into this space.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.570
And it's-- that sounds terrible.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.290
But the reality is we have
to get together and work

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.880
hard and go along to get
along even if we don't feel

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.210
like it or we've had a
horrendous night before

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.100
or whatever the case may be.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.920
So I agree with that.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.320
What is the possibility
that introduces,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.950
I think, in this book and
particularly for the narrator,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.270
is that that begins to exert
a particular pressure on him

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.050
because he has been a person,
like many of his coworkers,

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.120
who is pragmatic and
rational and levelheaded and

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.650
well-adjusted and--
but there is pressure

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.120
from his personal
life in this book

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.100
and a large part of the
book is what happens when

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.570
that pressure becomes greater
than maybe he can contain

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.130
in that work-oriented mindset.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.120
But you're right.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.120
I mean the flip
side is, if you're

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.902
going to set a book
in the work space

00:26:11.902 --> 00:26:14.110
and you're not going to make
it a satirical one-- you

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.610
want to make

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.100
it largely realist--
you're right.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.850
There are going to be
certain constraints.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.475
You're not going to have people
going into operatic crying fits

00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:23.090
or doing other things unless
you're presenting characters

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.540
that are mentally disturbed.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.616
But I would say I--
maybe this is true.

00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:29.240
Maybe it isn't.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.490
I certainly can't make any
claims from my own writing.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.300
But I think, even in scenes
like that short when we read,

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.520
there's clear tension
both on the surface

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.280
and below the surface that's
occurring even though people

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.520
are largely polite.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.750
Keith has that one slight
outburst at the end.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.860
But people are largely polite.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.000
And I think it's
the fact that you

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.660
are trying to keep a lid on
that politeness, even when,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.640
underneath, you may
feel anything but,

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.900
that by itself is
sufficient tension

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.197
to drive parts of the story.

00:27:00.197 --> 00:27:01.280
But it is a good question.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.840
You have certain
creative constraints

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.850
if you're going to
say it's a work story.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.516
There are certain
ways people can behave

00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:09.110
and certain ways
they can't behave.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.365
That's a good question.

00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:12.740
AUDIENCE: The
question I have is,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.870
can you briefly describe
your creative process?

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.770
What sparked the idea?

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.520
And how do you build
out an outline?

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.521
Or how do you get to the
final product, I guess?

00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:24.520
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: I don't
know if I can briefly

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.570
describe the creative process.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:34.390
As I've mentioned, I was-- I had
been working for about 10 years

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.570
when I decided I
wanted to try to write.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.350
So I had not-- I feel as
though a lot of writers

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.870
know out of the gates that
that's what they want to do.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.680
And they start in their
teens or early 20s.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.630
And they go heads down and--
so I was at least 10 years

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.380
delayed on that.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.880
I would like to say
now productively

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.600
so because I think
that gives you time

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.540
not only to live
your life, but also

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.255
just to let certain
experiences build.

00:28:02.255 --> 00:28:04.630
That's different from saying
you have any sort of wisdom.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:09.110
But you've lived enough
things to know what happens.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.090
And as I say, one of the
things that I was drawn to

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.496
was I was doing a lot of reading
as-- obviously, like all of us.

00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:19.120
You work your day job, and then
you go home and do what you do.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.300
And one of the big
things I did was read.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.290
And as I said, I was
just struck by the fact

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.800
that there's just almost
no literature that actually

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.970
looks at the workplace.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:35.390
So that was absolutely a trigger
point for thinking about it.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.450
But to be a little bit more, I
guess, practical or pragmatic,

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.600
I also realized
at that time, even

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.890
if I had this
incohate idea, that it

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.000
was going to take a lot of
time to really try to do it.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.020
And so I left my job,
and I went and got

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.280
a masters in fine
arts, which is really

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.640
just-- it's like apprenticing
yourself to other writers,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.140
right?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.110
I mean before the
MFA programs existed,

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.070
Hemingway had all
his crew in Paris.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.880
And he could just
apprentice to them.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.880
I think MFA programs today
are our apprentice programs.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.570
And what you discover
in that process

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.740
is that you just don't know
what you don't know as somebody

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.710
who would be a writer.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.520
And a huge part of that
is writing and developing

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.290
an allergy to what
you write and then

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.810
beginning to develop
the vocabulary

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.870
to understand why what
you write is so awful

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.000
and, again, beginning to
understand what it might look

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.670
like if it weren't so awful.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.210
So there's no simple answer.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.090
There was the idea.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.060
It nagged at me enough.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.820
It didn't go away.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.520
It wasn't like I had this
idea for a couple weeks,

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.478
and then it just faded.

00:29:42.478 --> 00:29:44.056
The idea sat there.

00:29:44.056 --> 00:29:45.430
And then I finally
decided, well,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.880
I need to do something
with this idea.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.240
And that's where the practical,
pragmatic part of you kicks in.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.240
What would it mean to go
do something with this?

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.884
Getting up in the mornings,
writing on the side

00:29:53.884 --> 00:29:55.300
isn't enough because
I need people

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.210
who know what they're
doing to look at it.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.440
So in my case, that meant
taking the subsequent steps.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.760
We'll see what happens
in the next book.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.980
AUDIENCE: Fresh on my mind is
your Op Ed about technology

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:15.280
and humanities being necessary
to advance both, I think,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.240
certainly advance technology.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.690
And I think we all
live insulated.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.910
We live in this tech bubble.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.960
We talk about it as
the tech bubble, right?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.320
And one of the things I heard
from a different meeting

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.680
this morning was about the
Brexit and how a lot of people

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:42.650
are feeling left behind in
this new economy and maybe even

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.320
our culture.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.310
Do you think
technology has a lot

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.280
to do with what's going on
politically in terms of people

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.690
feeling left out?

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.020
I mean I look at my parents.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.520
And my dad wants
to sometimes throw

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.740
his phone against the wall.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.700
He's like, I don't know
how to answer this thing.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.245
Is that part of the problem?

00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:01.870
J. BRADFORD HIPPS:
I am going to regret

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.580
saying I talked about anything.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.620
Because you've now put
a Brexit question in it,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.780
I'm going to be really stumped.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.280
No.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.610
Let me fumble my way
through because I

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.470
think if I were to go back
to-- the short answer is,

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.230
is technology-- is
it, if you will,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.420
flattening things for folks?

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.200
Or is it actually
a distancing thing?

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.205
Is it making the elites higher
and everyone else left behind?

00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:23.580
The short answer
is I don't know.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.960
I can see an
argument either way.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.280
But what I would say-- and
this was part of the reason

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.180
that I wound up writing
that particular Op Ed

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.110
piece is I guess
I-- I don't think

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.840
resent is too strong a word.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:43.545
But I resist or resent the
idea that-- this push that

00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:45.670
is on right now which is
to basically say, look, we

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.461
need to throw out the
humanities because it

00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:50.650
has no vocational merit.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.600
And we have to get all our
15, 16, and 17-year-olds just

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.390
to study engineering.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.247
To me, it's misguided
for a couple reasons.

00:31:58.247 --> 00:31:59.830
First of all, it
feels as though we're

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.830
trying to create some
sort of high priest class,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.454
and the only way to
get into that class

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:06.510
is if you know what bits are.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.320
But more broadly, my
feeling is that's just

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.520
a fundamental
misunderstanding of software.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.240
And folks are-- obviously, feel
free to disagree with this.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.590
But my assertion
is that software

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.285
is more creative as an activity
than it is algorithmic.

00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:23.410
That's more or less the
point I was trying to make.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.580
This notion that it's
all about the bit

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.184
heads, and it's just about
these engineering geeks.

00:32:29.184 --> 00:32:31.100
That's just, I think,
fundamentally misguided.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.470
It does not correspond
with my own experience.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.700
The best developers
I've worked with--

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.164
and I'm a far cry
from these folks.

00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:38.830
But the best developers
I've worked with

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.790
are fundamentally
creative souls.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.140
And it was only coincidental
whether they'd actually been

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.007
born and bred in engineering.

00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.840
They were philosophy
majors and music majors

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.660
and folks that had come out
of these artistic degrees.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.460
So I realize that's a little
adjacent to the question

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.130
you're asking, which is,
is technology-- is it

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.200
making better or worse this
feeling that we're separating?

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.180
And I'm not-- as I said,
I'm not sure of the answer.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.950
But the one thing I
do feel strongly about

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.000
is our desire to say there's
only one true path to become

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.500
effective in technology.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.260
And if you're not
on that true path,

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.380
you might as well just-- I don't
know-- go open an apple cart.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.336
To me, that just is
totally misguided

00:33:20.336 --> 00:33:21.460
and doesn't make any sense.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.600
And maybe if-- hey, if I'm
right and if people wake up

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.710
to that, then maybe fewer people
feel excluded and feel like,

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.187
well OK, this is
something I can tackle.

00:33:32.187 --> 00:33:34.270
I mean, again, I don't
know if it's controversial.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.970
But learning to program,
it's learning a language

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:38.990
fundamentally.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.420
And lots of people are capable
of learning a language.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.550
Now, obviously, the best
developers do more than that.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.177
But this idea that it's this
thing for just very select few,

00:33:48.177 --> 00:33:50.260
it doesn't feel right and
probably not good for us

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.840
on a macroeconomic level either.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.360
AUDIENCE: There's a pretty good
size collection-- population

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.550
of writers at Google.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.820
They have day jobs, of course.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.600
They always ask this.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.160
What's your advice?

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.461
J. BRADFORD HIPPS: Keep
your day job is my advice.

00:34:08.461 --> 00:34:08.960
Yeah.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.366
I think maybe I'll be
singing a different song

00:34:13.366 --> 00:34:14.199
five years from now.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:18.420
But I think-- unless
your job is-- I mean.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.980
With at least this
cohort, I feel

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.100
comfortable saying
we're not coal miners.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.620
We have it reasonably easy.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.219
Not to say our jobs aren't
stressful, but-- and as long

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.610
as you feel as though the job
can be contained, if it's not

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:35.010
bleeding you dry and leaving
you with nothing left over

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.510
to do anything
else-- in which case,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.389
you would probably be looking
regardless of whether you're

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:39.348
a writer or not.

00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:41.139
But I think as long as
it can be contained,

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:46.580
then I think it can be
productive because, as I say,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.489
it puts you into
encounter with folks

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.804
that you don't otherwise
necessarily choose

00:34:52.804 --> 00:34:53.679
to be encounter with.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:56.112
And some writer-- I can't
remember which one said this.

00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:57.320
But he had this great phrase.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.480
He said, "People come to you
dripping in mystery," which

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.247
I think is a great way,
maybe a subtly vampiric way

00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:04.830
to look at people,
if you're a writer.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.840
But it's true that
everyone comes

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.570
with his or her own story.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.830
Everyone has genuinely
fascinating experiences.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.540
And as a writer, you
want your radar up

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.120
and attuned to those
kinds of things.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.417
It's what informs a lot
of what you're after.

00:35:18.417 --> 00:35:20.500
At least, a lot of what
I'm after in a book, which

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.080
is to try to make
sense of my own life

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.650
and to try to see
existence as I've

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.490
lived it depicted in a
credible and real way.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.710
And I think if
you-- I don't know

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.020
what the magic utopia
some writers think exist.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.980
If it's to shut
yourself up in a tower

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.174
and never have to do
anything other than work,

00:35:37.174 --> 00:35:39.340
I'm afraid, ultimately,
that's going to come through

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.600
in the writing itself.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.440
It's going to start to feel very
hermetically sealed and sterile

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.600
and chilly, whatever other
adjective you might come up

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.100
with.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.780
So that's my plug for
the value of having

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.320
to get up and work
something that

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.130
is not related to your writing.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.880
As I say, give me
another five years,

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.970
I may be ground down to nothing.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.630
And I'll give you a very
resentful, different answer.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.340
But that's my answer right now.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.550
Thank you all very much.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.860
Really appreciate you coming.
