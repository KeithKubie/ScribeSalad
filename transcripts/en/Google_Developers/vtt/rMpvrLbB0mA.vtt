00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.656
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.656 --> 00:00:02.680
RODRIGO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to Sao Paulo.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.565
My name is Rodrigo.

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.340
ANDRE: My name is Andre,
and we founded Epungo.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.125
RODRIGO: Hola.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:18.530
My name is Rodrigo.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.510
Welcome to Epungo.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.000
This is our global office.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.900
ANDRE: Also known as
my living room.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.710
So basically, we're a real
estate search site.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.170
You type in the name of the city
that you want to search.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.650
I'm typing in the name of
Curichiba, which is a

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.570
beautiful city here in Brazil.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.350
And the first thing you want to
do is define a search area,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.130
which you can do just by
clicking on the map.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.920
You can make it bigger, or
you can make it smaller.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.640
And you can move it around.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.350
And you do this to define the
area where you were searching

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350
for real estate.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.970
The results on the map are color
coded, so the red ones

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.940
are commercial listings,
and the blue ones

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.090
are residential listings.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.090
You can click on them to see a
summary of the characteristics

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.230
of each one, or you can pull
down a list to see a list of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.000
the results.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.520
You can open each of the results
and see the details

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.170
that are set in each of them.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.260
Let's say you want to define
a more complex search area.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.920
You can quickly use the polygon
tool here, and you can

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.090
draw an area as crazy as you
want, and the site's just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.590
going to fill it up with
the results it finds.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.555
Another thing you can do is you
might want to filter down

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.220
the results, and you can
use the filter tools.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.700
You can toggle off the
commercial, for example, and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.270
you can toggle off the rent.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.130
So you're just looking to buy
something for up to, let's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.040
say, $300,000, and it has
to have two bedrooms.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.355
So going back on the map, this
is the list of the results.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.300
And if you change the shape, you
go back to results which

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.750
are filtered according
to that filter.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.450
Let's say you want to get a
feel of the neighborhood.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.410
You can toggle the points
of interest on and off.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.960
For example, I'm showing
drugstores here, and I'm

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.330
showing banks and
supermarkets--

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.070
the red point's coming up--

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.120
and the bakeries, which
are the orange points.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.260
If you finally want to take a
look at what the neighborhood

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.070
looks like, you just drag the
Pegman, drop it on the map,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.669
and you pull out Street View,
and you can see exactly what

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.900
the neighborhood looks like.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.210
This is what we've been doing.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.820
You can visit us
at epungo.com.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.070
Thanks for watching.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.820
The one thing that we really
like about the Google Maps API

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.370
is that every time we need
something, and we expect it to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.560
be there somewhere in the
API, when we look

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.720
for it, it's there.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.970
And that's really great.
