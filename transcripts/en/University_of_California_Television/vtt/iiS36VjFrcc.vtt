00:00:01.562 --> 00:00:04.979
(dramatic trumpet music)

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.610
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.660
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.320
of International Studies.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.050
Our guest today is
Professor Sir John Gurdon

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.700
who is a researcher at the Wellcome Trust

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.390
Cancer Research UK Gurdon
Institute of Cancer

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.133
and Developmental Biology.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.680
And he served as its first
chairman from 1998 to 2001.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.260
He is a professor of cell biology

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.940
in the University of Cambridge

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.010
and he served as master of
Magdalene College Cambridge

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.120
from 1995 to 2002.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.180
In the spring of 2006, he is visiting the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.430
Berkeley Campus as the Hitchcock Lecturer.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.800
Professor Gurdon, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.633
- Thank you.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.450
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
- I was born in the
southern part of England

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
in a small village in the area

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.520
where they expect people largely to be

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.315
stockbrokers, though my family was not.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:31.540
- (laughs) And you chose not to be.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.090
Looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.550
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.090
- Well, they were extremely supportive

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.727
in the sense I was
accorded private education.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.400
Not the state sector and it was actually

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.140
better education that way
which was rather expensive

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.230
and they kindly provided that.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.280
So when the time came to
aim for a particular career,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.790
my father thought the
most appropriate thing

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.880
would be a career in either the army

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.880
or in the financial world, and
arranged some introductions.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.670
But fortunately for me I was refused entry

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.730
to the army for the National
Service, a piece of good luck.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.390
I was actually a competitive
squash player at the time

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.380
and rather fit, but the
family doctor decided

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.610
I was not suitable for the army and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.580
diagnosed my slight cold as bronchitis.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.930
And that eliminated any
possibility, thank heavens,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.747
of entering the army as a career.

00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:34.480
- So what did your parents think
of your going into science?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.100
- Well my mother could always see that

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.210
I was fascinated by biological things.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.700
Even at school I used to grow
thousands of caterpillars

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.380
to make moths to the intense
annoyance of my tutor.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.480
But I had a sort of
fascination for these things.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.970
And I think it was really her particularly

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.110
who enabled me to switch
from my education,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.620
which was completely non-scientific,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.202
into a scientific direction.

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:07.420
- And you were identified early
in your educational career

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.890
as somebody who was not
qualified for science, correct?

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.040
- That's correct, yes.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.420
I have this rather amazing report,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.320
which roughly speaking says
I was the worst student

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.027
the biology master had ever taught.

00:03:20.027 --> 00:03:21.165
(Harry laughing)

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:23.410
And he goes on to say that
he had heard there was

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.660
some possibility of me
becoming interested in science,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.510
but this would be, to quote him,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.230
a total waste of time both
on his part and on mine.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.708
And this whole whole idea should
be immediately discouraged.

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:39.230
- And at what level in your
education did you get this news?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990
- This was age 15, when I had done

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.780
one first semester of science and that was

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.240
the end of it, no more
science from then on.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.893
Until later on when I was
able to return to the subject.

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:52.475
- And how did this affect you,

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:55.023
your self-esteem, so to speak?

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.130
- Yes, well it was, excuse me,
it was sort of discouraging

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.260
but curiously enough in retrospect,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.180
if you have bad teaching,
which was in fact the case

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.270
'cause this was just after the World War,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.890
you're better off not being
taught a subject badly

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.610
and therefore come back to it when you can

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.180
take it from a different point of view.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.530
So in a curious sort of way
I see it as an advantage

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.260
to have not had to do the
dreary kind of school science

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.770
that people did have to do at that time.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.670
- And I would imagine a key
factor in being a good scientist

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.618
is being able to stand on
your own feet in a way,

00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:35.910
and go in new directions.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.610
- Yes I think that's right, I was,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.207
I had another piece of
curious good fortune

00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:43.850
in a sense that I was extremely interested

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.023
in insects and always have been.

00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:50.030
And I actually applied to do a PhD

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.810
with the entomology department, but again,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.436
luckily for me I was refused
as being a bad student.

00:04:55.436 --> 00:04:56.816
(Harry laughing)

00:04:56.816 --> 00:05:00.840
And then took up this embryology in effect

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.120
with a very sympathetic person.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.430
So I moved into that slightly by default,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.030
but what a happy situation for me it was,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.640
because actually entomology
in those days was

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.240
a dull subject, there weren't really any

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.970
scientific questions as there
clearly are in development.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.970
- Many of the people I interview
always talk often about

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.597
doing what you want to
do, really liking it,

00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:33.597
and it sounds like this was
a ballast for you as you

00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:35.810
moved through different
periods of your career because

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.290
you really were drawn
to the subject matter.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.490
- That's correct, I always
had a fascination for it,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.290
and the interesting, thing
is nowadays this, my career

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.220
would have been impossible
in the sense that I did

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.660
classics, Greek, ancient Greek and Latin

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.900
all my school time and then
had to switch to science,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.290
and this involved my poor
parents had to pay an extra year

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.670
of private tuition to get
into science and in those days

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.280
they were actually short of
students in Oxford and so

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.220
I received this curious letter
from the admissions tutor

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.050
in Oxford that said they would
accept me on two conditions.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.800
One was that I came into
residence immediately,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.960
in a week's time, and the
second was that I did not study

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.014
the subject in which I had been examined.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.220
(Harry laughs)

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.880
This is unimaginable at present.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.410
- So you were being ordered
not to become a classicist.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.967
- Absolutely, they said
I'm not suitable for that.

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:33.730
And actually I later met the
person socially, he was a man

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.870
called Trevor-Roper who
later became Lord Dacre

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.950
and very involved in in
the last days of Hitler.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.310
And he told me privately that
his mind was on greater things

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.000
and he'd realized he hadn't
filled the places in the college

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.450
and so he looked down the
list of unsuitable people.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.680
- So I guess we can say that
Fortuna is at work here.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.260
- Absolutely, a lot of
it, great deal of it.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.182
- So what did you do your dissertation on?

00:06:58.182 --> 00:07:01.920
- My PhD dissertation, that
was indeed on the subject

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.720
I still work on, which is to
say nuclear transplantation

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.980
and that was thanks to my
supervisor, a wonderful man who

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.043
put me onto that as a very novel subject.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.180
It was practically rather
a challenge because it,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.140
like everything, it didn't
work at all at first,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.720
but he was persuasive and
had ideas and it finally did

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.050
so that was an extraordinary
piece of good luck to be

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.683
able to work with someone who
was an outstanding mentor.

00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:35.270
- So you have become a
developmental biologist,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.290
and I guess what I'm
curious about how would you

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.290
characterize the temperament and character

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.520
required to do this kind of science?

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.300
You've given us some hints already,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.500
perseverance is clearly one.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.300
- Yes, I think that's probably
right because as all of us

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.450
find, most of the things we
try in the lab don't work,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.790
at least if they're at
all innovative or novel

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.710
they usually fail, and the
question is do you keep at it

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.730
or do you just say I'll
try something else.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.520
And I think the, my
feeling is you have to feel

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.850
convinced it's an important problem.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.810
That may be the single most
important thing to decide

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.007
that if you could do it it
really would be worth doing.

00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:19.860
And then one keeps at it and
goes at it different angles,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.840
and finally some little
unexpected result comes up

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.890
which gives you a feeling of how you

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.580
can make progress in that area.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.710
But I must say I was fortunate in having

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.300
a complete fascination
for both biological things

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.620
and also doing things by hand.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.410
I used, when I was
smaller out of amusement

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.223
I used to make model sailing
ships in the shell of a walnut.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.190
Just 'cause, doing micro things

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.040
with hands has always appealed to me.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.030
- So it's a dealing with
frustration experimenting,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.160
but of course in your work really

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.880
working with microscopic entities.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.210
- In my case that's, really
does appeal to me a great deal,

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.130
and perhaps I'm rather bad
at looking after the people

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.060
in my lab in the sense that
I do an awful lot of my own

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.230
experiments myself by hand and
they rather have to manage.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.160
But I like to hope that
gives them some sort of help,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.880
the fact that one can usually
do these things oneself.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.010
- Now you told us that
you were a humanist become

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.600
a scientist, and most people
probably couldn't do that today

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.050
so what sort of skills do
you need, do you think?

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.330
I mean chemistry, physics, what?

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.113
- You mean to be a scientist
or failed classicist?

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.460
(Harry laughing)

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.075
- Well, both, but let's
do the scientist, yes.

00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:47.553
- [Sir John] What sort of science?

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:49.378
- Yeah, but maybe the
other is as interesting.

00:09:49.378 --> 00:09:51.043
- That's something interesting, too.

00:09:52.609 --> 00:09:54.823
Well, what do you need, I suppose,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:01.140
in a way I suppose you must
have to have this inherent

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.410
interest in something that
you're trying to study.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.950
But one thing that was
very prominent in my mind

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.290
and in a way answers
both those two questions,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.010
I thought if I'd spent my
life as a classics person

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.660
I would end up at the
end of my career saying

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.330
I've now achieved the
level that everybody else

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.960
has achieved for the
last few hundred years.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.010
I wouldn't know more about Homer

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.640
and Thucydides than anybody else.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.260
I might reach the same
level, it wouldn't advance

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.960
anything in human society in my view.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.010
Whereas in science you felt
that at the end of a career

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.950
you could actually see
some genuine progress,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.286
both in understanding and
in fact in practical use.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:42.960
So that was very much in
my mind that one wants,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.960
I'd like to give my career
to something where I can see

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.991
at the end of it there's
been a real advance.

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:52.350
- And is there a root of
that perception on your part,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.510
is that something you got
in your early schooling

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.420
from the humanities or from your parents?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.720
- No, from parents if anybody,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.463
maybe it was just sort of innate.

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:05.250
Sort of thinking about one's
future, one lives much of

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.110
one's life by saying what am
I going to do the next year

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.480
and I often ask my, sometimes
you have very bright students

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.850
and I sometimes say to them, PhD students,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.410
where will you be in 40 years time?

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.890
Most of them say I can't
tell you, I'll tell you

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.310
where I will be next year
but I haven't any idea.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.600
In some ways it's a good
thing to think what you,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.833
how your career might
evolve if things go well.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.520
- Talk a little about this synergy between

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.270
the individual scientist,
his team of collaborators,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.560
and the broader scientific community.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.950
Because when we start
talking about your work,

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.870
it really needs to be placed in

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.480
a tradition and with the work of others.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.260
- So maybe the comment to
make is that in my time,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.890
and I think there's been a real
change from the possibility

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.150
of someone working almost as
an individual as opposed to

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.860
part of a team, and of course
in physics my understanding is

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.010
you work in enormous teams
with big instrumentation.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.410
Things are moving that way, I
think, in biological sciences.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.770
But I don't think they're going to be,

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.543
ever exclude someone who
explores novel ideas.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.510
It's rather easy now to get
a grant for a huge piece

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.700
of equipment and to have
10 people getting out lots,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.590
large amounts of data of sequences

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.950
or something which you analyze.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.570
But I'd like to think there is
still and will be for a while

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.100
an opportunity to do things
on a more individual scale,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.730
but not as much as there was.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.820
When I started you really
could work as one person

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.340
in a field and you wouldn't
be worrying every day

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.830
that you're going to read the results

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.580
of your work in the paper next day.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.540
- So what then was the evolution
of your research up until

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.340
the 60s when you made a major discovery,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.528
which we will talk about in a second.

00:12:57.528 --> 00:13:02.528
What problems interested
you after your dissertation,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.460
and where did they lead you?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.930
- Well, after my PhD
dissertation my supervisor,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.818
my mentor said you should do
something completely different.

00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:18.610
And that was right, and
that's why I went to Cal Tech

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.080
where I in fact worked on
bacteriophage genetics.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.130
But interesting, to me I could
never make it work at all.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.760
Every experiment I did failed completely.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.500
But I learnt an enormous amount by meeting

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.960
a number of very interesting
people, and the whole idea

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.180
of how you do science became
much more clear to me.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.110
So I went back again to
what I'd been doing before,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.940
but in a more informed way.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.180
- What became clearer
to you, if I may ask?

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.920
- How you try to analyze things
at a more molecular level,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.460
more detailed level, so I'm the...

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.750
I'm the extreme opposite of
the systems biology person

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.650
who says we must look at
everything, I actually can't.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.620
I look more and more down into,
focus down on a tiny thing,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.110
to understand just one thing,

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.600
and then try and enlarge afterwards.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.200
And I think it became clear
after my year in Cal Tech

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.590
how people can do, can
make a molecular analysis.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.650
So if something happens in
biology, the end result has to be

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.320
that you understand it
in terms of molecules,

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.430
individual molecules doing something.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.347
And that was, my education
didn't reveal that.

00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:29.210
For example, when I was a student we spent

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.500
three days a week learning
about paleontology.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.190
We had to learn every
dinosaur bone that as far as

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.670
I could see everyone
at any one had dug up.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.620
But it wasn't really scientific,
it was just a memory test.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.540
- So how did your work of
transplanting a specialized cell

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:54.522
into an E-nucleated egg,
and then a tadpole emerge,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.600
how did that come about and
what were its implications?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.650
'Cause it was truly a revolutionary

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.700
moment in developmental biology.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.320
- Right, so the background there is that

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.510
the concept of using micro glass needles

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.311
to move things around had
actually been in operation

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.220
since around 1900, when
people, someone called

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.930
Bataillon did some work of that kind.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.410
But the real advance took
place when two people in

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.470
this country called
Briggs and King who were

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.460
the first to be able to,
within the vertebrates,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.410
take the nucleus out of a
cell and put it into an egg.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.463
And it worked extraordinarily well.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.360
The odd thing is that a few
years later they found that

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.650
when they started doing
this experiment with

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.370
somewhat later stages of development,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.930
taking the nuclei from later cells,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.693
it didn't work really at all.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.980
Also my supervisor put me onto this,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.880
copied their work at a very early stage.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.650
And we were lucky in that it
actually worked differently.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.940
And since the the more
advanced the cell was

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.860
from which you took the
nucleus, you nevertheless

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.903
ended up getting normal individuals.

00:16:05.023 --> 00:16:08.400
And that was really the
breakthrough that made all the

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.110
difference in my career, so
that you ended up with an

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.410
admittedly small number of
completely normal individuals.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.380
When you take the nuclear
site of an intestine cell,

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.690
put it into an egg, you
actually can end up with

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.630
normal adult fertile
animals, and that made me

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.820
take a different view of this
work from Briggs and King,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.400
who I greatly respected, and
indeed if I'd had their results

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.520
I'd have reached the
same conclusion as them.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.520
But at first it led to
quite a lot of controversy,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.240
I mean here was I just a graduate
student sort of contesting

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.470
the conclusions of two very
highly respected workers.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.100
So naturally enough people didn't believe

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.590
what I said, and I can see why.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.438
- What had they argued,
Briggs and his colleague?

00:16:55.438 --> 00:16:56.570
- Right, right.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.890
Well they quite reasonably
from their experiments

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.740
had argued that as an
embryo develops into a into

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.460
a little later embryo in an
organism, and at a very early

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.330
stage the nucleus of those
cells is no longer able to

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.157
replace the egg and sperm
that normally occupy the egg.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:18.157
And so the conclusion was
that as development proceeds,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.240
the genetic material undergoes
some kind of stable change

00:17:23.315 --> 00:17:27.840
which precludes it then
substituting for the egg and sperm.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.760
That's a very fundamental
question, and it has to do with

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.450
whether, as we form from an
egg, the genome so-called,

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.530
the set of genes, remains
constant or it doesn't.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.790
So it was it was a question
which had interested scientists

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.947
for at least fifty years before
that, and this was really

00:17:45.947 --> 00:17:49.023
the first really good attempt
to answer that question.

00:17:50.044 --> 00:17:52.970
- And may I ask what the
animals were that you were

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.743
dealing with, South African frogs, yeah.

00:17:54.743 --> 00:17:59.360
- Yes, it turns out that I
was, for a odd reason, but

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.590
there's quite a lot of
history to how it came that

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.160
a South African frog
turned out to be a favored,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.980
one of the most favored
organisms, which ultimately

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.190
came down to the fact that
someone had more children

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.920
than they could afford
to educate in England.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.660
So they went all around the
world ending up in South Africa

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.870
and finally ended up in
England when the animal

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.670
was used for human pregnancy tests.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.540
And the spare eggs were
then of use to people doing

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.020
developmental biology, so I used that.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.150
Now Briggs and King
used the American frog,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.150
which turned out to be less
good for these experiments.

00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:38.290
- So this a moment, a
very important moment in

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.400
the history of science, of
the biological sciences.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.280
What was what was that
feeling of creativity

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.780
like, that wow when this happened?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.399
Could you really talk about,
here you are tinkering,

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:57.990
and I gather from what I've
read that the really complicated

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.801
thing here is taking the cell
out and moving it around.

00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:06.680
So it's a very, somebody who's
worked with delicate items

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.120
like sailboats and walnuts
you said, is prepped.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.340
Talk a little about that.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.840
I mean, the difficulty
and then the aha moment.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.840
- Yes, so that that was an
early event in my PhD work

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.410
was to attempt this experiment which got,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.050
as I say, completely failed.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.580
And the most obvious reason
why it failed was that

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.230
when you used a micro glass
needle to put into the egg,

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.600
you could push it in and
it came out the other end

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.567
but it actually hadn't
entered the cell at all.

00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:39.080
It had taken the membranes
with it, pushed the whole lot

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.007
through out the other end and come back.

00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:44.840
And it turned out to be
impossible to get through this

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.670
very viscous jelly, so that
was the first major problem.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.370
And that was solved largely
by the fact that my mentor had

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.010
recently got a grant for a new microscope,

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.297
which had nothing to do with this work,

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.240
it was for an ultraviolet microscope.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.440
And we discovered more by
chance than anything else

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.480
that it happened to emit
light of a wavelength

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.352
that dissolved this elastic jelly.

00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:15.210
As it happens, it also
killed the resident nucleus,

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.300
so it was a extraordinary piece of

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.390
good fortune that that worked.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.360
And that then, suddenly
things started developing,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.910
you found that you
could do the experiment.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.864
And that was a key point, if that had

00:20:28.864 --> 00:20:30.760
went on and continued to fail,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.400
I really don't quite know
where one would have gone.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.950
- But talk a little about your feelings,

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.380
about that aha moment when this,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.596
I guess what you got was a mature,

00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:42.650
you got a tadpole, right?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.005
- You've got a tadpole,
that's absolutely right.

00:20:44.005 --> 00:20:45.070
- Right, right.
- That's right.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.300
- When previously nothing happened

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.591
at all, suddenly this thing.

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.490
So the next you thought,
well this is amazing,

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.569
could it actually be
right, that's the thing one

00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:55.240
always thinks, even at my stage.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.810
Whenever you get a result you think,

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.500
could there be an artifact?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.529
And there was an obvious
artifact and that would be that

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:04.940
the resident female
nucleus in that egg had not

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.330
been destroyed, and all
you've done by pushing

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.190
a needle in was to somehow activate that.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:15.190
So we needed a way of proving
that that was a rare result.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.690
And then another piece
of, partly good fortune,

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.570
partly wisdom of my mentor came about.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.660
He had a student who is doing
some completely different

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.070
experiments, and they failed
too, for an odd reason.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.720
Instead of him saying
well, do something else,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.020
he said there must be reason
why these are failing.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.940
So he discovered what turned
out to be a exceedingly

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.130
important mutation, which
acted as a genetic marker.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.450
And so we could put in the
nucleus of one cell which was

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.590
genetically marked into this
egg, grow the embryo up,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.350
and prove that the embryo
carried that genetic marker

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.140
appropriate to the nucleus you
put in, and not appropriate

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.830
to the resident nucleus that
you hope to have removed.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.293
And that was I think really why it was

00:22:02.293 --> 00:22:05.660
that the general scientific
public believed our results.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.690
They probably wouldn't
have done otherwise.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.380
So that was very important.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.150
- Now in terms of
science, this was a very,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.300
a real turning point in the road that led

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.393
to the cloning of Dolly many years later.

00:22:20.737 --> 00:22:24.550
And I wanna help our
audience understand this.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:29.550
So what you had, you won the Copley medal,

00:22:30.129 --> 00:22:34.500
which recognized your work that
had given decisive evidence

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.340
that specialized cells are
genetically equivalent,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.710
and they differ only in
the genes they express

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.315
and not the genes that
they contain, explain that.

00:22:45.315 --> 00:22:47.620
- It's a very precise
and accurate statement.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.760
So the idea, just going
back a little is that after,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.570
particularly after the
results of Briggs and King,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.820
the thought was that the nucleus
or the collection of genes

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.270
we have would actually change as the egg

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.240
develops into different cells.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.410
So our skin, intestine,
brain, blood and muscle would

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.020
all have different sets of genes.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.090
Because they would lose the
ones that you no longer need.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.910
So the, for example the skin
cells don't need brain genes.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.480
And indeed it was an idea of
someone in the 1880s called

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.717
Weissman that that's indeed
how development worked.

00:23:22.717 --> 00:23:26.270
It was a plausible idea, as
the egg develops it sheds off

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.120
these genes, and so as the
cell decides to follow a

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.790
particular pathway, that's
a very neat way of doing it.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.617
You get rid of the genes.

00:23:35.617 --> 00:23:38.810
And so it gets narrowed down to that fate.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.560
And the really important thing
about this question and the

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.100
experiments was that that
turns out not to be the case.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.320
So all our cells with
very minor exceptions

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.350
contain the same set of genes.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.970
And I would say that's
fundamental in any kind of

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.450
cell replacement therapy
which we might envisage.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.270
And indeed, obviously if
that had not been true

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.020
Dolly the sheep could
not have been formed.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.967
But it turns out it is that way,

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:07.940
and so what we now understand
(coughs) excuse me,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.730
is that as cells develop they
contain the same set of genes.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.054
The only difference is that
something decided to read

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:19.020
the skin genes in skin,
and brain genes in brain.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.370
So that's what they meant by
expression in that statement.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.900
- Now why did it take so long,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.930
because we're talking about
a 30 year interval, really.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.720
Your experiment was in what year?

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.790
- Well the first time we got an adult,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.340
a successful adult it was 1958.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.510
- [Harry] Oh, really, oh, okay.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.720
So why so long?

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.270
- Yes, very good question
and I've wondered

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.683
about that, too, and I've
tried to explore that.

00:24:40.683 --> 00:24:44.690
Now, one reason for that was
that (clears throat) excuse me,

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.440
when they were doing these
experiments of mammals,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.240
and I might have stared that
I had a PhD student in early

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.084
1960s who did indeed try
transplanting nuclei in rabbits.

00:24:55.084 --> 00:24:58.800
And it didn't work or at
least not significantly well.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.880
And then that got left aside, now why?

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.490
And the reason is that
someone called Davel Salto

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.270
took this up very seriously
and did a lot of experiments,

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.980
and he found that you
the best you could do was

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.980
take a nucleus out of a two cell embryo

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.850
and put it back into a one cell embryo.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.410
If you did anything else,
anything further they didn't work.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.700
Now it turns out the
explanation is that if you put,

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.460
transplant a nucleus into a
fertilized egg, an activated egg

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.300
that's already started, it's
extremely difficult to do

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.573
and it doesn't like to
receive that nucleus.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.800
We had always chosen
to do experiments using

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.535
un-activated eggs, they're sort
of naive and waiting to go.

00:25:39.535 --> 00:25:43.610
And for reasons that I'm
only partly clear about,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.420
that was not done in
the early mammal work.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.310
They felt that a better route would be to,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.409
and they had reasons for doing that,

00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:53.520
to thinking of going
into the fertilized egg,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.200
but it essentially doesn't work.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.050
And Davel Salto did, it was
very careful experiments

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.853
published through very good
journalists explaining that

00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:03.490
that this particular route
he used does not work,

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.060
and indeed it doesn't.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.220
But switching back to
the route that was done

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.750
with amphibia it actually does work,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.610
and that's how Dolly the
sheep came to be successful.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.380
So it's not entirely clear
to me why they wouldn't have

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.420
tried that, I think it was
technically more difficult.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.660
But that seems to be the
explanation so you're quite right,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.140
it took about forty years
for this essentially similar

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.700
result, in many respects, to be obtained.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.410
- And I gather it was really out of

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.080
industrial experimentation as opposed to

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.090
coming out of university
science, is that --

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.430
- Dolly the sheep?
- Yes, yeah.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.840
- Well I'm not so sure that that's right,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.428
I don't really know
whether perhaps that is,

00:26:41.428 --> 00:26:43.550
never really asked, it
came out of an institute

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.600
that had a lot of industrial support

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.090
called the Roslin
Institute, but it wasn't,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.510
I don't believe that they
were really being told

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.630
we we want you to do this work

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.560
because it's going to be profitable.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.210
I don't think there
was a perceived profit,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.440
it was more that it was
exploratory work with animals.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.730
Hence the sheep, not a mouse.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.200
- So what what directions
then did your research

00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:12.870
take after this, help us
understand that and we'll talk a

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.780
little about what you were
lecturing about here at Berkeley.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.300
- Yes, right, well the, I mean if we,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.250
we could say it this way, that
my only results tell me that

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.202
actually the way development
works, and that was the

00:27:24.202 --> 00:27:26.788
fundamental question I've
always been interested in,

00:27:26.788 --> 00:27:28.470
interested how does an egg make an animal?

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.580
It's an extraordinary process,
I should just emphasize,

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.410
because this egg has no,
no one tells it what to do.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.680
Just one cell and somehow it knows how

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.070
to make an animal, so how is that?

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.940
Well, we were satisfied
then that that's not

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.420
by any loss of genes, the genes are there,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.100
so something must read the genes,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.250
decide which genes to to
read and which ones not to.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.283
That then took me off in
a number of directions,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.110
much of which I talked
about yesterday, which is

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.301
what kind of thing tells
the cell that it must

00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:03.373
read one gene not another,
and that was how we got into

00:28:03.373 --> 00:28:06.810
what I call morphogen gradients,
signals that come from

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.290
another cell and say, I want you now

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.980
to read that gene not another one.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.560
And that then was a large
part of my mid-career,

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.450
and dealt with the morphogen gradients,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.423
community effects, signaling and so on.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.110
And then much more recently I've gone

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.760
right back to the original question of

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.000
how is a transplanted
nucleus reprogrammed?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.990
What I'm going to be talking about today.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.100
And I see that as all connected,
it's all the same question.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.980
Just going off one direction
and then coming back

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.420
to the same one, perhaps
another direction,

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.080
it's all going back to the same question

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.940
to try and understand
ultimately how this happens.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.300
- Yesterday I noticed, and
now that I know you were

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.850
a classicist, you, I think
the headline on the slide

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.900
you were showing was cell commitment

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.900
to future development, so
let's talk a little about that.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.880
Because what you were telling
us, and were really four ways

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880
that a cell after formation
would would commit to a path of

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.910
development, what are those four elements?

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.680
- Yes, well one of the things which you

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.500
certainly absorb very
well, and which I refer to

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.640
again today is this surprising
fact that when the cell

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.240
begins to set out on its
on its career and pathway

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.872
to become something like skin or muscle,

00:29:30.872 --> 00:29:35.872
at an amazingly early stage it
refuses to change direction.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.620
Even within a matter of
hours, that says I'm going in

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.960
this direction, I'm not going
to go any other direction.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.120
And as long as I'm left as a whole cell,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.340
so inside that cell it's
sort of re-instructing itself

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.080
to keep going in this direction,
won't take another pathway.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.850
And the point that I will
make today is that if you then

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.830
take that cell apart and
take the nucleus away,

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.180
then it's completely
happy to change direction.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.380
So it's a surprising contrast
between a whole cell,

00:30:09.488 --> 00:30:12.670
which is committed to
a particular pathway,

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.350
hence commitment, as opposed to the

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.220
individual parts of
the cell which are not.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.754
- Now in this initial process,
I think you identified

00:30:20.754 --> 00:30:25.754
four elements that said it's on this path.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.450
To repeat them, that the
pre-fertilization controlled

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.772
development, asymmetric cell
division, signaling between

00:30:32.772 --> 00:30:37.310
cells, and then what you
call a community effect.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.920
Summarize that for our
television audience.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.710
In other, so what you
have is a set of processes

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.140
at work that say you're
going this way, fella.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.210
- Yes, that's right, that's
exactly right, what you say.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:57.210
And the, in a way surprising
thing is, (clears throat)

00:30:57.304 --> 00:30:59.340
excuse me, this egg which is, you know,

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.620
we we eat a chicken's
egg or see frog eggs.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.230
But the egg before it's
received a new sperm

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.040
already has a fair amount
of information in it.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.270
In fact it's taken, in many
cases as much as a year

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.660
to make that egg from us
very specialized cell,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.000
and that already is a part
of the whole of our life,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.370
is determined before fertilization.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.520
So that's point one, and
then the the other thing is

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.470
I emphasize, but this asymmetric
division is a way of again

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.910
telling cells to choose one
pathway as opposed to another.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.930
And then of overall importance
is this signaling by which

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.800
a cell receives molecules
telling it in which way to go,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.300
of which the community
factors are variant.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.610
So it's a progressive process,
and I think that's a logical

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.760
way of viewing it, with four
steps that are fundamentally

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.950
responsible for deriving a thing like

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.650
a heart or brain cell from an egg.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.160
- Now, either the humanist in you made

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.400
the comparison between the phrase...

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.520
faith hope and charity, and of these

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.630
the most important is charity.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.160
And you turn that around to say

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.313
space, time, and concentration,

00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:14.460
and with concentration
being the most important.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.293
- That's right.

00:32:15.293 --> 00:32:20.100
- So these are the factors
that set us on this course.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.860
- Yes, I've increasingly
become intrigued with how

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.255
precisely things work, so
let me give you an example.

00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:31.550
There's a phrase called
haploinsufficiency syndrome.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.450
Now, all that means is that
you and I have one gene

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.570
inherited from our mother
and one from our father,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.120
so we have two genes that
should do the same thing.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.250
Sometimes things go wrong, and one of them

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.280
isn't any good, so we only have one.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.640
Now amazingly in a number
of cases, if you have

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.470
one copy of a gene instead
of two, things go wrong.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.100
Now that means that a
factor of two difference

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.790
makes an enormous difference,
and indeed other experiments

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.360
are referred to, so factors of
three make a huge difference.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.800
So everything in us is
regulated to an extraordinarily

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.980
precise degree in actually concentration.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.710
And that when you go into this in detail,

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.470
as much of my career has been involved,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.010
it turns out that that's
the single most pivotal

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.300
component in making
things work the way we do,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.340
is the concentration of things.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.803
So that was why I chose
to emphasize that point.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.440
- Talk a little about this reverse process

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.760
which you're gonna be
talking about this evening.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.630
I haven't had the fortune
yet to hear that lecture

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:39.590
but what then becomes the
implication for all this work

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.120
in stem cells of what we
might achieve with that.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.770
- Yes well what I will be
saying is that if you take

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.730
the nucleus genetic material
out of one of these cells

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.260
that are quite clearly
committed, they know

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.383
what they're going to do
and nothing will change it.

00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:56.720
But you take that nucleus
out and put it into the egg,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.340
then that essentially rejuvenates
that nucleus in most cases

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:06.320
and what I'll show is that you
can take a cell from an adult

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.520
put it through this process
and it then essentially forgets

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.000
everything it knew about following

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.404
that pathway and starts life again.

00:34:14.404 --> 00:34:16.490
And there are things
called stem cell genes,

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.470
genes which mark the
fact that it's gone back

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.490
to the beginning of life again.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:24.760
And so that in a sense
creates a stem cell,

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.162
because if you go right back
to the beginning of development

00:34:27.162 --> 00:34:29.850
the ultimate stem cell is an egg,

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.510
because it can form everything at all.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.710
It's totally potent.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.590
And you recreate these sort
of universal stem cells

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.630
by this procedure, so that's
what I refer to my talk as,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.420
from egg to adult and back again.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.290
Take it right back to the beginning again.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.500
And of course if we could make
that work really efficiently,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.670
I do believe this would
give the opportunity

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.840
for cell replacement in humans.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.400
- So that one could
use one's own materials

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.130
to actually make repairs.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.150
- That's absolutely correct.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.477
- Right.
- Yeah, that's right.

00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:07.310
- And the key thing which
I haven't said yet is that

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.700
in terms of replacement,
all of us eventually

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.150
would welcome some replacement of parts.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.770
You really like to have
cells of your own genetic

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.990
constitution, so you can
receive cells from other people

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.640
but you may know that if
you do, you have to be

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.080
subjected to what's
called immunosuppression.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.650
It means you can't reject
the cells and of course

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.890
you also can't reject any
infections that you get.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.940
So immuno-suppressed people
are quite disadvantaged.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.880
In an ideal world, we would give ourselves

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.290
rejuvenated cells of our
own genetic constitution.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.680
And this, whatever you call
it, cloning or anything

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.240
like that, that is actually
the only efficient way

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.580
in which you can hope
to derive rejuvenated

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.870
embryonic cells from your own adult cells.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:57.870
- Now what are the big
obstacles to achieving this in,

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.920
within terms of a lack
of information, or what?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.550
- Right, so the big obstacle is

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.040
that it works, but not very well.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.880
That's the fact of the matter.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.864
And so when you do this, you sometimes get

00:36:09.864 --> 00:36:12.930
amazing results, like I
mentioned the adult animal

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.720
derived from an embryo
cell or Dolly the sheep

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.100
derived from mammary glands, spectacular,

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:22.020
and it can work, but the
efficiency with which it works

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.091
is actually extremely low.

00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:27.320
And that is the reason why
my own work for example

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.680
is completely committed
now to trying to understand

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.590
the mechanism, molecular
mechanism of how it is

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.940
that you rejuvenate a nucleus,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.650
send it back to the beginning again.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.320
'Cause my view is that only
if we really understand

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.810
that mechanism, can we hope
to make this work efficiently

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:48.303
enough to actually be useful
in a therapeutic sense.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.330
- I wanna go back to this
earlier career of you as

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.930
a humanist, which you
turned away from because

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:01.691
this is really, this
work is raising a lot of

00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:06.080
sort of big questions about who we are

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.900
and where we might go and so on.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.940
How do you think about
that, or is it part of

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.310
the professional list of a scientist

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.390
not to focus on those questions?

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.520
- Well I do think about
it, and I shall say

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.250
a bit about that today, but
my own view in short is that

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:27.250
there's completely unjustifiable
concern on these issues,

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.870
people talk about the ethics of this.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.090
And they would say for example that if you

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.480
transplant the nucleus
of one of your skin cells

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.990
into a donated egg from
some woman, this will form

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.097
an early, very early embryo, and it would.

00:37:43.097 --> 00:37:46.730
And they say that is a
potential human life.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.160
I would completely disagree with that

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.980
on the grounds that it is
not a potential human life

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.210
in the absence of implantation,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.050
a key step in mammalian development.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.410
So I see this rather
skeptical where people who are

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.050
in good health, in high places,
whether they're lawyers or

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.550
whatever sitting there
and saying, I'm fine,

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.710
but I don't like you to
do these experiments which

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.690
might in fact greatly improve
the health of other people.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:15.170
So I find that quite an
unacceptable philosophy.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.200
So I would say this early
human embryo is actually

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.050
not a potential life and
has no significant validity.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.700
I don't think it may or may not

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.210
have a soul, it doesn't matter,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.530
The fact is it's not going to,
you're not killing anything

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.200
that's significant, and if you don't do it

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.590
you're then not taking advantage
in the way that we could

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.840
of relieving an awful
lot of human suffering.

00:38:36.818 --> 00:38:40.910
- So it is that practical
application and the

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.590
intention here of the
good that might be done

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.930
that should define the process.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.880
Are there things that
we should worry about

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.420
in this process that
might get out of control,

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.420
and that is that, what is
your insight on that problem?

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.780
- Yes, well I, at the end
of my talk today I shall

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.427
go through five reasons why
people might object to that.

00:39:05.427 --> 00:39:08.930
And one of the ones which I
find particularly unpersuasive

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.910
is what I call the thin
end of the wedge argument.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.370
So they say you scientists
are doing this kind of thing,

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.700
that's okay, but they say we
don't know what you'll do next,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.230
we'd better stop it quickly
before anything worse happens.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.900
It's a very bad argument,
and I shall go through these

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.150
points, and I don't think any of them have

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.273
any worthwhile validity, to be honest.

00:39:31.956 --> 00:39:36.956
- And how do you see the the
commercialization of this,

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.740
these insights ultimately being achieved?

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.860
Will the scientific breakthrough

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.430
lead the market to see the implications,

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.100
and then it will happen
in a broader scale?

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.420
- Well that's an interesting
question of whether

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.420
there will be commercial
gain from this kind.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.640
Let's assume the technology,
like most, improves,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.860
people find out how to do a
thing and it works better.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.340
It's unclear to me how
commercially useful that will be.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.030
The end point of my work that
I'm currently engaged in,

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.640
if it were to go well,
would be to understand

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.850
what molecules you need
to rejuvenate a nucleus

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.400
and create a universal stem cell.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.550
So now if that was some
special molecule which I could

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.470
put a patent or patent on,
maybe there'd be money in that

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.730
but I rather doubt if
it will work that way.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.180
So I'm not sure that there is
going to be a huge commercial

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.053
consequence of this work,
however successful it might be.

00:40:39.043 --> 00:40:40.670
- What would be your advice to students

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.910
as they prepare for their future?

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:47.910
Your career stands out as
one where rejection paid off

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.890
once you chose to do
what you wanted to do.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:55.890
- Yes, I'm very troubled that
every now and then one has

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.620
extremely gifted PhD students,
and I'm lucky enough to have

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.680
those from time to time,
and almost without exception

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.960
the recent ones have all given up science

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.370
and gone into the finance world.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.528
I regret that, and I'd
like to say to them,

00:41:09.528 --> 00:41:12.360
consider yourselves at
the end of your career.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.880
You will have probably made
a large amount of money

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.720
and you'll have an expensive
car and a big house

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.640
and you can take holidays
wherever you want,

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.560
but is that really what
you want out of your life,

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.640
or would you rather say that
what you've been able to do is

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.800
to make a real difference
to the quality of human life

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.270
by relieving suffering, in
the way that centuries later

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.470
they say oh you know, Dr.
Chrysler, you actually did

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.800
some of this work which was
really helped the whole of

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.070
human society rather
than, you have actually

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.270
made enough money to live comfortably.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.710
So I would hope that progressively,
people will be prepared

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.680
to see, look at their life
as a whole and look at the

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.160
end point, other than in
simply financial terms.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.400
And when I was young that
was, the scientific career was

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.270
regarded, highly regarded
as a good career.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.070
and I think it's unfortunately less so now

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.830
largely because it's very poorly rewarded,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.320
at least in Europe, financially.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.040
So he will have to suffer.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.380
But in the long run that
will probably change.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.300
- What, looking down
the road, should we be,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.220
the general public be
watching for in terms of

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.180
milestones, are there
certain questions out there

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.140
that in this work that you're describing

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.670
we hope to be getting the answers from?

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.250
- Now, do you mean what they should be

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.670
looking towards as a positive effect --

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.740
- [Harry] Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.010
- Not worrying about a negative effect.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:34.470
- Yes, right, worrying about a

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.956
positive, yes, yeah yeah yeah.

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:37.240
- Looking about the positive,
what can they hope for.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.610
- In other words in this
realm of questions that you're

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:43.770
dealing with, some, a couple
of questions, or one that

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:48.370
stands out that needs to be
answered in the next stage

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.660
to achieve these positive developments?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.630
- Well in my opinion the single
most important steps will be

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.630
to understand how this rejuvenation
process actually works.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.440
And we and others are beginning
to pick away at that problem

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.783
and to give you some feeling for it,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.670
we have to know what it
is that removes the marks,

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:17.670
as they're called, that make
a a set of genes specialized.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.140
So as you have your cells
becoming, say, skin cells,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.400
they actually switch off, as we've said,

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.340
the genes needed for the brain.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.600
They're there, but they're
not very easily activatable,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.080
and they acquire marks which
for example they're called

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.790
methylation of DNA is one such thing.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.250
And we know actually nothing at

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.100
the moment about how that is reversed.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.000
It is reversed, I have
no idea how it's done so.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.093
But if it isn't reversed it won't,

00:43:43.093 --> 00:43:44.937
the whole process won't work.

00:43:44.937 --> 00:43:48.150
So you can divide the whole
process into a few steps

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.550
like that, and I think that's
what we would be watching for

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.350
to see as people gradually
find a way of reversing these

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.900
marks, that gets it back
the beginning again,

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.910
and then of course you
have to start telling it

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.130
in which direction to go after that.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.790
But this reversal process
is undoubtedly complicated,

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.390
but I'm quite sure it will
be eventually worked out,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.600
and those are the steps
which were ultimately,

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.120
if it really works well, just
to give you a feeling for this

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.560
I would say eventually we should
be able to take a skin cell

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.570
and apply these molecules,
which we by then would have

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.150
found out what they are, to that skin cell

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.950
to directly switch it back
into an embryonic cell,

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.160
from which you can derive
heart muscle brain and so on.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.567
So that's the ultimate vision
one would have of this.

00:44:34.567 --> 00:44:36.670
- And then one final
question, where do you think

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.330
the leadership will be in
in these new directions,

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.766
do you think the politics
of some countries, unnamed,

00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:46.610
will affect its future leadership role?

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.670
Because although in
your mind a lot of these

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.530
ethical issues are
resolved, they have become

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.873
political issues in some countries.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.490
- So I would doubt whether the
constraints or restrictions

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.995
which do apply in this country
and even more in some others

00:45:03.995 --> 00:45:08.360
are really holding up progress
significantly at the moment.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.490
It's unrealistic to do
experiments with human eggs,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.800
just an inefficient way of doing it.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.290
And once you know how a
thing works in a mouse egg

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:20.020
or even in a fish or frog egg,

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.390
the principles usually
turn out to be similar.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.090
So if we really knew how
it worked in a mouse,

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.920
for example, it wouldn't be that difficult

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.430
to switch over to humans, and
I would assume that by then

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.870
any public concern will have evaporated.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:39.370
Let me give an example, it was
the in-vitro fertilization,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.950
as we call it, was invented
primarily by Bob Edwards

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.250
in Britain, as it happens,
and the first two years

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:49.910
when he did it he got
terrible abuse, bad press,

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.760
letters of people
threatening his life, etc,

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.040
For all sorts of, they said
unnatural, we don't like this.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.040
But in a couple of years it
turned out to be very useful.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.660
And the whole thing's
completely forgotten.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.370
So I think what will happen
in the world is people will

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.730
realize that this is a really
valuable kind of direction

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.550
to follow, and these
reservations will just evaporate.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.150
- Sir John, on that hopeful
note I want to thank you very

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.300
much for taking the time to be
here today and thank you for

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.203
delivering the Hitchcock lectures
on the campus, thank you.

00:46:20.203 --> 00:46:21.600
- Thank you very much for your

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.350
interesting questions and discussion.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.440
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.663
for this Conversation with History.
