don't really use it if it don't really
mean to use it another thing what we

00:08:59.759 --> 00:08:59.769
mean to use it another thing what we
 

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:01.980
mean to use it another thing what we
were doing is integration so a lot of

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:01.990
were doing is integration so a lot of
 

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.660
were doing is integration so a lot of
integration work was going for example

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.670
integration work was going for example
 

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.610
integration work was going for example

another thing what we were doing is

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:16.660
another thing what we were doing is
 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.319
another thing what we were doing is
instant app support in snap support is

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:19.329
instant app support in snap support is
 

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:20.880
instant app support in snap support is
ready to roll out and if your

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:20.890
ready to roll out and if your
 

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.680
ready to roll out and if your
application is doing this you will

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.690
application is doing this you will
 

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.939
application is doing this you will
actually see that very shortly I oh I

00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:26.949
actually see that very shortly I oh I
 

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:30.210
actually see that very shortly I oh I
have seen this somewhere well this is

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.220
have seen this somewhere well this is
 

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.300
have seen this somewhere well this is
meant to be exactly as mint input and

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
meant to be exactly as mint input and
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.400
meant to be exactly as mint input and
output so we have done various things

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.410
output so we have done various things
 

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.519

Android application will be able to

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.310
Android application will be able to
 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.790
Android application will be able to
access it directly so that was one of

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800
access it directly so that was one of
 

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.900
access it directly so that was one of
the big asks from last year

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:52.910
 

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.000
another thing is play fires so this is

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.010
another thing is play fires so this is
 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.590
another thing is play fires so this is
something which is if you ever use the

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600
something which is if you ever use the
 

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.260
something which is if you ever use the
Chrome or as files browser you have

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.270
Chrome or as files browser you have
 

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.760
Chrome or as files browser you have
possibly seen that there was no way of

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:01.770
possibly seen that there was no way of
 

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.830
possibly seen that there was no way of
accessing the Android files if you want

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:03.840
accessing the Android files if you want
 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.720
accessing the Android files if you want
to send something or inspect something

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:05.730
to send something or inspect something
 

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.300
to send something or inspect something
well now inside this tool you have

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.310
well now inside this tool you have
 

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.700
well now inside this tool you have
actually also play files which is the

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:10.710
actually also play files which is the
 

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.040
actually also play files which is the
mirror of SD card so you can get to all

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.050
mirror of SD card so you can get to all
 

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.960
mirror of SD card so you can get to all
these files another thing is if you have

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:16.970
these files another thing is if you have
 

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.810
these files another thing is if you have
documents provider API like for example

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820
documents provider API like for example
 

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.440
documents provider API like for example
Google Drive Dropbox or anything like

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.450
Google Drive Dropbox or anything like
 

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.540
Google Drive Dropbox or anything like
that they will actually be reflected now

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:26.550
that they will actually be reflected now
 

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.190
that they will actually be reflected now
also in the files application so

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200
also in the files application so
 

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.170
also in the files application so
basically this is fully transparent and

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180
basically this is fully transparent and
 

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.300
basically this is fully transparent and
it's running inside chrome space but

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.310
it's running inside chrome space but
 

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.190
it's running inside chrome space but
it's using all the Android features on

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200
it's using all the Android features on
 

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.930
it's using all the Android features on
that point so you can drag and drop

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940
that point so you can drag and drop
 

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.760
that point so you can drag and drop
files now from all these cloud storage

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:37.770
files now from all these cloud storage
 

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.060
files now from all these cloud storage
providers without anything thinking

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.070
providers without anything thinking
 

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.070
providers without anything thinking
about that and if you have if you're

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080
about that and if you have if you're
 

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.830
about that and if you have if you're
using this cloud provider API for your

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:45.840
using this cloud provider API for your
 

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.930
using this cloud provider API for your
own applications you can even then make

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940
own applications you can even then make
 

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.630
own applications you can even then make
it that you can actually use this

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:49.640
it that you can actually use this
 

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.820
it that you can actually use this
directly so like editing our files and

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:52.830
directly so like editing our files and
 

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.750
directly so like editing our files and
so on manage devices we head there also

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760
so on manage devices we head there also
 

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.960
so on manage devices we head there also
several new add-on so first off we were

00:10:59.960 --> 00:10:59.970
several new add-on so first off we were
 

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.000
several new add-on so first off we were
improving the installation speed four

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.010
improving the installation speed four
 

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.030
improving the installation speed four
minutes two seconds and it's also much

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040
minutes two seconds and it's also much
 

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.500
minutes two seconds and it's also much
more secure so as therefore it should be

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:06.510
more secure so as therefore it should be
 

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.990
more secure so as therefore it should be
now really be installed when an

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000
now really be installed when an
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.110
now really be installed when an
administrator is asking for it another

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120
administrator is asking for it another
 

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.640
administrator is asking for it another
thing what we were doing is when you are

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:13.650
thing what we were doing is when you are
 

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.640
thing what we were doing is when you are
using the VPN connection from Chrome OS

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:15.650
using the VPN connection from Chrome OS
 

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.950
using the VPN connection from Chrome OS
then Android will automatically use the

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:18.960
then Android will automatically use the
 

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.290
then Android will automatically use the
same VPN connection which is a huge

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300
same VPN connection which is a huge
 

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.579
same VPN connection which is a huge
improvement in regards of security so

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:25.589
improvement in regards of security so
 

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:26.990
improvement in regards of security so
now I'm coming to the most important

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000
now I'm coming to the most important
 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.700
now I'm coming to the most important
thing for you because this is a section

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:28.710
thing for you because this is a section
 

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.060
thing for you because this is a section
which is explicitly trying to target all

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.070
which is explicitly trying to target all
 

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.020
which is explicitly trying to target all
the things where you should actually

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.030
the things where you should actually
 

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.450
the things where you should actually
watch out for to make your application

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:35.460
watch out for to make your application
 

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.990
watch out for to make your application
shine on Chrome OS so let's have a look

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000
shine on Chrome OS so let's have a look
 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.670
shine on Chrome OS so let's have a look
multi-monitor this is not really new

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680
multi-monitor this is not really new
 

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.980
multi-monitor this is not really new
right we're talking about this one

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:42.990
right we're talking about this one
 

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.020
right we're talking about this one
already last year but one of the things

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.030
already last year but one of the things
 

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.630
already last year but one of the things
what we were silently doing behind the

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640
what we were silently doing behind the
 

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.820
what we were silently doing behind the
day behind the scenes was we were doing

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:49.830
day behind the scenes was we were doing
 

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.500
day behind the scenes was we were doing
a lot of scaling because the thing is if

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.510
a lot of scaling because the thing is if
 

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.150
a lot of scaling because the thing is if
you have an internal small monitor which

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160
you have an internal small monitor which
 

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.730
you have an internal small monitor which
is 4k and you have an external big

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740
is 4k and you have an external big
 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.190
is 4k and you have an external big
screen which is maybe even also 4k then

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200
screen which is maybe even also 4k then
 

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.740
screen which is maybe even also 4k then
there is an a size differential of two

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:00.750
there is an a size differential of two
 

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.720
there is an a size differential of two
to one which basically means if you are

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:02.730
to one which basically means if you are
 

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.700

dragging a window from A to B

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:04.710
dragging a window from A to B
 

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.070
dragging a window from A to B
suddenly it becomes like a giant mess so

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.080
suddenly it becomes like a giant mess so
 

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.330
suddenly it becomes like a giant mess so
and therefore that is something what the

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.340
and therefore that is something what the
 

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.440
and therefore that is something what the
user doesn't really want to see so

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.450
user doesn't really want to see so
 

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.000
user doesn't really want to see so
therefore what we do is we scaled that

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.010
therefore what we do is we scaled that
 

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.490
therefore what we do is we scaled that
sink down to match the same size as on

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500
sink down to match the same size as on
 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.310
sink down to match the same size as on
the on the notebook but the problem with

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320
the on the notebook but the problem with
 

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.950
the on the notebook but the problem with
that is of course that well scaling

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:18.960
that is of course that well scaling
 

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960
that is of course that well scaling
means like you are losing some some

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:20.970
means like you are losing some some
 

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.580
means like you are losing some some
information from the thing it's getting

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.590
information from the thing it's getting
 

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.170
information from the thing it's getting
blurry it's not really that great so and

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.180
blurry it's not really that great so and
 

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.520
blurry it's not really that great so and
therefore what we are trying to do going

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:28.530
therefore what we are trying to do going
 

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.110
therefore what we are trying to do going
forward this we will actually change the

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120
forward this we will actually change the
 

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.300
forward this we will actually change the
density on the on the fly that is

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.310
density on the on the fly that is
 

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.560
density on the on the fly that is
something what we were talking about

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.570
something what we were talking about
 

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.510
something what we were talking about
last year and the year before about

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:35.520
last year and the year before about
 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.500
last year and the year before about
changing the size so this is now the

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.510
changing the size so this is now the
 

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.450
changing the size so this is now the
next thing which is the next and the

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:41.460
next thing which is the next and the
 

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.010
next thing which is the next and the
last thing that we are asking anything

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:43.020
last thing that we are asking anything
 

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.710
last thing that we are asking anything
from you is to actually make your

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720
from you is to actually make your
 

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.690
from you is to actually make your
application be aware of different

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700
application be aware of different
 

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.060
application be aware of different
densities on an activity level so don't

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.070
densities on an activity level so don't
 

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.980
densities on an activity level so don't
do that into inside your service or what

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:51.990
do that into inside your service or what
 

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.050
do that into inside your service or what
not do it actually inside the activity

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060
not do it actually inside the activity
 

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.430
not do it actually inside the activity
because you might actually move to a

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440
because you might actually move to a
 

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.660
because you might actually move to a
Windows on the screen and you never know

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:56.670
Windows on the screen and you never know
 

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.600
Windows on the screen and you never know
where this right so and because that if

00:12:59.600 --> 00:12:59.610
where this right so and because that if
 

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.370
where this right so and because that if
you're using on configuration changes

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380
you're using on configuration changes
 

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.680
you're using on configuration changes
check out the density and otherwise

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:03.690
check out the density and otherwise
 

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.770
check out the density and otherwise
listen to these kind of events

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:05.780
listen to these kind of events
 

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.930
listen to these kind of events
so gaming if you were ever using gaming

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940
so gaming if you were ever using gaming
 

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.820
so gaming if you were ever using gaming
and you were using a game controller you

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:10.830
and you were using a game controller you
 

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.590
and you were using a game controller you
have possibly noticed that there is not

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600
have possibly noticed that there is not
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.350
have possibly noticed that there is not
really much of what Android is doing so

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360
really much of what Android is doing so
 

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.370
really much of what Android is doing so
you cannot really figure out how many

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380
you cannot really figure out how many
 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.590
you cannot really figure out how many
controllers are connected and if the

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600
controllers are connected and if the
 

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.060
controllers are connected and if the
mapping was wrong it didn't really work

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.070
mapping was wrong it didn't really work
 

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.700
mapping was wrong it didn't really work
we are changing this basically very soon

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:22.710
we are changing this basically very soon
 

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.980
we are changing this basically very soon
you will actually have the standard API

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:24.990
you will actually have the standard API
 

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.650
you will actually have the standard API
which is on any phone so if you want to

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660
which is on any phone so if you want to
 

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.180
which is on any phone so if you want to
test it out test it on your phone if

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:29.190
test it out test it on your phone if
 

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.010
test it out test it on your phone if
it's working there it'll work in the

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.020
it's working there it'll work in the
 

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.670
it's working there it'll work in the
future well then say its relative mouse

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680
future well then say its relative mouse
 

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.890
future well then say its relative mouse
positioning which is used by all kinds

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:36.900
positioning which is used by all kinds
 

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.690
positioning which is used by all kinds
of first-person shooters and whatnot we

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700
of first-person shooters and whatnot we
 

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.090
of first-person shooters and whatnot we
have that also now supported which went

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100
have that also now supported which went
 

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.240
have that also now supported which went
out in m74 which is now and file well in

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.250
out in m74 which is now and file well in
 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.090
out in m74 which is now and file well in
in in release state so you can request

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100
in in release state so you can request
 

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.190
in in release state so you can request
the pointer and you can actually listen

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200
the pointer and you can actually listen
 

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.160
the pointer and you can actually listen
then to all changes and go for that so

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.170
then to all changes and go for that so
 

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.450
then to all changes and go for that so
and with that I'm coming to the most

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:53.460
and with that I'm coming to the most
 

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.100
and with that I'm coming to the most
important topic of this talk which is

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.110
important topic of this talk which is
 

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.440
important topic of this talk which is
animation junk well if you were ever

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.450
animation junk well if you were ever
 

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.060
animation junk well if you were ever
doing any kind of animations you have

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.070
doing any kind of animations you have
 

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.100
doing any kind of animations you have
possibly seen kind some kind of jank

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.110
possibly seen kind some kind of jank
 

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.810
possibly seen kind some kind of jank
what is jank it's something like when

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820
what is jank it's something like when
 

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820
what is jank it's something like when
something moves very slowly suddenly you

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:04.830
something moves very slowly suddenly you
 

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.800
something moves very slowly suddenly you
see this kind of hiccup when something

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:06.810
see this kind of hiccup when something
 

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.590
see this kind of hiccup when something
is like stuck and then continuing so and

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600
is like stuck and then continuing so and
 

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.470
is like stuck and then continuing so and
there is unfortunately no tool after now

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480
there is unfortunately no tool after now
 

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.930
there is unfortunately no tool after now
which shows you where this hiccup is

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940
which shows you where this hiccup is
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.820
which shows you where this hiccup is
coming from but we were working on that

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:16.830
coming from but we were working on that
 

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.800
coming from but we were working on that
very hard so

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.810
very hard so
 

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.990
very hard so
and for that I have a small presentation

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000
and for that I have a small presentation
 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.210
and for that I have a small presentation
for that so unfortunately this is not

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:22.220
for that so unfortunately this is not
 

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.310
for that so unfortunately this is not
that easy there are a lot of boxes but

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320
that easy there are a lot of boxes but
 

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.440
that easy there are a lot of boxes but
don't be scared if you have never seen

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:26.450
don't be scared if you have never seen
 

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:26.890
don't be scared if you have never seen
them before

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:26.900
them before
 

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.260
them before
I will actually get used to ever say so

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:29.270
I will actually get used to ever say so
 

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.240
I will actually get used to ever say so
first off when you look into a standard

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.250
first off when you look into a standard
 

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.090
first off when you look into a standard
application it is usually using double

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.100
application it is usually using double
 

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.650
application it is usually using double
buffering what does double buffering

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:35.660
buffering what does double buffering
 

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.390
buffering what does double buffering
means it means you have one buffer which

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.400
means it means you have one buffer which
 

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.070
means it means you have one buffer which
is being shown and one buffer which is

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:39.080
is being shown and one buffer which is
 

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.810
is being shown and one buffer which is
being rendered - and you are constantly

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:40.820
being rendered - and you are constantly
 

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.610
being rendered - and you are constantly
iterating between the two of them and

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:42.620
iterating between the two of them and
 

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.710
iterating between the two of them and
this application is basically it's

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720
this application is basically it's
 

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.690
this application is basically it's
getting the buffer it's rendering to the

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:46.700
getting the buffer it's rendering to the
 

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.550
getting the buffer it's rendering to the
buffer and it's submitting the buffer to

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560
buffer and it's submitting the buffer to
 

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.430
buffer and it's submitting the buffer to
be displayed and then it's doing the

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440
be displayed and then it's doing the
 

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.050
be displayed and then it's doing the
same thing again and over and over and

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:53.060
same thing again and over and over and
 

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.850
same thing again and over and over and
over again it's always exactly the same

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:54.860
over again it's always exactly the same
 

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.550
over again it's always exactly the same
thing and in screen space you see then

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560
thing and in screen space you see then
 

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.230
thing and in screen space you see then
first the old picture then comes a

00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240
first the old picture then comes a
 

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.060
first the old picture then comes a
vision which is basically the end of the

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.070
vision which is basically the end of the
 

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.280
vision which is basically the end of the
scan out of the buffer which means like

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.290
scan out of the buffer which means like
 

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.480
scan out of the buffer which means like
at which point in time you can flip to

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:04.490
at which point in time you can flip to
 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.160
at which point in time you can flip to
the next one and then it flips to the

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.170
the next one and then it flips to the
 

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.769
the next one and then it flips to the
next frame this is the ideal state so

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:08.779
next frame this is the ideal state so
 

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.720
next frame this is the ideal state so
looking deeper into the system this

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:10.730
looking deeper into the system this
 

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.210
looking deeper into the system this
driver space so in driver space we are

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.220
driver space so in driver space we are
 

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.800
driver space so in driver space we are
waiting now for the visa ring from the

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:14.810
waiting now for the visa ring from the
 

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.690
waiting now for the visa ring from the
previous frame so that we can take the

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:16.700
previous frame so that we can take the
 

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.970
previous frame so that we can take the
buffer and render stuff into it so which

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:18.980
buffer and render stuff into it so which
 

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.650
buffer and render stuff into it so which
is basically then producing all the buff

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.660
is basically then producing all the buff
 

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.480
is basically then producing all the buff
master DMA commands and putting them

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.490
master DMA commands and putting them
 

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.790
master DMA commands and putting them
into one contiguous buffer so that the

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800
into one contiguous buffer so that the
 

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.490
into one contiguous buffer so that the
GPU can read them and continuing the

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.500
GPU can read them and continuing the
 

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.250
GPU can read them and continuing the
same thing and in GPU space the GPU is

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:30.260
same thing and in GPU space the GPU is
 

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.690
same thing and in GPU space the GPU is
simply like taking that thing it's

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:31.700
simply like taking that thing it's
 

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.640
simply like taking that thing it's
executing these buffers which were being

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:33.650
executing these buffers which were being
 

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.010
executing these buffers which were being
produced by the driver space and doing

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.020
produced by the driver space and doing
 

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.270
produced by the driver space and doing
that one by one and flipping it

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:37.280
that one by one and flipping it
 

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.970
that one by one and flipping it
automatically via Hardware event into

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:39.980
automatically via Hardware event into
 

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.880
automatically via Hardware event into
view as soon as I just need it so where

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:42.890
view as soon as I just need it so where
 

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.130
view as soon as I just need it so where
comes change now and play well Jeng

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:45.140
comes change now and play well Jeng
 

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.740
comes change now and play well Jeng
comes if for example the rendering takes

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:47.750
comes if for example the rendering takes
 

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.560
comes if for example the rendering takes
much longer than you expect so and in

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.570
much longer than you expect so and in
 

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.240
much longer than you expect so and in
that case what happens well basically

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.250
that case what happens well basically
 

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.040
that case what happens well basically
you're repeating the previous frame and

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.050
you're repeating the previous frame and
 

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.140
you're repeating the previous frame and
inverse whatever you have already queued

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.150
inverse whatever you have already queued
 

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.240
inverse whatever you have already queued
up in order to be rendered is possibly

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.250
up in order to be rendered is possibly
 

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.040
up in order to be rendered is possibly
producing the next frame which is also

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.050
producing the next frame which is also
 

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.870
producing the next frame which is also
bad so it's not only one frame which is

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880
bad so it's not only one frame which is
 

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.570
bad so it's not only one frame which is
bad it's two or three so therefore it's

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:04.580
bad it's two or three so therefore it's
 

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.670
bad it's two or three so therefore it's
really a bad thing to have that so

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680
really a bad thing to have that so
 

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.500
really a bad thing to have that so
another thing what can happen is that in

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:08.510
another thing what can happen is that in
 

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.030
another thing what can happen is that in
user space you would actually see

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040
user space you would actually see
 

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.190
user space you would actually see
something similar so which means like

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.200
something similar so which means like
 

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.320
something similar so which means like
for example there is memory swapping

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:14.330
for example there is memory swapping
 

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.120
for example there is memory swapping
involved chrome is basically loading

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.130
involved chrome is basically loading
 

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.260
involved chrome is basically loading
some new notifications or maybe Android

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.270
some new notifications or maybe Android
 

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.970
some new notifications or maybe Android
is doing some compaction or whatnot and

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:21.980
is doing some compaction or whatnot and
 

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.650
is doing some compaction or whatnot and
in that case you might actually end up

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:23.660
in that case you might actually end up
 

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.460
in that case you might actually end up
in the same state so but unfortunately

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.470
in the same state so but unfortunately
 

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.079
in the same state so but unfortunately
we are running a desktop operating

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:29.089
we are running a desktop operating
 

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.670
we are running a desktop operating
system right which is not only that

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680
system right which is not only that
 

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.440
system right which is not only that
so now it's getting a little bit more

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:33.450
so now it's getting a little bit more
 

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.790
so now it's getting a little bit more
complicated because we have suddenly

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800
complicated because we have suddenly
 

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.590
complicated because we have suddenly
multiple clients which have to be

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600
multiple clients which have to be
 

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.650
multiple clients which have to be
rendered so we have now n things which

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660
rendered so we have now n things which
 

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.420
rendered so we have now n things which
are being rendering at the same time so

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.430
are being rendering at the same time so
 

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.250
are being rendering at the same time so
think about everything what I was

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.260
think about everything what I was
 

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.519
think about everything what I was
talking before but only n times so in

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:46.529
talking before but only n times so in
 

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:49.040
talking before but only n times so in
this case 2 and we haven't driver space

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.050
this case 2 and we haven't driver space
 

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.350
this case 2 and we haven't driver space
exactly as many boxes again only doubled

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360
exactly as many boxes again only doubled
 

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.470
exactly as many boxes again only doubled
and well GPU space gets crammed right

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480
and well GPU space gets crammed right
 

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.790
and well GPU space gets crammed right
because we have to do now multiple

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800
because we have to do now multiple
 

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.540
because we have to do now multiple
things which are obviously realized and

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:58.550
things which are obviously realized and
 

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.030
things which are obviously realized and
well then comes the scary thing which is

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040
well then comes the scary thing which is
 

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.640
well then comes the scary thing which is
a compositor what is the compositor well

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.650
a compositor what is the compositor well
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.230
a compositor what is the compositor well
basically it's now taking all these

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240
basically it's now taking all these
 

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.970
basically it's now taking all these
surfaces and it's compositing them

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980
surfaces and it's compositing them
 

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.370
surfaces and it's compositing them
together into one surface which means

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380
together into one surface which means
 

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.900
together into one surface which means
like we have to read everything again

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:11.910
like we have to read everything again
 

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.970
like we have to read everything again
write it again into Z output buffer

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980
write it again into Z output buffer
 

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.490
write it again into Z output buffer
which is another overhead right so let's

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500
which is another overhead right so let's
 

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.809
which is another overhead right so let's
complete the picture with some more

00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819
complete the picture with some more
 

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.240
complete the picture with some more
boxes from what happened before and now

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.250
boxes from what happened before and now
 

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.829
boxes from what happened before and now
if you look into the screen and you look

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839
if you look into the screen and you look
 

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.210
if you look into the screen and you look
from the upper left to the lower right

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220
from the upper left to the lower right
 

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.760
from the upper left to the lower right
you see that blue things percolating

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:25.770
you see that blue things percolating
 

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.410
you see that blue things percolating
through the system all the way to the

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:27.420
through the system all the way to the
 

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.870
through the system all the way to the
output except for there is no blue slide

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880
output except for there is no blue slide
 

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.120
output except for there is no blue slide
on the screen right which means we have

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.130
on the screen right which means we have
 

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.740
on the screen right which means we have
already created a pipeline here a

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:33.750
already created a pipeline here a
 

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.500
already created a pipeline here a
pipeline is a good thing in some ways

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:36.510
pipeline is a good thing in some ways
 

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.600
pipeline is a good thing in some ways
because the thing is like if the system

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:38.610
because the thing is like if the system
 

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.640
because the thing is like if the system
has some fluctuations like memory

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:40.650
has some fluctuations like memory
 

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.020
has some fluctuations like memory
swapping or whatnot you can compensate

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.030
swapping or whatnot you can compensate
 

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.150
swapping or whatnot you can compensate
for them but the thing is it has also

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160
for them but the thing is it has also
 

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.620
for them but the thing is it has also
the problem that if you click something

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.630
the problem that if you click something
 

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.270
the problem that if you click something
it might actually take a little bit of

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280
it might actually take a little bit of
 

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.950
it might actually take a little bit of
time additional time to actually see

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960
time additional time to actually see
 

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.250
time additional time to actually see
that so the good news is there is

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260
that so the good news is there is
 

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.990
that so the good news is there is
actually very old technology from the

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000
actually very old technology from the
 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
actually very old technology from the
90s which is actually trying to

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.010
90s which is actually trying to
 

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.910
90s which is actually trying to
eliminate this by using overlays so

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:58.920
eliminate this by using overlays so
 

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.250
eliminate this by using overlays so
overlays is basically the GPUs and

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260
overlays is basically the GPUs and
 

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.049
overlays is basically the GPUs and
reading out two buffers at the same time

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059
reading out two buffers at the same time
 

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:04.940
reading out two buffers at the same time
it's blending them together but

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:04.950
it's blending them together but
 

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.710
it's blending them together but
unfortunately that works only as long as

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720
unfortunately that works only as long as
 

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.450
unfortunately that works only as long as
you're not su mning in or not you are

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460
you're not su mning in or not you are
 

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.220
you're not su mning in or not you are
you're not turning your display into

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:10.230
you're not turning your display into
 

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.520
you're not turning your display into
portrait for example so and since most

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:13.530
portrait for example so and since most
 

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.530
portrait for example so and since most
users are possibly playing around with a

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:15.540
users are possibly playing around with a
 

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.480
users are possibly playing around with a
zoom level it might actually not work

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.490
zoom level it might actually not work
 

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.400
zoom level it might actually not work
it's a good news on the other hand as we

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:19.410
it's a good news on the other hand as we
 

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.380
it's a good news on the other hand as we
are working on it by the end of the year

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:21.390
are working on it by the end of the year
 

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.750
are working on it by the end of the year
I hope much much earlier we will be able

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760
I hope much much earlier we will be able
 

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.330
I hope much much earlier we will be able
to address that and you will have always

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340
to address that and you will have always
 

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.650
to address that and you will have always
double buffering if you're running in

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660
double buffering if you're running in
 

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.100
double buffering if you're running in
front so is that coming to the tool

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.110
front so is that coming to the tool
 

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.260
front so is that coming to the tool
itself so what kinds of tool do well

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:33.270
itself so what kinds of tool do well
 

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.669
itself so what kinds of tool do well
first off it can actually show how the

00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679
first off it can actually show how the
 

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:36.290
first off it can actually show how the
buffers are percolating through the

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300
buffers are percolating through the
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.049
buffers are percolating through the
system it can show you when memory was

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059
system it can show you when memory was
 

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:41.480
system it can show you when memory was
actually being swapped it can show you

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:41.490
actually being swapped it can show you
 

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.880
actually being swapped it can show you
how busy the CPU is the GP who is at any

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:43.890
how busy the CPU is the GP who is at any
 

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.720
how busy the CPU is the GP who is at any
point of time

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:44.730
point of time
 

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.940
point of time
it can actually show you all kinds of

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:46.950
it can actually show you all kinds of
 

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.340
it can actually show you all kinds of
things temperature speed and whatnot

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:49.350
things temperature speed and whatnot
 

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.870
things temperature speed and whatnot
from all the different components inside

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880
from all the different components inside
 

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.690
from all the different components inside
the system and best of all if you have

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700
the system and best of all if you have
 

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.400
the system and best of all if you have
some traces inside your code and you

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.410
some traces inside your code and you
 

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.780
some traces inside your code and you
want to see exactly what happened at

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:56.790
want to see exactly what happened at
 

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.370
want to see exactly what happened at
Voltron time you can actually put some

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380
Voltron time you can actually put some
 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.870
Voltron time you can actually put some
in there and you can actually see them

00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880
in there and you can actually see them
 

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.610
in there and you can actually see them
and monitor them there as well so as you

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620
and monitor them there as well so as you
 

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.110
and monitor them there as well so as you
see everything in relation to each other

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120
see everything in relation to each other
 

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.390
see everything in relation to each other
and then you can actually drill down and

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400
and then you can actually drill down and
 

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.150
and then you can actually drill down and
see why you have seen junk so with that

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160
see why you have seen junk so with that
 

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.220
see why you have seen junk so with that
let's come to a sort demo so let's see

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.230
let's come to a sort demo so let's see
 

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:16.250
let's come to a sort demo so let's see
let's bring up our tool so this tool is

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260
let's bring up our tool so this tool is
 

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.750
let's bring up our tool so this tool is
basically it's a small particle

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760
basically it's a small particle
 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.550
basically it's a small particle
generator and you can see already here I

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:19.560
generator and you can see already here I
 

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.470
generator and you can see already here I
mean yeah you can so you can basically

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480
mean yeah you can so you can basically
 

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.270
mean yeah you can so you can basically
see like the lower line is 60 frames per

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280
see like the lower line is 60 frames per
 

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.860
see like the lower line is 60 frames per
second the next line is already friends

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:27.870
second the next line is already friends
 

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.540
second the next line is already friends
per second 15 and so on and so on

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:29.550
per second 15 and so on and so on
 

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.920
per second 15 and so on and so on
so and so in order to start the tool

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:33.930
so and so in order to start the tool
 

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.360
so and so in order to start the tool
what I'm doing is I'm pressing ctrl

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:35.370
what I'm doing is I'm pressing ctrl
 

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.120
what I'm doing is I'm pressing ctrl
shift G so now tool is running and they

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.130
shift G so now tool is running and they
 

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.190
shift G so now tool is running and they
are also aging look at that that was

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200
are also aging look at that that was
 

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.610
are also aging look at that that was
fast

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620
fast
 

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.190
fast
much faster than I expected so let's see

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200
much faster than I expected so let's see
 

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.610
much faster than I expected so let's see
so first let's try to zoom out a little

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620
so first let's try to zoom out a little
 

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.310
so first let's try to zoom out a little
bit to see the regular pattern you can

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320
bit to see the regular pattern you can
 

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.140
bit to see the regular pattern you can
actually see now here I hope you can see

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.150
actually see now here I hope you can see
 

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.760
actually see now here I hope you can see
my cursor yes you can awesome

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:52.770
my cursor yes you can awesome
 

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.380
my cursor yes you can awesome
you can actually see how the buffer is

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:54.390
you can actually see how the buffer is
 

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.120
you can actually see how the buffer is
so first off we have four buffers here

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.130
so first off we have four buffers here
 

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.390
so first off we have four buffers here
so the upper line is always in the thing

00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400
so the upper line is always in the thing
 

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.040
so the upper line is always in the thing
what's application and/or surface

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.050
what's application and/or surface
 

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.320
what's application and/or surface
flinger sees the next line is what

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.330
flinger sees the next line is what
 

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.230
flinger sees the next line is what
chrome is seeing for its compositor and

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240
chrome is seeing for its compositor and
 

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.850
chrome is seeing for its compositor and
then comes the next buffer and the next

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860
then comes the next buffer and the next
 

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.960
then comes the next buffer and the next
buffer is the next Baba so there are

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:08.970
buffer is the next Baba so there are
 

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.490
buffer is the next Baba so there are
lots of buffers we have four buffers

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500
lots of buffers we have four buffers
 

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.820
lots of buffers we have four buffers
means quadruple buffering so then we

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:13.830
means quadruple buffering so then we
 

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.130
means quadruple buffering so then we
have the Android compositor which is

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140
have the Android compositor which is
 

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.600
have the Android compositor which is
doing a little bit of stuff before it's

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:17.610
doing a little bit of stuff before it's
 

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.160
doing a little bit of stuff before it's
actually passing it on to Chrome and

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.170
actually passing it on to Chrome and
 

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.160
actually passing it on to Chrome and
it's doing something and we see chrome

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.170
it's doing something and we see chrome
 

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.900
it's doing something and we see chrome
is also rendering and as you can see

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:23.910
is also rendering and as you can see
 

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.340
is also rendering and as you can see
there are two buffers which is basically

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:25.350
there are two buffers which is basically
 

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.870
there are two buffers which is basically
saying it's two using double buffering

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880
saying it's two using double buffering
 

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.090
saying it's two using double buffering
at that point and time and looking into

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100
at that point and time and looking into
 

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.710
at that point and time and looking into
the memories memory sing you can

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720
the memories memory sing you can
 

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.390
the memories memory sing you can
actually see how much memory was being

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400
actually see how much memory was being
 

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.460
actually see how much memory was being
used you can see a line creeping up here

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:34.470
used you can see a line creeping up here
 

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.040
used you can see a line creeping up here
which is oh look at that so memory is

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.050
which is oh look at that so memory is
 

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.330
which is oh look at that so memory is
actually definitely creeping up over

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340
actually definitely creeping up over
 

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.090
actually definitely creeping up over
time and you can also then see that the

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100
time and you can also then see that the
 

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.790
time and you can also then see that the
GPU was very busy here see so there is

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:43.800
GPU was very busy here see so there is
 

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.560
GPU was very busy here see so there is
only a little bit and there here is a

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:45.570
only a little bit and there here is a
 

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.930
only a little bit and there here is a
pretty solid line so let's drill in and

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940
pretty solid line so let's drill in and
 

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.300
pretty solid line so let's drill in and
let's see the GL thread was taking

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:50.310
let's see the GL thread was taking
 

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.540
let's see the GL thread was taking
longer look at that okay so why was a GL

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:53.550
longer look at that okay so why was a GL
 

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.420
longer look at that okay so why was a GL
thread keep taking more time let's have

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:56.430
thread keep taking more time let's have
 

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.980
thread keep taking more time let's have
a look

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:57.990
a look
 

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.700
a look
there is what is this I think this is

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:03.710
there is what is this I think this is
 

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.050
there is what is this I think this is
the temperature of the system is

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:06.060
the temperature of the system is
 

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.570
the temperature of the system is
incredible it's 84 degrees that is

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580
incredible it's 84 degrees that is
 

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.190
incredible it's 84 degrees that is
possibly always a reason why it was

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200
possibly always a reason why it was
 

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.840
possibly always a reason why it was
actually going down because you are

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:11.850
actually going down because you are
 

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.520
actually going down because you are
starting possibly to throttle the system

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:13.530
starting possibly to throttle the system
 

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.180
starting possibly to throttle the system
at that point in time so but in general

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:17.190
at that point in time so but in general
 

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.380
at that point in time so but in general
this tool gives you all the information

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:18.390
this tool gives you all the information
 

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.650
this tool gives you all the information
in one go and you can let's call it

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660
in one go and you can let's call it
 

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.170
in one go and you can let's call it
through you can see at the end that

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:24.180
through you can see at the end that
 

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.650
through you can see at the end that
there is Composition Jang somewhere so

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660
there is Composition Jang somewhere so
 

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.240
there is Composition Jang somewhere so

this tool please come by our scent boxes
 

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.320
this tool please come by our scent boxes
we have there actually people which we

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:33.330
we have there actually people which we
 

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.240
we have there actually people which we
were training to X and/or they are in

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:35.250
were training to X and/or they are in
 

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.510
were training to X and/or they are in
working on the tool which is which are

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520
working on the tool which is which are
 

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.180
working on the tool which is which are
able to actually handle anything inside

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.190
able to actually handle anything inside
 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.410
able to actually handle anything inside
your application if you want to see why

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:42.420
your application if you want to see why
 

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.880
your application if you want to see why
your application is checking please let

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:43.890
your application is checking please let
 

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:50.710
your application is checking please let
us know so with that back to the slides

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720
 

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.560
so if you want to try it on your own m75

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:54.570
so if you want to try it on your own m75
 

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.930
so if you want to try it on your own m75
is going to bethe around today or

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940
is going to bethe around today or
 

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.790
is going to bethe around today or
tomorrow so you can actually simply take

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:58.800
tomorrow so you can actually simply take
 

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.070
tomorrow so you can actually simply take
the beta Channel going to developer mode

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080
the beta Channel going to developer mode
 

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.720
the beta Channel going to developer mode
unfortunately you need to develop a mode

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:02.730
unfortunately you need to develop a mode
 

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.370
unfortunately you need to develop a mode
