00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.880
Okay.
So you've got a time-line in place.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.420
And, now it's time for you to follow it.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.010
And this might seem a little asinine,
but

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.550
trust me,
it's a great learning experience.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.790
Even if your actual time to completion
is way off from your estimate, you'll

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.410
still have a better idea as a developer
how long it takes you to do things.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.016
There are great time-tracking apps,
like Toggl, for instance,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:26.900
that help you keep track of how long
it takes you to complete a given task.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.590
There's a link to Toggl
in the instructor notes,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.170
if you want to check it out.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.190
But maybe it's not your cup of tea,
and you have some other methods for

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.640
tracking your time.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.750
If you do, please share those thoughts
on the forums, because both myself and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.670
your classmates would really
like to hear about them.
