00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
Hello.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.380
So the last couple of videos,
well we've been doing a lot of

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.760
projectile motion, and
we'll keep doing

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.029
some projectile motion.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.150
But I think it may have seemed
more confusing than it really

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.010
is, because I kept everything
in terms of variables.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.810
And we worked with the formulas
and the variables.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.910
What I want to do is take all
those things that hopefully

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.580
I've taught you or you've had
exposure to over the last

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.850
couple of videos, and just do a
bunch of problems. Because I

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.150
think this is all about
experience and getting the

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.750
intuition and just checking
through a lot of problems.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.110
So let's just do a
straightforward one, kind of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.070
going back to the ball
throwing game.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.366
So let's say I throw a ball
straight up, throw a ball up,

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:49.200
and that the total time the ball
is in the air is, I don't

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.070
know, let's say it's
7 seconds.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:01:04.120
So how fast did I throw
it straight up?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.130
Not throw up.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.200
How fast did I throw
the ball up?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.380
And then how high did it go?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.400
We've figured out a bunch of
formulas, and we could plug it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
straight into those formula and
solve this problem in 10

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800
seconds, or probably more
like 2 seconds.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.400
But what I want to do is just
actually go through the same

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.270
logic we went through to get
the formulas, but I'll work

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.840
with the numbers.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.230
And I'll show you this isn't
something where you even have

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.530
to memorize formulas.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.990
So it took 7 seconds, right?

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.160
The ball took 7 seconds to go
all the way up and then to go

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.780
down, right?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.220
And assuming no air resistance,
it took the same

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.260
amount of time to go
to its peak as it

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.570
took to go down, right?

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.760
So it took 3.5 seconds
to go up.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.700
Time is 3.5 seconds.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330
And then it took another
3.5 seconds to go

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.720
down, right, 3.5.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.640
So it took 3.5 seconds to
get to its peak, so what

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.685
does that tell me?

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:19.240
Well it tells me that in 3.5
seconds, the ball went from

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.905
whatever the initial velocity
it was when it left my hand.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:30.350
The ball went from-- v sub i is
equal to whatever-- it went

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.080
from that initial velocity.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.670
This is the ball.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.190
This isn't a number.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.290
And then by the time it got to
the top, to kind of the peak

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.050
of its travel, it got
to 0 velocity.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.660
So I'll call that v sub f
or the final velocity.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.060
It went from whatever
speed I threw it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.755
at to 0 in 3.5 seconds.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.030
So now we could just use,
I mean we don't even

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.670
have to use a formula.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.400
We could think of
it intuitively.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.010
How fast am I decelerating?

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.470
So I'm decelerating at the
rate of gravity, right?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.510
And we know that cause that's
what's slowing down the ball.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.450
So we know that acceleration
is equal to minus 10 meters

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.700
per second squared.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.900
And so what do we do?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.735
Well acceleration is the same
thing as a change in velocity.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.385
Acceleration times time
is the same thing as

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:26.590
the change in velocity.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.010
Or the change in velocity
divided by time is

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.610
acceleration.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.150
So let's say that.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.875
It's a change in velocity.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:38.510
Well the change in velocity is
equal to the final velocity

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.580
minus the initial velocity.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.710
And that equals acceleration
times time.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:50.040
So minus 10 meters per second
squared-- I'll stick with the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.480
units this time-- times time.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.710
So it did that in 3-1/2 seconds,
times 3.5 seconds.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.600
So this seconds cancels out with
one of the seconds in the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.970
denominator here.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:13.020
So I get minus vi is equal to
minus 350 meters per second

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.540
minus 10 times, no, that's
3.5, not 35.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.130
So it's minus 35 meters
per second.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.410
Something was looking
suspicious.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.240
Minus 35 meters per second, and
then of course, multiply

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.600
both sides by negative 1.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.490
And the initial velocity is
equal to 35 meters per second.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.520
That wasn't too bad.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.810
You don't even have to really
do it formally like this.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.720
You could just say well I'm
throwing it at some speed.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.820
Of the total time, it takes
half of that time

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.290
for it go to 0, right?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.060
So I threw it at some speed and
it took 3-1/2 seconds to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.200
go to 0, and it's decelerating
at this speed, right?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.400
So every second it's getting 10
meters per second slower.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.520
Every second I go,
it's getting 10

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.070
meters per second slower.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.040
So if it took 3-1/2 seconds to
go to 0, I must have started

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.480
off at 35 meters per second.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.880
If that confuses you, use the
formula, but I want to give

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.270
you a sense that you can
kind of just use

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.440
your intuition, right?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.710
Every second it travels in the
air, it's getting 10 meters

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.160
per second slower.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.610
It took 3-1/2 seconds to go from
whatever speed you threw

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.780
it at to 0, so it must have
started off at 35 meters per

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.200
second, right?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.600
At t equals 1, it was going
25 meters per second.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.990
At t equals 2, it was going
15 meters per second.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.570
At t equals 3, the ball is going
straight up at 5 meters

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.590
per second.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.400
And at t equals 3.5, the
ball is stationary.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.910
It's right at the top
and then it starts

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.740
decelerating downwards.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.372
Let's do some more problems.
I don't like these colors.

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:59.623
Let me switch to something
nicer.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.980
Also in that problem, I didn't
figure out how high the ball

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.920
went, so once again the total
travel time is 7 seconds.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.040
We know the acceleration
is minus 10

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.480
meters per second squared.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.890
And we know that the initial
velocity now-- we figured it

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.540
out-- is 35 meters per second.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.380
So to figure out how high
it went, so let's

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.750
just draw that part.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.830
So the ball is going
up, right?

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.110
And we figured out just in its
upward portion to go from vi

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.900
is equal to 35 meters per second
to, let's call this vf,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.510
is equal to 0 meters
per second.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.980
It took the ball 3.5 seconds,
right, because this is half of

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.670
its travel time.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.920
And then it took another 3.5
seconds to come straight down.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.930
Well we could just use our
fairly straightforward formula

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.290
that change in distance is equal
to the average velocity

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.460
times time, right?

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.430
And this should be pretty
intuitive to you.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.840
This shouldn't even be
viewed as a formula.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.370
Hopefully, it's starting
to be viewed as

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.760
maybe even common sense.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.030
So what was the average
velocity?

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.240
The average velocity is just
the average of your initial

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.710
velocity and your velocity
at the top of the curve.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.320
So that's 0.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.917
So the average of 35 and 0 is
just 35 divided by 2, so it

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.960
equals 35 over 2.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.850
And then what's the time?

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.100
3.5 seconds.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.490
And I could use my trusty

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.290
calculator, provided by Windows.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:58.418
35 divided by 2 times 3.5 is
equal to 61.25 meters.

00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:01.440
It's pretty easy.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.710
So hopefully you're realizing
that we used a lot of formulas

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.180
and things.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.290
And the formulas were getting
all over the page last time.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.930
But when you actually do it with
numbers, it's not so bad.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.570
In the next video now, I'm going
to just keep doing a

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.640
bunch more problems, because I
think you're probably tired of

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.625
this ball throwing business.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:20.875
I'll see you soon.
