1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,610
Hey, this is jad you're about to
get an episode in a couple seconds,

2
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:06,550
but first a quick curtain pole.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,950
Okay, so some of the episodes
that we put out on radio lab are,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,700
I don't want to see easy, but
like relatively contained.

5
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:19,150
You have a couple producers working
for a few months on a story.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,920
More often though we get
into situations like,

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,230
like the story that we're
going to share with you today,

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,120
just one from lots of Nasr where behind
the scenes you had four producers

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,900
working for nearly a year solid or
take a story like rhino hunter or the

10
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,980
gondolier just a few months back.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,140
Those stories took multiple years to
report and produce and they involved a

12
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,530
level of production that was
basically on par with an indie movie.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,140
Like that's how ambitious we're
trying to be in the cost. Oh,

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,200
let's talk about costs.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,240
When you add it all up and I'm talking
the reporting hours of producing hours,

16
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,690
fact checking, digging through
archives, getting people on planes,

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,840
the equipment, all of it. For
some of these bigger episodes,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,300
it can sometimes get
north of a hundred grand.

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,180
Freaks me out to say that,
but it's actually true

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,410
and yet shows up in your feed for free,

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,610
which is great as it should be.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,580
Here's the rub of all the millions of
people who have Radiolab in their feed and

23
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:31,030
we asked them all to give cause we are
listener supported and I'm proud of that

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,643
only

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,620
0.72% of the people who listen actually
give money actually raise their hand and

26
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,610
say I'm in 0.72 we're not
even at one whole cookie

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,910
so that's what I want to change right now.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,960
My challenge to you guys listening is
can we get this to 1% just 1% what that

29
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:02,800
means. What that means is
$8 a month, $8 a month.

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,640
That amount will keep this thing that
we're all a part of healthy and growing

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,230
like are you in? Are you down? I'm
talking to you listening right now.

32
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:17,380
Are you in? If you are,

33
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:22,381
go to radio lab.org/donate or text the
word give to the number seven zero one

34
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,270
zero one again, that's the word.

35
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,500
Give to the number seven zero
one zero one if you do it now,

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,040
add an incentive. We'll send you a
pair of noise canceling headphones.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,100
It's just our way of saying
thanks for joining in

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,470
because there's no way around this
partnership. We are listener supported,

39
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,940
not for profit. Radio lab
happens when you happen

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,000
1% we can do it. Just a quick note.

41
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,000
This story, uh, contains some
profanities here and there,

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,070
like even there a couple. So just know

43
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,830
that before we get going. [inaudible]
wait, you're listening. Okay.

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,593
[inaudible]

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,160
you are listening to radio
lab radio from w n y s hey,

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,473
hey.

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,710
Hey, I'm John Abu [inaudible].
I'm Robert Krulwich,

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,200
Radiolab and today we
are going to start. Okay,

49
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,410
so let's start with our producer.
Lots of Nassar. Yeah, well let's just,

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,670
let's just go back to San Francisco on a
particular day at a particular time and

51
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:37,110
a particular woman. Hello.
Hi, is this Sarah Jane? Yes,

52
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:41,250
it is woman named Sarah Jane
Moore. Sarah Jane. Okay.

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,850
So does the San Francisco, the
particular date was September 22nd,

54
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,040
the particular time 1975
it's a Monday morning. It.

55
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,140
Was it a nice day? Oh yeah. I
don't remember anything different,

56
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:56,070
so I assume it was a nice day marriage.
Sure, sure. I was kind of, you know,

57
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:00,150
in my own head. I remember. So
Sarah Jane on this Monday morning,

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,800
she wakes up early, drops
her nine-year-old off at
school, runs a few errands,

59
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,660
then she drives downtown to
this, this big fancy hotel.

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,570
What was the name of the hotel? Uh,
this, I think it's the Saint Francis,

61
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:14,640
isn't it? I'm 87 years old.

62
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:17,550
Don't expect me to remember little
details like that. Okay. All right.

63
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,700
Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah.
But at any rate, you know,

64
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:25,701
I parked in the parking garage across
right across from the hotel as a park,

65
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,600
but there's a parking garage underneath,

66
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,310
walked over and walked
across the street that was,

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,490
there were sidewalks on
both sides of the street.

68
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,800
There were people on both sidewalks.

69
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,580
She joins the crowd across the street
from the hotel. It was very crowded.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,910
A couple of thousand people. It's like,

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,870
it's like a big scene and there
was a barrier, a rope barrier,

72
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:45,240
right to keeping us back on the sidewalk.

73
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,670
And my plan had always been
to be back in the crown. Um,

74
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,000
you know, and I was dressed like every
other middle age one that was there.

75
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,610
What were you, do you remember
what you were wearing? I mean I, I,

76
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm sure there's, uh, oh, there are
pictures of it. Yes. I was wearing,

77
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,800
I was wearing slacks. That was,

78
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,460
that was at the beginning of when it
was natural for women to wear slacks.

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,480
I had a coat on and I was carrying a
purse and I went back into the middle of

80
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:12,180
the crowd cause I hadn't
planned to do anyway.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,890
I thought a man come up against me and
socialize as I was in that day and time,

82
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:21,450
I spun around a slap his face cause she
sees this guy, they're big, strong guy,

83
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,690
blonde hair. Look at him and realize
that it was current crowd pressure,

84
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,260
that he had not done anything out
of, out of ordinary that [inaudible].

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,450
So I turned back around and uh,
went on about my business. Uh,

86
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,970
I was then pushed up. The
crowd pressure was such,

87
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,440
I tried to stay back in the crowd,

88
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,860
but I got pushed up almost onto the ropes
in the front right up on the curb of

89
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:47,330
the sidewalk. That's right. I
had not planned to be, uh, and,

90
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,410
and he apparently was
still right behind me,

91
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
so maybe he was pushed
out by the crowd also.

92
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,890
And so Sarah Jane is just crammed into
this crowd and she's just standing there

93
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,220
and were you, were you
nervous? Oh No. Huh.

94
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,720
You set out to do something and I was
just going about and doing what I had set

95
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,554
out to do.

96
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,890
So she waits and she waits and an hour
goes by and two and three and then

97
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,330
finally

98
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
[inaudible] out of the hotel comes
none other than the [inaudible]

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
president of the United
States, Gerald Ford,

100
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,980
and he has police and secret
service and they're all coming.

101
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,260
They're walking out of the
hotel to get in his car,

102
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,170
which was parked there on the
street, but he sees the crowd.

103
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:36,171
Sarah Jane actually says he looks directly
at her and he waves you waves to the

104
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:41,640
crowd and everyone starts applauding.
And cheering. Now, right at that moment,

105
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
Sarah Jane reaches her right hand into
her purse and pulled the gun out of my

106
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:53,280
purse, a 38 caliber revolver.

107
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,820
She cocks it and then she takes
aim right at Gerald Ford's head.

108
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,160
[inaudible]

109
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,993
and then

110
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,783
[inaudible].

111
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,260
Mr Freud did not fall.

112
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,410
The bullet flies a few feet to the right
of Ford chips. The wall behind him,

113
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,810
Ford freezes in place.

114
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,020
Sarah Jean never planned
to take a second shot. No,

115
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:28,770
she's just still standing there with my
hands still in the air, holding the gun,

116
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,760
looking over the smoking barrel of the
gun and she's got enough time if she

117
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:36,420
wants it. But before she
can take that second shot,

118
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,110
the blonde man behind her lunges at her,

119
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,850
grabs her gun arm,

120
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:46,620
pulls it down and deflects it for just
that crucial second that these police

121
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,320
officers nearby need to get
to her. They tackle her,

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,440
they take her gun and they
pin her to the ground.

123
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,690
So I couldn't move.

124
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,260
And by that point the secret service
has whisked off the president into the

125
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:01,310
limousine and I was immediately picked
up and carried across the street into the

126
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:04,790
hotel, arrested and eventually, uh,

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,560
she went to prison and she
served 32 years in prison. Huh.

128
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,903
Uh, and then,

129
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,030
and then after that was released on
parole and then we talk to her, we a

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,750
that prepared to be told the uh,

131
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,550
first person narrative from the
perspective of someone who's about to

132
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,850
assassinate the president. That was not
what I was expecting. I was hoping that,

133
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,390
um, wait, can you explain though why it
is she decided to shoot the guy? Yeah.

134
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,710
Why? Why did you shoot? Well, well,
surgeons never fully explained that.

135
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,550
And in fact, when, when I asked her,
well, this is not, she was like,

136
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm not going there.

137
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,830
This is not an interview about what was
driving me or about what I did or why I

138
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:47,270
did it. This is an interview
about Mr Sippel simple. Yeah.

139
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,880
Oliver sipple,

140
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,480
he's the random blonde guy who just
happened to be standing next to Sarah Jane

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,780
Moore that day. The guy who grabbed
her arm. And Save the president's life.

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
And he paid dearly for that.

143
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,990
I actually called up Sarah Jane and had
her tell that whole story because I was

144
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,220
actually interested in what happened to
all of her Sippel after that because had

145
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:11,280
he not reached down and,
and put his hand on my arm,

146
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
none of this would have happened to him.

147
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,810
Wait, what happened to them?

148
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,600
So all of our civil actually
died in 1989 but, um,

149
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,930
before we get to the story, I just want
to give you a picture of the guy. So,

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,300
uh, just a Google search,

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,040
Oliver sipple Ford or
something. Wait. Okay. Wait,

152
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,210
I see the picture. I say, look, this
is a muscular guy, kind of blonde hair.

153
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:44,450
He's a, he's a, he's a, um, he's a
handsome guy. Yeah, he's hilarious.

154
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,310
He's a little bit, James Dean and
Marlon Brando had a baby, kind of,

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,430
he feels like an all American.
He feels all American.

156
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:54,460
There's something all American
about him. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,220
We're bringing in another
all-american for this story. Uh,

158
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,880
Daniel Looser editor at
Oxford University press. Um,

159
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,540
and a few years ago, I was like, probably
more than five years ago, I wrote a,

160
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,000
an article, uh, about Oliver sipple.
But anyway, to get back on track,

161
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,320
September 22nd, 1975, Sarah
Jane Moore fires that shot.

162
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,790
Oliver sipple grabs her arm,

163
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,930
the police wrestled more to the ground
and then the police actually grab all of

164
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,330
her to pull them inside
the hotel to question him.

165
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,920
Cause there's initially some confusion
about what he was doing there and some

166
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:27,731
thought that, you know,

167
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:32,140
he might have been a suspect and so
he's in this hotel trying to light a

168
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:36,370
cigarette, but he just couldn't do
it because he was shaking so hard.

169
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,650
It turns out Oliver had served
two very rough tours in Vietnam,

170
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,580
loud noises, which would
make him very unhappy. Um,

171
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,000
I think this is the sort of thing we
might call post traumatic stress disorder

172
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:52,510
now. But when eventually all
of her started to come down,

173
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,960
the secret service were like,
what are you even doing here?

174
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,210
It was Kinda hard for him to answer
because it's like he didn't even really

175
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,320
know. It was just like,
well, I don't know.

176
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,520
I was taking a walk and I just bumped
into this huge crowd of people asked what

177
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:07,060
was going on. People are like, oh,
like Gerald Ford is going to be here,

178
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,530
you know, the president
is going to be here.

179
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
So he said he thought I
might as well see him.

180
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,660
And then he was standing
there for a couple hours
until he saw a flash of metal,

181
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,200
realized it was a gun, reacted
quickly, instinctively.

182
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,090
And then you guys all pulled me in
here. That's how we came to be here.

183
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,800
So he's questioned for three hours. He
goes home, home to his fourth floor,

184
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:30,280
walk up and there's a reporter
there waiting for him.

185
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,690
But he, he just wants to
sort of be left alone.

186
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,320
And he told this reporter, um, quote,

187
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,510
I'm a coward. I don't know why I did
it. It was the thing to do at the time.

188
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,280
And then even after that,

189
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,360
he just keeps getting phone calls from
reporters and some of them learned that

190
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,750
he was a marine. And so they would ask
them questions like, Oh, was it your,

191
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,960
you know, was it your training? Is
that why you did this heroic thing?

192
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,240
But he said like, Oh, you know, listen,

193
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,790
don't mention any of that stuff
about the marines. You know, like,

194
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:05,580
let's keep that under wraps.
Quote. I'm no hero or nothing. But

195
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,590
the next day, yesterday in San Francisco,

196
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,890
a shot fired all of her story
shot across the country,

197
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,320
aimed afflicted by an ex marine and be up.

198
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:18,860
And I'm better on named Oliver's simple.
He's names on television, that marine,

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,350
all of simple, the front
page of newspapers,

200
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,700
where's there's headlines like x
marine deflects weapon as woman shoots.

201
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,790
That's the La Times Chicago Tribune
hero tells how we deflected woman's arm.

202
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:33,260
And so despite his best efforts,

203
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,630
Oliver becomes a national hero for a day
and it appears that he sort of thought

204
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,540
that would be it. Maybe his friends
would give him a pat on the back,

205
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,330
buy him a couple of
rounds, and then, you know,

206
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,720
over the next couple of days that all
sort of like rippled out of control

207
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,760
because that very same day that all
over it was being painted as a hero.

208
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,680
This guy named Herb Kane,

209
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,430
the long time San Francisco Columnists
walked into his office and on his

210
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:03,600
answering machine were
two messages saying, Hey,

211
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,630
that guy Oliver sipple a hero
saved the president's life

212
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,440
is gay. Huh?

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Was He, was he out? Well, he
was sort of out and sort of not.

214
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,120
What does that mean? Well, to explain,

215
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,190
you've got to understand this particular
time and place. So let's just,

216
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
you know, take a magic carpet ride,

217
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,530
close your eyes and let the sound take

218
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,403
your wet

219
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,770
city has emerged where homosexuality
is not only tolerated but it's dry,

220
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,420
sometimes labeled with a flying
captain, the Queen Study of the wet.

221
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,730
So San Francisco is a great
day. It's the gay day happy,

222
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,530
happy day was one of the first cities
in America to have a gay pride parade.

223
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,240
And in the 70s, a wonderful boys
go to bed with boys and girls,

224
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,860
got to bed with girls and for gay people.

225
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,530
San Francisco was like this
shelter from the storm.

226
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,460
Many of us were immigrants from
somewhere. This is Ken Maley,

227
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,320
Longtime San Francisco resident

228
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,110
gay activist who at the age of 19,
uh, came to San Francisco from Kansas,

229
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,780
from Kansas because what the west
offered was the ethereal promise,

230
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,390
if you will, of reinvention.

231
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,900
You could cross a line in which
your past stayed behind you.

232
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,830
It was a place where you could be out,
but to the people you left behind,

233
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,850
you could still be in. So, uh,
until for all of her, you know,

234
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,600
he came from Michigan, from
a working class family. Uh,

235
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,960
he had a lot of brothers and sisters.

236
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,930
I think he was one of eight
children until after the war.

237
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,950
When he got his San Francisco,

238
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,830
he actually started going by the
name of Billy Billy, Billy sipple.

239
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,730
And he was perfectly open about his
sexual orientation and would tell anybody

240
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,180
who asked that he was a gay man, but
you know, he never told his family.

241
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,030
And so all of her lived like
a lot of gay people at the

242
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,490
time. This double life. Yeah.

243
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:57,860
And do we know that this is the reason
why civic unity of San Francisco or was

244
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:02,540
there a differential because Harvey milk
was there, the Harvey milk, you know,

245
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,030
famous gay activists,
San Francisco politician.

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,600
He was friends with Harvey Milk, The
New Yorker, an immigrant from New York.

247
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,510
Turns out Oliver had actually met
Harvey a decade earlier in New York,

248
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:16,670
and I just want to mention this because
I think it's so cool at different points

249
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:16,961
in time,

250
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:21,670
they actually dated the same guy who
was the inspiration for sugar plum fairy

251
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:26,230
sugar there he came and hit the streets
in Lou Reed's walk on the wild side.

252
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,640
Look at the silver Udon and please the,
it's just a fun fact, just a fun fact.

253
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,260
That's it. But I'm all over in
Harvey. They were pretty good friends.

254
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,490
They corresponded,

255
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:38,040
stayed in touch when they lived in
different places in the country. Actually,

256
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,310
Harvey even loaned all of her money
sometimes because all of her didn't have a

257
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,930
job. He collected disability from
his time in the marines. But anyway,

258
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,980
by the beginning of the seventies
when Oliver got to San Francisco,

259
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,980
reconnected with his old friend,
Harvey was uh, shall we say,

260
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:56,970
evolving into a huge figure
there, but gay public figure.

261
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,770
Ken was actually friends with Harvey
worked on one of his campaigns. But this,

262
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,930
I'm sorry. No, no, no.

263
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,330
And I'm just thinking like one of the
things we were talking about on the phone

264
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,050
was about sort of the, the kind of two
different schools are two different,

265
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,080
but the segue to that. Oh, perfect.
Okay. Yeah, yeah. This older other,

266
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,130
I would say older,

267
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:22,131
but other generation of gay mostly men
was that they were content to go to tea

268
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,140
with the mayor or public
official or some kind of,

269
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,610
they would show up to like a rally wearing
jackets and ties and like asked for

270
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,100
their rights politely.
They really weren't,

271
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,120
shall we say activists
because according to Ken,

272
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,740
the activism came when
in the late sixties,

273
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:48,741
early seventies you had young gay men and
women who came out of the Vietnam War.

274
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:52,770
Protests into the world.
Took a look around.

275
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,160
The CBS News survey shows that two out
of three Americans look upon homosexuals.

276
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,740
We've discussed discomfort or fear.

277
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,830
Police are still raiding bars.

278
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,930
They consider discrimination
in jobs and housing.

279
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,320
People are still getting beaten.

280
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,440
One of them, it said, a clear faggot.
We're going to beat the shit out of you.

281
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
Center to that effect.
We're going to kill you

282
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,220
both violently and in nonviolence.

283
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,990
Got Up in the middle of the street.

284
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:20,680
They knocked me down and started beating
me with their hands and their feet,

285
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:24,160
their elbows, uh, tried
to muffle my screams.

286
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,360
And after a while a body of people get
to a point where they just will not take

287
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,480
oppression anymore. So

288
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,790
in came the activists like
Harvey Ponytail, Mustache,

289
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,470
he was the banker turned hippy.

290
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,460
You know, you're lying, you know,
you're changing the statements around.

291
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,880
He was very outspoken. I question
what is your real motive behind it?

292
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,900
Very militant and stopped this phony
issue that you know was a phony issue to

293
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,320
Harvey saying that I gave her a smile,

294
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,670
should have the right to say gay people
were living in a half-life opportunity.

295
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,650
I am gay. That is a
part of society, period.

296
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,750
Not being able to be who they were.

297
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,140
Every gay person must come out.

298
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,660
[inaudible]

299
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,100
you must tell your immediate family.
You must tell your relatives.

300
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,700
You must tell your friends if
indeed they are your friends.

301
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
You must tell your neighbors.

302
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,550
You must tell the people
you're working with.

303
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,300
You must tell the people
in the stories you shop in

304
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,240
and runs. Once you do, you
will build so much better.

305
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:40,930
[inaudible]

306
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,120
and so cut back to

307
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,080
September 22nd, 1975

308
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,270
in the blink of an eye, all of her civil
becomes this hero. And that same night,

309
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,390
all of his friend Harvey,
here's about all this news

310
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,160
and kind of senses. Wait, maybe
there's an opportunity here.

311
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,863
So

312
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,420
hmm. He picks up the phone
and he calls the columnist.

313
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:08,390
Herb became a very, very well known,

314
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:12,800
well loved gossip columnist
and Cain isn't there.

315
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:17,801
So milk leaves a message on his
answering machine and he basically says,

316
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:23,060
look, I'm a friend of all of our
symbols. I've known him for years.

317
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,770
All of our Sippel worked on
my campaign for supervisor.

318
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,340
So basically with,
without simple's consent,

319
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,540
Harvey out at him milk out at him.

320
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,410
But what was Harvey milk thinking
that he would do this? Well,

321
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,120
for Harvey, I think the
stereotypes, the lies,

322
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:47,550
the innuendos of gay people as limp
wristed and drag queens and stuff.

323
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,160
The distortions. Okay. People
are child molesters. Well,

324
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,470
here's a true gay hero,

325
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,610
a square jawed heroic marine who
seemed to be a sort of like regular,

326
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,940
like red blooded American.
And so Harvey said,

327
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,850
and this was written down by
his biographer who I'm quoting,

328
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,280
it's too good an opportunity for once
we can show that gays do heroic things,

329
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,410
not just all that Kaka about molesting
children and hanging out in bathrooms

330
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,250
wasn't there? Somebody said, no, no,
no, no. You got to ask the guy for it.

331
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:25,570
You can't just do that. Harvey
just did it. Really? Yeah,

332
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:30,550
he just did it. So cane
in the next morning,

333
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,900
Keene arrived at his office.

334
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,790
He listens to the message and Kane tries
to call simple, but he can't reach him.

335
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,280
But there was another guy who is
a gay activist. His name was, uh,

336
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,460
the reverend ray brochures.

337
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,620
He was the head of what's called what
was called the lavender panthers. Um,

338
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,680
and he also independently
called Herb Kane to say,

339
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,650
oh, that guy all over civil. Everyone's
talking about on the news. Yay.

340
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,110
So you've got two independent sources,

341
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:04,111
both of people who said that they were
friends with Sippel and that he was gay.

342
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,800
And for Kane, I think this was juicy.

343
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,900
This was a juicy thing.
Um, and he, uh, was this,

344
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,820
let me just like go back and get this.

345
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,660
So two days after the assassination
attempt, Kane's column comes out.

346
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,020
And the way that he wrote it up,
this is the precise paragraph.

347
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,450
One of the heroes of the
day, Oliver, Billy Sippel,

348
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,060
the ex marine who grabbed
Sarah Jane Moore's arm,

349
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,690
just as her gun was fired and thereby
may have saved the president's life,

350
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,600
was the center of midnight
attention at the red lantern,

351
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,230
a golden gate avenue bar. He
favors Reverend Ray Broshears,

352
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,920
head of helping hand center
and gay politico, Harvey Milk,

353
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,060
who claimed to be amongst simple's close
friends, described themselves as proud.

354
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,980
Maybe this will help break the stereotype.

355
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,330
And then that day, this
guy named Darryl Lemke,

356
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,800
Lemke lem, B k e

357
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,580
picks up his issue of the
chronicle, sees herb Keynes column,

358
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,110
and I reported it to the office,
the Office of the Los Angeles Times.

359
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,910
I was a reporter for the
La Times in San Francisco.

360
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:10,580
And so my office told me good.
An interview with Oliver sipple.

361
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,580
But really quickly before we get there,

362
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,560
we actually managed to find the recording
of this very specific interview in the

363
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,650
La Times collection at the
Huntington Library in Los Angeles.

364
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,880
And I think the reason they hung
onto it was because it was kind of

365
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,900
controversial.

366
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,530
So the night that Keynes article comes
out, Daryl goes to Oliver's house,

367
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,483
Oliver's there,

368
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,150
do reporters from the
sentinel over there also.

369
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,233
I'm just, I don't know

370
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,020
that right there is Darryl.

371
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,050
He gave me Andrew's favorite. Oh sure.

372
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,230
So they're all sitting in
Oliver's living room and,

373
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:50,080
and what the reporters are all wondering
is, have you heard from the president?

374
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,260
The president hadn't bothered
to thank him at that point,

375
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,510
present kind of words, what
they call metals and freedom.

376
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,590
People for outstanding marks offered.

377
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,770
You never had any brought back to
the White House weeks ago? Certainly.

378
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,080
Would you like to be
[inaudible]? Well yeah,

379
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,090
I stood in line for three hours to see you

380
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,610
and that voice right there, that's Oliver.

381
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,330
You didn't have time to meet at
that occasion, I don't think.

382
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,420
Have you heard from the mayor?
Wow. I've heard from number

383
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,460
I heard only from the
press and porters and uh,

384
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,520
reporters in the press and that
you have been hard to get ahold of.

385
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,220
I only have to dig dignity,

386
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,670
but then I'm sure the mayor could find
you guys access to these records that

387
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,980
know where you are. Can
we go on that round?

388
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,670
Yeah. Okay. Um,

389
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,020
for some reason San Francisco Police
Department has now referred to any

390
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:55,280
inquiries about you to the sex
crimes and missing persons detail.

391
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,430
That's something I think you should know.

392
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,960
Something Oliver should
know because this is, again,

393
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:06,280
this is at a time when the assumption was
that all gay men were just pedophiles.

394
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,040
Pervert.

395
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,880
I mean, when I said background, this
is information that cannot be printed.

396
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,130
Well, can I, can [inaudible]

397
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,050
Darryl actually asks if he can
call somebody and ask about it.

398
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,380
Yeah, well, you J at right? Yeah.
Uh, no, I don't want it. Well,

399
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,050
you want baby damn there. Any reasons
as to why the number is five five,

400
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,230
three one three, six, one
who was the guy to talk to?

401
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,210
[inaudible] Sullivan or
Heifer. Now I found out

402
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,970
Daryl calls local authorities,
but he can't get ahold of anyone.

403
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,993
Thanks again.

404
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,390
He took the call back around one where
I have said nothing to you about that.

405
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,560
Do you have any sex crimes on your record?

406
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,610
Never had the sex events in my intent.

407
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,160
I've never been arrested much of
him being drunk a couple times,

408
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,590
but I don't think there's no more in
the world. Hasn't been dropping. How,

409
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,780
what'd you like us to check
that out further to sing?

410
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,300
If there's more they're getting

411
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,890
and then the tape recorder
goes off, it comes back on,

412
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,090
uh, well who do I call with some
authority with the police department

413
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,610
and now Oliver's on the phone
with the police department.

414
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,410
Yeah. Just to check the balance. Yeah.

415
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:15,280
Well money and Jonathan sipple and I'd
like to know why I've been turned over to

416
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:20,190
your department. Sex crimes
and missing person. This is me.

417
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:23,240
Yes, that's correct sir.

418
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,760
Yes sir. I'd like some information.
A bunch of press came over. A lot of,

419
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,121
bunch of,

420
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:34,260
just three people from the press came
over this afternoon and they said they

421
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:38,340
were trying to get some information about
me in the police department and I was

422
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:42,000
turned over to a sex and crimes act.
What the hell is on a lot about,

423
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,310
oh, I see one. Jesus. God. I mean,
I said, what the Hell is going on?

424
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,350
Okay Guy.

425
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,280
I tried to call the mayor's office just
now and I tried to call the chief of

426
00:25:57,281 --> 00:26:01,930
police office just now. What
the Sam Hell is going on? Okay,

427
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,760
thanks a lot guy. Yeah, just the opposite.

428
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,750
One of the officers that was involved
with the assassination of Sasha Nation of

429
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,490
Chad is in that department. That's
all. That's why it's being churned.

430
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,750
Does that make any sense to you? You
got me very shook up young man. Well,

431
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,680
I was just about to go downtown
and whip some ass somewhere.

432
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,520
We find out anymore about, you know,

433
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,960
now the reason this tape is
so controversial is because
according to all of her,

434
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:37,580
before the interview began, before the,
you know, recorder started rolling.

435
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,010
Um, he had said to the reporters
from the Sentinel, um, okay,

436
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm going to talk to you
guys about my sexuality.

437
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,370
But then he had said to Darryl, I don't
want you to write anything about that.

438
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,010
I don't, I don't want
that in a national paper.

439
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,500
Darrell says he doesn't remember that.
But then right here in this interview,

440
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,540
this thing happens where Daryl says,

441
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,030
oh, I'll make one more try
on the gay a thing that

442
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,720
I'll make one more try on the gay thing.

443
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,190
You don't, you don't want
to change your mind on it.

444
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,300
You don't want to change
your mind on that.

445
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,300
No. Uh, I just don't want
to change your mind that

446
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,030
maybe we quote you as saying
homosexuality has nothing to do with this.

447
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,130
Even calling and saying that, uh,
if I were a homosexual, I was not,

448
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:28,550
you can quote me on that. It doesn't make
me any less than a man than what I am.

449
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,673
Okay.

450
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,590
But I think that that has nothing to
do with the accurate or right himself.

451
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,970
So I don't think you
should be pushing for that.

452
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,183
Cool.

453
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,730
And eventually,

454
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,710
hey, that's great. Okay.

455
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,660
Interviewing [inaudible]. And Darryl
says that when he left that interview,

456
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:56,120
he felt like when it came
to all of her sexuality,

457
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,430
they didn't want to be quoted.

458
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,900
That was it. Like, just don't
quote me on it, but still,

459
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,480
I was trying to report
from all sides of audits.

460
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,710
The big side for me was that
he was a heroin is president.

461
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:12,510
United States was a very slow on the take
and thanking him for saving his life.

462
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,010
And Darryl thought that
all of her sexuality,

463
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:18,910
the fact that he was gay
might have something to do
with that because just seven

464
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:19,744
months earlier

465
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,720
on March 6th, Sergeant Leonard Method,

466
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:26,040
a bitch disclosed to a supervising officer
at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia

467
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,520
that he was a homosexual. And
one of the stay in the air force,

468
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,880
this air force sergeant named Leonard
Matlovich who had the purple heart,

469
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,560
had the bronze star. He comes out that
he's gay and he's kicked out of the air

470
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,050
in conversations here, people say that,
you know, we're discharging this queer,

471
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,810
that queer thrown them out of
here for us. I mean, I'm sorry,

472
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,350
I just burned up with just am I a coward
here and I'm just gonna stand here and

473
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,210
never really collect
the protection of, uh,

474
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,280
my fellow minority grouping and just
keeping quiet and my conscious just

475
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,520
wouldn't let me do it anymore. I had to
come forward and say, no more America.

476
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,840
And now you've got this ex marine save
the president's life and it's two days

477
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:11,400
later, he still hasn't heard from
the president. So for Darryl,

478
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,820
even though all of her had said
don't make this about my sexuality,

479
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,020
I still thought it was an,

480
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,920
it was a national story and it was pretty
hard to ignore it after a hurricane.

481
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,210
It started the ball rolling.

482
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,810
So that night after the interview,

483
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,230
Darryl calls in his story to the La
Times office and he uses this phrase,

484
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,780
um, he says that Oliver's
an ex marine who was quote,

485
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,630
a prominent figure in the gay community,

486
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,190
put it down away in the story,

487
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:42,880
but the rewrite guy put it in the
lead really and made it the big thing.

488
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,230
And so three days after
the assassination attempt,

489
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,840
the La Times runs the story
with the headline. Uh,

490
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,970
no call from President Hiro in forge,

491
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:55,560
shooting active among SF gaze

492
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,070
and, uh, the La Times at a news service.

493
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,810
And so Darrell's story, it goes,
I mean, it goes everywhere.

494
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,120
Another strange twist to the story

495
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,730
headlines are like gay
vet or homosexual hero.

496
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,990
It's been reported that the experiene
who deflected Mrs. Morris shot on Monday,

497
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,710
is well known in San Francisco's
gay activist circles.

498
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,930
And so it was not just
running in Los Angeles,

499
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
it's also running in Chicago.
It's running in Dallas,

500
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:27,320
it's running in Indianapolis,
and it's running a, you know,

501
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:32,120
of all places in all of our
sickles home town in Detroit.

502
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,700
I guess what I'm wondering is
if you have a guy who says,

503
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,300
please don't talk about this, this has
nothing to do with what I did yesterday.

504
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Shouldn't that play some role in what
you decide to write or not to write?

505
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,740
Well, no. You know,

506
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:51,741
news news sources are
always reluctant to talk.

507
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,740
And so a,

508
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I guess I took it as my
duty to take up that angle,

509
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:05,550
especially as such involved the president
of the United States. Right. But, uh,

510
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,140
w if you were to do it all over again,
would you do anything differently? Uh,

511
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,320
I don't know. Uh,

512
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,620
I hadn't taken into account maybe,

513
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,440
uh, the potential harm saying it.

514
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,330
I don't know if I'd do
it over again or not.

515
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,980
[inaudible]

516
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,700
but not able to turn back the
clock for something like that.

517
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,410
[inaudible]

518
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,060
the clock marches forward after the break.

519
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,920
[inaudible].

520
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,300
My name is Jaz Adam and I'm
calling from Los Angeles.

521

More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

524
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,870
I just want to remind you that we are at
the moment raising money to support the

525
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:32,330
making of radio lab.

526
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,720
We did a little math earlier
and we figured out that
of our listening audience,

527
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,010
uh,

528
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
only 0.72% of our audience
actually contributes money
to the making of the show

529
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,330
and we are listener supported,
not for profit radio and podcasts.

530
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,860
So we rely on our listeners.

531
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:56,300
So we only got 2.7199999999999998%
we're thinking with a little concerted

532
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:59,960
effort, all of us, we can tick
that up to 1% can we do it?

533
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:04,250
Can we get to 1% that is
the challenge. If you're in,

534
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,000
if you're up for this, if you want more
stories like the one you're hearing,

535
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,740
help us out with a pledge of $8 a
month. Just eight bucks a month.

536

Go to radio lab.org/donate or text the
word give to the number seven oh one oh

538
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:25,970
Give to the number seven Oh
one oh one and thank you.

539
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,963
[inaudible]

540
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,360
this is Radiolab.

541
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,170
We're back with the story of Oliver
sipple from reporter producer with lots of

542
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,970
Nasr. So the assassination attempt
was on Monday and on Thursday

543
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,970
sipple and his lawyer call
a press conference. Well,
I think you all know this.

544
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:59,180
There's all other symbol who shape the
president's wife and he has a prepared

545
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:03,020
statement on a subject that's
appeared in the press today.

546
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,590
Okay. In the past few days I have been
asked many questions having to do with my

547
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:12,550
sexual preferences to
what I had been asked,

548
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,930
whether or not I am gay
or homosexual. This is,

549
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,920
there is, this is my reply
to the line in question.

550
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
The first reason

551
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,610
you are interested in my in me is the
fact the woman who tried to shoot the

552
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:36,850
president t, I'm sorry, I'm
still nervous. Excuse me.

553
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,513
No,

554
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,080
this is her handwritten statement and
he's having a little difficulty reading

555
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:48,100
it. We xeroxed it in order to get
it to you this afternoon. Reason.

556
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,340
First reason you were interested
in me is the fact that I do.

557
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,410
Oh, okay. I couldn't get the words
there. We'd go right from whatever.

558
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,580
My sexual orientation has nothing at all
to do with saving the president's life

559
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,970
just as the color of my eyes or my race
has nothing to do with what happened in

560
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:11,150
front of the St Francis
Hotel on Tuesday. My sex,

561
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,390
sexuality, my sexuality is a part of my

562
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,630
private life and I have
not. I have no edits. No.

563
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,850
It has no bearing on my response to the
act of a person seeking to take the life

564
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,263
of another.

565
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,230
I'm first and foremost a human
being who enjoys and respects life.

566
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,130
I feel that a tradition person toward
worth is determined by how he or she

567
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,580
responds to the world in which they live.

568
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,850
Not on how or what with or with whom
a private life is share [inaudible]

569
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,380
you bet. He basically says like, stop.
Stop. It's kind of as simple as that.

570
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,780
Yeah. But there's something else that
happens in the press conference that is,

571
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,640
makes the whole thing, I
mean so much more personal.

572
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,500
And it actually was the very reason that
all of her called the press conference

573
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:14,330
in the first place.

574
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,330
I want you to know that my mother called
me today that she could not walk out of

575
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:26,141
her front door or even go to church
because of the pressures she feels because

576
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,620
of the press stories concerning
my sexual orientation.

577
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,090
Naturally, I never

578
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,360
participated such interference
with my family's relationship,

579
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:45,140
which I, when I said, when I
supposedly say the president's life,

580
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,130
Oliver would later say that, uh,

581
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,850
when he was talking on the phone
with his mother, she said to him,

582
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,550
I don't want to speak to you ever again.

583
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,190
She hung up on him and also hung up.

584
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,190
Did you call him uncle? Uncle Oliver?
Yes. I called him uncle Oliver. Yup.

585
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,840
This is George sipple jr Oliver's
nephew. He told me that, uh,

586
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,660
most of all of his family
stayed in Detroit. Uh,

587
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,170
all of his two brothers and his dad
worked together at an auto plant there.

588
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,220
They all worked for General Motors.
And the stories that I've heard is that

589
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,890
the day after all over saved
the life of President Ford.

590
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,780
They walked in and everyone wanted
to like buy them a beer, you know,

591
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,070
everybody on the factory floor,
um, was congratulating them,

592
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,560
patting them on the back. You
know, your brother's a hero,

593
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:38,250
your son's a hero when, you know, when
they would take their, their shift break,

594
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,270
this is the old days, right?

595
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:43,050
They'd take a shift break and they'd go
to the bar and everybody wanted to like

596
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:47,120
buy them around the drinks. So then
the news comes out and whatever date,

597
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,130
couple of days later that he's this
gay marine and there's teasing on the,

598
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,170
on the factory floor teasing and then
teasing or teasing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,710
[inaudible] yeah. And
George says, what happened,

600
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,150
his reporters back in Detroit just
sorta descended on Oliver's parents

601
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,380
to get more of the story.

602
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,410
And so they kept knocking on
my grand mother's door and she,

603
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,010
I guess apparently told them to go away.
I guess neighbors were harassing her.

604
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,230
She thought the media was harassing
her. My grandmother just said,

605
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:21,990
I don't want to deal with it. And so
don't, don't come knock on the door,

606
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:22,920
leave us alone.

607
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,480
They just wanted it to go away and
won't go back to their private lives.

608
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,940
Now one of the things that
I found actually after
talking to George were these

609
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:36,160
interviews done with Oliver's family
after the news broke that Oliver was gay

610
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,500
and there's just a whole,

611
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,560
I just want to read you this
one particular passage here.

612
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,360
Have you talked to any other members?
This is from George F Sippel. Um,

613
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,480
who is all of our symbols, brother. Uh,

614
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,510
have you talked to any other members
of your family since September,

615
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,870
1975 about Oliver? Um, I
mentioned it once to my father.

616
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,430
Question and what was his response? What
did he say? And if you can remember,

617
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,050
I was on afternoons then and I had seen
him because I had come in early and he

618
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,920
mentioned the fact that the next person
that even said he had a son named

619
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,850
Oliver, he was going to
literally break their damn neck.

620
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,190
Whoa. So his dad was like,
this is from his brother.

621
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,070
Talking about his dad's reaction.
They're talking to the dad. Yeah,

622
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,630
and then so then the brother says,

623
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,110
and he told me quite
clearly in two letter words,

624
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,250
just forget you got a
brother and I let him alone.

625
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,973
He never

626
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:38,010
or anticipated such interference
with my family's relationship,

627
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:42,400
which I, when I said when I
supposedly saved the president's life,

628
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,620
this is all I have to say on this subject.

629
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,460
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

630
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,150
Any questions and go to
minister to my lawyer.

631
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,110
I like to ask the simple
question, what would you,

632
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,180
what would you like to see happen? I know.

633
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,220
No, I'm just, I'm very set up. I may
even have to go see a doctor when this,

634
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,810
I'm very emotional. I've got an I. I
just, I'm feeling very sad for my family.

635
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,730
It's awful. Just off
and nothing more to say.

636
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,530
Can you tell us the story of the
letter? Wow. I wish I would've.

637
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,380
I wish I went abroad. I do have
it, but I didn't bring it today.

638
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,260
The same day is that press conference,

639
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,750
which was a three days after
the assassination attempt.

640
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,930
Gerald Ford actually did write
a letter to Oliver Sipple,

641
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,900
which was then released
publicly. It's a nice letter,

642
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,360
its White House Stationery
White House envelope.

643
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,130
It's basically Ford telling
my uncle that, you know,

644
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:46,000
he's thankful to him for this heroic deed.

645
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,850
And he signed it. Jerry Ford,

646
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,970
which I've been told that Gerald
Ford signed different ways.

647
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,600
So if he signed Jerry
Ford, it meant something.

648
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:00,850
It was like a personal touch. Ah,

649
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,860
well there's this other chapter where
your uncle says to the president,

650
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:09,160
I guess writes. Yes, we
found it. We found a letter.

651
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,430
We found a letter in
the Gerald Ford Library.

652
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,140
It's from your uncle to the
president. Wow. Yeah. And I did not,

653
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,830
I did not know about that letter.
Really. I have the letter right now.

654
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:25,570
So it's the date on into September
30th, 1975 so here's what it says.

655
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,070
Uh, dear. Mr President, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah.

656
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,800
You said it was what it
was when? September 30th,

657
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,780
1975 so that would be a couple days
after he got the letter from Ford.

658
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,670
This was so obviously at this,
the, he got my grand mother.

659
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:44,880
Must've hung up on him. Right. Um, and
then he wrote the letter. Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,830
It sounds like cause he could because
he couldn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,630
That's really interesting. Yeah. Well,

662
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,710
and then stop me anytime if
you have thoughts or reactions.

663
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,660
[inaudible] dear Mr President,

664
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,550
thank you for taking the time to write
to me in view of some of the events since

665
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,590
the unfortunate attempt
on your life on Monday,

666
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,610
September 22nd I really appreciate
your publicly thanking me.

667
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,850
As you probably know,

668
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,170
there have been a number
of stories concerning my
personal sexual orientation in

669
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,010
the news media.

670
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,720
These stories have caused great anguish
to my parents and to the rest of my

671
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:21,261
family.

672
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:26,150
I am sure my mother hung up on me when
I first called her after these stories

673
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,350
began to be published.

674
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,210
I know you are concerned with very many
matters which are too important and

675
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:36,380
pressing for you to be concerned with
the details of my private life. However,

676
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:41,381
the unexpected and glaring publicity which
has been given to my private life has

677
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:46,340
very seriously disrupted my family
relationships. Mr President,

678
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:51,320
it is a very hard thing to have your
mother and family not want to have any

679
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:55,790
contact with you. I know that
your schedule is heavily occupied,

680
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:00,860
but I respectfully request that you take
the time to see my family or at least

681
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:04,130
call my family. The telephone
number is three one, three,

682
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,340
eight zero.

683
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,940
I love my family and I do not want
to be separated from their love and

684
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:14,440
companionship. Your help will be
gratefully appreciated respectfully,

685
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,760
all over w simple.

686
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,573
Well

687
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,643
that's sad.

688
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,170
Saturday to think that nothing came of it,

689
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,780
you know? Yeah,

690
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,823
yeah.

691
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:00,610
[inaudible] we

692
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,670
tried really hard to find out if
Ford ever made that call. Uh, the,

693
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,570
the archivists at the
Ford Library, they, uh,

694
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,780
went through his call logs and there
was no evidence that he ever made that

695
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:15,520
call. And then we talked to George
Jr and he talked to, you know,

696
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,110
everybody in his family and they
don't remember it either. Anyway,

697
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,830
you can't say for sure, but as far as we
can tell, uh, that call never happened.

698
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:28,890
But we did find out that the same day
that all of her sent that letter of back

699
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:29,944
to Ford,

700
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,160
he and his lawyer filed a $15
million lawsuit against the press.

701
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,360
Really? So I'm saying saying what?

702
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:44,390
That the newspapers when they publicized
that he was gay without his consent,

703
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,430
they violated his privacy.

704
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,750
Okay. Walking out of civic center,

705
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,270
Burt onto civic center in San Francisco.

706
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,081
It's just,

707
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:58,310
it's one of those cases where it pulls
your head in one direction and it pulls

708
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:01,280
your heart in the exact
opposite direction. And so,

709
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:06,020
so we wanted to get into the legal
case files and we could not find them.

710
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:09,380
We looked and looked and looked and
then we found them. You found them?

711
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:10,580
We found. Where'd you find them?

712
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:15,470
Uh, so the clerk's office is, I guess
not surprisingly right off city hall.

713
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,780
They were at this court in San
Francisco. And so we recruited this guy,

714
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:24,610
this researcher, historian of the Gay
Movement in San Francisco. A great name,

715
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:29,500
Joey Plaster. And He, okay, so
I'm going to need your Id. Okay.

716
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,110
Went and got the files for us.
And then when we found them,

717
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:35,740
it turned out the were like house and
thousands upon thousands of pages.

718
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,160
And is that everything?
That's everything. Okay.

719
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,350
So the issue, you know, it's,

720
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,710
it's a very fundamental issue for those
of us in journalism and to help us make

721
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:47,800
sense of the arguments, you
know, lurking in those pages.

722
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,650
What is privacy and what
is invasion of privacy?

723
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,180
We talked to Dan morain editorial
page editor of the Sacramento Bee.

724
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,410
He actually first heard about the case
in journalism school and also wrote about

725
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:02,740
all of our simple way back in
the 1980s. So anyway, okay.

726
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:06,640
So here's the first page of the file.
The lawsuit was against the chronicle,

727
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,590
the cases, Oliver w sipple plaintiff
versus the Chronicle Publishing Company.

728
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,280
It was against the La Times,
uh, de Moines Register,

729
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:17,010
the Chicago Sun Times the Denver
Post, the Indianapolis Star,

730
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,870
and the San Antonio Express. Wow.

731
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,160
Let's see. So this is a,

732
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,150
the deposition of all of
her simple. Let's see.

733
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,650
So one of the arguments that the lawyers
for the newspapers were making is that

734
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:31,770
all of her sexuality
was not actually private

735
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:32,500
lawyer.

736
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,240
Were there any people that you knew
in San Francisco's and say September,

737
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,800
1975 who knew that you were
homosexual? Simple. Yes. Lawyer.

738
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:46,780
Approximately how many people? Simple.
I have no idea. More than 10 yes.

739
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,080
More than 50 yes. More than a hundred yes.

740
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,810
People in New York who knew he was gay.

741
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,100
There were people in Dallas who
knew he was gay and it kind of,

742
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,060
they settle in the like in the hundreds.

743
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,510
Did you tell anybody before in September
of 1975 that you were homosexual?

744
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,680
If I were asked, I am asking you,
I don't know what you were asking

745
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,620
and they make the argument in
newspapers, lawyers that, hey,

746
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,650
this was already somewhat public a fact,

747
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,220
but his personal business
was his personal business. I

748
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,190
have never attempted to obtain
publicity for the fact that I am gay or

749
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:25,450
predominantly homosexual and my sexual
orientation was a private citizen.

750
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,040
I had made my home approximately
1,800 miles away from, but

751
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,130
my parents and my family so that I
could move somewhat freely in the gay

752
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,820
community without the fact that my sexual
orientation getting back to my parents

753
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,590
and family and it goes on,

754
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,480
but the newspapers made this other
argument that was like, okay,

755
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,970
whether or not you're
living a double life,

756
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:46,280
whether or not you wanted to
or whether or not you had to,

757
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,790
there's something here that's bigger
than that, that's bigger than you,

758
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,800
which was he was a private citizen who
thrust himself as anybody would hope they

759
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,000
would do. He ran toward,

760
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,480
he went toward danger and when he did,

761
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,000
he also thrust himself
into the public eye.

762
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:04,580
[inaudible]

763
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,830
and the journalists, when
you're in the public eye,

764
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:10,090
you become something else entirely.
You become a public [inaudible].

765
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,810
Yesterday in San Francisco, a shot fired

766
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,110
when that happened to all of her,
he lost his right to privacy.

767
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,070
Oh, I'll make one more
try on the gay thing,

768
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,630
and the newspapers argued when
it came to of sexuality. No,

769
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,050
it was news at the time.

770
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,340
It is was an it all pregnant at times
has been my judgment that Mr Sippel,

771
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,450
his activities in the gay community are
highly significant in newsworthy for two

772
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:35,950
important reasons. First,

773
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,870
on March 6th Sergeant Leonard Methadone,
a disclosed that he was a homosexual.

774
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,290
Sure. So like we said,

775
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:44,500
when Daryl Lemke was writing
that article about all of her,

776
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:48,220
you had this big story about the u
s air force trying to kick this guy,

777
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:53,221
Leonard Matlovich out because he was gay
and Oliver has heard nothing from the

778
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:55,990
president. The President
leader said that he,

779
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,800
that had nothing to do with all of her
being gay, but to people at the time,

780
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,220
the suggestion that the president's
expression of gratitude to Sippel might've

781
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:06,610
been affected by rumors of simple's
activities than the gay community that was

782
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,300
new

783
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,133
newest secretary.

784
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,960
Nothing was asked if that was the reason
President Ford has not yet personally

785
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:15,020
thanked him. Second lie, the innuendos

786
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,010
simple as public display of here,

787
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:19,680
wisdom and saving the life of the
president of the United States

788
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,750
distortions. Okay. People
with child molesters

789
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,560
presented an image that gay
people are like everybody else,

790
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,750
that they're heroes image,

791
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:32,020
certainly contrary to the stereotype
of persons associated with the gay

792
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,660
community as weak and UNHEROIC figures,

793
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
which is to say this
is newsworthy, this is

794
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:41,110
worth knowing. And it is something that
the whole country wants to know. And,

795
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,780
and the value of that is more
than the value of, you know,

796
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:49,020
this individual person's privacy. Do
they make it that explicitly? I mean,

797
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:52,770
sort of putting it in terms of the public
benefit outweighs the private privacy.

798
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,010
Yeah. Hmm. Um, so all of this case,

799
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,300
it dragged on for nine years. So, uh,

800
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:03,240
from 1975 to 1984. Um, but this is,

801
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,740
I'm quoting a judgment.

802
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:10,910
The record shows that the publications
were not motivated by Morbid and

803
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:13,500
sensational prying into
appellant's private life,

804
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,480
but rather were prompted by
legitimate political concerns, I.

805
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:22,500
E to dispel the false public
opinion that gays were timid, weak,

806
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:27,210
and UNHEROIC figures. And to raise the
equally important political question,

807
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,220
whether the president of the United States
entertained a discriminatory attitude

808
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:34,340
or bias against a minority
groups such as homosexuals.

809
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,230
So the court tossed
Oliver's case out, he lost.

810
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,340
He didn't get a dime.

811
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,981
I mean if you think about,

812
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:47,981
it is weird that a journalist can just
take a person's most private details and

813
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:52,500
then if it feels relevant, like
if they can make that argument,

814
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:55,570
they just put it out there. Like if we,

815
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:00,590
if we were to go silent because somebody
says don't say that about me then and

816
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,060
the government backs him up. It is,

817
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:08,061
if it's meaningful than the person out
of which the meaning is being pulled

818
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:11,820
painfully has nothing to say about
it. That's just weird to me. It's,

819
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,900
it's really hard.

820
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,230
I mean I was thinking about this like
even sort of on the train coming over here

821
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,590
again,

822
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:21,510
Daniel looser and it's like the thing
that like makes journalism laws so

823
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:25,740
complicated and the things that make
an invasion of privacy discussion so

824
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:30,741
difficult is that like
what makes something not an
invasion of privacy is not

825
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:35,100
that it's okay. It's that it's
politically, you know, relevant.

826
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,470
So like the s the fact that the story,

827
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:42,471
the fact that the private details of
his life are politically relevant means

828
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,320
that it's not an invasion
of privacy. You know,

829
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:49,170
it doesn't mean that it isn't
rude or that it doesn't hurt.

830
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:53,760
It means that it's an
appropriate story to feed out,

831
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,310
to publish. But I, but I do think like,

832
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,650
why should the journalists be the only
ones to decide what is newsworthy?

833
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,630
It's not like, why is it
that then journalists, you,

834
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,320
you just pick up a notepad and a pencil
and all of a sudden you have so much

835
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:13,040
more power to say what's
sayable then than anybody else?

836
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,480
Well, I mean, we have a,

837
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,420
this sort of long tradition of that
in the United States. I mean like,

838
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:23,650
that's like what the first amendment
is. I mean, I dunno, I mean, it's like,

839
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:26,440
yeah, sure. Like, it's like why do
journalists get to decide that? Well,

840
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:30,940
like who would you rather have decided?
It's not a perfect system, but it's,

841
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,350
you know, it kind of works.
So Oliver, just like this,

842
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,230
this is pretty Sir Tracy Hunt
who was in on the interview.

843
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,250
Somebody whose life is basically kind
of sacrifice to the altar of the first

844
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:46,960
amendment. And it's like
sad way. Yes. Um, yeah.

845
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:54,690
[inaudible] [inaudible]

846
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,470
yeah, it feels like he was sacrificed
from all sides actually. Yeah.

847
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,550
It feels like there's this
one kind of man in the middle.

848
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:05,190
And then there are all
these forces around him,

849
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:10,110
these like these larger than life
forces, like the White House.

850
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:13,960
There's the game movement, there's
the freedom of the press and,

851
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,800
and all these people are, are
sort of batting around all these,

852
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,400
all these enormous and
important abstractions. And
then in the middle of it,

853
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:23,670
there's this guy that just,
he's trampled by all of them.

854
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,340
And so what ends up happening
to in the end, well,

855
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:31,341
apparently some people in
the gay community during
and after the lawsuit felt

856
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:35,190
that he was trying to
go back in the closet,

857
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:39,290
so they sort of turn
their backs on him. Uh,

858
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,280
he surprisingly, he was friends
with Harvey milk till, till the end.

859
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,080
Like when Harvey Milk was assassinated,
all of simple went to his funeral.

860
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,850
Um, and he did have one
brother, George Sr, who,

861
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:58,530
who stuck by him throughout,
but, but his parents did not. Uh,

862
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,910
and they never fully accepted the
fact that he was gay. And, and two,

863
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:07,320
when his mom died, uh, it,
it, it was so bad that, uh,

864
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,850
all of our samples, father didn't let
him go to the funeral and because he,

865
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,430
he sort of, he had so,

866
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,110
so few people I guess at the end
and because there weren't, you know,

867
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:23,580
a lot of news articles about him and
cause a lot of people in the gay community

868
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:28,080
from that time have died. Um,
because of the AIDS crisis,

869
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,740
uh,

870
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,850
it was really hard to find
out what happened to all
of our civil and those last

871
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,790
five years of his life. Um,

872
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:41,160
and the only way we could was because
when we were talking to Daniel Looser,

873
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,730
he mentioned this interview that he
did with this guy named Wayne Friday.

874
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,340
He was a friend of Oliver's
Wayne Friday was sort of like a,

875
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:51,330
a pillar of the community
in San Francisco, like a
pillar of the gay community.

876
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:55,740
And then also a sort of political figure
and he was a cop and you know, he was,

877
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,580
he was, he sort of fingers in
every pie, uh, kind of thing.

878
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,320
Wayne died last year,

879
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,670
but Daniel's still had the transcript
of their conversation about all of our

880
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,380
simple's last days. And so to absorb
that or just sort of speak that

881
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,630
we found an actor, uh,
the very gifted, uh,

882
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,020
Gordon Pinsent and we
had him read it for us.

883
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:21,950
Okay.

884
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,660
Okay. Let me have a go.

885
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,583
Okay.

886
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,330
Uh, I, uh, I forget, was it
1975 the Sarah Jane Moore or,

887
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:32,710
Yeah.

888
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:37,710
Then I met him around 73 he was a
swamper had a gay bar called the cockpit.

889
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,020
Okay.

890
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,560
Swan brothers, they cleaned
the borrowers at night? No,

891
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,450
they set the bar up for the
next bartender in the morning.

892
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,020
That's what I did today. He did
it at two or three different bars.

893
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:51,030
He was always at the bars. I'd see him.

894
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,080
We actually became friends because we had
discovered we were both from Michigan.

895
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,743
Okay.

896
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:01,880
Bill was a good guy. It was just
so fucking alcoholic. I mean,

897
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,470
he'd get his disability check once a month
and he called down one of the bars in

898
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:09,770
the tenderloin where he used to hang
out was called Queen Mary's pub.

899
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:14,120
He'd go in there the day he got
his check, swear to God he'd,

900
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,620
he'd spend his whole fucking check on
everybody and he'd get broke the rest of

901
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:20,360
the month. He just
couldn't control. And so,

902
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,130
and he was a little bit
of a Blowhard, you know,

903
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,210
easy. Get drunk, Tim's loud and
need get posted on the bars.

904
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,770
I used to drive him home, had an apartment
on Van Ness, had a little studio,

905
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:38,460
maybe have a one bedroom on
the first floor at about Turk.

906
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,000
He'd be drunker than Hell at
the barn. I drive him home.

907
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,650
So I always knew where he lived.

908
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,050
And after this thing with Ford,
it really fucked his mind.

909
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,890
Simple was a broken guy. After
that, the whole thing worked out,

910
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,060
the publicity of it all. And the fact
that everyone knew he was a Faggot,

911
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,280
you know, he said to me a couple of times,

912
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,840
I went to the Marine Corps and I got
hurt. And now what am I known for,

913
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:08,840
for being a faggot? And
I'd say, no, you're not.

914
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,990
You're known for saving
the president's life.

915
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,160
He won't be known for what you
did in bed for Christ sake.

916
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,270
But he would get drunk and niched.

917
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:23,320
I'd be moaning that I'd sit there in the
barn with him and I'd talk to him about

918
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:28,250
it. Hey man, it is what
it is. But he was just,

919
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,090
he was just down to nothing.

920
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,840
[inaudible]

921
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,700
this thing happened and had overcame
him. It was too much for him to handle.

922
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,660
And I think he got to feeling
sorry for himself and his family.

923
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,580
Just many a night I would sit in the bar
with a pill Sippel and he'd cry on your

924
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:52,720
shoulder and you'd say, okay,
simple. It's time to go home.

925
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,940
And then I drive him home.

926
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,200
I remember it was raining,
it was pouring fucking rain.

927
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,080
Bruce called me at my office over
at the DA's office and said, Wayne,

928
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,340
will you do a wellbeing check on?
Simple for me. And I said, why?

929
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,230
And he said, nobody has seen the dude.
He hasn't been around for awhile.

930
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,650
So we go up there together and it was
raining and I'm ringing the bell ringing.

931
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,200
The bell rang. He doesn't answer.

932
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,190
I noticed on his door there were these
little stick and things posted and he had

933
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:44,220
befriended this little old
lady who lived next door.

934
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:48,570
They kind of looked after each other
and she had left all these notes. Bill,

935
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,220
call me, I can't get ahold of you.

936
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:56,260
So I rang the manager's bell and
I was a little filler Vietnam guy.

937
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,010
I showed him my badge and I
said, you gotta let me in.

938
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:05,850
And so he did and the door opened
and I knew what was going on.

939
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,190
It's the smell. It's a
smell. You'll never forget.

940
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,190
It's a sickening, sweet smell.

941
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,190
Bill was sitting in the chair,

942
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,590
he was bloated. He was
bloated out real big.

943
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,893
Okay.

944
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:35,100
He had a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting
there and the television was still on.

945
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,970
The coroner told me he'd been dead about
10 days as near as I got fake hair.

946
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,330
Got It. I didn't know he was only 47

947
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,000
okay.

948
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,890
I thought he was older than that. Anyway,

949
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,180
I got the guide who opened the
door for me and the minute he did,

950
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,560
I said close it

951
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,240
and then I had to stand there
and wait for the car now.

952
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,483
No,

953
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,700
I remember it was over
here at the Campbell,

954
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:29,701
a funeral home on market street and then
we buried him out in gold get national

955
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:31,680
cemetery in San Bruno

956
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:34,760
[inaudible]

957
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,600
and I remember it was, it was very small.

958
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah.

959
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,230
Casket wasn't open.

960
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,310
I am.

961
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,680
The funeral was just,

962
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:49,510
I mean there were more
media than anything else.

963
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,580
I'd seen him buy drinks from more
people than were at that funeral.

964
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,700
He could have been buried in Arlington
if they'd made an issue out of it.

965
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,230
I mean, shit, there he was, this national
icon, a gay whatever and [inaudible]

966
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,970
I am

967
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,900
with just a few people
out there for the funeral.

968
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:33,590
[inaudible]

969
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,990
I believe in human life.

970
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,740
[inaudible]

971
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,280
and I think that this country
stands for human values,

972
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,070
including life and freedom.

973
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,420
I'm first and foremost a human
being who enjoys and respects life.

974
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,910
I feel that, I bet. I
feel that [inaudible]

975
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,880
worth is determined by how he or she

976
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,230
responds to the world in which they live.

977
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,510
[inaudible]

978
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:15,280
not on how or what or with
whom a private life you share

979
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,160
[inaudible] they started losing my words

980
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,083
and their mind feel.

981
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,340
[inaudible] this is all I
have to say on this subject.

982
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,730
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

983
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,443
No.

984
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,480
This story was reported by
lots of Nasr and Tracy Hunt.

985

Wow.

We had original music in this story. Uh,

995
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:07,600
we use a lot of music from
a guy named Patrick Cowley.

996
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,950
He was a guy who grew up in buffalo,
moved to San Francisco in the 70s,

997
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:15,190
like Oliver sipple. And
in 1982, he died of AIDS.

998
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,950
This music was released posthumously
by the label, dark entries.

999
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,520
We're super grateful to
them and to Patrick County,

01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:28,170

his music. And, uh, last bill,

1001
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:32,470

to say a very sort of special, uh,

1002
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,320
belated goodbye to our senior
producer, Jamie. You are,

1003
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,370
who did a little of the legal
research and the story trying to,

1004
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,360
cause we had to really probe fairly
deeply to get the legal files. Thank you,

1005
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,194
Jamie, for doing that.

1006
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,613
And for everything,

1007
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:49,550
for guiding so many of our stories and
our whole team for the last few years.

1008
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:51,890
Jamie, we will, we'll
really miss you. Yes,

1009
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,520
we even do at this very
moment. We'll miss you.

1010
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,630
Alright, I'm Chad. I've been
riding, I'm Robert Krulwich.
