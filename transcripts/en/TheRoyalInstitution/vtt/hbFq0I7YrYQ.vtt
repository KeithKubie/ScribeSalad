00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.160
Wouldn't it be lovely to make contact
with another civilization

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.060
that has arisen and evolved independently.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.920
Well, one thing you'd have to do first
is to be sure you can understand the message.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.480
Why should we expect
that beings that are very different,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.500
evolved in a  different place,
different period of time for their evolution,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.760
should be able to send us a message
that we can understand.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.860
And the reason
that I think that's likely

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.060
is that they live
in the same universe as we,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.980
they must deal with the
same laws of physics and chemistry

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.620
and astronomy as we.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.420
To test the idea
that a signal could be understood,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.620
we did a little experiment –
we can only use human beings,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.180
it's too bad I wish we could use
some other intelligent beings

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.380
to make such an experiment,
but we're restricted to people

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.500
they're the only ones we know about.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.180
and so what we did

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.679
was to devise a complicated message,
which you can see here,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.120
of zeros and ones.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.640
The zero and one might be a long and a
short radio beep, you know,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.700
[BEEPS]

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Or it might be two frequencies,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.060
[BEEPS]

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.380
Might be many things.
But it's a language of two letters,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.020
And you can see there's
an enormous number of zeros and ones,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.780
in fact 27,000 and something of them.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.280
You can't tell just by looking at it,
oh my goodness I see what this is,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.660
you have to think about it.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.300
Now the key to this is
that the total number of zeros and ones

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.860
is 31 times 31 times 31,
31 cubed,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.980
and it suggests that it's
a pictorial message in 3 dimensions .

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.300
And if we were to write  it
in a sequence of 31 symbols

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.820
then go to the next line,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.980
Then you see it starts
getting a remarkable regularity.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.780
And so what we did

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.540
is to give this message,
not made simple in that way,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.800
to some graduate students of mine
at Cornell University

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.240
they were told nothing
about what was in it, how to decode it,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.600
and their job was to figure out
what it said.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.120
And here they are describing the the
process they went through

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.620
to figure out what the message was about.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
These are all graduate students of mine
who are reasonably clever

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.100
But none of them
work on this particular problem.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.980
Well we gathered together
in the the Mars room

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.000
and stared at it,
and cursed volubly at length

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.920
Kathy noticed that 31 divided
into 27 thousand... 29 thousand

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.860
seven hundred and ninety one,
and it was  determined that the remainder,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.940
961, was 31 squared which left us with a
31 by 31 by 31 sequence

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.459
And then we sat together six of us for
hours transcribing zeros and ones,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.340
screaming and shouting
from one office to the next

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.780
and complaining about the
typographical errors

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.400
until we could get the sequence
which is shown in the frames there.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.540
They were making good progress,
they found some errors in the transcription

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.600
of this that the BBC had made in fact,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.800
but they figured out how to get around that.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.880
It was not necessarily a
three dimensional model at first,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.100
it could have been a movie, because
what eventually turned out to be

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.500
the corner markers of the cube,

00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:42.810
and the lines which drew
the pattern of the cube

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.040
could have been just frame markers
for movie or a slideshow

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680
it could have been separate frames .

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.740
And it was only when we
had drawn them out and looked at them

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.200
that it became very uncertain whether it
was anything like that.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.500
– Since it was a dull movie
you figured it was really three dimensional?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500
– That's about the size of it.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.320
So, here we have some Plexiglas things.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.140
A 'one' will be represented by a black square,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.020
And a 'zero' by a transparent square.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.260
Here's a whole sequence 
of transparent squares

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.480
that represent a sequence of zeros.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.380
Now building up as the message requires,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.540
the first space is a one which is black,
second space another one which is black

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.346
third space another one which is black,

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:39.940
and in fact it's black one's all the way
across the top line.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.580
So top line there is
a sequence of black ones.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.820
Next line begins with a black one
but then there's a sequence of zeros

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.440
represented by the transparent markers,
and then a one at the end.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.480
Now we have the similar pattern
building up,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.580
black edge, transparent interior,
which goes for a number of lines further

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.920
Now the next line is different,
it starts out with a one,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.260
has a sequence of zeros and then there
are three ones in the middle.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.580
Then the same sequence of zeros
and then a one.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.860
So here is the black one at the periphery,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.640
then here are the zeros,
next are the three black ones

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.720
And then there will be zeros
and a black one there,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.300
and the remainder of this frame
fills in like this.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.960
So we now see the picture
is a black border

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.300
and a kind of maltese cross in the middle

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.000
and everything else blank.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.520
And there are many other layers
and when we build them all up

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.320
we result in a pattern
which we will shortly see

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.380
And that is the answer.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.840
We can tell this is the right
answer because of how regular

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.840
the  geometry is, 
it couldn't have gotten that by accident.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.160
So here is in three dimensions
what the resulting model is like.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.680
Now let's see what the
graduate students have to say

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.680
about their interpretation
of this funny-looking message.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.080
The first thing that came out of our
analysis of that object

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.760
was that in profile it was
strongly reminiscent of Mickey Mouse

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.340
And in fact it's still not clear
whether that's the case.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.260
And although we know that you
have a sense of humour

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.780
Mickey Mouse was not our
idea of a joke,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.040
So it had to be something else.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.900
The only thing it really looked like
was a molecular orbital type

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.800
drawing of a molecule.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.100
And the first one that came to my mind
was formaldehyde

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.520
And Kathy is in fact right, this was
intended to be a formaldehyde molecule

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.060
although it does look a little bit like
Mickey Mouse.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.480
In which there is a carbon atom,
two hydrogens and an oxygen.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.620
Now what could the significance
of that be?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Why go to all this trouble to simply say
formaldehyde?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.820
And the answer is that

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.960
formaldehyde has a radio frequency
attached to it.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.260
And what all of this trouble is about

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.659
is the message is saying
don't listen on this station,

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.649
this isn't the station that's interesting,
listen on the formaldehyde station

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:26.340
and that's where the
Encyclopedia Galactica will be.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.580
So as soon as we get that message,
quick, we turn the frequency

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.280
of our radio telescope
to the formaldehyde frequency,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.618
continue to look at the same
star we're looking at

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.340
and then hopefully get such a message.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.640
That's the general kind of idea,
notice that if we made

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.040
a serious such search and succeeded,
the results would be inestimable.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.660
We would have have ended
the isolation of mankind

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.500
from the rest of the universe forever.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.819
If we made a serious search and failed,
we would have determined something

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.160
of the uniqueness, fragility,
preciousness of human beings

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.520
and it seems to me either way we win.
