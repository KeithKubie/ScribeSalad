00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.340
JASON SILVA: The famed
physicist, Freeman Dyson,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820
wrote about a very
near future, where

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.190
a new generation of
artists will be writing,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.404
composing genomes
with the fluency

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:28.294
that Blake and
Byron wrote verses,

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.584
with the fluency of Shakespeare.

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:35.700
In other words, our new
alphabet, our new technology,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.520
our new canvas is life itself.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.030
The software of
biology, genetics,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.210
mastering the information
processes of biology

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.790
turns the substrate
of life itself

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.810
into the raw material
for minds to engage with.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.100
Talk about a recursive loop.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.720
Talk about us folding
in on ourselves.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.310
Mind has now
transcended its biology

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.820
enough to turn around and start
to tweak its own compositions.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.480
I mean talk about the
evolutionary process,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.745
slingshotting and evolving
its own evolvability.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:24.170
Biotechnology makes us as gods.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.060
As Stewart Brand
said, "We are as gods

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.340
and should finally
get good at it."

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.240
We ought to realize that
we are the music makers.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.630
We are the dreamers of dreams.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.970
We cast the spells.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.800
We invoke the songs.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.350
It's up to us.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.200
This is our moment.
