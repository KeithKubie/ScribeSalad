BRAD BIRD: That moment where
the character touches the pin

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.270
and finds herself
in the wheat field

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.670
was part of the film when
Damon pitched me the idea,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.380
and that idea that this
better world was that close

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.850
was really attractive to me.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.040
DAMON LINDELOF: This is
our view of "Tomorrowland."

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.900
It's a Disney movie.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.344
It's coming out in the summer.

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:21.760
You know, we want
people to-- this

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.370
is-- he's enjoying his popcorn.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.100
He's drinking.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.707
He's drinking a
soda, more popcorn.

00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:27.540
He's-- something's gone
down the wrong pipe.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.123
He's clapping.

00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:30.270
He's scared.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.020
I feel like I'm on Pictionary.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.190
It's terrifying.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.532
We're going to do the rest
of this interview as--

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:36.741
BRAD BIRD: As Admiral Ackbar.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.365
DAMON LINDELOF: That
will get feedback.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.180
The views on YouTube
are going to shoot up.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
Did you hear Bird did
a sit-down at Google

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.500
as Ackbar for two hours?
