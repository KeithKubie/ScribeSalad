00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
sex
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410

uh and everything they say is right it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
uh and everything they say is right it
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630
uh and everything they say is right it
feels kind of misogynistic even if

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
feels kind of misogynistic even if
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.330
feels kind of misogynistic even if
they're trying to the only excuse I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
they're trying to the only excuse I
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.530
they're trying to the only excuse I
could think of is that they're trying to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
could think of is that they're trying to
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.849
could think of is that they're trying to
make what happens to her in The Killing

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859
make what happens to her in The Killing
 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.339
make what happens to her in The Killing
Joke a little more emotional because she

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
Joke a little more emotional because she
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.930
Joke a little more emotional because she
kind of shows up and then she's just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
kind of shows up and then she's just
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.960
kind of shows up and then she's just
kind of gone in the story so but

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
kind of gone in the story so but
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.280
kind of gone in the story so but
everything with The Killing Joke is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
everything with The Killing Joke is
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050
everything with The Killing Joke is
establishing that this history already

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
establishing that this history already
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.569
establishing that this history already
exists and it's done through such clever

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
exists and it's done through such clever
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.099
exists and it's done through such clever
writing and I think that's the one last

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109
writing and I think that's the one last
 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.330
writing and I think that's the one last
thing I'll say about the first half-hour

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
thing I'll say about the first half-hour
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.289
thing I'll say about the first half-hour
is that the writing does not match the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299
is that the writing does not match the
 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.119
is that the writing does not match the
rest of the writing at all I think

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129
rest of the writing at all I think
 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.589
rest of the writing at all I think
that's the biggest problem

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599
that's the biggest problem
 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.990
that's the biggest problem
I know people talk about you know the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
I know people talk about you know the
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.599
I know people talk about you know the
way back row is done terribly and Batman

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
way back row is done terribly and Batman

I would still recommend it with the idea
 

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.510
I would still recommend it with the idea
that you can just fast-forward that

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:36.520
that you can just fast-forward that
 

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.940
