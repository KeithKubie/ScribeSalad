00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.580
They're just entire cabbage leaves, kimchi cabbage leaves in it,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.720
it looks and smells fantastic!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.660
Hey everyone it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.400
At the airport now and Ying and I are on our way to Incheon International Airport, Seoul, Korea

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.480
And we're gonna be there for the next seven days along with Ying's two sisters,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.680
we're gonna be sightseeing and eating and I'm gonna be vlogging

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.600
And then after that we're gonna travel from Seoul to Jeonju, which is in kind of the South of South Korea

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.720
So stay tuned for lots of vlogs coming from Korea and lots of Korean food

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.380
Ying are you excited to go to Korea?/
Peace out!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.640
Our flight leaves at a little after midnight at 12:10 and I think it should be about 6 hour flight,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.220
we're gonna arrive early in the morning into Seoul

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.420
I fell asleep before we took off and it is now morning and they have just come around with breakfast

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.380
Oh, the hotdog is better than it looks!

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.080
We have just landed at Incheon International Airport,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.060
Welcome to South Korea!

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.640
Oh that was some cold air!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.020
It is 7:30 AM in the morning

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.180
That was a good flight with Korean Air!

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.900
Before we leave the airport, we just bought these little cards,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.300
it's called T-Money, and you can use it for the subway, you can use it for the train,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.680
you can use it for the bus, I think

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.300
And you can buy that T-Money card at any of the convenience stores,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.900
there are a couple of them right here as you arrive in the airport

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.280
We just arrived to Seoul Station, that ride took about 1 hour,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.040
we're gonna be staying at an airbnb that we rented, but we cannot check in until 3 pm

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520
So it is now about 10 AM, we're gonna look for a locker,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.180
so that we can walk around and then after that come back for our bags,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.300
and then we'll check in later this afternoon

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.620
This is by far the most high-tech locker system I've ever seen in my life!

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.760
The entire block of lockers is all controlled throughout from this computer screen

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.880
So we'll take, I think we'll take this one

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.260
Oh, that's awesome! And it opens!

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.600
Success with the locker, i haven't really had a chance yet to do any research,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.340
so we're just gonna walk around try to find something quick to eat

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.000
And then hopefully throughout today, I'll be able to do more research on where to eat and what to do

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.760
Oh! This is a good looking restaurant right here! I think this is where we're eating right here!

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.580
Yeah

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.080
All the menu is in Korean, but they had this one little printed off paper that was in English,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.440
and it said that they serve potato and pork bone soup,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.760
and they had all different sizes. We ordered the large size for all four of us

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.860
Oh, I gotta have a piece of kimchi right now

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.920
I love kimchi!

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.360
They are just entire cabbage leaves, kimchi cabbage leaves in it,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.860
big pork bones, lots of potatoes, and a bunch of leaves on top. It looks and smells fantastic!

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.700
She gave us some scissors as well,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.900
so I think we might chop up everything into bite sized pieces before we start eating

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.480
This is just a beautiful hot pot, there is so much kimchi in here, and just giant pork bones

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.120
Oh!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.200
It's really good, that's like, that is like pork kimchi soup

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.020
You can taste a little bit of the sourness from all that kimchi,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.840
and mostly it's just pretty porky!

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.720
And they're just gigantic bones in here, so I think there is not a whole lot of meat,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.880
but there is a little bit of meat

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.300
And let me take some of that kimchi as well, put it onto my plate

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.820
Oh, I gotta eat some of that kimchi with rice

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.180
that is a lot of hot kimchi

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.180
Oh, that just slides off the bone, looks extraordinarily tender

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.840
and eat that with a piece of kimchi as well

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.820
That is so tender! You don't even need to chew, you don't need teeth for that meat

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.540
So that's just like the extremely tender result of boling pork for a very very long time

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.380
I actually forgot that potato is one of the main ingredients in this dish,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.680
but there are some big chunks of potato, I think the potato has sort of,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.640
parts of the potato have slightly disintegrated into the soup so that's kind of what's thickening it

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:03.380
I know this is kind of a little bit of starchiness in the soup along with that pepper, red chili broth

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.560
Let me take another bite and I want to have one of those leaves that was sitting on top,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.340
I think that is one right there

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.380
That leaf has a wonderful slight liquorish flavor to it,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.620
I think, I think it might be similar to shiso leaf or sesame leaf

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.860
Almost like a clove and liquorish anise flavor to it

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.980
They have a sauce on the table, I have no idea what it is, but I'm gonna try it

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.680
Kind of looks like it needs to be stirred up though because there is some different layers of ingredients in it

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.100
All right!

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.820
And let me taste some of this on a piece of kimchi with some rice

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.240
That's wasabi

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.920
Oh that's wonderful!

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.140
It's kind of like a sweet wasabi sauce

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.580
Oh that's good, that goes immediately up your nose!

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.780
I'm gonna put on a little bit of wasabi, oh yeah!

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.540
This has been outstandingly delicious, we're getting to the bottom of our pan here,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.020
and look at how thick and how wonderful the broth is at the bottom,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.780
I think that's a combination of some of the pork fat + some of the like collagen and marrow

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.840
that's come out of the bones from being boiled for so long and maybe a little bit of that potato

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.860
That is incredible! Oh,It is thick and hardy and rich, that is intensely flavorful!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.440
That was a truly incredible first meal here in Seoul this trip

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.180
And this is a really good restaurant, it's basically right across the street from Seoul Station

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.400
Amazing, I'm feeling extremely good after that and that is one my favorite ways to

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.620
find restaurants just walking around and seeing a place that looks good

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.720
We're back at Seoul Station now, and it is cherry blossom season,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.440
so Ying's sisters search for somewhere that is good for seeing the cherry blossoms,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.980
we're on our way there now

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.500
We got off the subway at National Assembly and then took exit number 1,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.500
and after such a good lunch, I'm really tired, so we're just gonna walk around here for a little bit,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.400
and then probably head back to Seoul Station and by then it should be time for us to check in to our airbnb

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:05.680
They are blossoming in fully white-ish pink flowers covering the trees, it is really nice to walk through

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:14.480
Oh, and they have lots of snacks too like cotton candy and I smelled some grilled chicken back there as well

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.460
We made it back to Seoul Station, picked up our bags,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.820
and we are walking around this area looking for our apartment

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.380
We had a little bit of an adventure as soon as we arrived, I was typing in the keypad the code,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.460
and we were met by a couple of Seoul tourists police, and they said that this building

00:10:51.460 --> 00:11:01.300
is not recognized or registered as a tourist lodging facility, it's a business building and an office building,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:07.860
and so they said it doesn't have the proper insurance that it needs to house people especially tourists,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.120
but the police were really nice and they gave us their numbers to make sure

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.900
we call them if anything bad happens, but we're here now and it's pretty nice

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.540
it's a big spacious room, and then there are two bedrooms and quite a few beds,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.180
so it can accomodate a lot of people

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:33.020
I fell into a deep sleep for about an hour, just woke up, I kinda only feel about half alert right now,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.960
but we're walking outside and looking for something to eat for dinner now

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:48.740
And they just looks like a nice friendly little place, but they have no English menu so we're just ordering of the photos

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.380
that they have here and we'll see what we ordered

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.240
to start off we got a whole pile of fried chicken, I think it's a whole chicken that's chopped off into pieces

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.500
and then deep fried to golden brown, it's because it smelled so good

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.880
and she told us to eat it with two different dipping sauces, one is just salt,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.360
and then the other is like a chili looking sauce

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.080
I'm gonna try it with just a little bit of salt, so I get the full full fried chicken flavor potential

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.420
Wow!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.000
That is unbelievably juicy!

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.260
I'm just absolutely gushing with chicken juices

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.440
and then that skin on the top and that brown golden layer is so crispy,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.160
I love it with just that little bit of salt just to compliment it

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.200
It is a pretty good sized plate, and at first I thought they were noodles,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.760
but I think they were just bean sprouts, yeah they're all bean sprouts,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.460
are there any noodles down here?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.200
I don't think so, but then just a mix of seafood, there is crab in here,

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.340
there are mussels, there are octopus,there is shrimp, and lots of green onions

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.580
and I think this is just like a blend of seafood, and bean sprouts, and chili

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.860
Grab one of those shrimp

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.760
They're very crisp and have that kind of an earthy taste to them

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.020
Actually I divided it in half and we just gonna eat the whole thing

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.140
A little bit chewy

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.640
I just got a bowl of the soup version now, I think it's all the same ingredients,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.260
the bean sprouts, the shrimps, the mussels, all the same seafood,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.680
but this is a soup instead of stir fried

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:03.740
Yeah, has that exact pretty much the same taste, except one is stir fried dry where this one is the soup

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:10.640
but this one has more of a shrimpy taste to it, it tastes like dry shrimp mixed with dry chilis

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.300
Another thing that I've noticed in both of these different dishes are these little things,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.220
and I have no idea what they are, but they are very common in both of these dishes

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.700
scattered throughout both of them, I'm gonna try one

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.600
I don't even know if I know what just happened

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.280
It's really hard, I thought it was like a nut or seed, but then I bit harder,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:50.020
and it just exploded with some kind of salty juice, a little bit seafoody,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:15:02.040
and now, now it's just like a really very very rubbery texture, what is that? I think it's some kind of seafood

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.680
That was another great meal in Seoul, we're gonna walk over to the Seoul Station now,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.320
and catch the subway to Myeong-dong, which is a big shopping district and

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.600
walk around there for a little while

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.780
There are lots and lots of clothes here and both indoor shops as well as a lot of street shopping as well,

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:42.220
you'll find all sort of things especially a lot of cosmetic stores and right now,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.660
the girls went in to buy some cosmetics

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.320
I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog for today right now, it has been a great day,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.120
a really really long day that started last night coming from Bangkok

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:01.500
We arrived to Seoul, delicious food, I especially loved our first meal just walking into that random restaurant,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.620
and having that pork bone rib kimchi soup, that was incredibly good!

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.520
Thank you all very much for watching this video, please remember to give it a thumbs up,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.880
Let me try one more

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.920
It feels like a hard nut or a sea..
