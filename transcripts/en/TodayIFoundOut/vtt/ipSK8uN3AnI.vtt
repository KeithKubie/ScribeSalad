00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:35.930
As embryos, men and women start off, well,
more or less as women.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.980
The genetic template of the body follows the
path of the X chromosome for approximately

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.900
60 days of development, providing the embryonic
man with a set of nipples.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.379
More specifically, approximately 4-6 weeks
into development, embryos develop parallel

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.920
mammary ridges.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.989
These ridges, called milk lines, span between
the armpit and chest then descend down each

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.460
side to the lower abdomen and finally narrow
in towards the groin, ending high on the thigh.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.854
Ultimately these milk lines regress, except
for in the chest area (in most cases, more

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:08.189
on this later), leaving us with mammary buds
that develop into the familiar pair of cold

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.670
weather pokies, some lactating glands called
lobules, ducts, a bit of fatty tissue in between,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.670
etc.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.929
For males, the Y chromosome later sets off
a cacophony of genetic changes and hormonal

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.729
flows, especially one quite near and dear
to men aspiring to become Citius, Altius,

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.929
and Fortius.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.320
Among other things, the influx of this hormone,
testosterone, stimulates the growth of the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.590
penis and testes.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.130
However, this only answers part of the question
of “why do men have nipples”.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.789
Another facet of this is why have nipples
stuck around in men when evolutionary processes

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.380
could have weeded them out?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.849
Quite simply, it’s generally thought nipples
are still around in men because they just

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.159
don’t matter enough for evolution to rear
its head.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.969
Genetic uncoupling of male and female characteristics
occurs when said characteristics have substantial

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.969
bearing on reproductive success.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.079
Nipples, however, persist, because there’s
nothing really to select against them – they

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.079
simply don’t do much either way!

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.319
As “nippled breasts never lost a fair maiden”
and because nipples are there before testosterone

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.700
kicks in, they’re seemingly here to stay.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.190
However, it would be a technical faux pas
to lump the male nipple in with the other

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.569
vestigial structures – indeed, the male
nipple is entirely ready to perform its original

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.739
function, leading to male lactation.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.830
Yes, you heard that right- men can breastfeed
babies if they really want to and it’s not

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.900
even that hard to make it happen.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.459
So what’s going on here?

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.760
Milk is produced in small hollow cavities
in breast tissue called alveoli, where the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.860
linings contain cells that secrete milk when
properly triggered.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.849
While there are a variety of things that go
into someone lactating, including various

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.000
hormones, the main trigger for milk production
is sufficient amounts of the hormone prolactin,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.670
which is primarily produced by the pituitary
gland, though also by the prostate in men

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.799
and a layer of the uterine wall known as the
myometrium in women, among other places.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.189
Both men and women have alveoli, but typically
have markedly different levels of prolactin.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.159
In fact, a normal non-pregnant woman has around
one third to twice the hormone than the average

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.180
man at any given time.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.550
Late in a pregnancy and after giving birth,
prolactin levels can peak as high as ten times

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.150
more in these women compared to what you'll
typically find in males.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.269
So how can men lactate without the necessary
processes involved in child birth triggering

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.790
a ramp up of prolactin production?

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.909
Prolactin is ultimately metabolized by the
liver helping to regulate its concentration

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.540
in the body in conjunction with certain mechanisms
in the hypothalamus.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.209
When the liver isn't functioning properly,
abnormally high levels of certain hormones

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.549
may build up.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.099
This is what is thought to have happened to
hundreds of male POWs during WWII, who, after

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.159
suffering months of starvation, began lactating
during their recovery; experts opine that

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.340
the stress and deprivation interfered with
the liver and certain hormone producing glands'

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.739
normal activities.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.939
Once properly fed, the liver took longer to
recover than the hormone producing glands-

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.340
pertinent to the topic at hand resulting in
a build-up of concentration of prolactin in

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.560
the POWs' bodies, causing them to start lactating.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.981
More recently a report in the Canadian Medical
Association Journal documented a case of a

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.540
man who had a pituitary tumor that resulted
in, among other things, overproduction of

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.019
prolactin, causing him to lactate.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.070
In fact, there are numerous reports throughout
history of men lactating, including in The

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.650
Talmud, where a poor man whose wife died while
their baby was quite young had "a miracle

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.400
. . . his breasts opened and he nursed his
child."

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.560
In Numbers 11:12 in the Bible, (whether claiming
it was a known literal occurrence or not isn't

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220
clear) it notes, "Have I conceived all this
people?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.110
Have I begotten them, that thou shouldest
say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.580
nursing father beareth the sucking child,
unto the land which thou swarest unto their

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.580
fathers?"

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.990
In Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine (1896),
Gould &amp; Pyle report that both a male South

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.479
American native and male Brazilian missionaries
nursed children after their wives lost the

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.770
ability.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.770
And a similar much more modern and well documented
report was made in 2002 of a Sri Lankan man,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.710
Mr. B Wijeratne, who took up breastfeeding
his 18 month old daughter after his wife died

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.289
giving birth to their second child.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.750
He initially had attempted to feed the older
child formula upon her mother's death, but

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.770
this was summarily rejected by the toddler.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.720
He later stated, "unable to see her cry, I
offered my breast.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.280
That's when I discovered that I could breastfeed
her."

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.500
If you're wondering how this is possible,
it's known that expectant fathers and those

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.660
with newborns also see a spike in prolactin
compared to their normal levels.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.169
While not anywhere close to enough to cause
lactation in men normally, you may be aware

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.330
that nipple suckling can result in women who
didn't just have a baby ultimately lactating

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.330
anyway.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.289
What's less well-known is that the receptors
responsible for triggering the brain to in

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.240
turn stimulate the pituitary gland to produce
more prolactin and trigger the release of

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.070
oxytocin, which is necessary to get the milk
flowing, exist and function in both men and

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.070
women.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.810
This process can commonly be observed in cases
of women adopting babies and wanting to breastfeed

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.810
them.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.669
They are able to achieve this via regularly
having the child suckle and further using

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.690
a breast pump every few hours over the course
of several weeks.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.419
According to the Goldfarb Breastfeeding Clinic,
in a small study they conducted looking at

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.400
228 women attempting this, 31% were able to
produce enough milk to provide the full caloric

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.610
and nutritional needs of the baby.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.030
While that may seem a small percentage, it
should be noted that nearly all 228 women

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.009
were at least able to provide some milk to
their adopted babies.

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.460
This same thing can also be observed in various
animals, including sometimes used to cause

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.580
goats who have never had kids to produce milk.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.870
For men, as with women, the net result of
having a baby around and regularly using a

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.449
breast pump / letting said baby suckle results
in a prolactin spike.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.159
For some men, this may be high enough to trigger
milk production, allowing the male to breastfeed

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.159
a baby.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.210
(Whether that's what happened in the case
of the Sri Lankan man or if he had some other

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.409
condition isn't clear, with his physician,
Dr. Kamal Jayasinghe, simply noting to the

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:02.319
media, "Men with hyperactive prolactin hormone
can produce breast milk.")

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.979
There are also some drugs that occasionally
have the side effect of increased prolactin

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.129
concentration in the body sufficient to cause
male lactation, such as the antipsychotic

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:17.699
chlorpromazine (marketed under the name Thorazine
and Largactil) and the heart medication digoxin

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.750
(marketed under the name Lanoxin, among other
names).

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.530
It should also be noted here that some teenage
and adult men produce milk without babies

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.530
or drugs.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.220
Called male galactorrhea, it often develops
during the hormone surge of puberty, but can

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.620
also be caused by hypothyroidism, among other
conditions.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.790
Videos documenting such lactation, such as
Bodybuilder Chest Milk, abound on the web.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.039
In addition, approximately 5% of newborn babies
of both sexes secrete milk from their breasts.

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.760
Colloquially called Witch's milk, it is believed
to be caused by the combined effects of prolactin

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.449
and growth hormones from the mother's milk,
along with thyroid and pituitary hormones

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:55.639
from the baby.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.820
The milk produced is similar in composition
to a typical woman's milk.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.030
The condition usually subsides within a couple
of months.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.229
Finally, as I'm sure there are some men out
there interested despite the social stigma

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:10.080
(and potentially some women who'd kill for
their men to be able to help out on the breastfeeding

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.280
front), outside of the aforementioned nipple
suckling technique boosting natural prolactin

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.419
levels, a more effective solution for men
would be to simply buy some prolactin and

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:20.620
introduce it into the body directly.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.590
However, while this is sometimes done to induce
lactation in animals, and we were able to

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.310
locate some sources of human prolactin for
sale online, at least as far as we can find,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.510
it doesn't appear to be a treatment any doctor
we could find will administer and oversee

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.641
for human males wanting to breastfeed their
children, and potential side effects of sustained

00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:42.460
high levels of prolactin in males doesn't
appear to be something well studied.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.750
However, it is known that abnormally high
prolactin levels can cause a loss of libido

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:52.390
in men and women, and in men potential problems
with impotence while said levels remain high.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.850
Further, prolactin is involved in at least
300 known processes in the body, including

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.270
playing a role in one's metabolism and immune
system, and in men potentially lowering testosterone

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.270
levels.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.870
It should also be noted that the general consensus
is that, due to certain physiological processes

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.080
during puberty, even with sufficient prolactin
it is unlikely a breastfeeding father would

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.040
produce nearly as much milk as a woman with
equivalent levels.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.850
That said, while that seems to be the general
consensus of the medical community, we couldn't

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.770
find a single study looking at volume of milk
production in lactating males that have been

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.480
studied, so it’s possible this is just a
widely accepted hypothesis at this stage.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.410
And if you're wondering about the nutritional
value of human male breast milk compared to

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.900
female breast milk, in a 1981 study of a lactating
human male, it was determined that, much like

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.030
the milk found in both male and female lactating
babies, to quote the study "The concentrations

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:51.580
of lactose, proteins, and electrolytes in
the breast secretion of this man are within

00:09:51.580 --> 00:10:16.660
the range of colostrum and milk obtained from
normal lactating women."

00:10:16.660 --> 00:11:41.650
Bonus Fact:
Ever wonder how some people end up with more

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.870
than two nipples?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.920
Well, wonder no more- In short, this is just
a result of an incomplete regression of the

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.380
milk line that results in one or more extra
mammary buds developing outside of where we'd

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.530
normally expect them, but still usually along
the milk line.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.870
The end result is an extra nipple, and sometimes
associated breast tissue.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:08.921
These are surprisingly common, appearing on
as many as 1 in 20 people, though most who

00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:12.590
have them don't recognize the often tiny protuberance
as an extra nipple.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:19.620
Numbering among the supernumerary are reportedly
Mark Wahlberg, Lilly Allen, Harry Styles and

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:39.620
Tilda Swinton.
