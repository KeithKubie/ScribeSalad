00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.250
STEVE BROWN: Yeah.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.650
AUDIENCE: So how on earth
did you narrow it down?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.430
How did you pick what you
wanted to focus on?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.020
Because there's a finite amount
of space to cram an

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.720
awful lot of stuff into.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.110
STEVE BROWN: You mean the 60,000
stories of Burning Man?

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.860
And how do you find the right
stories for 90 minutes?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.870
So we were looking for, I'd say,
a story arc that was very

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.890
similar across the board.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.380
Which are people that, what they
took from Burning Man was

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.260
the catalyst or inspiration to
act on a dream, and set off on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.140
a journey to do some big,
ambitious projects that they'd

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.925
never done before.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.760
It's one of the more common
experiences of Burning Man.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.250
And it's actually one of my
experiences from Burning Man

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.840
with this film.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.360
This is the first time I've ever
produced a feature film.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.110
And it was very much that
similar kind of a journey.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.810
Burning Man is a community
that is sort of designed

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.180
intentionally to give people the
freedom and the permission

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.870
to act on their dreams.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.730
And so there are a lot of
stories like that, start at

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.540
Burning Man.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.392
So I was looking for, and our
team was looking for, stories

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:17.180
where we could follow somebody
who was acting on a dream.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.230
Somebody like Katy, who didn't
used to be an artist, but she

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.340
went to Burning Man and decided
that that was what she

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.260
was going to be.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.550
And we filmed her from
conception to realization of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.630
her first art project.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.770
Otto Von Danger, very different
side of Burning Man,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.180
and kind of unexpected for
people to think it's just a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.300
rave or it's some sort
of hippie thing.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.110
But for him, this was the
first time he did a big,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.880
meaningful project.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.990
They were just really trying to
make a statement and make a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.860
difference in the world.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.050
And what he was actually trying
to do was trying to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.100
create a statement that
was really uniting the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.920
frustrations of both the Tea
Party and the Occupy movement.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.330
And so it was a big,
ambitious project.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.420
And Jon La Grace, not only was
he kind of on the front line

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.005
of this growth of Burning Man
becoming worldly, and people

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.555
with a lot of money showing up
and kind of paying for a

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:11.250
catered experience of Burning
Man, which was very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.020
controversial.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.110
He was from one of those camps,
a producer of one of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.660
those camps.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.280
But this was the year when he
was, when the whole camp was

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.230
really trying to give back and
really was trying to do

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.300
something new, which was host
Play)A(Skool, which was the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.170
set for TEDxBlackRockCity.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.890
Which is how I got connected
to them in the first place,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.520
because I was the co-organizer
of that.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.300
So we were looking for stories
that were somebody acting on a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.830
dream, what happens next, and
kind of a cross-section of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.070
different aspects of Burning
Man-- theme camps and kind of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.650
the roughneck side of Burning
Man, and the art side of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.820
Burning Man.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
And then we got invited in to
film more and more of the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.160
founders and inside
the organization.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.120
And we realized their story
was the same thing.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.300
The had big dreams.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.880
And those dreams were also
getting very complicated as

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.250
they kind of collided with
reality in the year that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.820
Burning Man hit limits
for the first time.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.360
AUDIENCE: How did you ensure the
consent of everyone being

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.450
filmed, especially for the
rabbit popping out, where

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.260
people are riding on the ramp?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.860
STEVE BROWN: So anyone we were
interviewing, we asked for

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.960
permission.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.420
General crowd scenes in public
places, that's a little more

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.160
complicated.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.870
But a crowd scene in a public
place where lots of people are

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.680
being filmed, that's
kind of fair game.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.210
But anybody we interviewed, or
really kind of went in close

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.570
and told their story, we
asked for consent.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.370
Thanks for making the film.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.420
What didn't make it
into the film?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.170
STEVE BROWN: What is that?

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.370
AUDIENCE: What didn't make
it into the film?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.250
What scene, what aspects?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.432
STEVE BROWN: Oh, so much.

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:56.758
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:58.640
STEVE BROWN: Actually,
my background

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.970
is in tech and software.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.950
And from my standpoint, some
of the most fascinating

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.360
stories of Burning Man are the
creativity and the innovation

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.620
that happens when it's not about
pleasing your venture

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.850
capitalists, or about money, or
sort of the Silicon Valley.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.779
But it's just pure play and
innovation in this harsh

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.150
environment.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.160
And you see that in art.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.040
But you also see that
in technology.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.830
And I mean, there was a project
just this last year

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.960
where people from
Ideate were--

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.810
you take off your clothes.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.420
Go into a full-body scanner.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.930
And then they would make
a 3D model of you.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.150
And then they would attach a
little tracking device to you.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.640
And then their radio-controlled
octocopter

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.780
would come and drop your clone
off somewhere in the playa.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.170
That was sort of cool,
and fun, and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.000
interesting, and playful.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.990
But we just weren't there
filming that one.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.760
But some that we did film
were more tech stories.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.270
A couple years ago, you
go to Burning Man.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.380
And you turn on your iPhone.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.790
And you would say, gosh,
I didn't know

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.250
AT&amp;T worked out here.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.320
Well, it doesn't.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.610
It was just some guys from the
OpenBTS project who were the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.520
open source mobile phone sort
of operating system.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.830
And they had a solar-powered
antenna.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.760
And they were playing a cell
phone company out there, beta

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.500
testing really cool technology
about how do we create mobile

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.350
technology for people who
live on $1 a day.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.560
For the liberation technologies
for poor

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.270
countries, and their beta
site is Burning Man.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.100
And their next customers
are in Somalia.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.680
Or who knows where they are.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.720
So there were things like that
that were really interesting.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.740
And they were just under the
same kind of story-- people

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.820
inspired to do something
creative, and original, and

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.840
ambitious in this environment.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.890
And not doing it for money.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.120
And not doing it for status.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.330
And not doing it for fame.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.540
But purely doing it as a
creative collaboration.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.330
And there's a lot of
stuff like that.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.520
Not all of it is simple enough
and visual enough to work in a

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.605
film like this.

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:17.170
I mean, we're back to
the last question.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.180
There are 60,000 stories
out there.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.450
You need to find stories that
are fairly simple, and fairly

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.793
visual, and can line up.

00:06:24.793 --> 00:06:29.570
AUDIENCE: Obviously, you went
through and sort of talked a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.500
lot about people's stories,
the struggles that

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.420
they had to get there.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.415
I'm interested to know what
your struggle was

00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:37.620
in making the film.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.410
Like what were your kind
of highs and lows?

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.000
STEVE BROWN: So making
a film, I discovered,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.952
is a lot like a--

00:06:44.952 --> 00:06:47.310
well, it's just another
startup.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.195
Which means you need to
have some crazy idea.

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:52.420
You need to convince some really
great people to join

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.770
and collaborate with you.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.280
You need to raise the money.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.710
You need to execute
like crazy.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.410
And then at some point, you've
got to get distribution.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.700
And it was kind of
the same thing.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.540
And every one of those steps is
loaded with challenges just

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.510
like it is with a startup.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.790
I think that the biggest
challenge in making a film

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.880
like this-- which is a story of
real people and real lives,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.880
no actors, no script, but a
working hypothesis for where

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.190
the story is going and what's
going to happen next--

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.310
the biggest challenge is
actually being there when the

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.360
story is unfolding.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.420
And there were stories that we
were following that kind of

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.110
went in a different direction or
just didn't really go where

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.860
we thought it was going to go.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.040
And other ones really
kind of grew.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.650
But if you're not there with the
camera rolling, it's like

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.970
it didn't happen.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.660
So the biggest challenge is
actually being there when

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.280
things are happening.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.570
And you saw so many
things in here.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.090
You saw that we were actually
there in a lot of really

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.790
unique moments in the story,
both of those artists who were

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.160
trying to manifest their dream
and do something project, but

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.230
also of the Burning Man
organization and the founders.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.450
So all these moments when their
dreams were colliding

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.832
with reality and getting very
complicated, we were in there,

00:08:07.832 --> 00:08:08.490
in those meetings.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.910
I mean, actually, I wasn't
in those meetings.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.640
And my co-director,
Jessie Deeter,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.990
wasn't in those meetings.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.560
But our camera and sound people
were in the meetings.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.440
And they were like, you can't
come to this meeting.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.200
This is a private meeting.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.770
But we're going to let your
cameras be in here.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.250
It was a really strange thing.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.525
So we were there at these
moments when they were arguing

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:32.809
kind of fundamental questions
of their principles.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.900
They had this sort of collision
of principles

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.580
between this openness that
allowed people to truly be

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.039
free versus now, what do they do
when it's sold out and too

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.320
many people want to go.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.070
And it was really--

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.370
I mean, everybody around the
world thought, whoa.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.930
They didn't know what
was going on.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.440
But when you saw the footage
inside the board room, you see

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.540
they're having really heartfelt
debates about

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.620
principles and values.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.360
And that was a big surprise.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.020
And it was really amazing
to witness that.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.310
But that was very lucky that we
were there with the cameras

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.140
rolling when all that
was going down.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.150
AUDIENCE: What was
the funding?

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.380
How did you raise the funding?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.740
And who provided the funding?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.530
And what was the budget
for this movie?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.570
STEVE BROWN: Well,
you saw the whole

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.580
last part of the credits.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.080
And there are actually some
people from the early days of

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.330
Google on that list.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.660
I did most of the fundraising.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.570
And I asked a lot of people,
told people about the project.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.810
And I explained the vision of
what we're trying to do in the

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.990
story, and why I thought it was
a story that was much more

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.595
relevant than just a
Burning Man story.

00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:40.838
It was a very universal story.

00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:43.620
And some people backed it.

00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:49.790
For the talk, I'm not going
to put a number

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.760
on the actual budget.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.540
But if you look at--

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.180
I mean, we were 13 months in
production of filming.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.260
And all those shoots had a
director of photography and a

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.690
sound engineer.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.230
Had a producer, associate
producer there helping

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.350
organize it all.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.780
And you have hundreds of hours
of footage and then 100 more

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.760
hours of archival footage
from the old days.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.510
And then there was a lot of time
spent with our amazing

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.350
editor, Andy Gersh, editing that
down to the 90 minutes

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.630
that you saw.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.800
And then there's an amazing
soundtrack for the movie.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.730
And even though most of the
artists on the soundtrack have

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.760
been inspired by Burning Man,
or have some connection to

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.990
Burning Man, and did some
amazing original music for the

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.730
film, they also have labels,
and managers, and agents.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:38.960
So all that costs
a lot of money.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.910
So it was a pretty big,
ambitious project for a

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.160
documentary.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.550
AUDIENCE: What were you doing
just before you started this?

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.060
And how did you decide
to actually get

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.150
started on this project?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.400
It was so big.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.840
STEVE BROWN: So I've been
involved in a number of

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.860
startups, usually software.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.230
And kind of every time, it's
been kind of this similar

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.460
drill of you have a vision which
is to solve some problem

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.890
that's going to change
the world.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.000
And you raise money.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.120
And you start to execute
on that vision.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.210
And you get more, and more,
and more focused on a very

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.420
specific thing to
make that work.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.950
And I found it kind of
starting to be more

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.540
constraining.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.200
And I was looking for
a creative canvas

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.080
that was more open.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.650
And film is a very wide
open and very

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.450
human creative canvas.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.690
So I was really interested in
getting involved with that.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.400
And so when we sort of stumbled
across a story that

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.200
looked really relevant
and interesting,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.510
things kind of unfolded.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.380
You go to Burning Man.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.760
And you say, gosh, I've always
wanted to make a film.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.830
And all of a sudden, you're
surrounded by people that say,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.230
how can I help?

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.020
And so that stuff starts
to become real.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.550
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:08.170
How did you recruit people to be
the subjects of your film?

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.270
STEVE BROWN: So you sort of
start with what you know.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:20.290
But we were also seeking out
a kind of a story which

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.370
resembled really kind of our own
story with the project--

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.560
people that were acting
on a dream, setting

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.600
off on some big project.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.790
And we also had to go with where
people were accessible.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.750
There were probably some amazing
projects where people

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.840
in Europe were building
something to

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.610
bring to Burning Man.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.800
And it was the same story.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.860
But we weren't over there.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.420
We were here.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.550
So our subjects were a little
closer to home--

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.790
the ones that we were able to
film all the way through were

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.880
a little closer to home.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.390
But we discovered Katy.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.980
We were filming a number
of people.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.310
And actually, I remember I
showed some of our footage,

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.150
some selects of some of the
people we were starting to

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.260
develop character sketches of.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.870
I showed it to my daughter.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.170
And she said, Dad, this is a
very important story about

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:14.610
creativity, and being free, and
being able to be creative,

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.460
and following your passion.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.130
That's a very important story
for young people, too.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.080
So it shouldn't just be a bunch
of old people having a

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.130
midlife crisis.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:23.740
STEVE BROWN: And then
I went back.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.110
And I looked at the people.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.270
And I realized, you know what?

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.710
We need to keep looking.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.355
And so we were looking.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:37.430
And then we went to film Marco
Cochrane, who is an artist,

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.460
amazing artist, who does these
huge sculptures of Burning

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.650
Man-- "Bliss Dance" and "Truth
is Beauty." And he's been out

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.390
doing that for 20 years.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.770
And so that's really
interesting.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.130
But there wasn't a
story unfolding.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.930
Because it was just similar
to what he's been

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.250
doing for a long time.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.160
But right behind him, working,
welding on one of the

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.860
sculptures, was Katy.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.250
And so we went there
interviewing

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.040
Marco, to talk to Marco.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.770
And then we said, well,
who's that?

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.600
Who's that on your team?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.680
And it turned out she
was right at the

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.210
beginning of that story.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.840
So we were looking for
that kind of story.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.950
And we wanted to find a story
where it was connected to the

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.615
great art of Burning Man.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:19.670
And she was there.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:25.440
Well, Otto Von Danger, this
one's my son's fault.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.740
So he said, Dad, this is not
going to be a good movie

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.770
unless there's somebody that's
a little bit crazy.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.160
STEVE BROWN: Anyway, so we
actually went up to the playa

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.150
on July 4, 2012.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.920
And we actually thought
we might be shooting

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.860
the end of the movie.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.430
Because we thought Burning
Man might not happen.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.660
Or it might never be the same.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.310
It might not come
back together.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.460
Because a lot of the big
projects were not able to--

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.655
their crew couldn't
get tickets.

00:14:54.655 --> 00:14:56.150
And everyone was mad
at Burning Man.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.160
And so no one could
raise money.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.510
And so everything sort of felt
like it was falling apart.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.420
So we went up there
for July 4.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.030
Where it's kind of like the old
days-- no organization, no

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.420
fence, no tickets.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.800
And that's where I met
Otto Von Danger.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.970
And he had some crazy project
he was doing out there where

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.010
they were exploding things,
and blowing things up, and

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.970
shooting lots of guns.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.010
And I asked my son.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.543
He was with me.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:19.780
And he says, well,
how about Otto?

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.190
And he said, I think he'll do.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.180
And he was a wonderful story.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.710
He was a wonderful character.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.790
And he really embodied a number
of things, but just

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:37.220
this passion and commitment in
this campus of Burning Man

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.370
that allows people to do huge,
ambitious things that you

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.830
wouldn't expect them
to be able to do.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.350
Otto Von Danger is living
on disability.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.760
He's an injured Marine.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.300
And he's having a hard
time getting by.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.720
And then at Burning Man, he's
working on a massive,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.520
super-challenging, super
roller coaster,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.800
big, ambitious project.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.980
And to me, that kind
of story where--

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.150
I mean, Katy was a nanny, and
Otto is a disabled veteran,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:14.000
and Jon La Grace, somebody who
lost everything, they're not

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.340
like the Google founders.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.160
They're not like the famous
people who are

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.860
out at Burning Man.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.530
They're very ordinary people
with actually a lot stacked

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.530
against them.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.090
But you kind of flip
the values.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.200
And in this environment,
they shine.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.970
And they rise.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.120
And they're the heroes.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.760
And I thought those were the
kind of people that, one, we

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.030
were looking for.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.360
But two, they were also
more accessible.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.200
They were open to us following
them around for a year.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.860
I was sort of struck by the
fact that everybody went

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.110
through this intense process
of very systematically

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.250
building and working in
sort of structured--

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.600
even though it was
a little crazy--

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.560
process.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.850
And then they got to have their
moment of release at

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.980
Burning Man where their project
all came to an end,

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.550
and they saw the results.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.089
You were still in the middle of
your process at that point.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.010
Can you talk about that a
little bit and how your

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.566
experience was?

00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:09.980
STEVE BROWN: Yeah.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.810
We're still in the middle
the process.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.790
Because we're just now launching
the film in theaters

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.010
and on demand just
this weekend.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:22.520
So, yeah, but kind of like the
people in the film, it is sort

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.560
of a never-ending process.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.650
The interesting thing--

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.410
so two kinds of projects
were in the film.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.700
There were the ones
that burned down.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.820
And that creates a space to
do something totally new.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.760
And then there are other ones
where, like Katy, is heart.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.905
She didn't burn that down.

00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:42.250
It comes back down the hill.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:42.970
It's in a warehouse.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.740
She's trying to figure out
what to do with it.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.110
Should I do another Kickstarter
to add some more

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.160
bells and whistles to it and
bring it back to Burning Man?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.240
Or what should I do
with this thing?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.740
And I think that one of things
that is unique about Burning

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.410
Man as an entire city but also
a lot of the art projects is

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.400
that kind of creative
destruction.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.760
It goes back to the dust so
people can start over.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.000
And this film is almost
to the point where

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.420
it really is launched.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.530
And then it's wide open space.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.300
And then I--

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.540
everybody in film
is like this.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.170
Then you can kind of take a
breath and say, what's next?

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.150
It's what's unique about film is
that you have this intense

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.170
effort on a project.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.220
And it has an end.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.080
A company goes on.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.360
Well, maybe it has an end
when Google buys it.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.340
But maybe it goes
on indefinitely.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.480
But films, like a lot of
these art projects,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.190
they have an end.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.730
And then that creates a space
for something new.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.420
That's what I like about film.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.990
AUDIENCE: I thought there was
an interesting kind of a

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.430
conflict of ideas between Larry
Harvey and John Law.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.380
And the presentation of Law
towards the end of the

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.180
movie, where he--

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.380
you're showing his image and
talking about the org of

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.430
turning into a nonprofit.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.260
And I kind of wonder if he gave
you any kind of a take on

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.360
what he thinks about that
or how that affects him.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.380
STEVE BROWN: I did sit
with John Law.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.500
Sat next to John Law and watched
the film with him when

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.520
we played in Sacramento.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.690
And I said, John, I'm going to
sit next to you in case you

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.540
need to kick me.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.460
Because I didn't know before
he saw the film what he'd

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.340
think of it.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.770
But I mean, he was a really
interesting, important

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.750
character in the film.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.880
Because there you saw this
original rift, this original

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.740
collision of values.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.180
I mean, the original dream
was one about this

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.360
sort of pure freedom.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.180
And then at some point,
it got out of control.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.630
People actually got killed
up there in 1996.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.660
And it really was
out of control.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.170
So they had to decide.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.060
This sort of, almost this
Utopian anarchist ideal of

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.870
freedom wasn't going
to work anymore.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.950
So what are they going to do?

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.050
Is it going to just go away?

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.595
Or are they going
to reinvent it?

00:20:01.595 --> 00:20:03.730
And John Law didn't want
the reinvention.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.450
It was form an LLC.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.600
Form a company.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.460
Sell tickets.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.310
Put up a fence.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.750
Create a container for it.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.900
Buy insurance.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.860
He didn't want to
be part of that.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.140
He wanted to stick to the
original dream and the

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.830
original value.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.480
So there was a big
parting of ways.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.250
And then when we were filming
this in 2011, 2012, we were

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.370
sort of hitting the next big
inflection point where again,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.690
it was a collision of values.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.490
I mean, that was the core
of what was happening.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.430
They have values that were
really interesting.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.120
And that they'd sort of gone
from pure self-expression and

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.490
freedom to a combination of
values of self-expression and

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.590
values of community.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.880
And can we create a community
that allows people to truly be

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.700
themselves?

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.020
And that idea was working,
amazingly, for many, many

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.070
years until they hit limits,
until there wasn't

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.440
enough to go around.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.940
And then the question is who
gets to decide who gets to be

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.010
part of this.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.610
If somebody stands there as
the judge, decides who's

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.580
worthy of being part of it, then
the whole idea that you

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.290
truly have that freedom
kind of gets eroded.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.760
Because now, I'm trying
to prove myself.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.940
I'm trying to prove
I'm good enough.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.170
Or at least I have
that feeling.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.810
Or there's even a hint
of that feeling.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.340
And so that's why they
did the lottery.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.190
Because they didn't want
to be the judge.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.200
And then that was a catastrophe
because it

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.250
destroyed community.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.210
So all along it had
been this really

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.370
interesting debate of values.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.730
Sort of like the Western
culture requirement in

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.850
freshman year at Stanford where
philosophers from kind

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.560
of thousands of years ago all
the way through the present

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.910
are sort of having these
fundamental arguments about

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.130
freedom versus order.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.530
And how do we create a society
that allows people to be free.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.840
But you need some structure.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.860
You need some governance.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.350
Otherwise, freedom goes away.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.110
These kind of debates were all
playing out real time.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.840
So the John Law rift was a very
early one about order

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.560
versus freedom.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.960
And then they reinvented
themselves.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.490
And then they had this
new collision.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.840
But the resolution of the new
collision of values seemed to

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.090
be, when we were filming it,
that may be there would be a

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.330
new transformation.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.090
And what really ticked off
John Law was sort of the

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.650
becoming this company.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.450
Maybe that was going
to go away.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.590
Maybe there was going
to be some new form.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.440
And maybe that rift would
possibly even heal.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.505
There was sort of hope.

00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:27.840
I heard that a number of times
in people we talked to.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.580
There was a hope that that rift
might somehow heal in

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.960
whatever came next.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.920
And we don't know whether or not
that's going to happen or

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.420
where that's going to end.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.530
But we have seen that this idea
of a community of people

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.080
that really allow each other
to be themselves in the

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.570
context of collaborating on art,
that that's happening a

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.170
lot of places, not just
at Burning Man.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.270
We showed this in
Washington, DC.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.130
And I had people in the audience
say, I've been to

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.750
three burns, but I've never
been to the playa.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.120
So I mean, it's sort of
happening on the east coast.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.470
Who would have thought that
that would be happening in

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.530
Washington, DC?

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.850
And then you saw at
the end where it's

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.980
happening around the world.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:14.040
So there's an idea that maybe
some of those original values

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.300
that John Law was involved with,
maybe those are coming

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.580
back in sort of the new form of
Burning Man, which is not

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.980
sort of contained
to the playa.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.620
So at the end, we were kind
of raising that question.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.280
But the verdict is not in yet.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.390
That story is just beginning.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.310
This was excellent.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.790
Thank you.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:43.243
[APPLAUSE]
