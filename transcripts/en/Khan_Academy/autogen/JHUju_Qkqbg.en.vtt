what I want to do in this video is to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
what I want to do in this video is to
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.590
what I want to do in this video is to
actually use a graphing calculator to

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600
actually use a graphing calculator to
 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.269
actually use a graphing calculator to
get some experience on the calculator

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
get some experience on the calculator
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.340
get some experience on the calculator
itself for graphing some of these

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
itself for graphing some of these
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.080
itself for graphing some of these
quadratics and actually figuring out the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090
quadratics and actually figuring out the
 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180
quadratics and actually figuring out the
roots visually by looking at those

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
roots visually by looking at those
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.180
roots visually by looking at those
graphs so the first equation i want to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
graphs so the first equation i want to
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.200
graphs so the first equation i want to
find the x-intercept for is y is equal

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
find the x-intercept for is y is equal
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.220
find the x-intercept for is y is equal
to negative 3x squared plus 4x minus 1

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
to negative 3x squared plus 4x minus 1
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740
to negative 3x squared plus 4x minus 1
so we're just gonna go straight to the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
so we're just gonna go straight to the
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.189
so we're just gonna go straight to the
calculator I get our ti-85 out of out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
calculator I get our ti-85 out of out
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.440
calculator I get our ti-85 out of out
here and there are obviously better

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
here and there are obviously better
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510
here and there are obviously better
things you can use especially on your

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
things you can use especially on your
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160
things you can use especially on your
computer that are going to be much more

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
computer that are going to be much more
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.410
computer that are going to be much more
visually interesting and in color and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
visually interesting and in color and
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.470
visually interesting and in color and
even faster but many of us have a ti-85

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
even faster but many of us have a ti-85
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660
even faster but many of us have a ti-85
at our disposal and the ti-85 hasn't

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
at our disposal and the ti-85 hasn't
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069
at our disposal and the ti-85 hasn't
changed much actually since I was in

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
changed much actually since I was in
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260
changed much actually since I was in
high school or ti-83 or whatever else

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
high school or ti-83 or whatever else
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940
high school or ti-83 or whatever else
there is out there TI 92 and this at

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
there is out there TI 92 and this at
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770
there is out there TI 92 and this at
least give you a sense of how to use it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
least give you a sense of how to use it
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869
least give you a sense of how to use it
because this is what you have and how to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
because this is what you have and how to
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.939
because this is what you have and how to
analyze the graph once you are able to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
analyze the graph once you are able to
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920
analyze the graph once you are able to
graph it so let's I already turned it on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
graph it so let's I already turned it on
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.310
graph it so let's I already turned it on
so let's input this graph right here so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
so let's input this graph right here so
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.880
so let's input this graph right here so
we click on graph and then we'll click

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
we click on graph and then we'll click
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.910
we click on graph and then we'll click
on this f1 tells us to pick this option

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
on this f1 tells us to pick this option
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310
on this f1 tells us to pick this option
right here this Y of X right so they're

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
right here this Y of X right so they're
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500
right here this Y of X right so they're
saying Y is a function of X Y is indeed

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
saying Y is a function of X Y is indeed
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230
saying Y is a function of X Y is indeed
a function of X so let's click there and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
a function of X so let's click there and
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.510
a function of X so let's click there and
then we're that's going to be negative a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
then we're that's going to be negative a
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.859
then we're that's going to be negative a
negative 3x let's see where is the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
negative 3x let's see where is the
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.280
negative 3x let's see where is the
variable there's the X variable x

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290
variable there's the X variable x
 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.240
variable there's the X variable x
squared plus 4x minus 1 there is our

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
squared plus 4x minus 1 there is our
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160
squared plus 4x minus 1 there is our
function now let's graph it so we want

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
function now let's graph it so we want
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.890
function now let's graph it so we want
to pick this choice up here so to pick

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
to pick this choice up here so to pick
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600
to pick this choice up here so to pick
the second choice and notice if you want

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
the second choice and notice if you want
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490
the second choice and notice if you want
to pick any of these choices on the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
to pick any of these choices on the
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889
to pick any of these choices on the
bottom row you can just punch in these

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
bottom row you can just punch in these
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.510
bottom row you can just punch in these
numbers but if you want to pick the the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
numbers but if you want to pick the the
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.910
numbers but if you want to pick the the
choice that's above you could press 2nd

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
choice that's above you could press 2nd
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950
choice that's above you could press 2nd
and then press that and the second tells

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
and then press that and the second tells
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840
and then press that and the second tells
you to pick the thing that's right above

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
you to pick the thing that's right above
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850
you to pick the thing that's right above
that so I'll pick the thing in the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
that so I'll pick the thing in the
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.999
that so I'll pick the thing in the
yellow essentially so I'll do second and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
yellow essentially so I'll do second and
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.560
yellow essentially so I'll do second and
I'm selecting the graph option the graph

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
I'm selecting the graph option the graph
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.179
I'm selecting the graph option the graph
option when I was in high school this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
option when I was in high school this
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770
option when I was in high school this
was all very fancy stuff but now

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
was all very fancy stuff but now
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719
was all very fancy stuff but now
compared to pretty much most cell phones

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
compared to pretty much most cell phones
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969
compared to pretty much most cell phones
this is pretty archaic but it gets the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
this is pretty archaic but it gets the
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.119
this is pretty archaic but it gets the
job done now let's zoom in because I

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
job done now let's zoom in because I
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.760
job done now let's zoom in because I
really can't see the zero

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
really can't see the zero
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.990
really can't see the zero
that well so let me zoom here let me and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
that well so let me zoom here let me and
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.810
that well so let me zoom here let me and
I like to use the box it just creates a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
I like to use the box it just creates a
 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.850
I like to use the box it just creates a
we zoom in on a certain area that I can

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860
we zoom in on a certain area that I can
 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.580
we zoom in on a certain area that I can
define so I'll select the box and then I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590
define so I'll select the box and then I
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.410
define so I'll select the box and then I
select where I want to start the box for

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
select where I want to start the box for
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.130
select where I want to start the box for
using the arrow keys press Enter that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
using the arrow keys press Enter that
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.070
using the arrow keys press Enter that
tells it to start the box and then I can

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
tells it to start the box and then I can
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.700
tells it to start the box and then I can
zoom in using the box I define the box

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
zoom in using the box I define the box
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.400
zoom in using the box I define the box
and when I have a box I like I press

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
and when I have a box I like I press
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.250
and when I have a box I like I press
enter and it'll redefine it will

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260
enter and it'll redefine it will
 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.310
enter and it'll redefine it will
redefine the range of x and y values

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320
redefine the range of x and y values
 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.050
redefine the range of x and y values
that it calculates the graphing function

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
that it calculates the graphing function
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.510
that it calculates the graphing function
now I want to figure out what these

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520
now I want to figure out what these
 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.000
now I want to figure out what these
x-intercepts are so I'm going to use a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
x-intercepts are so I'm going to use a
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.280
x-intercepts are so I'm going to use a
trace function and the trace folks she's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290
trace function and the trace folks she's
 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.500
trace function and the trace folks she's
just going to walk along this graph so

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
just going to walk along this graph so
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.080
just going to walk along this graph so
let me hit second trace and now I'm

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
let me hit second trace and now I'm
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.000
let me hit second trace and now I'm
walking along this graph as I go to the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
walking along this graph as I go to the
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.400
walking along this graph as I go to the
right it just increments the x-value

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410
right it just increments the x-value
 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.710
right it just increments the x-value
we're getting closer and closer to Y is

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
we're getting closer and closer to Y is
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.160
we're getting closer and closer to Y is
equal to zero and it looks like it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
equal to zero and it looks like it
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.260
equal to zero and it looks like it
happens right at about one right as I

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270
happens right at about one right as I
 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.740
happens right at about one right as I
cross one I'm crossing Y is equal to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750
cross one I'm crossing Y is equal to
 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.510
cross one I'm crossing Y is equal to
zero right Y is a very small positive

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520
zero right Y is a very small positive
 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.699
zero right Y is a very small positive
number here and then it goes to becoming

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
number here and then it goes to becoming
 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.920
number here and then it goes to becoming
a very or less small but still a small

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930
a very or less small but still a small
 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.560
a very or less small but still a small
negative number right as we cross one

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570
negative number right as we cross one
 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.560
negative number right as we cross one
and evaluate it directly at X is equal

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570
and evaluate it directly at X is equal
 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.330
and evaluate it directly at X is equal
to one but let's I think that's a pretty

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
to one but let's I think that's a pretty
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.010
to one but let's I think that's a pretty
good approximation we can even try it

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020
good approximation we can even try it
 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.490
good approximation we can even try it
out in our equation let's try it out if

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500
out in our equation let's try it out if
 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.830
out in our equation let's try it out if
if X is equal to one

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840
if X is equal to one
 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.310
if X is equal to one
let me write it this way Y of one if we

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
let me write it this way Y of one if we
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.770
let me write it this way Y of one if we
write Y is a function of one this is

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780
write Y is a function of one this is
 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.110
write Y is a function of one this is
going to be equal to negative 3 times 1

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120
going to be equal to negative 3 times 1
 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.310
going to be equal to negative 3 times 1
squared plus 4 times 1 minus 1 so this

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320
squared plus 4 times 1 minus 1 so this
 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.960
squared plus 4 times 1 minus 1 so this
is equal to negative 3 plus 4 minus 1

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970
is equal to negative 3 plus 4 minus 1
 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.060
is equal to negative 3 plus 4 minus 1
which is indeed 0 so the point the point

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070
which is indeed 0 so the point the point
 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.240
which is indeed 0 so the point the point
X is equal to 1 Y is equal to 0 is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250
X is equal to 1 Y is equal to 0 is
 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.070
X is equal to 1 Y is equal to 0 is
definitely on the graph and this is one

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080
definitely on the graph and this is one
 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.930
definitely on the graph and this is one
of our x-intercept so let's see if we

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940
of our x-intercept so let's see if we
 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.240
of our x-intercept so let's see if we
can figure out the other one using our

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250
can figure out the other one using our
 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.940
can figure out the other one using our
calculator so let's see we need to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950
calculator so let's see we need to
 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.680
calculator so let's see we need to
figure out this other point right here

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690
figure out this other point right here
 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.960
figure out this other point right here
let's get the zoom box going actually

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970
let's get the zoom box going actually
 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.219
let's get the zoom box going actually
let's try just to trace there scrolling

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229
let's try just to trace there scrolling
 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.920
let's try just to trace there scrolling
all the way it looks like it's around

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930
all the way it looks like it's around
 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.320
all the way it looks like it's around
point three three

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
point three three
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.809
point three three
looks like it's around point three three

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819
looks like it's around point three three
 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.850
looks like it's around point three three
I suspect it's close to one-third let me

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860
I suspect it's close to one-third let me
 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.740
I suspect it's close to one-third let me
zoom in a little bit better so let me

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750
zoom in a little bit better so let me
 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.800
zoom in a little bit better so let me
click graph again click on Zoom I'm

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810
click graph again click on Zoom I'm
 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.939
click graph again click on Zoom I'm
going to use the box again and then let

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949
going to use the box again and then let
 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.619
going to use the box again and then let
me do the top left corner of the bottom

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629
me do the top left corner of the bottom
 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.110
me do the top left corner of the bottom
of the zoomin really narrowly on that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120
of the zoomin really narrowly on that
 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.760
of the zoomin really narrowly on that
point right there really really zoom in

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770
point right there really really zoom in
 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.219
point right there really really zoom in
so it's around point three three that I

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229
so it's around point three three that I
 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.210
so it's around point three three that I
want to zoom in so that's going to be

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220
want to zoom in so that's going to be
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.300
want to zoom in so that's going to be
the beginning of my box then we go right

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310
the beginning of my box then we go right
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.469
the beginning of my box then we go right
below the y-axis and then go right above

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479
below the y-axis and then go right above
 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.580
below the y-axis and then go right above
point three three so it's really zoomed

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590
point three three so it's really zoomed
 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.189
point three three so it's really zoomed
in on that on that y-intercept right

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199
in on that on that y-intercept right
 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.050
in on that on that y-intercept right
there so now if i trace it i really

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060
there so now if i trace it i really
 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.129
there so now if i trace it i really
should be able to figure out what that

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139
should be able to figure out what that
 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.649
should be able to figure out what that
value is so let me use second and trace

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659
value is so let me use second and trace
 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.790
value is so let me use second and trace
and keep scrolling so it's a little bit

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800
and keep scrolling so it's a little bit
 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.899
and keep scrolling so it's a little bit
more than 0.33 it looks like it's really

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909
more than 0.33 it looks like it's really
 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.070
more than 0.33 it looks like it's really
approaching point three three three

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080
approaching point three three three
 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.959
approaching point three three three
three three two three which is one third

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969
three three two three which is one third
 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.689
three three two three which is one third
looks like it's point three repeating

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699
looks like it's point three repeating
 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.279
looks like it's point three repeating
then we're getting very very small Y

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289
then we're getting very very small Y
 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.040
then we're getting very very small Y
value so it looks like one third so

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050
value so it looks like one third so
 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.990
value so it looks like one third so
let's try out one third and see if we

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000
let's try out one third and see if we
 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.850
let's try out one third and see if we
got the right answer so if we have so if

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860
got the right answer so if we have so if
 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.420
got the right answer so if we have so if
we have Y of one third is equal to

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430
we have Y of one third is equal to
 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.309
we have Y of one third is equal to
negative 3 times 1/3 squared plus four

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319
negative 3 times 1/3 squared plus four
 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.649
negative 3 times 1/3 squared plus four
times one third minus 1 this is equal to

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659
times one third minus 1 this is equal to
 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.339
times one third minus 1 this is equal to
negative three times 1/9 is negative 1/3

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349
negative three times 1/9 is negative 1/3
 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.990
negative three times 1/9 is negative 1/3
this is plus 4/3 and then minus one or

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000
this is plus 4/3 and then minus one or
 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.309
this is plus 4/3 and then minus one or
negative one how you depending on to

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319
negative one how you depending on to
 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.800
negative one how you depending on to
view it is the same thing as minus three

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810
view it is the same thing as minus three
 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.309
view it is the same thing as minus three
over three so this is going to be

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319
over three so this is going to be
 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.200
over three so this is going to be
negative one plus four minus 3 all of

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210
negative one plus four minus 3 all of
 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.769
negative one plus four minus 3 all of
that over 3 which is indeed zero so we

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:11.779
that over 3 which is indeed zero so we
 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.469
that over 3 which is indeed zero so we
also have the x intercept X is equal to

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479
also have the x intercept X is equal to
 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.600
also have the x intercept X is equal to
one third Y is equal to zero let's do

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610
one third Y is equal to zero let's do
 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.680
one third Y is equal to zero let's do
another one let's say we have let's say

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690
another one let's say we have let's say
 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.180
another one let's say we have let's say
we have one half see let's say we have Y

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190
we have one half see let's say we have Y
 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.430
we have one half see let's say we have Y
is equal to one half x squared minus 2x

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440
is equal to one half x squared minus 2x
 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.830
is equal to one half x squared minus 2x
plus 3 let's see if we can get its

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840
plus 3 let's see if we can get its
 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.960
plus 3 let's see if we can get its
roots or the zeros of this equation

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970
roots or the zeros of this equation
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.420
roots or the zeros of this equation
where it intersects the x-axis so let's

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430
where it intersects the x-axis so let's
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.650
where it intersects the x-axis so let's
get our calculator back and we're gonna

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660
get our calculator back and we're gonna
 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.110
get our calculator back and we're gonna
have to zoom out of this thing so let me

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120
have to zoom out of this thing so let me
 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.200
have to zoom out of this thing so let me
just zoom see I know I think I do the

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210
just zoom see I know I think I do the
 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.990
just zoom see I know I think I do the
previous zoom well the previous zoom is

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000
previous zoom well the previous zoom is
 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
previous zoom well the previous zoom is
still a little bit not too zoomed in let

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010
still a little bit not too zoomed in let
 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.129
still a little bit not too zoomed in let
me do the previous zoom before that I

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139
me do the previous zoom before that I
 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:04.990
me do the previous zoom before that I
guess it it keeps zoom previous and then

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000
guess it it keeps zoom previous and then
 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.420
guess it it keeps zoom previous and then
I do another zoo oh it just keeps

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430
I do another zoo oh it just keeps
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.790
I do another zoo oh it just keeps
alternating between the zooms so maybe I

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800
alternating between the zooms so maybe I
 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.750
alternating between the zooms so maybe I
have to go maybe we have to clear out I

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760
have to go maybe we have to clear out I
 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.659
have to go maybe we have to clear out I
am NOT an expert at this all right so

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669
am NOT an expert at this all right so
 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.879
am NOT an expert at this all right so
let me just input my new graph so it's

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889
let me just input my new graph so it's
 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:21.390
let me just input my new graph so it's
1/2 x squared I could write that as 0.5

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400
1/2 x squared I could write that as 0.5
 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:29.770
1/2 x squared I could write that as 0.5
x squared minus 2x plus 3 and then I

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780
x squared minus 2x plus 3 and then I
 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.370
x squared minus 2x plus 3 and then I
want to graph this so let me second and

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380
want to graph this so let me second and
 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.580
want to graph this so let me second and
graph it oh it's on that super zoomed in

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590
graph it oh it's on that super zoomed in
 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.330
graph it oh it's on that super zoomed in
version so let me zoom out the zoom what

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340
version so let me zoom out the zoom what
 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.310
version so let me zoom out the zoom what
zoom maybe oh there you go to zoom

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320
zoom maybe oh there you go to zoom
 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.930
zoom maybe oh there you go to zoom
standard that resets it there you go

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940
standard that resets it there you go
 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.219
standard that resets it there you go
that's all I have to do the standard

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:45.229
that's all I have to do the standard
 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.129
that's all I have to do the standard
zoom so you see let's see where does it

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:48.139
zoom so you see let's see where does it
 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.230
zoom so you see let's see where does it
intersect the x-axis well it doesn't

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240
intersect the x-axis well it doesn't
 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.300
intersect the x-axis well it doesn't
intersect the x-axis it just goes down

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.310
intersect the x-axis it just goes down
 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.730
intersect the x-axis it just goes down
here and then keeps going up so this

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:54.740
here and then keeps going up so this
 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.480
here and then keeps going up so this
this quadratic function right here will

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.490
this quadratic function right here will
 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.060
this quadratic function right here will
have no x-intercepts and you can see it

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.070
have no x-intercepts and you can see it
 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.219
have no x-intercepts and you can see it
graphically here it does not intersect

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:03.229
graphically here it does not intersect
 

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:06.760
graphically here it does not intersect
the x-axis so if you are trying to solve

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:06.770
the x-axis so if you are trying to solve
 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.700
the x-axis so if you are trying to solve
the equation if you are trying to solve

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:09.710
the equation if you are trying to solve
 

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.589
the equation if you are trying to solve
the equation 1/2 if you're trying to

have x squared plus 6x plus 9 is equal
 

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:10.269
have x squared plus 6x plus 9 is equal
to zero and we should actually be able

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279
to zero and we should actually be able
 

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.970

and when you multiply them and get 9 it

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279
and when you multiply them and get 9 it
 

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.249

probably jumps out at your head it's 3 &amp;

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:18.259
probably jumps out at your head it's 3 &amp;
 

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:23.110

3 so this is X plus 3 times X plus 3 is

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120
3 so this is X plus 3 times X plus 3 is
 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.410
3 so this is X plus 3 times X plus 3 is
equal to 0 or and we just have to use

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420
equal to 0 or and we just have to use
 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.759
equal to 0 or and we just have to use
one of these X plus 3 is equal to 0

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:29.769
one of these X plus 3 is equal to 0
 

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:33.009
one of these X plus 3 is equal to 0
subtract 3 from both sides X is equal to

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:33.019
subtract 3 from both sides X is equal to
 

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:36.790
subtract 3 from both sides X is equal to
negative 3 so this has 1 0 so how do you

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800
negative 3 so this has 1 0 so how do you
 

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.860
negative 3 so this has 1 0 so how do you
think this is going to look if it only

point well the best guess is is that

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:44.630
point well the best guess is is that
 

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.540
point well the best guess is is that
that one point is going to be the vertex

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:46.550
that one point is going to be the vertex
 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.110
that one point is going to be the vertex
so let's graph it just to verify for
