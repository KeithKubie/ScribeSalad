00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.600
Latin sentences and sayings seem to be designed to be carved out of stone.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.200
This is a matter of their concision and weightiness.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:20.340
Because of its highly inflected grammatical structure, Latin uses far fewer words to express something that a non-inflected language such as English.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.400
Here are some of our favourite Latin sayings.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.100
"Veni, Vidi, Vici"

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.760
Julius Caesar's most famous remark, apparently made in Roman Senate in 47 BC

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.360
and referring to his victory over King Pharnaces II of Pontus at the battle of Zela is an example of Latin at its most concise.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.960
English takes twice as many words to convey the same meaning.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.480
The English translation doesn't come close to matching the patent terseness,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.160
those alliterative V's, those final long I's of the original.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.220
"Requiescat In Pace"

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.560
One of the most familiar of all Latin sayings is unusual in not being notably more terse than the English equivalent

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880
but, here the weightiness and the solemnity of Latin come to the fore.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.840
The big words have a sort of baroque splendour

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.120
and strictly speaking, this is more succinct or conveys more meaning in the same number of words

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.600
than the English equivalent

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.280
because the Latin word, "Requiescat" is a subjunctive and represent a pious wish;

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.140
"May he or she rest" - not a simple command.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.480
"Carpe Diem."

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.580
The famous saying from the eleventh

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
poem of Horace's first book of Odes

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580
is possible the best known Latin tag of all.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.580
It's certainly the one which has

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.580
inspired the naming of more restaurants and wine

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580
bars than any other.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.580
Why is it so memorable, and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.580
why does it work so well in Latin?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580
For a start, it has the classical Latin

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580
succinctness which is two

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.580
balanced syllables to convey a whole

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.580
world of meaning, even an entire philosophy -

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.780
in this case, the philosophy of epicureanism.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.500
There is also the weightiness, especially in the second word.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.880
A Latin 'dies' is more significant than a mere English 'day'.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.840
And finally, this poet saying has a marvelous poetic ambiguity and richness

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.240
as the word 'Carpe'

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.700
can mean so many different things from

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
seize to pluck.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.440
"Homo Sum: Humani Nil Ame Alienum Puto."

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340
This saying from the early Roman comedian,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.220
Terence, is genius for plain eloquence.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.400
The English version is 50% longer in terms of words

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
and nothing like as memorable,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400
especially when it comes to word order.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
The ability to manipulate word order

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
is a great advantage that Latin gains

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
from its grammatical inflections.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.660
The way nouns and adjectives incorporate their own

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.940
cases and verbs include person,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.440
mood and tense within a single word,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.420
Here, being able to hold back the verb to the end

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420
of the sentence enables Terence

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
to juxtapose the 'Homo Sum'

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420
with the 'Humani Nil'.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.660
'Parturient Montes, Nascetur Ridiculus Mus.'

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180
Here, from Horace's 'Ars Poetica',

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.980
his hugely influential treatise on how to write,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.500
is a lovely example of Latin being playful,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.560
as it were, using its own weightiness against itself.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320
Latin is able to enact the process by

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.780
huge effort, the mountains going into labour,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.780
produces a laughably puny result

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.860
- the birth of a miniscule, unimpressive rodent.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.840
'Capax Imperii, Nisi Imperasset.'

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.820
The master of the witheringly terse, put down in Latin

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.820
or maybe in all languages,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820
is the Roman historian, Tacitus.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.200
This marvellous foreworder refers to the emperor Galba

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.660
but could be seen as an equally fitting epitaph on at least one recent British prime minister.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.920
Here, both succintness, enabled by grammar

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.020
and the unique Latin weightiness

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.020
find a perfect expression.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.820
'Caelum Non Animum Mutant, Qui Trans Mare Currunt.'

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
Another Horacian gem, this

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.440
time from his first book of Epistles

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.260
depends once again for its memorable force on the genius of Latin grammar.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.460
The way the accusative tense is signalled in the final Um's

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.080
of 'Caelum' and 'Animum'

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.480
so that the contrast between the climate or the colour of the sky, 'Caelum',

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480
which the traveller can change,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480
and her state of mind, 'Animum',

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480
which the traveller can't alter so easily

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.040
is pointed out with the maximum impact.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.180
Latin, more than any other tongue, is the language

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.180
in which things are not just said, but

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.660
stay said.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.660
The tight grammatical structure of the language

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.820
helps give Latin sayings a massive architectural grandeur.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.820
The verbal equivalent of a colosseum,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.820
the pantheon or the Pont du Gard

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.040
like those great edifices, they're built to stand the test of time.
