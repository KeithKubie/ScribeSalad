00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.950
My name is Daniel Donoghue.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.470
I'm a Professor of English,
and the Chair of the Committee

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.405
on Medieval Studies.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
Diagrams are ubiquitous.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.400
There is the
mandala, for example,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.980
used in Buddhist meditation.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.610
Or the mandorla, used in
Byzantine and Western Christian

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.890
iconography.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.350
But we don't have
to go so far afield.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.759
I can recall, for example, the
seductive symmetry of diagrams

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.670
in textbooks from my earlier
school days in fields

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.700
like geometry and biology.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
In more recent
decades, computers

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.090
have allowed us to
turn many kinds of data

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.060
into visual representations
of various kinds of data,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.880
including 3-D imaging.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.980
If we think of diagrams as
techniques of visualization

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
that give order to knowledge
and perception, then

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.450
the Middle Ages have a special
claim on our attention,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.680
because much of its
art is diagrammatic.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
We might be tempted to dismiss
diagrams as a convenience,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.340
perhaps visually
interesting, but still

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.980
a tool that recedes into
the background behind more

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.480
pressing questions.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.780
But as our talk this
evening will demonstrate,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.290
the topic opens into important
philosophical and aesthetic

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.940
questions such as,
what is an image?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.370
Jeffrey Hamburger is the
Kuno Franke Professor

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.770
of German Art and
Culture at the Department

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.910
of the History of Art and
Architecture, here at Harvard.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.650
The recipient of grants
from numerous organizations,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.880
including the John S. Guggenheim
Foundation, the American

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
Philosophical Society, the
NEH, and the Humboldt-Stiftung,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.170
Professor Hamburger
was elected a Fellow

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
of the Medieval Academy
of America in 2001,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.620
and a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.870
in 2009.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.880
He is the author, the co-author,
the editor and the co-editor,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
of too many books to list in
an introduction like this.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.580
So I will mention only
a few from recent years.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.980
I hope all of you had
the opportunity last year

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.980
to visit the stunning exhibition
of medieval illuminated

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.790
manuscripts, held in various
institutions in the Boston

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.840
area.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400
They were assembled
and displayed

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.790
at the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.120
at the McMullen Museum
of Boston College,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600
and here at the
Houghton Library.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.850
Professor Hamburger was one of
the prime movers of the effort,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.870
and a co-editor of the
beautiful volume to accompany

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.040
the exhibition--

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.340
Beyond Words--
illuminated manuscripts

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.280
in Boston Collections.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.550
Also in 2016, with
three collaborators,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.280
he produced Liturgical Life and
Latin Learning at Paradies Bei

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.290
Soest, 1300-1425--

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.720
Inscription and
Illumination and the Choir

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
Books of a North German
Dominican Convent.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
In 2015, with Nigel Palmer,
he edited The Prayer Book

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.790
of Ursula Begerin.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.300
And between 2015 and 2016, he
produced a 12-volume survey

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.280
of masterpieces of book
illumination in central Europe.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.440
In 2016, with Harvard
University Press,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.050
he co-edited Sign and Design--

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.110
Script as Image in
Cross-cultural Perspective,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.630
300 to 1600 CE.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.580
Next April, Professor
Hamburger is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.640
organizing a symposium
at Dumbarton Oaks,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.740
on the Diagram Paradigm--

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.340
Byzantium, the Latin West,
and the Islamic World.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.650
As the Chair of the Committee
on Medieval Studies,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.680
I am constantly reminded
that to be a Medievalist

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.320
means to be interdisciplinary.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.690
And that interdisciplinarity
is even more true,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.450
if that's possible, in the
field of Medieval Art History.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.060
Professor Hamburger's
scholarship

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.800
moves with disarming ease among
various specialized fields,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.529
such as Late Medieval
Theology, including

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.800
Mysticism, liturgy,
Latin and vernacular

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.019
literature, and history--

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.280
whether the micro-history of a
particular convent in Bavaria,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.430
or the particular interest in--

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.260
or, I should say,
the broader movements

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.950
of political and
cultural history.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.050
His work has shown a
particular interest

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.740
in women's spirituality
and mysticism, especially

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.440
in convents throughout
the German-speaking world,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.680
with special attention
to book illuminations.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.460
But his work is always
reaching toward big questions,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.220
so that when he examines
a particular instance

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.660
of mystical art produced in a
Bavarian convent, for example,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.050
he crosses a threshold into
a much broader discussion

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.940
of the paradoxical relationship
between art and mysticism.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.740
This evening, we are
going to be treated

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.090
to a similar move, that opens
onto important questions facing

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.620
us today.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.800
Finally, let me say, it is a
special pleasure for me to make

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.740
this introduction, because
Jeffrey and I have been friends

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.770
since our graduate school days.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.490
He will be speaking to us
on mind mapping, diagrams

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.926
in the Middle Ages, and beyond.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:34.846
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.510
Thank you very much, Dan,
for that more than generous

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.980
introduction.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.800
And thank you all.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.180
I'm overwhelmed by the turnout.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.850
It's great to see
so many people here.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.850
I begin with a diagram.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.660
The caption at the top,
written in a child's hand,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.660
identifies the
circle as the Earth.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.820
Das is die Erde.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.120
The four quadrants are
arranged in a chiastic fashion

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.790
along the opposing diagonals.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.610
The diagonal running from
lower left to upper right

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.950
marks the distance
between Germany--

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.410
Deutschland-- and England.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.330
The opposing diagonal contains
vectors in the form of arrows.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.490
In addition to
attaching text to image,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.910
these pointers set
the orb in motion.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.250
The arrow with the lower
right, which points to Germany,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.650
lends motion and meaning to the
dyadic declaration, da wohne

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.370
ich.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.780
I live there.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.510
That at the upper left,
which points to England,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.140
to the equally emphatic
statement, da wohn stu.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.070
You live there.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.830
In its elementary abstraction,
the simple drawing

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.830
resembles a medieval
T-O map, in which

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.080
the simplest of
geometrical schemata

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.490
exemplifies the basic
structure of God's creation.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.380
A typical map of
this kind is far

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.410
from being eurocentric
in orientation.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.720
The upper semicircle
represents Asia,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.350
the lower two quadrants
Europe and Africa.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.320
The continents converge on
the world's true center,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.460
the Holy Land, with Jerusalem
sometimes, although not always,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.320
at the middle point.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.870
Such maps indicate that
medieval cartography

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.900
was diagrammatic to its core.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.880
To what extent,
however, are diagrams

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.910
cartographic, in the
sense of modeling reality

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.340
in spatial terms?

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.520
No less than a medieval
map, a medieval diagram

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.910
embodies a Weltanschauung,
a world view.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.330
If not as literally, then in
its structuring of a reality

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.170
thought to govern the world
and mankind's place within it.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.230
The letter from which this
child's diagram is taken

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.710
explains the circumstances
of its making.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.160
It begins, in
translation, "Dear Mummy,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.740
Papa made a face like
this when you were here,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.960
and cried like this."

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.260
It continues.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.170
"This is the earth,
and on the earth

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.290
I see how close we are living."

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.070
All these points are
underscored by indexical arrows.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.040
A trio of additional pointers
draws the reader's attention

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.580
from the text to the diagram
in the upper left hand corner,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.700
lending added force to
its plaintive affirmation

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.250
of proximity, as
if its declaration

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.679
of inconsequential
distance could, in fact,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.809
effect a reunion.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.909
Adjacent to the diagram
stands a crudely

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.210
drawn face, if not quite
round, then in most respects

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.600
no less schematic than
the cartographic schema

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.190
with which it's juxtaposed.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.890
The tears to which the
letter refers stream

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.530
not from the large
black eyes, but rather

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.240
from a second pair above them,
perhaps doubling as eyebrows.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.490
And, as if one pair of
eyes couldn't weep enough,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.210
their duplication adds
weight to the letter's words.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.150
Below the face, a trapezoid,
representing both neck

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:16.010
and torso, extends to embrace
the word, Gesicht, a face.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.980
The overlap assures the
linking of text and image,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.950
as does the long
loop representing

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:26.270
a tie, which knots the two types
of graphic traces together.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.030
The other side of the letter
includes a simple exercise

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.480
in English, conducted,
it seems, in anticipation

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.570
of the desired reunion.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.260
The letter in question was
written by my mother in 1934,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.300
when she was 10.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.130
She had been left
behind in Leipzig

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.030
by her parents, who had already
fled Nazi Germany for London,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.190
where they were seeking
to establish themselves

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.580
before bringing over
the rest of the family.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.230
The arrows that
punctuate the letter

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.440
lended a hope for
instrumentality.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.700
The paintings of Paul
Klee, whose notebooks

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.330
are crammed with diagrams,
deliberately and deceptively

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.480
ape the naivete of
children's drawings.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.810
They incorporate arrows and
pointers to similar ends,

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.870
transforming his playful
yet haunting images

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.100
into diagrams of desire.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.500
Like a medieval diagram of
the micro- and the macrocosm,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.670
Klee's schematic drawing,
Ich, Du, Erde, Welt--

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.750
I, you, earth, world--

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.360
also mixes iconic and
indexical elements

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.270
to diagram the relationship
between the self and the world.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.910
In this case, his eye
and his I-- his self.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.430
The horizontal arrow at
the center pointing from

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.260
the teardrop-shaped Du on
the right, labeled, "you--

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.470
visible interiorization,
object,"

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:56.110
to the reciprocal Ich on the
left, labeled, "eye and I,"

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.240
punning, "artist," traces the
path of optical appearances,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.153
"optical, physical--

00:11:04.153 --> 00:11:07.337
uh-- opticalischa Weg?"

00:11:07.337 --> 00:11:08.670
I can't quite read it from here.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.530
The orb of the earth placed,
as in a medieval diagram

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.070
of the four elements,
at the bottom,

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.600
marks one half of an
elliptical pathway

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.910
which converges from
above and below,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:32.010
on the eyeball at the left, the
focal point of all the arrows.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.030
The lower half of the path
represents the earth--

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.460
non-optical path of
terrestrial or material

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.270
rootedness, or stasis.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.250
In contrast, that at the top,
which traverses the upper

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.270
region of the all-embracing
circle, labeled, Welt,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.070
represents the world--

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.030
non-optical path of cosmic
communality, or dynamism.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.910
Klee's drawing
encapsulates the argument

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.390
presented in his essay, Paths
for the Study of Nature,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.820
from 1923.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.590
By the standards
of common parlance,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.930
clays poetic diagram
could not be farther

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.830
from a naturalistic
representation of the world.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.370
Rather than reflecting reality,
however, Clay's poetic diagrams

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.570
participate in his
credo of making visible.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.250
In his essay, clay describes the
diagram in the following terms.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.860
Quote, "On the lower
path which gravitates

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.630
towards the center
of the Earth lie

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.120
the problems of
static balance, which

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.760
can be defined with
the words, stand

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.150
despite all the
possibilities of falling.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.580
The upper path leads
desire to break away

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.630
from earthly attachment
through swimming and flying

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.250
to free impetus,
to free movement."

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.220
Klee explicitly
identifies his diagram,

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.860
which provides a pattern
for his paintings,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.690
as a means of charting desire.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.050
The arrows in my mother's
less ambitious cosmic diagram

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.580
are no less indexical.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.200
They not only
convey information,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.360
or express an affective state--

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.380
in this case, an overwhelming
case of separation anxiety--

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.870
they represent an attempt to
impose order on the world--

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.410
in this case, a world in
which order was quickly

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:23.230
slipping away, and in which
nothing would soon make sense.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.540
More an expression of distraught
desire than crude cartography,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.550
the diagram, despite
its simplicity,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.770
raises fundamental questions.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.340
In the words of Nelson
Goodman, "how is worldmaking

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.320
related to knowing?"

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.920
To paraphrase Goodman's reply,
diagrams do not map the world.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.620
They make a world.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.510
Of course, medieval
authors would not

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.620
have accepted Goodman's account
of multiple actual worlds,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.300
although in the
context of discussions

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.570
of divine omnipotence,
possible worlds represented

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.250
a different matter.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.050
His question, however,
would nonetheless

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.340
have made sense to them.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.330
I wish to argue that, no less
than my mother's diagram,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.720
those made in the Middle Ages
should be viewed, not simply

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.290
as tools for thinking, or
representations of knowledge,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.980
but also as vehicles
of deeply held desires.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.600
Rather than simply
representing the world,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.470
they make and model worlds.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.740
Diagrams and desire might seem
far removed from one another.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.460
No less a logician than
Charles Sanders Peirce,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.280
however, saw fit
to connect them.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.460
In his essay, "Logic as
Semiotic," written around 1897,

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.550
Peirce spoke of the habit of
"abstractive observation," that

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.350
formed the foundation of
learning from experience.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.880
Peirce defines the process
in terms of desire.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.330
And this is the first of
a few longer quotations,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.270
so I put them up
for you to follow.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.000
"The faculty which I call
abstractive observation

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.940
is one which ordinary
people perfectly recognize,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.010
but for which the
theories of philosophers

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.500
sometimes hardly leave room.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.050
It is a familiar experience
to every human being

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.230
to wish for something quite
beyond his present means,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.840
and to follow that
wish by the question,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.390
should I wish for that
thing just the same

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.330
if I had ample
means to gratify it?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.090
To answer that question,
he searches his heart,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.670
and in doing so,
makes what I term

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.400
an abstractive observation.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.840
He makes in his imagination
a sort of skeleton diagram,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.680
or outlying sketch,
of himself, considers

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.530
what modifications the
hypothetical state of things

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.760
would require to be made in that
picture, and then examines it,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.610
that is, observes
what he has imagined,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.040
to see whether the
same ardent desire is

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.960
there to be discerned.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.300
By such a process,
which is at bottom very

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.590
much like mathematical
reasoning,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.740
we can reach
conclusions as to what

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.930
would be true of
signs in all cases,

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:05.150
so long as the intelligence
using them was scientific.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.960
On Peirce's account,
which remains

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.040
indebted to Kant's notion of
the schema of imagination,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.140
namely the rule or
procedure by which

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.340
a pure non-empirical concept
or category is associated

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.670
with a sense impression,
the process of perception

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.930
itself involves a form of
diagrammatic projection.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.360
In this model, diagrams
are not simply something

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.650
seen, they are also an inherent
part of constitutive cognitive

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.070
patterns, which observers
bring to their experience

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.610
of the world.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.550
And just as diagrams
were central to,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.520
even constituentive
of Peirce's logic,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.340
so too I hope to
demonstrate logic

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.120
is critical to understanding
medieval diagrams in ways

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.320
that have not always
been fully appreciated.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.620
All of you, no doubt, have an
instinctive sense as to what

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.500
constitutes a diagram.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.200
Diagrams constitute a
staple of our textbooks,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.950
as Dan pointed out.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.099
Especially in the German
philosophical tradition,

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.060
they are thought to
appeal to intuition--

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.540
Anschauung.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.579
All the way back
to Plato, diagrams

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.119
have been associated with
transcendental truth.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.240
Diagrams, however, at least
as materially produced

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.579
and transmitted, are
very much a product

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.770
of their time and place.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.390
Despite their association
with laws, logic, and truth,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.340
diagrams have
contingent dimensions.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.610
A diagram, some might say, is
a two-dimensional schematic

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.070
representation-- usually
linear or geometric--

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.600
of relationships between
various interrelated objects

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.180
or concepts, that is designed
to show how something works.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.400
If only it were that simple.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.820
Even this rudimentary definition
is riddled with equivocation,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.040
and makes all kinds
of assumptions.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.840
For starter, with
what one might call

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.740
the representational
regime of the diagram.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.700
Does a diagram in some way
reflect or embody reality?

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.820
Or does it possess
its own reality,

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.440
whether ideational or material?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.830
Are diagrams platonic
or pragmatic?

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.740
Moreover, if one is to speak
of the diagrammatic as well

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.560
as the diagram, per
se, why need one

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.220
limit oneself to two dimensions?

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.190
In the age of virtual
reality, diagrams readily

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.470
assume three-dimensional form.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.720
Also in logic, in
which tautologies

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.580
have given way to typologies.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.840
With the rise of
computer-generated design,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.020
which encourages less the
representation of preexisting

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.360
forms than the
playful generation

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.410
of perception-bending spaces,
architectural historians

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.620
and even some architects refer
to their solid structures

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.620
as diagrammatic, not
simply in character,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.370
but also in conception.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.600
Modern design practice
serves as a reminder

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.760
that a diagram is always spatial
and relational in character.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.970
Some diagrams, such as the
Feynman, Penrose, and Minkowski

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.900
diagrams employed by
physicists to graph spacetime--

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.150
and please don't ask me too
many questions about those

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.310
after the talk--

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.500
and the interactions
among particles,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.100
explicitly integrate
the component of time.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.940
As in the Compendium Historiae
in Genealogia Christi of Peter

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.600
of Poitiers, the shift from the
third into the fourth dimension

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.050
can unfold or unfurl
on paper or parchment,

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.900
not to mention, on
a computer screen.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.310
Diagrams chart.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.120
They map.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.440
They interrelate.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.280
But they also unfold,
sometimes literally.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.850
Diagrams deal with process,
both in the world and no less

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.040
importantly, in the mind.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.890
They plot rationality
in spatial terms,

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.490
and map out cognitive as
well as mechanical practices

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.870
and procedures.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.020
Cognitive psychologists
ask whether spatial schemas

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.840
offer a metaphor or a mechanism
for cognitive processes.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.140
Medieval diagrams suggest
that the answer is both.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.190
Take, for example, a single
diagram found in a 14th century

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.190
historical compendium from
the Diocese of Konstanz,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.420
consisting of biblical
paraphrases and summaries.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.750
The diagram takes the form
of a seven arm candelabrum,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.120
and in this particular
copy, can be considered

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.720
either the last part of Peter
of Potiers' work, with which it

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.800
often circulated, or the
first in a series of nine

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.860
diagrams at the end of the
manuscript, the remainder

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.810
of which belong to the set known
as the Speculum Theologiae.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.060
Its placement alone
permits it to serve

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.240
a mediating role between
the historical works, which

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.360
constitute the bulk of the
book, and the moralizing

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.260
diagrams at the end, whose
emphasis is tropological,

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.890
that is, moral, rather
than typological, that is,

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.290
historical.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.500
Whereas in an early 13th
century English example

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.860
here at Harvard--

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.190
it's one of the earliest
surviving copies--

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.790
the candelabrum, accompanied
by a Tree of Consanguinity,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.180
comes at the very beginning of
Beiter's Timeline of Scriptural

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.230
History.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.440
In the 14th century version,
in which, moreover, the work

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.110
has been adapted
from roll to codex,

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.430
the candelabrum comes, rather,
at the end, thereby endowing it

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.110
with an eschatological aura,
embedded within the text, which

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.140
ostensibly explains it.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.300
The diagram
represents the church,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.980
by means of a seven-branched
menorah from the temple.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.020
Transplanted to a
Christian context,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.480
the seven-armed
candelabrum, similar

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.610
to monumental bronze
examples found

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.890
in churches
throughout the empire,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.480
indicates, as does the
genealogy that precedes it,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.150
that Judaism, synagoga,
has been superseded

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.330
by Christianity, ecclesia.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.970
The candelabrum represents
part of the symbolic

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.260
as well as the literal beauty
of the church triumphant.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.660
The upright central
arm represents Christ.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.510
The three on one side,
the left, represent

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.030
the three orders, or
grades, of the faithful

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.580
during the period
before, the three

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.290
on the other side, that is the
right, after the Incarnation.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.660
The text, in turn,
defines these three orders

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.840
within the church in terms
of the prophecy in Ezekiel

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.700
regarding Noah, Daniel, and Job.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.700
Whereas Noah represents
the prelates,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.440
Daniel represents the virgins,
and Job, those who are married.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.910
All await the day of judgment.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.990
Above each of the seven arms
an upturned, chalice-like cup

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.930
pours out oil into one
of the bowls held aloft

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.140
by the arms, which in turn
consist of pieces which

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.780
are linked by small
spheres, from which

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.860
spring decorative lilies, terms
which are repeated obsessively

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.110
across the surface
of the page, as

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.810
if to match the number of
parts in real examples.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.950
And for example, the
candelabrum in Braunschweig,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:16.560
which I just showed you,
has 74 different parts.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.950
The redundant denomination of
the depicted object's parts

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.190
provides a plethora of places--

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:28.220
loci-- not unlike the segments
of the Guidonian hand,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.925
a common mnemonic device.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.460
How does such a diagram work?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.110
The accompanying text barely
makes any mention of it.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.300
Some terms are allegorized.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.150
The majority, however, in
particular the components

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.710
of the candelabrum, are not.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.550
In contrast to what one
finds in an authentic work

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.480
by Peter, the Allegoriae
Supertabernaculum Moysi.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.900
It is left to the viewer
to make sense of the image.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.160
More than a line diagram, but
less than a freestanding image,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.940
it hovers between two
modes of representation.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.610
The object diagram
figures both time--

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.220
sacred history-- and space--

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.110
heaven and hell, as
well as the ranks

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.350
within the
ecclesiastical hierarchy.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.900
Like the diagram, all of
history and all people

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.230
are divided in two by
the coming of Christ.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.250
The image's meaning, moreover,
is conditioned by its context.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.880
Whereas the preceding schematic
rendering of salvation history,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.830
in the form of
Peter's chronology,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.740
identifies the diagram
as an image connecting

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.500
past and future, even
as it distinguishes

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.450
between the blessed
and the damned,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.270
and by implication,
Christians and Jews,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.000
the subsequent
image, a Tree of Life

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.760
based on Bonaventure's
Lignum vitae,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.820
provides a visionary vehicle
for spiritual ascent,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.190
by way of the
imitation of Christ.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.460
In the words of the inscription
at the bottom, a paraphrase

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.180
of Apocalypse 22, "I
saw the tree of life

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.020
bearing twelve fruits, yielding
its fruits every month.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.910
And the leaves of the tree were
for the healing of nations."

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.740
Just as the viewer
of the candelabrum

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.280
is instructed that the gifts
which Christ confers on mankind

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.090
surpass human understanding,
so too the viewer of the Tree

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.350
is invited to ascend with Christ
and aspire to those heights.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.860
Both diagrams serve a mnemonic
function, permitting the reader

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.580
to hang various concepts on the
branches of both candelabrum

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.940
and tree, just as
does the artist.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.560
The metaphors, however, merge--

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.960
a complementarity
encouraged and enhanced

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.030
by the fact that
the two images face

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.000
one another across an opening.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.880
Alone, by virtue of the
two images' juxtaposition,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.140
the candelabrum becomes a
type of Christ on the cross.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.390
The branches of both
menorah and tree

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.530
become intertwined,
generating new associations.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.310
Metaphor becomes
mechanism, a mechanism

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.640
whose parts the viewer is
expected to manipulate.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.630
The images both represent a
Christian conception of truth,

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.610
and provide the
viewer with vehicles

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.930
for striving towards it.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.190
The use of diagrams
as demonstrations,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.010
whether mathematical
or philosophical,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.400
or as vehicles with which
to attain those truths,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.720
is as old as Plato,
Euclid, and Archimedes.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.170
Each of the 42 diagrams
developed by Lothar of Segni,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.650
later Pope Innocent III,
to accompany his Treatise

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.590
on the Mass, is paired
with an explanation

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.740
beginning, haec
figura demonstrat--

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.740
this figure demonstrates.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.110
The repeated rubric
was hardly necessary.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.950
The diagram itself
serve to make the point.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.660
Throughout the
Middle Ages, diagrams

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.690
made particular types of
claims on their viewers

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.670
and demanded specific forms
of cognitive response.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.220
Philosophical tracts
regularly contain

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.550
diagrams, whether to
represent their contents,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.440
or to provide the
reader with tools

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.290
for conceptualizing problems.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.140
The diagrammatic tradition's
roots in science--

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.470
in particular, astronomy
and cosmology--

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.160
made it natural to associate
medieval diagrams with reason

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.260
rather than with feeling.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.180
Their abstraction, in
turn, made it easier

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.910
to associate them with the
realm of the intellect,

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.460
rather than with
that of experience.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.510
Of course, the truth
claims of diagrams

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.750
do not need to be
accepted at face value.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.540
In particular, religious
devotional and theological

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.960
diagrams, which deal with
such topics as life and death,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.460
prophecy, and salvation, or the
underlying order of creation--

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.490
you're looking here at a Genesis
initial from a 12th century

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.660
Bible--

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.390
necessarily grapple
with powerful emotions,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.540
which, no matter how hard
they try to impose it,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.660
escape the
establishment of order.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.050
Not without reason,
postmodern philosophers

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.230
have subjected diagrams
to scathing suspicion,

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.050
if for different reasons
than did late 19th century

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.680
mathematicians and logicians,
such as Frege, Pasch,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.360
and Hilbert.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.050
Writing on figures such as
Gilles Deleuze, Francois

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.610
Laruelle, and Alain
Badiou, a neoplatonist

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.110
who elevates set theory
to the role of geometry

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.880
in Plato's corpus, the historian
of philosophy, John Mularkey,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.870
has declared, quote, "There
is no Truth in diagrams,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.360
nothing sacred in geometry.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.190
The fluctuous line is not
an intimation of the divine.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.690
Its immanence, its
materiality, keeps it

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.230
at some distance from the
infinite lines, pure circles,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.560
and perfect triangles
of Nicholas of Cusa.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.050
Such infinities,
purities, and perfections

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.780
smack of the virtual,
the transcendental,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.570
the vision of God."

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.260
This iconoclastic
critique of the diagram,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.780
which casts it not as
an instrument of reason,

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.360
but rather as a
rhetorical device,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.940
opens its seemingly
cogent demonstrations

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.120
of irrefutable logic
to accusations, if not

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.770
necessarily of
mystical irrationality,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.090
than at least of fiction
and ideological persuasion.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.110
Following David
Freedberg, art historians

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.850
now regularly speak of
the power of images.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.920
Within anthropological
perspectives,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.610
less often is it asked, to
what end such power, whatever

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.010
form it might take?

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.740
The power that derives
from persuasion, let alone

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.350
animation, is very different
from a demonstration

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.810
of irrefutable truth.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.240
To what extent do
diagrams lend one

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.610
the appearance of the other?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.890
Part of diagram's
persuasive power

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.030
lies in their uncanny
ability to both mimic

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:04.040
and to structure the process
of ratiocination itself.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.560
To these functions the
diagrammatic method,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.590
underlying some forms of
artificial intelligence,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.510
bear witness.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.000
Peirce invented a
diagrammatic language

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.600
called, by him, existential
graphs, with which he thought

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.480
he could address any
philosophical problem,

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.730
in particular those in logic.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:27.440
And this is a set of those
so-called existential graphs

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.990
from his notebooks
across the street,

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.970
in the Houghton Library.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.890
In a celebrated
passage written shortly

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:38.510
before his death in 1913,
Peirce declared, quote,

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:42.410
"reasoning is dependent
on graphical signs."

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.740
Peirce, who said of
Aristotle, and again I quote,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.290
"have read and thought
more about Aristotle

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.530
than about any other man,"
echoes the philosopher's

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.680
treatise on memory, in which
he observes that, quote,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.560
"it is not possible to
think without an image."

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.920
That's the famous
passage from Aristotle.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.960
Neither Peirce nor
Aristotle, however,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.390
refers to
representational images,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.370
whether actual or mental.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.000
And this passage
is often misquoted.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.600
In fact, Peirce insists
that neither on paper,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.960
nor in his dreams, do
his diagrams engage

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.630
with the imagination.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.280
This is a wonderful passage.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.920
"There is nothing fanciful
about my diagrams.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.900
I do not, for
example, see numbers

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.020
with colors attached to them
and placed upon some curve,

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.940
and it perfectly
astounds me to find

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.730
how useful some persons
are able to make

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.950
such strange constructions.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.560
When I am in health I
am not aware of having

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.380
any dreams, unless
perhaps of a problem

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.250
in algebra where no real
significations are attached

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.430
to the letters, or
something equally abstract.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.130
My 'Existential Graphs'
have a remarkable likeness

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:57.100
to my thoughts about any
topic in philosophy."

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.340
In contrast to his approximate
contemporary, the philosopher,

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.400
logician, and mathematician,
Gottlob Frege,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.990
whose concept schrift--

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.350
Begriffsschrift--
a formal language

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.470
for pure thought modeled
on that of arithmetic

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.080
represented a
revolution in logic,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.050
but also had the effect of
banishing pictures, even

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.880
diagrams.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.640
Peirce insists not
simply on the utility,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.330
but also the
necessity of diagrams.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.310
The stakes here are high.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.230
Moreover, they can
be framed in terms

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.530
that a medieval theologian
would have understood.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:37.520
Namely, what purchase do the
imaginative faculties, which

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.970
operate with images,
have on truth?

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.980
Just as medieval
thinkers disagreed

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.950
when it came to this issue,
with iconoclasts representing

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.430
the radical skeptics, so
too modern philosophers

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:54.020
and students of psychology have
swung from one pole to another.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.330
In the words of one
commentator, "we

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.130
live at the end
of a period, which

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.280
perhaps more than
any other, has hidden

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.340
in the pictorial life of the
mind from intellectual view."

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.580
Philosophy in the mid-century
regarded sense data

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.940
as fictions, arrived
at by bad inference,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.560
and suitable for disposal as
an undergraduate exercise.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.930
It was seriously maintained
that all inner representation

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.530
was propositional."

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.490
That's the end of the quote.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.050
Peirce's view could not
have been more different.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.210
In his essay on
improving reasoning,

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.000
Peirce explains,
"By 'graphical' I

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.680
mean capable of being
written or drawn,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.110
so as to be spatially arranged.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.900
It is true that one
can argue viva voce,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.180
but I do not believe
one can go very deeply

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.580
into any important
and considerably large

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.070
subject of discussion
with calling up

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.730
in the minds of one's hearers
mental images of objects

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.910
arranged in ways in which
time, without space, is

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.330
incapable of serving as the
field of representation,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.540
since in time of two
quite distinct objects

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:07.100
one must be antecedent
and the other subsequent."

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.370
In insisting on this spatial
dimension of thought,

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.980
Peirce again echoes
Aristotle, who

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.520
speaks not of mental pictures,
but rather of diagrams.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.800
Having affirmed that, quote--

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.659
this is Aristotle speaking--

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.110
"it is not possible to
think without an image,"

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.929
the philosopher observes,
for the same effect

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:34.199
occurs in thinking as
in drawing a diagram.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:37.489
In comparing cogitation
to the process of drawing,

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.850
Aristotle goes beyond asserting
that a diagram represents

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.889
the content of thought.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.350
Rather, it is the
procedure of producing

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.409
the diagram which
resembles, and even enables,

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:50.449
the process of thought.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.489
Both, in his view,
involve a step

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.870
by step method of
defining and drawing

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:59.300
relationships that point
towards particular conclusions.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.730
If drawing a diagram and
the process of thinking

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.490
represent two sides
of the same equation,

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:08.030
then it is not simply a matter
of thought generating diagrams,

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.360
but also of diagrams
generating thought.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.730
Rather than a
representation, the diagram

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.600
structures the patterns
according to which one thinks.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.240
The diagram is more than
a mere representation.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.770
It is an active, or operative.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.160
This understanding of the
diagram, not as an illustration

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.550
but as a tool for thinking,
and in religious contexts,

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:33.400
a vehicle for transporting
the soul to God,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.070
was of major importance
in the Middle Ages.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.400
When thinking about
medieval diagrams,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.050
Peirce provides a
useful point of entry,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.640
and not only because he
assigns them such importance.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.430
Peirce employed diagrams
not simply to map out

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.860
a pre-cogitated
philosophy of signs,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.740
but to generate it
in the first place.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.960
Peirce famously
discusses the diagram

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.320
in the context of his complex
differentiation of signs

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.900
into three overarching
categories--

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.590
icons, indices, and symbols.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.290
In discussing specific
instances of icons,

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.590
Peirce defines the diagram
in scholastic terms, which

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.230
portray an obsession
with triads worthy

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.120
of the medieval
theologian struggling

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.570
to understand the Trinity.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.250
Just as theologians
spoke of hypostases

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.410
to refer to the
persons of the Trinity

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:32.360
as individuated instantiations
of the Godhead, so Peirce--

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.160
and I love this detail--

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.060
he converted from Unitarianism
to Trinitarianism--

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.420
called his three classes of
individuated icons, hypoicons.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.200
"Hypoicons may roughly
be divided according

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.150
to the mode of Firstness--

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.460
that is, the
pre-reflexive immediacy

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.350
of which they partake.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.026
Those which partake of
simple qualities or First

00:36:57.026 --> 00:37:00.830
Firstnesses--" he sounds
like Duns Scotus--

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.980
"--are images-- those which
represent the relations,

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.820
mainly dyadic, or so regarded,
of the parts of one thing

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.140
by analogous relations in
their own parts, are diagrams.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.930
Those which represent the
representative character

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.210
of a representamen
by representing

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:23.000
a parallelism in something
else, are metaphors."

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.890
Peirce can be heavy going.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.490
Peirce outlines a
hierarchy of connectivity.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.500
Whereas images
involve, in his view,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.290
one-to-one relationships
predicated on shared

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.420
qualities--

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.590
a kind of phenomenology--
and metaphors,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.550
a higher order set of parallel
relationships that are mediated

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.010
without any actual
correspondence among

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.750
their component parts--

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.430
a kind of metaphysics--

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.680
a diagram, which,
in his view, belongs

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.890
to the realm of
science, charts forces

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.850
that, like vectors, require
that a given object and its sign

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:03.470
possess an analogous structure
of internal relationships.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.050
Peirce sought to
make his system,

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:09.220
which ultimately grew to
embrace a 66-fold classification

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.280
of signs,
all-encompassing, yet is

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.640
betrayed by the personification
of epistomy, sketched

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.250
in the margin of one
of his manuscripts,

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.820
his system was as much a
product of compulsive obsession

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.520
as of distant speculation.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.370
In laying bare the
contradictions and cracks, even

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.090
the breaking points
of his classification,

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.000
Peirce's marginalia aped the
function of the often unruly,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.480
ribald, and shape-shifting
images in the borders

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.480
of medieval manuscripts.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.120
Oops.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.745
There they are.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.830
Whether or not one
regards them as revelatory

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.200
of the philosopher's
unconscious concerns

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.390
about the stability
of his system,

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.780
his drawings are symptomatic of
tremendous emotional, as well

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.861
as philosophical struggle.

00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:02.360
Sorry.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.010
I'm now just going to go
back to where I wanted to be.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:11.950
Peirce's diagram of IT,
part of the triad I, It,

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.880
and Thou, an early attempt to
reduce Kant's 12 categories

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.140
of understanding to a more
manageable three, once again,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.630
which he drew as he was
working on his treatise,

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.590
The Natural History of Words,
provides a compelling example

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.290
of diagrammatic contingencies.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.380
Less a table or an
octagon, both words

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.420
that have been used
to describe it,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.300
the diagram suggests a
whirling St. Catherine's wheel

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.750
of words and vectors, whose
centrifugal forms fly out

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.460
from the center.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.940
Rather than charting the
infinite qualities of quantity,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.700
indicated to the right,
the spinning forms

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.060
suggest a spiraling centrifuge.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.210
In fact, the drawing's forms
reflect the circular blade

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.300
structure of the
turbine, a new technology

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.470
whose forms fascinated Peirce--

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.180
this is Peirce's drawing
of a turbine on the left--

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.980
just as they did
his contemporary,

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.310
Henry Adams, who, in perhaps
the most famous chapter

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.680
of his autobiography,
The Education of Henry

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.170
Adams, the Virgin
and the Dynamo,

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:18.400
describes the great machines at
the Chicago exhibition of 1900,

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.950
in Chicago, as a
symbol of infinity.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.730
Adams continues, "As he
grew--" he writes about himself

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.050
in the third person--

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.780
"as he grew accustomed to the
great gallery of machines,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.420
he began to feel the 40 foot
dynamos as a moral force,

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.200
much as the early
Christians felt the cross."

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.420
In its linking of
categories of perception

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.970
to vectors of motion,
Peirce's drawing

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:49.560
is uncannily reminiscent of
Klee's diagram, Ich Du Erde

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.390
Welt. Both embody precisely the
kind of metaphorical ambiguity

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.430
that Peirce's
so-called Existential

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.590
Graphs sought to eliminate.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.970
On the one hand,
Peirce's diagrams

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.430
reveal a determination
to impose order

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.340
on the unruly signs
of the world--

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.490
I'm sorry-- on the
unruly world of signs.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.960
On the other hand, they suggest
a deep-seated fear of disorder.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.740
This double-faced character,
rational and irrational,

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.850
finds its match in medieval
diagrams and marginalia.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:28.470
And I've deliberately put up an
example of phallic marginalia,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:33.000
because the image at
the top, by Peirce,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.120
which is a parody of his
own existential graphs,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:41.140
also contains similar
phallic imagery.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.640
In the Middle Ages,
diagrams acted not only as

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.890
instruments of pedagogy,
they also served

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.920
as a means of recording,
if inadequately,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.620
prophetic and
visionary experience.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.410
In other cases, in keeping
with their generative as well

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.840
as their representational
capacities,

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.640
they further provided a
matrix for such experiences.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.530
Diagrams supplied an
armature within which

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.890
authors and artists could,
to use the medieval term,

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.980
figure those things that
could not be captured

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.510
by words and images alone.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.380
To view diagrams as
instruments of mystification

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.350
might seem like a
contradiction in terms.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:25.030
Like their modern counterparts,
medieval diagrams demonstrate.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:28.300
As soon, however, as one
speaks of demonstration,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.730
a contradiction arises.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.630
The purpose of a demonstration
is to make something clear.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.580
Yet an image
requiring decipherment

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.910
can also be used
to veil the truth.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:43.360
Diagram's potential to
clarify often, if not always,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:49.190
comes at the expense of
metaphorical misrepresentation.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.650
Does history, or
do concepts, really

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:55.340
unfold like the
ramifications of a tree?

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.220
Is the Trinity really
like a triangle?

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.740
Even if one could
draw such a figure,

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.470
and that is precisely
the point, how

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.380
is God like a circle, whose
center is nowhere and whose

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.960
circumference is everywhere?

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.860
In this double
character of the diagram

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.260
lay a large part of
its appeal to medieval

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.900
theologians and exegetes.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.570
Metaphor, as Umberto
Eco points out,

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.330
referring to Aristotle's
theory of the trope,

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.520
has the capacity to
establish new ontologies.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.420
Whether overtly figurative
or merely suggestive

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.590
of figuration, the
medieval diagram

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.230
participated in a
dynamic dialectic

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:38.020
of revelation and
concealment, one in which

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.200
the viewer was invited
to participate.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.750
To look at a theological
or mystical diagram

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:50.280
was not only to be instructed,
it was also to be initiated.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.310
Diagrams not only make visible.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:56.490
Their abstract, etiolated forms
hint at what remains invisible,

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.950
beyond representation.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.200
With this turn, one
could object, or observe

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.642
that, at a fundamental
level, a diagram is not

00:44:03.642 --> 00:44:07.530
a representation at all.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.320
One could even go so far as to
say that diagrams ultimately

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.800
have no object or
referent in the world.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.290
Rather than reflect
the world as it is,

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.560
they first identify,
then rearrange its parts

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.830
into coherent configurations,
that both reflect

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:27.360
and enable, shape and structure,
our patterns of thought.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.410
There is therefore a poetic
dimension to the diagram.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.435
Like a metaphor,
if less open-ended,

00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:37.140
a diagram posits a correlation
among disparate elements,

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.600
or figures of those
elements, in order,

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.330
not simply to reveal, but
rather to create a tertium

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:44.887
comparationis.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.320
It is, of course,
impossible to press

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.710
all diagrams, or even
all medieval diagrams,

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.750
into a single mold.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.170
Diagrams remain part of the
culture and historical horizon

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.210
which produced them.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.170
For the purposes
of this lecture,

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.400
I therefore propose
presenting, very briefly,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.730
a set of diagrams created
in the early 1290s,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:13.110
by the Dominican Friar,
Berthold of Nuremberg,

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.570
on whom I'm currently
completing a book.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:19.210
According to a pair of
authorial subscriptions,

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.730
one at the end of the
first and second parts,

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.580
the first dedicated
to the cross,

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.070
the second to the
Virgin Mary, the work

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.690
was written between
1292 and 1294.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.090
In its complete form,
it survives only

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:37.810
in a single manuscript,
the presentation copy.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.780
Despite the author's name,
the style of the illumination

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.510
points to the upper Rhine,
in particular the region

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.690
of Lake Constance.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.460
One of the most
ambitious diagrammatic

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.380
works from the
entire Middle Ages,

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.350
it ostensibly serves as
no more than a supplement

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:57.100
to the famous treatise
by Robanus Maurus

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.340
in honor of the Holy Cross,
the celebrated collection

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:06.320
of picture poems composed
shortly before the year 810.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.480
Taking Robanus's magnum opus
as his point of departure,

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.490
Berthold traces the entire
history of salvation,

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:16.550
from Adam and Eve
to the end of time,

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.880
in an astonishing
120 sections, each

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.060
of them prefaced by
a small illustration.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:27.350
So at left you have the original
work by Robanus Maurus, which

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.350
in this manuscript is a
15th century copy, which

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.850
can be shown to have replaced
a 13th century original,

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.900
that was there from the outset.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:42.200
And then you have part
one of Berthold's work

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.560
in which Robanus's
cosmology is reorganized

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.430
to tell the story of salvation
in chronological order.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:53.300
And then in Berthold's
part two, on your right,

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.970
the third part of the
whole, the commentary

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.670
on the Virgin, her life
and that of Christ,

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:02.360
are spelled out
in greater detail.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.950
By setting salvation history
in the context of typology,

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.310
his work is of a piece with
the great typological handbooks

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.410
of his day.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.570
The Biblia Pauperum, the
Speculum Humanae Salvationis,

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.000
and the Concordantiae
Caritatis, not

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.030
to mention various
scholastic Marian compendia.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.290
Both Robanus and Berthold
represent radical shifts

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:30.160
in what we are accustomed
to thinking of as an image.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.710
Whereas the one shifts image
in the direction of text,

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.570
the other shifts image in
the direction of diagram.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.240
Despite its difficulty,
Robanus's commentary

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.030
on the cross was copied and
admired throughout the Middle

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.350
Ages.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.120
Written in the
early 9th century,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.568
at a time when forms,
such as the figured and--

00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:51.556
oops.

00:47:51.556 --> 00:47:54.030
What am I doing here?

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.870
When forms, such as the figured
and historiated initial, which

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:02.700
combined word and image in ways
that were to become integral

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.060
to the formal and expressive
repertory of medieval art,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.180
remained of recent
vintage, Robanus's work

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.450
provided a benchmark
of unrivaled complexity

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.730
for its integration.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.730
Its reception thus provides
a measure of difference

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:22.060
in medieval aesthetics,
theology, and piety.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.000
Berthold's religious commitments
as a Dominican Friar,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.790
and his attitude towards
images, differed dramatically

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.030
from those of his
Carolingian predecessor.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.420
These differences chart an
epic-making shift from cross

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:39.040
to crucifix, from a simple,
stark, all-embracing sign,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.940
to a compelling, heart-rending,
and ultimately abject depiction

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:47.260
of the human body, shown
hanging, not from a sign but,

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.280
as in this case, from
a green, living cross.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.620
The differences between
Robanus's original

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.020
and Berthold's
re-interpretation chart

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.570
the origins and
development of figuration

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.120
in medieval art, a
passage from cross

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.020
to crucifix, from book to
body, from disembodied sign

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.080
to embodied image, that
in itself, and in keeping

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.770
with Christian justifications of
anthropomorphic representations

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.470
of the Godhead, fulfills
and demonstrates

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.240
the doctrine of the incarnation.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.880
More than just signs, diagrams
also embody technique.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.670
Not just knowledge,
but ways of knowing.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.490
In light of the processual
nature of the diagram,

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.840
any adjustments to Robanus's
complex, text-image amalgam

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.350
therefore testify to
shifting epistemologies,

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.200
not to mention shifting
attitudes towards images

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.330
in particular, and visual
experience in general.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.010
Whereas Robanus's work
revolves around, and is

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.010
in part generated by,
intricate numerology,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.130
having no center other
than the cross itself--

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.470
witness on the left his
doubling of the seven

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.800
gifts of the Holy Spirit, so
as to be able to rearrange them

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.940
as a symmetrical cross--

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.880
Berthold's is thoroughly
historical, and hence,

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.500
paratactic in structure,
tracing the history of salvation

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.700
in terms of typology
from beginning to end.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.340
Whereas the disciplined
construction of Robanus's work

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.570
presents itself as a revelation
of a temporal truth, whose

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.850
validity is underscored by an
abundance of number symbolism,

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.840
Berthold's sprawling
structure, more

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.510
devotional and
theological, accommodates

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:37.190
a gradual unfolding of human
events in historical time.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.440
For Robanus, locking
his figurations

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.960
within diagrammatic
arrays of words

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.460
disfigures the image, stripping
it of its immateriality.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.690
For Berthold, fleshing out
diagrams with figuration

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.270
enhanced their ability to affect
the truth of the incarnation.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:57.520
Development
introduces the danger

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.310
of teleology, a progress
from abstraction

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.380
to anthropomorphism.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.130
Medieval art, however,
relied on multiple systems

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.010
of representation,
the figural as well

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:13.540
as the abstract, the narrative
as well as the hieratic.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.850
Similar cross-contamination
persists

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.190
in modern scientific diagrams.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.230
Witness Peter
Galison's distinction,

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.430
in scientific imaging,
between the homologous--

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.280
that is, retaining logical
relations within that

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.110
which is represented--

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.600
and the homomorphic--
retaining the form

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.940
of that which is represented.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.190
Those are his definitions.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:38.320
The re-emergence
of the diagrammatic

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.420
in the modern avant
garde, in which

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.120
figural modes of
representation were largely

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.720
abandoned in favor of
various forms of abstraction,

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.120
provides further
insight into the forces

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.270
at work in medieval diagrams.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:56.050
In diagnosing the
diagrammatic aspects of Dada,

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.140
David Joselit has
spoken, and I quote,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.930
"of an historical rupture
between the textual codes

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:05.920
of the book and the visual
codes exemplified by cinema,

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.100
constituting the
ground against which

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.490
Dada's spectacular
heteroglossia emerges."

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.530
According to Deleuze
and Guattari,

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:18.550
whose concept of the rhizome
is fundamentally diagrammatic,

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.730
albeit by definition in the
manner of a distributed nodal

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:25.750
network, not a tree,
the diagram does not

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.870
function to represent
even something real,

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.620
but rather constructs a
real that is yet to come,

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.650
a new type of reality.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.100
In this definition, the diagram
acquires a particular form

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.840
of agency.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.440
One might thus ask, is
abstraction an appropriate term

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.050
applied to medieval diagrams?

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.810
To apply the classic
formula of E. H. Gombrich,

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.480
making comes before matching.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.570
Medieval diagrams, again,
make and model of the world,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:57.790
the only difference being
that there ideations

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.000
refer not to a world
to come, except perhaps

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.610
in an eschatological
context, but rather

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.820
to its prototypical
existence in the mind of God.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.970
that Robanus's
picture poems are all

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:17.080
structured by the exemplary
Christian diagram, the cross,

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.620
they also exhibit a
spectacular heteroglossia.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:25.610
They function simultaneously as
poems, pictures, and diagrams.

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:29.020
Their origins can be traced, not
only to the antique traditions

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.920
of picture poems, and opus
geminata, prose and poetry

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.500
combined, but also
to the earliest

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.850
Christian representation of the
crucifixion, the staurogram,

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:46.480
forged from parts of the Greek
words for cross and crucify.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.900
In some cases, Robanus
imposes diagrammatic elements

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.720
on the poems in the form of
geometric or figural shapes.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.660
In other cases, the
shapes themselves

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.440
take the form of letters
pregnant with meaning.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.480
In translating
Robanus's treatise

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.260
into the diagrammatic mode,
and in literally drawing it out

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.830
at such length, Berthold
disturbed its delicate balance

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:11.890
between word and image,
separating the two,

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.890
and employing independent
images in the form of colored

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:19.990
diagrams, many accompanied
by figural elements.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.900
The differences in formal
and theological presentation

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.540
between the two
authors, one famous,

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.720
the other forgotten,
defining two ages--

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.670
the first operating
in the aftermath

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.600
of Byzantine iconoclasm, the
second in a moment of unchecked

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.270
enthusiasm for images.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.670
Both works are
serial in structure--

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:44.320
Robanus's with 28 parts,
Berthold's with 120.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.070
But each is organized according
to different principles.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:51.700
In the latter, sacred history
is not simply represented,

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.560
it is effectively reenacted,
using a medium which itself

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.280
incorporates a temporal
and corporeal dimension,

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.640
as a result of the diagrams
being placed in sequence,

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.590
and because each
diagram implicitly

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:07.840
involves a series
of connections being

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:13.360
drawn in both material and
ideational sense of the word.

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.980
In this sense,
Berthold's diagrams

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.520
could be said to evolve in the
manner of a mathematical proof,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.950
not only each one
in and of itself,

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:23.320
but also in combination
with one another,

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.930
as a series that both
retraces and maps

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.360
out the course of
salvation history,

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.205
from past to present to future.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.680
Words used to describe the
diagrammatics of computer

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.090
graphics applied just as
well to Berthold's method.

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:43.680
Quote, "Here,
syntactic possibilities

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.320
extend into time
and space as they

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.620
define transposition
operations that

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.350
facilitate the dynamic
exploration of information.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.520
Information is entered,
or played against time.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.310
The analyst enters the
diagrammatic space,

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.410
and what was formerly
a snapshot now

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:04.007
becomes a flow of information."

00:56:06.387 --> 00:56:08.345
That's from an article
about computer graphics.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.730
As an historical form predicated
on dyadic relationships,

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:19.110
typology is fundamentally
diagrammatic in form.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.810
Figura, one of the terms
most commonly employed

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.990
in medieval sources
to designate diagrams,

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:26.940
carries within it
the connotations

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.910
of the typological figure,
which merely shadows

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:32.340
the truth, which, in
the fullness of time,

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.760
will be fully fleshed out.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.730
Berthold effectively fuses the
two connotations of the term--

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:43.470
the one, a geometrical figure,
the other, a prophetic image.

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:46.230
In keeping with the discourse
that identified Old Testament

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.710
prophecy as a mere foreshadowing
of Christian truth,

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.380
and the incarnation as
the ultimate authorization

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.650
of images, the diagram
prefigures and points

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.830
towards the visible and
necessary reality of Christ's

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.472
coming into the world.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.940
The first diagram of
the Marian treatise

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.750
offers an encapsulated
lesson in typology.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.760
It is also modeled
on that most familiar

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.840
of logical diagrams, the
square of opposition.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.670
Rooted in Aristotle's
distinction

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:22.330
between contradiction
and contrariety,

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.610
the square constituted
a fundamental part

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:27.300
of medieval teaching on logic.

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:31.000
Four concepts or propositions
are placed at the corners.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.570
The top pair, defining the
squares upper horizontal,

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:36.460
represents contrary terms.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.530
The bottom two,
the subcontraries.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:44.460
Each term at the bottom stands
as the subaltern in relation

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.610
to the term directly above
it along the vertical sides

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.320
of the square.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.660
The square was applied
to such standard topics

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.760
as the relations
of propositions,

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.880
the construction of
syllogisms, the mathematics

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.970
of musical intervals, and
the relationship of elements

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.130
within natural philosophy.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.280
In other words, it could be
found throughout the syllabus.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.260
The square, quite,
simply became part

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.640
of every student's toolkit.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.370
Diagrams such as the square
are neither illustrations

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.050
of the text which
they accompany,

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.960
nor mere adjuncts to argument.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.600
Rather, they are tools
with which to think,

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.080
and, in Berthold's hands,
with which to create.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.080
In this example, Adam,
at the upper left,

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.450
is the partner, yet
superior of the subaltern,

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:34.400
Eve, who by virtue of having
been formed from Adam's rib,

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.320
could be thought of
as literally being

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.710
but a part of her
male progenitor.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.960
In the case of Christ
and Mary, the diagram

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.200
posits the same relationship,
although in this instance,

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.230
just how one represents
the particular, the other

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:51.570
the universal, remains unclear.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:55.310
The efficacy of the diagram,
however, extends quite far.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:59.270
Adam supplies the contrary
of the new Adam, Christ.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.940
Moreover, Adam and Mary
like Christ and Eve,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.220
are contradictions
of one another.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.770
Transecting the simple
yet elegant image,

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.410
which is rooted in the chiastic
structure of the square

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:11.900
of opposition,
the bipartite tree

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:18.400
easily suggests both the tree of
life and the tree of knowledge.

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.620
By using logical
diagrams as his model--

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:24.140
others are based on
the Tree of Porphyry--

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.440
Berthold lends his
diagrammatic history

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.670
of salvation the force of
a logical demonstration.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:34.150
Moreover, he does so in keeping
with the pedagogic traditions

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:35.980
of his order.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.000
The square can be found
among the 29 illustrations

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.520
in a little book for the
consolation and instruction

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.390
of novices, dated around 1300.

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:48.580
Extant at a single
early 14th century

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.240
manuscript from the important
Dominican library at Toulouse,

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.320
its text nonetheless indicates
that it was approved in 1283

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.140
at the general chapter of
the order in Montpellier,

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.460
suggesting wider distribution.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:08.270
The anonymous author elaborates
his diagrammatic didacticism.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.500
"I therefore paint
here certain images

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.890
I made so that desolate novices
might find consolation in them

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:16.890
and so that a little flame of
newly fervent and more devout

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.890
devotion might be kindled
making perceptible matter

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.620
from celestial signification."

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.930
The images, the
diagrams included,

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:29.520
are intended to ignite
devotional desire.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.220
The novice is instructed
in great detail

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.970
in these necessary arguments,
not simply how to read,

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:40.370
but even how to lay out
the diagrams, step by step.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.540
What follows, however,
are not instructions

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.110
in how to use the diagram
to solve problems in logic,

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:50.960
but rather how to
apply a moral gloss.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.990
And this becomes clear in
the subsequent illustration,

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.790
in which process is key.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.720
The product of this procedure
is this the second diagram,

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.350
whose construction and meaning
the text explains at length.

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.740
Whereas the text asks
the reader to populate

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.780
the preexisting
diagram with scenes

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.730
from the parable of
Dives and Lazarus,

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.840
the miniature fleshes out the
image right before his eyes,

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.850
within an armature
that structures

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:20.300
the process of interpretation.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.990
And the relationship between the
various parts of the parallel

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.640
is mapped onto the
square of opposition.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.570
And I won't read you
the text at any length,

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.750
because the moralizing is,
as usual, rather dreary.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.080
Other works of the period,
Tomasin von Zerklaere's Der

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.290
welisch gast, a didactic work
in the vernacular addressed

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.780
to a literate,
aristocratic readership,

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.770
likewise assumes easy
familiarity with the square.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:57.570
You see an image from
one manuscript here.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:03.590
And so, to come full circle, and
I am approaching my conclusion.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.000
To come full circle,
we also find the square

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.730
embedded within the sacred
genealogy represented

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.220
by Peter of
Poitiers' Compendium,

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.200
here in the same
manuscript I showed you

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.000
at the beginning of this talk.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.020
And I don't think it's been
noticed before that Peter also

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.480
makes use of the
square of opposition.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.390
Techniques of representing
logical and genealogical

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.600
relationships overlap in
Peter's representation

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.440
of the complicated line
of descent from Solomon.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.720
To clarify these
tangled relationships,

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.030
and to make them
easier to remember,

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:42.710
Peter provides a diagram based
on the square of opposition.

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:47.330
Nathan and Melchi, the two
husbands in that order of Este,

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.990
placed at the center, occupy
the roundels constituting

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.750
the upper right and left
corners of the square.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:56.300
Whereas the sons of
each of those unions,

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.690
Jacob and Eli,
respectively, occupied those

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:02.300
at the lower right and left.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.070
Nathan and Jacob represent
the direct line of descent

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:10.350
indicated by the thick red
line, which connects Nathan

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:15.000
to his ancestor, Solomon, above,
and to his descendant, Joseph,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.280
below.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.220
The horizontal bar
connecting the two fathers

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.660
reads, "connected because
killed," a reference to Melchi

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.320
having succeeded Nathan,
following the latter's

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.560
death as Este's wife.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.330
Mapped onto the
square of opposition,

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.390
their relationship is contrary,
insofar as they cannot have

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:38.750
been married to the same
woman simultaneously.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:42.710
The bar connecting Eli and
Jacob, the two sons, reads,

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:45.970
uterine brothers, identifying
them as stepbrother's

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.170
by the same mother.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:50.520
Mapped onto the square
in the same fashion,

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.930
their relationship, analogous
to that of their fathers', is

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:55.790
subcontrary.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.520
The vertical lines
connecting fathers and sons

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.850
read, carnal sons, the
equivalent in the square

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.070
to subalternation.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:07.730
Finally, the diagonals linking
the two fathers via Este

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:11.150
to the two sons,
read, conjugal son.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.330
These represent the lines
of contradiction connecting

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:18.320
the corners, in that Nathan
is not the father of Eli,

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.330
and Melchi, in turn, is
not the father of Jacob.

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.050
And if you don't remember
that, the square of opposition

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.690
would provide you with a
handy little mnemonic device

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:34.080
in order to do so.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.850
It is time to steer
toward some conclusions.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:42.320
What better way to work them
out than in an imagined diagram?

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.400
I envisage not a line,
leading either forward

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.830
from the Middle
Ages to modernity,

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:52.370
or backwards from the present
to the past, but rather

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:56.100
a parallelogram, in which
analogous relationships undergo

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.720
similar shifts, if
to different ends.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.060
Whether medieval
or modern, diagrams

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.960
mix modes of expression,
visual and verbal.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.210
Diagrams are not
only conceptual,

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:10.340
they are also material.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.800
Process is not only
part of their making,

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.960
but also their meaning.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.680
Diagrams do not simply
reflect or embody ideas,

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.240
they shape them.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.640
And beyond ideas, they move like
machines, to encourage action.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.770
Diagrams are relational.

01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:31.130
And very often, as in the
case of Robanus and Berthold,

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.080
they are serial.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.060
As for Berthold,
his way of thinking

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.270
about the history of
salvation, typology,

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.750
which pairs Christian event
to Old Testament prophecy,

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.240
and uses geometry to
lend those pairings

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.030
the character of a
demonstrative proof,

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.660
is fundamentally diagrammatic.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.800
Whether looking at
modern or medieval art,

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.020
one can ask the same question.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.110
Why resort to diagrammatic
modes of representation

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.890
in the first place?

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.760
The answers, whether to
demonstrate cosmic harmony,

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.210
provoke visions, understand the
prophetic course of salvation

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:08.630
history, or, in the case
of more modern examples,

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.050
to disrupt established
social codes,

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.090
will differ dramatically.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.340
One thing, however,
remains constant.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.850
The diagram, on its
face a cold abstraction,

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.550
permits one to delve
into the desires that

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:25.160
informed its makers.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.440
In this respect,
diagrams themselves

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.350
map what is perhaps the
primary point of intersection

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.440
between the technical
and the cultural.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.220
Icons, once a source of mystery,
have become as commonplace

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.200
as a computer screen.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.820
The internet and
the worldwide web

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.240
purport to displace traditional
centers and hierarchies

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.630
in favor of rhizomatic,
distributed networks--

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:49.940
in effect, diagrams
or systems best

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.940
understood in terms of diagrams.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.730
Of this desire
disruption, bitcoin

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:58.640
is a paradigmatic example.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.320
Taken together,
such developments

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.000
have transformed not only
academia, but also society.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.770
And in the age of
social networks,

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.260
human actors
themselves have become

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:14.060
diagrams, defined less in terms
of a stable, autonomous self--

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.160
if any such thing ever existed--

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.380
than of a system
of relationships

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.320
that go by the name of networks.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.230
It is no less the case
that the algorithm, which

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.500
even if not a diagram in
itself is best understood

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.190
in diagrammatic terms, has,
in a manner of speaking,

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:34.880
become the platonic form
of everyday existence, both

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.890
underlying and informing the
reality of contemporary life.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:42.590
Diagrams are central to
all those disciplines

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:45.260
which deal with the
visualization of knowledge,

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.860
as well as, no less important,
the critical discourses

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.230
that consider the
impact of modern media

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:54.320
on ourselves and on our society.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.340
As more and more forms of social
interaction become networked,

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.970
and as all human activity comes
to be defined in terms of links

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:05.420
within a larger web,
our world and ourselves

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:09.155
increasingly come to resemble
the mechanics of a diagram.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:14.390
What, one might reasonably
ask, does any of this

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.670
have to do with the Middle Ages?

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.370
One way in which medieval art
resonates with the present

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:22.520
is that much, although
not all of it,

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.490
is fundamentally diagrammatic.

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:28.550
In lieu of linear or continuous
narrative of a kind brought

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.149
to perfection in antiquity,
medieval art, so much of which

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:37.010
is predicated on typology,
lends itself to demonstrative,

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:41.189
didactic, and diagrammatic
modes of image making.

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:43.609
The complex armatures
of stained glass windows

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:46.040
provide only the
most obvious example.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.750
Cathedral facades are another.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.689
Medieval authors
and artists seized

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:53.270
upon traditions of scientific
illustration rooted

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:56.270
in antiquity to create
complex representations

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.760
of Christian cosmology.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.979
These, in turn,
often imbued ornament

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:04.340
with cosmological significance.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.279
Medieval art is not
simply symbolic, abstract,

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:10.729
an anti-naturalistic, it is
structured and systematic

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.979
in its approach to
representing a world which

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:17.420
it perceived as being
highly structured in itself.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.370
History, far from
being open-ended,

01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.939
had a structure-- one that could
be investigated and manifested

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:25.340
in the language of geometry.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.000
There was, however, no single,
medieval Weltanschauung.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.330
Multiple theologies,
cosmologies, and epistemologies

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.560
competed, and
continued to compete

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.160
to claim the mantle of
just interpretation.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.800
It is within this contested
field, modern as well as

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.080
medieval, linking
diagrams to thought

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.979
in the search for truth,
that the subject of diagrams

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:50.910
and the diagrammatic in
the Middle Ages and--

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.260
sorry.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.920
It is within this contested
field, modern as well

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.380
as medieval, linking
diagrams to thought

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.860
and the search for truth,
that the subject of diagrams

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.040
and the diagrammatic in
the Middle Ages and beyond

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.260
becomes so compelling.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.644
Thank you.

01:10:08.644 --> 01:10:13.514
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.360
I realize time is
getting on, but I

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:34.420
would love to entertain some
questions, if there are any.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.062
Don't be shy.

01:10:35.062 --> 01:10:37.062
And I'll just say, there
are microphones to use.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.770
I started with this image
of a medieval classroom

01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:58.780
with two Greek
students discussing

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:02.500
the proverbial problem
of squaring the circle--

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.200
it's from a 13th century
English manuscript--

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.990
to picture the dialogue
that I hoped we would have.

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.770
So you can't disappointment me.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:17.680
In your last slide, if you
could go back to you last slide?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.370
By all means.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:18.970
Just a moment.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.420
Actually, this
was my last slide.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.870
But we can go.

01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.320
This one.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.060
No, the square.

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.860
With a cross.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.360
This?

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.340
Yeah.

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.900
On the left.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.360
Is there is a story
embedded in the square?

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.135
It's not prose.

01:11:43.135 --> 01:11:43.635
It's a poem.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:53.850
In one of the many Latin meters
that Robanus Maurus employed.

01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:57.090
And the way these
picture poems work,

01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:58.290
it's quite mind boggling--

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.690
I think of them as a
combination between the world's

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.890
most complex crossword
puzzle and sudoko--

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:08.190
is that the text can
be read continuously

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.810
from left to right,
top to bottom,

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:11.880
the way you would
read a normal text.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.610
And it reads as Latin verse.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:18.000
But you can also read
the so-called in-text.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.180
That is, the text
within the figures--

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.940
in this case, a simple cross--

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.960
as independent verses
in their own right.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.660
This is one of the simpler
examples in the work.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.240
In other words, some letters
serve a double purpose.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.060
They make sense within two
different semantic units,

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.810
which are superimposed
one upon the other.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:49.860
And very often, the arrangement
of words and letters

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:55.470
is governed by very complex
numerological considerations.

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:58.440
It's quite mind
boggling, how anyone

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.700
could produce such a thing.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.010
But as we know from
concrete poetry,

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:10.030
and poets like Mallarme,
or Apollinaire,

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:12.810
there's a long, long
tradition, not only in

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:15.660
the west but also in
the Greek tradition,

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:19.140
and in other cultures as
well, of picture poems.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.540
Poems that double as
text and as image.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.830
A famous example within
English literature

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:28.590
would be George Herbert,
in the 17th century.

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:32.550
If you look at some of the poems
in his collection, The Temple,

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.770
they take the form
of picture poems.

01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:38.290
Does that answer your question?

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:39.270
Yeah.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:45.460
It reminded me of
a word crossword,

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.380
where you have to
find the word with--

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:47.900
Yes.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.330
Well.

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:54.860
These works are not designed to
be understood at first glance.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.710
They're designed to be
meditated on at great length,

01:13:57.710 --> 01:13:59.960
in true monastic tradition.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.705
Irene, did you have a question?

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:05.180
I'm pondering it still.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:08.150
When you discussed Peirce--

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:08.730
Sorry.

01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.150
When you discussed Peirce,
you used the word, model.

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:15.780
And how a model
relates to a diagram.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.350
Might be, perhaps, unpacked
a bit further by you.

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:23.940
But also, it occurred to me
that there is a difference

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.040
between a model and a metaphor.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.370
And to the extent that a
diagram can be read as metaphor

01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:32.520
or as model, it would make
an interesting distinction.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.350
I wonder what your thoughts are.

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:40.620
Yes, well, I am not
going to be categorical.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.590
Because in some ways I'm more
interested in the slippage

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:48.720
between those two
types, or categories.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.400
I think the case
of Peirce-- and I

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.000
don't claim to have
read everything

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.330
that Peirce wrote that is
directly relevant to the topic,

01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:00.630
let alone have understood it--
but I think in Peirce's case,

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:04.620
he very much wants it
to be model or form,

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.860
but very often it
slips into metaphor,

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.800
in ways that he finds
deeply unsettling.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.240
One of the things I find so
fascinating about the drawings

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.390
in his manuscripts, which have
only recently begun to receive

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:22.470
any kind of attention, as in
so many other cases, editions

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:25.920
of texts, the drawings, the
diagrams, the marginalia,

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.530
simply get edited out.

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:33.210
But one could make
the case that they

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:36.270
are, as it were, the
unconscious of his text.

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:40.560
Although I think he was very
much aware of the problems.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.390
And so the drawings,
as I said, I

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:47.370
think produce metaphoric
nightmares for him.

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:49.770
Even though he insists
that he dreams only

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:53.100
in algebra, which I find one of
the most remarkable statements

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.000
I've ever read.

01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:59.560
Obviously, I could go further.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.180
But I think that debate as to
whether diagrams are models

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.760
and metaphors, is in part,
for example, the debate that

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.850
has played out in the
history of mathematics,

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:12.100
from the mid-19th century.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.220
And in both mathematics
and philosophy,

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.690
there was a desire exemplified
by logicians such as Frege,

01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:21.490
and mathematicians
such as Hilbert.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:26.830
And I would never claim that I
understand their mathematics.

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:34.900
But they rejected geometry
and diagrams 100%.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.260
They wanted to convert all of
mathematical representation

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.100
into algebra.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:48.150
And since-- I would say--

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:52.390
well, it's really co-equal
with the advent of computers.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.840
Diagrams have, of course,
made a tremendous comeback,

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.290
not simply as practical
tools, but also

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:04.480
as legitimate vehicles for
philosophical and mathematical

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.830
analysis.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.970
And so there is this debate
amongst mathematicians,

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:18.040
historians of mathematics,
but also cognitive scientists,

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.580
as to the validity of diagrams.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:26.230
To what extent they
represent thought processes,

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:29.080
model thought processes,
or are merely metaphors

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.730
for thought processes.

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.090
I don't claim to
have the answer.

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:34.870
Yeah, Robin.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.900
Thank you, Jeffrey, for
that wonderful talk.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:48.610
It may be fanciful,
but I've long

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:55.990
wondered whether part
of Peirce's addiction

01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:00.880
to the triadic
notion of semiosis

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.400
was related to the fact that
he spent decades working

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.340
for the US Coastal Survey,
and engaged in triangulation

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.410
as a matter of daily practice.

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.760
So I'm wondering if you
have any speculations

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.080
about the relationship between
the diagrammatic impulses

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.900
in the Middle Ages
and to other practices

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:27.010
outside these beautiful
works that you're showing us,

01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:29.560
whether liturgical
practices or what

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.730
have you, that might shed some
light on the diagrams we're

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:34.810
seeing?

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:40.360
Thank you for that
wonderful question, Robin.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.570
I'm trying to think on my feet.

01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:47.140
In Peirce's case,
he was certainly

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.560
obsessed with
triads, which is why

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.280
I relish that detail of his
conversion from Unitarianism

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.190
to Trinitarianism.

01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:59.380
I'm not sure what is
cause and what is effect.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.220
Although the phenomenon you
point out-- surely those years

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.420
of working in the Survey
ingrained certain habits

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.040
of mind, that could have
had a powerful impact,

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.510
or formative impact, on
his patterns of thinking.

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:19.720
Your question makes
me think of a concept

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.420
rather like Baxandall's
"period eye."

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:26.080
For those of you who've read
his book on art and experience

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.580
in Renaissance Italy,
there's a famous passage

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.010
in that book in which
he talks about barrel

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:36.190
making, and barrel gauging
in Renaissance Florence.

01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:40.540
And he argues that the way in
which 15th century mercantile

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:45.910
patrons would have sized up,
to use the term advisedly,

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:49.270
would have sized up the
volumetric representation

01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:53.350
of objects in three dimensional
space and in perspective

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:58.530
was conditioned by the
tools of their trades.

01:20:01.231 --> 01:20:02.980
I mean, one of the
problems with Baxandall

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.660
is that you never
quite know where

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:09.310
to draw the line in
defining the period eye.

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:13.570
In terms of the-- guess the
case that I'm making here,

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:17.770
and more extensively in
the book I've written,

01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:21.400
is that that practice is logic.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:27.670
And if one reads the history
of diagrams in the Middle Ages,

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:30.280
there is some attention
given to logical diagrams.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:34.090
For example, if you read
John Murdock's amazing book,

01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:36.550
The Album of Science-- he was
an historian of science here

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:39.400
at Harvard--

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.600
still, by far, the best
book on medieval diagrams.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.750
He has a chapter devoted
to logical diagrams,

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:50.230
but there is no attempt
to think of logic diagrams

01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:52.570
and the patterns of
thought that they represent

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:56.290
as exemplary, or as
models for other systems

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.000
of representation.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.650
Whereas part of what
I want to argue,

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:04.360
and I tried to
demonstrate it briefly,

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.700
is that you have an
historian and theologian,

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.260
like Peter of Poitiers, who's
using logical diagrams as a way

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.270
of structuring his works.

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.310
You have Berthold
of Nuremberg who's

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:20.410
making extensive use of
porphyrion logic diagrams,

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:24.190
and the square of opposition,
to structure his diagrams

01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:26.680
as an exegetical tool.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.860
So I don't I don't know if
the realm of logic and logic

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:36.710
diagrams is far enough outside,
to answer your question.

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:39.550
But that's the answer with which
I'm comfortable at this point.

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:40.960
I think part of
what I want to do

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.830
is argue that logic,
and the modes of thought

01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:46.810
and representation
associated with it,

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:50.650
are paradigmatic when it comes
to diagrams, to a greater

01:21:50.650 --> 01:21:53.930
extent than has been argued.

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:57.130
So for example, if you
think of the famous diagram

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:00.190
of the triangle
representing the Trinity.

01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:03.550
That is a logic diagram,
because the various corners

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:07.240
are connected by the
words, est, non est--

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.220
is and is not.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.570
So it's dealing-- it's a kind
of triangle of oppositions.

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:15.940
So that's about the
best answer, for now,

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:17.760
I can get to your question.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.260
Yes.

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:24.000
I believe, in the case
of logical diagrams,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.550
it would be appropriate to
distinguish the mnemonic tools,

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:34.180
if you like, like logical
square, and on the other hand,

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.500
in your presentation, you
had also Venn diagrams.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:43.570
Venn diagrams, semantic
tableaux, kernel maps,

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:46.690
are more than visual tools.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:52.690
They are demonstrative,
and deductive, it you like,

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:54.910
artifacts that can be used.

01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:57.970
So this is a distinction.

01:22:57.970 --> 01:23:02.410
And mind maps more
for, if you like,

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:05.130
brainstorming and
creative usage.

01:23:05.130 --> 01:23:06.370
Which are also--

01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:07.240
Yes.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.120
Yes, I think that's an
important distinction.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.520
But of course, one
of the reasons why--

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.210
if I remember my history
of logic correctly--

01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:20.380
one of the reasons why
Peirce worked so obsessively

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.450
on his existential
graphs, is because he

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:25.480
felt that there were
problems with Venn diagrams,

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.840
and he wanted to
improve on that system.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.690
And recently, there's
an historian--

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:35.770
not an historian-- a logician
at Yale who has written

01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:42.750
on Peirce's existential graphs,
with a view to demonstrating,

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.980
or trying to demonstrate
to her satisfaction--

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.680
I've forgotten her
name for the moment--

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.690
that Peirce's system
actually is an improvement.

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:54.350
And that it works.

01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:58.990
Again, I am not
sufficiently sophisticated

01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:02.470
in order to come to any
final judgment myself.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:05.830
But the fact that
such a debate exists

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:10.150
demonstrates that logicians
themselves continue

01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.670
to grapple with the
question, to what degree

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:17.110
a diagram has probative value.

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:19.060
For example, in the
history of mathematics,

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:21.000
there are debates about Euclid.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.240
And there is a lively
literature arguing

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.180
against those who have taken
the position that Euclid's

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:32.050
diagrams are problematic.

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.720
That they do not actually
prove the propositions

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.540
they supposedly demonstrate.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.430
And yet recently, there are
historians of mathematics

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:42.089
who have made that case.

01:24:42.089 --> 01:24:43.630
Now as for the square
of opposition--

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.921
and this is perhaps the last
thing I'll say in response

01:24:45.921 --> 01:24:50.800
to your very important
distinction--

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.420
the square of
opposition was long

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.650
written off as a kind
of simplistic tool

01:24:56.650 --> 01:25:02.490
for novices in logic,
despite the fact

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:04.410
that, well into
the modern period,

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:12.560
it was of such importance in
the syllabus and curriculum.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.150
But even the square
of opposition

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:17.030
is making a comeback.

01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:22.520
And there have been conferences
with hundreds of contributions

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.340
devoted to the
square of opposition

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.980
and its various applications.

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.480
So without wanting to
adjudicate beyond my ken,

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.800
it's interesting that,
as in the case of Euclid,

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.380
so too in the case
of the square.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.070
There are now some
logicians who argue

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:45.020
that a case can be made for
it, in certain contexts.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:48.410
I hope that goes some way
to answering your question.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:51.340
Yes, Dan.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:56.090
Well, let me thank you again for
that wonderful and stimulating

01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:57.110
talk.

01:25:57.110 --> 01:26:00.470
I would like to pick up on a
detail from Robin's question

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.120
and push it in a
different direction,

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.360
because you began
with a T-O map.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.150
And early on, you
had a map of, I

01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:12.671
think it was from Matthew
Paris, with a flap extending up.

01:26:12.671 --> 01:26:13.170
Yes.

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:16.130
And it raised a
question for me about,

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:19.520
what is the relationship
between the map and the diagram?

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.240
Is one a subset of the other?

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.800
Is there an easy overlap
between those two?

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.574
What other plans do
you have this evening?

01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:29.731
Dinner.

01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:30.230
Yes.

01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:32.960
Me too.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:38.000
That's an exceptionally
fraught question.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.570
Obviously, if you think of
a kind of sliding scale,

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:45.680
there's a point at which
maps become diagrammatic,

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.920
and at which some diagrams
become cartographic.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.110
And they both deal
with spatiality,

01:26:52.110 --> 01:26:54.650
in some ways that are related.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.630
Some people have said that,
unlike diagrams, maps have

01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:04.740
real reference in the world.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:10.180
And again, I don't want
to seem like a cop out,

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.690
but I think that I would
have to take it on a case

01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:16.760
by case basis.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.270
I mean, maps are fascinating
in that, as we all know,

01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:23.270
there's something
arbitrary about any form

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:27.210
of cartographic representation.

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:28.910
And that's why I
used the comparison

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:32.300
to talk about a kind
of Weltanschauung.

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.420
Medieval maps happen to
be, for the most part,

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.670
exceptionally diagrammatic.

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.910
I'm not sure I would call
Google Maps diagrammatic,

01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:43.960
although, if you
look at the under--

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.620
if you could strip
away the imagery,

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:50.210
and look at the
underlying software--

01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:55.910
that again, without
knowing what that is--

01:27:55.910 --> 01:28:00.290
but I imagine that if you
stripped the images away,

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:05.150
and could just see how
it works, whether it's

01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:06.950
based on algorithms
or whether it's

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:12.770
based on certain kinds
of projective geometry,

01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:15.650
that it is fundamentally
diagrammatic as well.

01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:21.990
Yes.

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:23.050
Thank you very much.

01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:26.130
Actually, you just answered
the first half of my question

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:29.550
about the difference
between diagram and map.

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:32.720
I guess my other question
was, what happened?

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.750
What was the afterlife of
the circling of the square?

01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:38.790
Of course, it is a very--

01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.760
I haven't solved the problem.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.800
It's a very, very
important figure

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.130
for writers, such as Dante, of
course, and so on and so forth.

01:28:47.130 --> 01:28:50.250
And it persists as
a figure of thought

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:52.350
into the Renaissance period.

01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:54.270
And I was just
wondering whether it

01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.840
was absorbed, since
it stopped being

01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.880
represented diagrammatically.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.740
Was it absorbed by
some other media?

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:06.300
Well, again, I seem to be
answering every question

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.650
by saying, I don't know.

01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:11.850
But I imagine
that, if one looked

01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:19.020
through the very extensive
corpus of school books

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.160
and treatises about pedagogy
and the seven liberal arts,

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.510
that one might find and prints
some representations of it.

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:30.330
But that I don't--

01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:31.390
that I don't know.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:36.770
Obviously, the notion
of squaring the circle

01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:38.270
has become proverbial.

01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:42.540
To that extent, it's
survived as the problem

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.690
that is impossible to solve.

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:50.150
Although, of course, calculus
makes it a little bit easier.

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.520
I should let all of you
know that I virtually failed

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.960
mathematics in high school.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:57.350
So I feel I'm really
skating on thin ice.

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:02.000
But that's also part of what has
made this line of investigation

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.170
so fascinating for me.

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:05.960
You know, better
late than never.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:13.340
So the image I showed you of the
two figures engaged in debate,

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:18.740
brandishing their
squared circles,

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.830
that's an unusual image.

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:25.170
There is a whole iconography
of the classroom in the Middle

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:25.670
Ages.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:29.090
And Laura Cleaver has recently
written an interesting book

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:33.210
precisely on that subject.

01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:37.370
But it's not as if there
was a pictorial tradition

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:38.840
of illustrating that problem.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.580
Of course, there are
many medieval images

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:44.500
that consist of a circle
or circles in a square.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.170
I could show you
those ad infinitum.

01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:50.090
In multiple media.

01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:56.390
And that geometry is more
than just a decorative device,

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.550
or a framing device.

01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:02.720
Although frames are of critical
importance in medieval art,

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.180
it is a way of imposing a kind--

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.710
or implying a kind of
cosmological order.

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.390
I'm afraid beyond
that, I'm not sure I

01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:13.200
can answer your question.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:13.700
Yeah.

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.460
Gina?

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.119
Thank you, Jeffrey.

01:31:18.119 --> 01:31:18.910
That was wonderful.

01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:20.950
And I am sure I can
ask you a question

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:23.200
that you will know
the answer to.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.300
That is, sort of following up
on the questions about, I guess,

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:31.990
imagery, this
diagrammatic impulse--

01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:35.260
and you put up how figuration
and diagrammatic impulse

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.990
go together in Berthold's case.

01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:40.090
And I wonder if there
is ever a sort of impact

01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:42.100
on artistic practice itself.

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:46.010
That the images of
figuration actually

01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:50.720
get, like diagrammatic impulse,
translated into it, in a way?

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.870
I'm just coming from
a tradition-- thinking

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:57.370
about a tradition that develops
am iconometric system that

01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:00.430
sort of transposes that
diagrammatic thinking

01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:01.960
onto the body?

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.382
So human figures and
figurative representation.

01:32:04.382 --> 01:32:05.340
Well, it's interesting.

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.680
If we were to page through
Villard de Honnecourt's

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.810
so-called sketchbook--
it's not a sketch book.

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:13.690
It's not even
really a model book.

01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:15.880
You would find
many stick figures

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.530
based on geometric figures.

01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:19.120
And there, clearly,
it's being used

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.660
as a mnemonic device for
craftsmen to generate figures,

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:28.870
or to remember how to
produce a certain figure.

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:30.850
Architecture becomes
very problematic,

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:34.300
but I think it's fair to say--

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:39.010
setting aside symbolic geometry,
which is often very difficult

01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:41.610
to establish, much
as scholars like

01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:44.170
to project it onto buildings--

01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:50.950
geometry plays a generative
role in medieval architecture.

01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:55.390
And certainly, in
medieval images.

01:32:55.390 --> 01:33:00.550
Just the tools they
used-- ruler, compass.

01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:03.310
It lent itself to
geometric armatures.

01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.880
But those armatures also
served as mnemonic devices.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.600
But more important,
I think, as I

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.620
received way of generating
variations on a theme.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.330
In the case of
manuscripts, of course,

01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.950
you have the ruling on the page.

01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:22.720
And even the pages that
have illuminations on them,

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.720
as received by the
painter, they're already

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.290
ruled, because these
craftsmen or scribe who

01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:31.870
did the ruling didn't
know, in most cases, where

01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:32.980
the pictures would fall.

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:38.830
And artists do use that ruling
as a matrix for their pictures.

01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:40.750
Not always, but
very, very often one

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:43.930
can show, even in the
later Middle Ages,

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:46.960
where illuminators are using
more naturalistic modes

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.640
of representation, that they
are employing the underlying

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:58.070
ruling as a kind of
pre-established graph paper,

01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:00.100
if you will.

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:00.600
Yeah.

01:34:03.486 --> 01:34:04.390
Yeah, Rosha?

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.980
Thanks, Jeffrey, for
this inspiring talk.

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:10.530
I'm so looking
forward to the book.

01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:15.160
There's a solid Jeffrey
bookshelf in my office.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.530
So, especially in
the case of Berthold,

01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:21.820
as you have beautifully
showed and argued,

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:26.080
there's this shift towards
anthropomorphization,

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.000
from the cross to the crucifix.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.760
And it strikes me that
Berthold's diagrams

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.809
are so figurative, and
that's part of his time.

01:34:33.809 --> 01:34:35.100
That's part of the development.

01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:36.950
I understand that.

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:41.740
But my question is
the underlying metric

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.090
is still the cross, isn't it?

01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:45.520
So it still goes back to that.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.770
But then, how does
script come into it?

01:34:47.770 --> 01:34:51.490
So is it also script that
makes, especially when we

01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:57.010
look at this image, makes
it a mnemonic diagram?

01:34:57.010 --> 01:35:00.370
So my question, I
guess, is what's

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:04.900
the relationship between
figurative representation

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.891
and script?

01:35:05.891 --> 01:35:06.390
Yeah.

01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:07.500
Well--

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.571
That's huge, I know.

01:35:08.571 --> 01:35:09.070
No, no.

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:13.490
But a lot of these images do
involve changing constellations

01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:17.250
of word and image.

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:19.990
And as you say, that's huge.

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:22.880
To indulge in a really
gross generalization,

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.950
you could say that the history
of medieval art, certainly

01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:29.110
from the Carolingian
period onward,

01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:31.120
in which text and
image are fused

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.090
in a variety of
very formative ways,

01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:38.070
historiated initials
first appear

01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:40.410
in the Carolingian period.

01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:44.280
These picture poems are
another salient example.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.280
That the whole history of
medieval art from that point

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.050
forward involves a gradual
teasing out, and separation

01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:52.920
of the two elements.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.620
So that by the Gothic period,
for example, text and image

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:03.150
have largely, if
not entirely, been

01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:06.060
extricated from one another.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.300
Of course, you find historiated
initials in the Gothic period,

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:13.860
but not in the way
that one would, say,

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.420
in Romanesque manuscripts.

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.580
And then, of course,
by the 15th century,

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:20.430
you can think of
book illustration,

01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:24.180
in a way rather similar to the
way in which we still think

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:29.970
of book illustration, with
text and image divorced

01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:35.680
from one another, but
still related in some ways.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.390
To take this particular
example, the inscriptions

01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:43.530
here are selected verses
from the carmina figurata,

01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:47.850
from the picture
poems of Robanus.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:54.600
Sometimes abbreviated,
but they're actually

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.640
incorporated in some cases
in rather awkward ways.

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.840
They're simply placed
around the images,

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.800
wherever he can fit them in.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:15.428
And that awkwardness actually
attests to this disintegration

01:37:15.428 --> 01:37:17.474
of the two media.

01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:24.100
Yes, at the back?

01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:27.637
Yeah, hi.

01:37:27.637 --> 01:37:29.970
You said a thing earlier that
I thought was interesting.

01:37:29.970 --> 01:37:33.330
You said you were interested in
the slippage between metaphor

01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:34.530
and model.

01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:37.030
And it reminded me of--

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:40.270
you also mentioned Deleuze a
lot, which I commend you for.

01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:42.000
Deleuze has this
concept, you know,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.920
of abstract machines, where
you sort of take a concept,

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.640
or a logic that normally
wouldn't apply in another area,

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.160
and you map it onto
another area, just

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.785
to see what you sort
of get out of it.

01:37:54.785 --> 01:37:56.160
And so I'm wondering
if there are

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.245
any historical
examples of people

01:37:58.245 --> 01:37:59.370
doing that sort of a thing.

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:01.430
Not like concepts,
like Deleuze does.

01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:03.390
Like, you know,
he'll use concrete.

01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:06.107
But people forget the
concrete was in liquid form

01:38:06.107 --> 01:38:07.690
before it's formed,
and so people will

01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:08.940
be like, this isn't concrete.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.770
That sounds like fluid.

01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:14.160
Do people do anything like
that, that you know of,

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.670
with pictorial
diagram explicitly?

01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:19.680
To be productive
with their diagrams,

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.600
in that sort of a way?

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.090
If that makes sense.

01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:27.440
Medieval thinkers could
be very, very playful

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.126
in speculative ways.

01:38:30.126 --> 01:38:31.500
You know, witness
the discussions

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.170
of what would have
happened if you assume

01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:37.260
the complete free
will of God, and if he

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.245
had come to save mankind
in the form of an ass,

01:38:40.245 --> 01:38:42.160
instead of a man.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.700
So they weren't beyond
entertaining wild hypotheticals

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.901
in order to make certain
kinds of arguments.

01:38:52.901 --> 01:38:54.650
They occasionally got
in trouble for that.

01:38:54.650 --> 01:39:00.380
But I think to that
extent, Deleuze

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:04.880
and the typical medieval
thinker are really

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.060
very, very different.

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:14.590
In that, as I
understand him, Deleuze

01:39:14.590 --> 01:39:18.460
is always interested in
that kind of disruption

01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:21.370
and in breaking
down of hierarchies.

01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:24.550
That's why he attacks the tree
as opposed to the rhizome,

01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:28.480
and the tree is perhaps
the archetypal metaphor

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:31.120
diagram of the Middle Ages.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.090
There's a wonderful article by--

01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:36.430
or essay by Umberto
Eco, by the way,

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.470
called, "From Tree
to Labyrinth,"

01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:42.400
which explores very much the
same set of ideas, in, I think,

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.510
very brilliant ways.

01:39:52.072 --> 01:39:54.880
I was thinking-- if
I could help at all--

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.964
Sure.

01:39:55.964 --> 01:39:58.770
Because Deleuze says that the
point of philosophy is to--

01:39:58.770 --> 01:40:01.170
like, what philosophers do,
and the point of philosophy

01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:03.040
is to create concepts.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.620
And he has a few
parts where he also

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.210
says that sometimes
you need a tree

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:08.160
and other times
you need a rhizome.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.260
So I think he's doing more
of like a differential,

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.380
or binary sort of thing there,
than just privileging one

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.052
over the other.

01:40:14.052 --> 01:40:15.510
And so I guess I
was just wondering

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:18.990
if there would be a medieval
example of someone taking,

01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:21.210
just, like, some crazy--

01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.000
I don't know-- botanical
drawing, and then saying like,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.850
well, now, let's see
how this explains--

01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:27.490
Well I think--

01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:28.740
Makes sense of something else.

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.185
I think you could make the
case that a medieval thinker

01:40:31.185 --> 01:40:33.690
or artist could press
just about anything

01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:36.870
into a diagrammatic mode.

01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:40.860
And again, speaking in terms
of gross generalizations,

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:43.020
I would argue that, as
opposed to narrative,

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:50.460
as opposed to even allegory,
that the diagrammatic

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:53.040
is perhaps the dominant
mode in medieval art.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.260
And I'm not the
first to say that.

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.280
Others have pointed
that out as well.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.490
They've also made the
connection with typology

01:40:59.490 --> 01:41:00.900
as a mode of thought.

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.450
I'm not sure I agree with
you completely about Deleuze,

01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:07.020
although I expect
you're more widely read

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.990
than I am in his works.

01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:14.970
But if you read that
introductory section

01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:23.280
of his text on the rhizome,
it's just a scathing attack

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.790
and criticism of all
forms of, you might say,

01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:29.490
arboreal thought.

01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:33.600
I think it's meant to be
deeply, deeply subversive,

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.920
in a way that I think
is unthinkable for most

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.030
medieval authors.

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:46.390
But certainly, in
the same way that,

01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:48.580
you know, in the Dada
diagram that I showed you.

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.090
If you read Joselit's
analysis of those diagrams,

01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:54.700
he makes the case that
their agenda was, again,

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.800
fundamentally subversive
and disruptive

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.960
of established social norms.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.460
That's just not the way
that medieval art works,

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:03.820
in most cases.

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:07.330
I nonetheless think that
it's very instructive

01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:12.610
to apply the thinking of some
of these modern philosophers

01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:14.020
to the medieval works.

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.323
And vice versa.

01:42:15.323 --> 01:42:16.676
Yeah.

01:42:16.676 --> 01:42:17.175
Thanks.

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:22.958
I don't want to keep
anybody from their dinner.

01:42:22.958 --> 01:42:23.458
Yes.

01:42:23.458 --> 01:42:27.680
One more question at the back?

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.700
A very short question.

01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:31.580
You mentioned shortly--
or you spoke mostly

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.520
on two-dimensional diagrams,
and mentioned shortly

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.434
the three-dimensional diagrams.

01:42:36.434 --> 01:42:38.600
And I was wondering what
about the fourth dimension?

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.830
What about the movement
or the temporality?

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:44.240
How does that come into
play in reading diagrams,

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.000
or in creating diagrams,
or could even a movement

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.670
be part of a diagram?

01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:50.720
That would be my question.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.830
Absolutely.

01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:56.060
In terms of the thought process
itself as being processual.

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.100
In terms of the
making of the diagram,

01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.530
obviously, there's
a temporal aspect.

01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:03.950
And in the Dominican treatise
that I referred to, at the end,

01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:06.342
it tells you step by step,
how to draw the diagram,

01:43:06.342 --> 01:43:08.300
and it could have been
done in a different way.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:11.060
But he allegorizes the
process of drawing it.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.310
Having told you how
to do it, because he

01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:15.770
wants you to think
of its construction

01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:18.110
in a particular way.

01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:22.610
The element of time
is what fundamentally

01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:25.370
distinguishes Berthold's
rewriting of the work.

01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:27.380
You could say, again
speaking crudely,

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.950
that whereas Robanus's work
is centered on the cross,

01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:35.570
and everything means the cross,
and in a sense it's atemporal,

01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:39.680
it's eternal, Berthold's
is put into the model

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.890
of salvation history.

01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:43.470
And that's why he has
to completely reorder

01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:44.810
Robanus's structure.

01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:49.190
Because, as a 13th
century Dominican,

01:43:49.190 --> 01:43:52.310
he's interested in salvation
history, and in time,

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.060
and in history in ways
that Robanus simply wasn't.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.040
And he's interested
in images in a way

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.200
that Robanus
couldn't be, because

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.371
of the context of
iconoclastic debates.

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.620
And then, as I tried to show
in the Peter of Poitiers,

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:11.750
where you have a timeline,
the temporal element

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:13.940
is inscribed within the work.

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.700
But I don't even think you need
to stop with four dimensions.

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.540
I mean, since I
mentioned David Hilbert,

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:21.650
you know, he's most famous for
so-called Hilbert spaces, which

01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:24.140
can involve an infinite
number of dimensions.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.930
Which I gather is why Hilbert
spaces are of such interest

01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:29.270
to physicists and
string theorists.

01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:31.910
Don't ask me any questions.

01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:38.960
But there you're dealing
with, as it were, diagrams

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.500
in an infinite number of
dimensions, of vector spaces,

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.180
and an infinite
number of dimensions.

01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.670
And now I'm really talking about
something I know nothing about.

01:44:49.670 --> 01:44:51.670
So thank you very
much to you all.

01:44:51.670 --> 01:44:55.620
[APPLAUSE]
