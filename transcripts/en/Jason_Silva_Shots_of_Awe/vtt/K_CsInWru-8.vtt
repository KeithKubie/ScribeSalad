00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.870
So I think a lot about
the role of poetry.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.975
What is poetry?

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.475
And I've come to the conclusion
that poetry is essentially

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.090
a technology of attention.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.950
It's a magnifying glass.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.910
It unveils in the full
meaning of the term.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.250
It strips bare under a light
and shatters our indifference

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740
to the everyday.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.915
It awakens the ontological wow.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.675
It makes us realize
that we are alive.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.650
It italicizes experience.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.520
The paragraph of subjectivity,
the narrator in our head.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.570
It's being written, the
paragraph in real time.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.750
It is the voice in
our head that lets

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.980
us know that we exist, becomes
emboldened and underlined.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.030
When we read a poem,
the poem reads us.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.636
It's a tool of illumination.

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.180
It's an altar.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.720
It's something we surrender
to in hopes of leading us

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.360
towards the place of
radical exaltation.
