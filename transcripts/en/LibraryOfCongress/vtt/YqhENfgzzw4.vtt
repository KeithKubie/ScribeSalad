&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It is my
pleasure to welcome to the festival

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.260
for the very first time the
former Secretary of State,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.860
former National Security Advisor
and Provost of Stanford University,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.210
who is also a two-time New York
Times' best-selling author,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.510
the remarkable, amazing
Dr. Condoleezza Rice.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:47.090
[ Applause ]

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.860
And Dr. Rice is going to be
interviewed for us by one

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.060
of the best interviewers I know
who has his own show on Bloomberg,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.540
our National Book Festival Co-chair

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.030
and very generous supporter
Mr. David Rubenstein.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.840
Please welcome both of them.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.280
[ Applause ]

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.580
And thanks and enjoy.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well,
thank you very much for coming.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.950
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Thank you
very much for having me here.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.510
And welcome to everybody,
thanks for being here,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.100
it's a great event, great event.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, it's hard
to believe but you've now been

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.930
out of government for
about nine years.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.190
So, just before we get into
your new book on democracy

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.740
which I highly recommend and we'll
talk about it in a few moments,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.500
tell us what you've been doing
since you left government other

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.990
than writing three
best-selling books.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.290
This is the third.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.300
But, other than that
you're teaching at Stanford

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.600
and what else are you doing?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.350
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well, I've
gone back to what I consider

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080
to be my real profession.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.470
I had that digression into
Washington but I've actually been

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.330
at Stanford since I
was 25 years old.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.580
I started there as an
assistant professor

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.360
and so I've returned to Stanford.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.710
My appointment is in
the business school

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.320
but I teach both business school
students and undergraduates.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.850
I teach a course in
American foreign policy.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.800
I've been able to do a little bit
of work in the private sector,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.810
a little consulting
in the private sector

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.100
and I'm spending a lot more time
practising the piano than I did

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.410
when I was in the government
because that's really a great love

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.570
and I'm trying to improve
my golf handicap,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.760
that's a lot harder
than playing the piano.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.310
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well
speaking of your golf handicap,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.750
you were one of the first
two women to be elected

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.240
to the Augusta National Golf
Club so was that an honor

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.430
that you ever expected
you would get?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.800
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I was stunned.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.360
In fact when a good friend who
was a member of Augusta came

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.010
out to tell me that
I was being invited

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.710
to join Augusta I just
sat there dumbfounded.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.460
And he said you are
going to say yes, right?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.430
And I said yes I am but I was
completely taken by surprise.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Well, just tell me, don't.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.990
I won't tell anybody but
what is your handicap?

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.340
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well it's
not really a state secret.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.030
So I am, for those of
you who are golfers,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.270
there's something called an index
and you take that index and you go

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.010
to different courses and
depending on the difficulty

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.570
of the course you establish
your handicap.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.030
So my index is 11.6 which
means that on most courses I'm

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.500
about a 13 or a 14 handicap.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, wow, okay
so if you ever, did you ever play

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.520
with President George W. Bush?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.320
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I have played
with President George W. Bush

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.620
on a number of occasions.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.920
He plays speed golf.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.220
He plays really, really fast.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.520
You have to almost run to your
golf ball to keep up with him

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.820
but yes, we've played together.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.420
And music, you did train to
be a classical music pianist?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.720
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
I have seen you perform

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.320
with Yo-Yo Ma among
others, so do you do a lot

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.620
of those concerts anymore or?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.920
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well, I
play at least one concert a year.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.220
I was fortunate to
play with Yo-Yo Ma

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.520
at his music festival just
recently at the Kennedy Center

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.820
for which you were such
a great leader David,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.120
but at least once a year I play a
concert with a professional quartet

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.420
from the Boston University
called the Muir String Quartet.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.720
And we do a benefit for a charity

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.020
that we started called
Classics for Kids.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.320
It puts musical instruments
in the schools

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.620
because I'm a great believer,
look I believe like everybody

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.920
that we need STEM, Science and
Technology and Mathematics,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.220
but I'm also a great believer
that we need the arts.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.520
Our kids need exposure to the arts.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.820
[ Applause ]

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, I
want to focus on your book

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.580
but I've heard some
people who may not know,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.330
there may be one or
two, your biography.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.680
Just, you were born and
grew up in Birmingham?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.980
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
it was a segregated South

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.840
under the Jim Crow laws so when
you were growing up did you,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.570
how long did it take
before you realized

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.710
that you were not being treated
the same as everybody else?

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.010
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well,
I grew up in Birmingham.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.420
It was the most segregated big
city in the country at the time.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.520
It was the place where
the police commissioner,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.940
Bull Connor was well known for
his brutality toward Blacks

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.530
and it didn't take long to know

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.710
that your parents were
a little embarrassed

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.140
that they couldn't take you to a
restaurant or to a movie theater.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.470
They were never people who let us,
this little community that I grew

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.990
up in, which was mostly
school teachers.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.120
My parents were educators.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.760
They never let us feel in
any way that we were victims.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.060 position:56%
As a matter of fact they always said

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.910
when you consider yourself
a victim you've lost control

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.220
so don't ever consider
yourself a victim.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.510
They also said you're going
to have to be twice as good.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.710 position:56%
Now they didn't say that as a matter
of debate, they said it as a matter

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.210
of fact because education
was supposed

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.370
to be your armor against prejudice.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.840
But I remember the very first time
that I, it really came home to me.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.700
I went to see Santa Claus.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.870
And you know how it works,
you take the little kid

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.300
and Santa Claus puts
the kid on the knee

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.010
and says what will you
have for Christmas?

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.770
Well, this particular Santa Claus
was taking the little white kids

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.020
and putting them on his knee
and holding little black kids

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.200
out here to talk to them.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.910
And my father who was a former
football player, my dad was 6.3,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.230
240, he said to my
mother Angelina if he does

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.300
that to Condoleezza I am going
to pull all that stuff off of him

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.920
and expose him as the
cracker that he is, he said.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.220
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What happened?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.520
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Alright
so, you're this little girl

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.480
and you're five and it's Santa
Claus/daddy, Santa Clause/daddy.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.720
How is this going to end up?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.240
Santa Claus must have read
my father's body language

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.550
because when it came to me, he
put me on his knee and he said,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.370
little girl, what would
you like for Christmas?

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.370
But I remember that was the first
time that I thought this is really,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.630
really terrible and over
Santa Claus of all things.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: One other
thing that might have been unusual

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.480
in your upbringing is you
had an unusual first name.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.780
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where
did that name come from?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.390
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: So,
Condoleezza is my mother's attempt

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:06.370
to Anglicize 'con dolcezza' which
in Italian means 'with sweetness'.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.530
Now, I don't know maybe
she missed the boat there

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.590
but anyway that's what it meant.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.380
And her name was Angelina
[assumed spelling]

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.180 position:56%
and I have an uncle Alto [phonetic].

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.620
I have an aunt Genova [phonetic]

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.400
who since we're Southerners
we call Genowa [phonetic].

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.240
But I think that she wanted
an Italian musical term.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.090
And she first thought about
[foreign language spoken]

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.680
but that meant walking slowly.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.310
She thought that wasn't so good.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.300
'Allegro' meant fast, that
definitely wasn't good

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.290 position:56%
and so she came up with 'con
Dolcezza' and Anglicized the ending.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.590
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.890
Ultimately your parents
move out of Birmingham.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.230
They moved to Denver.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.530
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.830
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And you
ultimately went to school

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.130
at the University of Denver?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.430
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where
you graduated Phi Beta Kappa?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.030
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
then you went to Notre Dame?

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.630
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: That's right.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.930
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But you didn't
get involved in the football,

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.740
cheering or anything there,
you were a graduate student.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.020
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I was
a FIA, I loved football.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.320
Are you kidding?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.620
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.920
Right, of course I went to
Notre Dame Football games

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.220
as a graduate student,
everybody does.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Alright,
alright so then you went back

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.820
to the University of
Denver and you got a PhD?

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.120
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
then you were recruited

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.720
to Stanford, is that right?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: That's correct.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.320
That's correct.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.620
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And your
specialty was Soviet and Russian?

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.920
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Eastern
European affairs, yeah.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.220
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, why
did you happen to pick that?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.470
It wasn't the normal thing that you
might say you might have picked.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.630
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: No, I
was a failed music major.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.670
I started in college
as a piano major.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.370
I studied piano from
the age of three.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.840 position:56%
My grandmother taught piano so I
learned very young and about the end

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.080
of my sophomore year
in college I went

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.070
to the Aspen Music
Festival School that summer.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.180
And I met 12-year-olds
who could play from sight,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.210
everything it had taken me all
year to learn and I thought I'm

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.730
about to end up you know
playing a piano bar someplace

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.200
or playing while you
shop, or whatever.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.520
And so, I wondered back with
no major and I took a class

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.820
in international politics.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.430
It was taught by a man
named Josef Korbel,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.020
he was Madeleine Albright's
father and all

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.490
of a sudden I knew
what I wanted to be.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.210
I wanted to study things
Soviet, East European, diplomacy,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.890
international and that kicked me
then into international politics

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.230
as a major and ultimately
as a degree.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.970
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And Madeleine
Albright is telling the story

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.220
that her father once said that
his favorite student was you.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.520
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.820
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And she was surprised

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.370
that you had been his student, she
hadn't known that for a long time.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.670
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
That's right, yeah, yeah.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So you started
your academic career at Stanford

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.680 position:56%
and then ultimately you got involved

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.410
in the George Herbert
Walker Bush administration.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.710
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You served on
the National Security Council staff?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.310
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.130
I got involved and it's
a really important story

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.210
because there's this notion

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.630
that we sometimes have,
I got there on my own.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.720
Nobody gets there on their
own, there's always somebody

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.690
who is advocating for you, working
for you, and for me Brent Scowcroft

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.580
who I had been national security
advisor to, to Gerald Ford,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.100 position:56%
came out to Stanford to give a talk,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.710
and I was a second-year
professor at Stanford.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.340
And he got to know me and he said
I want to get to know you better.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.640
I like your work.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.000
I was sort of getting
known for my work

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.230
on the Soviet military
of all things.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.070
And so he started taking
me to conferences

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.220 position:56%
like the Aspen Strategy Group and he
really mentored me into the field.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.610
And I often say there's
another lesson in that.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.290
We also say you know you
have to have role models

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.010
and mentors who look like you.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.340
Well, it's great if you do but
if I'd been waiting for a black,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.720 position:56%
female Soviet specialist role model.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.910
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I'd still be
waiting and instead my role models

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.590
and indeed my mentors
were white men.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.300
They were old white men, those were
the people who dominated my field

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.010
and so I always say to my students
now, your mentors just have

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.720
to be people who believe in
you and who see things in you

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.070
that you don't necessarily
see in yourself.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So he helped
you get a job on the Bush '41?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.010
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes,

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.760
when George H.W. Bush was
elected he asked Brent

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.180
to be his national security advisor
and Brent, I'll never forget,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.560
he called me and he said.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.890
This fellow, this is 1988 remember,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.200
he said this fellow Gorbachev
is doing some interesting things

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.500
in the Soviet Union.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.650
The president is going to need
somebody to help him sort it out.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.170
Do you want to come and be the
White House Soviet specialist?

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.800
And as a result I got to be the
White House Soviet specialist

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.390
at the end of the Cold War.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.820
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
and do you speak Russian?

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.300
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
I do speak Russian.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.650
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Wow, okay.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.620
And so after that administration
was over you went back to Stanford?

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.920
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I did.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.630
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And then
when George W. Bush was running

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.020
for president, how did you
get involved with that?

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.320
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well,
I went back to Stanford.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.940 position:56%
I was Provost of the university
which is the chief operating officer

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.770
of the university and
a very happy academic.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.790
But George H.W. Bush called me one
day and he said you know my son

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.820 position:56%
who is governor of Texas is thinking
about running for president and I'd

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.860
like you to come and talk
to him about foreign policy.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.400
I spent a couple of days down
at Kennebunkport with him

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.360
and after a little while he asked
me to organize his foreign policy

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.260
in the campaign and that's how I
got involved with George W. Bush.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So were
you surprised that he asked you

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.040
to be the national security advisor

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.410
at the beginning of
that administration?

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.710
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
Well, by the time we got

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.980
to his election I figured I would
probably go into the administration

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.910
and national security advisor.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.180
I'd been on the National
Security Council staff before.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.290
It seemed like a kind
of natural thing to do.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.700
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How
many women had served

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.970
as national security
advisor before you?

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.770
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
None [laughter].

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.310
[ Applause ]

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.610
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.190
So let's talk about
this book "Democracy".

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.020
Why did you feel compelled to
write a book about democracy?

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I think in many
ways I wanted to write this book

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.140
for a long time because it is

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.150
in some ways an expression
of my own life.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.910
I am a firm believer that
there is no other system

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.180
that accords the kind of
dignity that human beings crave,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.220 position:56%
than to be able to be free from the
knock of the secret police at night,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.390
to be able to say what you
think, to worship as you please,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.150
and most importantly to have those

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.730
who would govern you have
to ask for your consent.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.050 position:56%
And I think growing up in segregated
Birmingham where my parents

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.170
and relatives were half-citizens
but still fundamentally believed

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.590
in this American democracy.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.620
I relate one story in the book.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.390
I was with my uncle Alto and
he picked me up from school.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:30.050
And it was election-day in Alabama,
and I was sixish-years old or so.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.430
And I knew in my own
six-year-old way

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.820
that this man George Wallace
was not good for black people

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.760
and so there were long, long
lines of people going in to vote.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.620
And it was segregated of
course so they were all black.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.200
And so I said to my uncle, well,
if all these people vote then

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.220
that George Wallace
man can't possibly win.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.650
And my uncle said, oh no, no he
said we are a minority he said

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.060
and so George Wallace
is going to win anyway.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.140
And I said to him, so
why do they bother?

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.320
And he said because
they know that one day

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.310
that vote will matter
and I never forgot that.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:14.340
And I thought as I wrote this
book of the extraordinary story

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.070
of the United States of America,
this Constitution that was given

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.780
to America by its founders, these
high-minded words about equality,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.570
and yet a country born with
the birth defect of slavery.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.220
But how this same Constitution
that had once counted

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.880
in the compromise my ancestors
as three-fifths of a man,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.350
would be the same Constitution
to which I would take the oath

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.690
of office, as the 66th Secretary
of State, under a portrait

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:48.300
of Benjamin Franklin, sworn in by a
Jewish woman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.510
And that for me is the
story of democracy.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.820
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You
point out in the book

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.230
that you are African-American
but actually 40%

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.590
of your bloodline is white?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.060
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes, 40%
of my bloodline is European.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.000
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
European, and 10% is Asian?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.620
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Something
other, yeah [laughter] some other.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, by the
way in Birmingham the young girls

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.960
that were killed in the bombing,
were they people that you knew?

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.260
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Absolutely.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.710
It was this, the Birmingham
black community,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.670
particularly this little
professional class black community

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.970
was pretty small.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.120
And Denise McNair, one
of the four girls killed

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.450 position:56%
in the 16th Street Baptist Church
bombing in September of '63 had been

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.880
in my father's kindergarten.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.180
I'd done kindergarten with her.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.890 position:56%
There's a picture of my father
giving her her kindergarten diploma.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:49.300
Her father was the photographer
at everybody's weddings

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.850
and birthday parties and so yes,
my, Addie Mae Collins had been

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:59.270
in my uncle's homeroom at Brunetta
C. Hill and I remember him saying

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.800 position:56%
that that day, that Monday when they
went back to school he just looked

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.570
at her empty chair and
just cried, so yeah.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.450
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: When that
happened did your family say we

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.750
should move out of here?

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.050
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: No, no,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.860
I do remember the first time seeing
real fear in my parents' eyes

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:21.260 position:56%
about what they could do to
protect me, but no, we stayed there.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.320
Birmingham began to change.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.200
You know again, it's
the story of democracy,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.630 position:56%
that same Constitution would be used
by the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.730
and others, starting all the way
back, by the way and I describe

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.090
in the book with the Marlow
[phonetic] Report from 1937.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.320
And they would sit
there on Friday morning

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.610
and they would decide what cases
they were going to take to try

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.240
and break down segregation
and inequality.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.230
And that would eventually end up
in the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.730
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and
the first time that my parents

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.200
and I could go to a restaurant.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.670
Because, two days after the Civil
Rights Act passed my father said,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.200
let's go out to dinner.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.810
And so we got all dressed up and
we went to this hotel for dinner

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.390
and I remember the people sort
of looking up from their food

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.880
and then maybe realizing
now it was okay.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.390
We had dinner.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.690
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
in your book you point

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.440
out that we've had a birth defect,
slavery, but when slavery was ended

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:28.690
in 1865 we went to Jim
Crow laws so how do you

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.670
as an African-American woman
rationalize what our country did

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.980
after the civil rights amendments
occurred in the Constitution?

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.070
We still went through 100
years or so of discrimination.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.070
How do you say that democracy
is such a wonderful system

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.180
and our country is so great when
you had to live through that?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.900
How do you rationalize that?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.740
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well
because there is no perfect system

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.710
that human beings have
ever created, ever.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:59.260
And yet because of the institutions
that we were bequeathed,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.680
the Constitution, the
courts, independent judiciary,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.170
slowly but surely the rights of the
descendants of slaves would be won

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.160
through those very institutions.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.910
When Martin Luther King and
others took on the struggle,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.640
Dr. Dorothy Height who was
a very dear mentor of mine,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.570
the only real woman among those
great civil rights leaders,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.670
they weren't asking America
to be something else,

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.450
they were saying America,
be what you say you are.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.280
Now you're in a much
stronger position

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.420
when you have those
institutions in place

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.090
and you can appeal to
those institutions.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:43.880
And so in any system the bringing
of rights to people is a difficult

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.040
and sticky and hard process and
ours has been extremely hard.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.130
But I look at how far we've come,
still with a long way to go,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:57.170 position:56%
and I think we've actually done
better than I can think of any place

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.030
in the world has done it.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So today,
you're a very accomplished person.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.840
You're very famous.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.190
Do you feel any discrimination
anywhere

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.490
in the world, anything that you do?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.450
Do you feel that you're
discriminated against?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.750
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
You know I always say

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.090
if by the time you're a
senior professor at Stanford

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.410
or you're secretary of state
and somebody treats you badly

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.650
because of race or your gender
it's your fault, not theirs.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:23.290
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: You know, no,
I feel very strongly that I am able

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:27.840
to achieve what I want
to achieve and I try

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.090
to tell my students
to feel the same way.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.430
You know if you, it goes
back to what my parents said.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.100
If you consider yourself a victim
then somebody else has control

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.720
of your life.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.770
Now we all know that there are
grave inequalities in our society

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.970
and we know that our great
national myth, it doesn't matter

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.470
where you came from, it
matters where you're going.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.060
You can come from humble
circumstances.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.590
You can do great things.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:00.340
That it isn't true for all
of our people, so our goal,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.690
our job as citizens of
this democracy has to be

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.480
to use these institutions to
demand of these institutions

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.550
that they deliver on that
promise, not to shun them,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.770
because they're still the
best option for getting there.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,
did your parents live

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.390
to see your great success
as a professional?

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.390
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I
lost my mother very young.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.940
My mother was only 61 years old.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.980
I was 30 when she died.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.480
But she did get to see me
as a professor at Stanford.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.510
As a matter of fact the Christmas
before she died I gave her my very

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.210
first book which was not a
New York Times' best-seller.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.330
It was called "The Soviet
Union and Czechoslovak Army".

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.230
It had been my dissertation.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.800
In case you don't notice, neither

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.740
of those countries
actually exists anymore.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.740
And so I gave her the book so
she saw me become a professor.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.390
My father knew that I'd become
national security advisor.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.140
He died shortly before
I left for Washington.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.440
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You
were an only, an only child?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.740
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
I'm an only child, yes.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So am I

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.340
and so you know the pressure
of being an only child.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.640
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right, so.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah, you,
well that's why I'm a sports fanatic

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.440
because that was my father's
passion and a music fanatic

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.070
because that was my
mother's passion.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.570
So when you're an only child
you have to satisfy both.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Please both.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.170
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Both, right.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.470
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
let's talk about democracy

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.770
around the rest of the world.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.070
Let's say the United
States has a democracy.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.760
Maybe it's the best in the
world, it's not perfect.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.380
You talk about the
Soviet Union and Russia,

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.640
obviously a subject you
know a great deal about.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.360 position:56%
You point out that a couple of
times democracy broke out in Russia.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.660
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.960
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: After
the Bolshevik Revolution

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.260
and also briefly I guess

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.960
after Gorbachev kind
of lost power perhaps.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.260
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes, yes.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.790
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Why did
democracy in both cases disappear

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.890
from Russia, after the
Bolshevik Revolution,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.240
after Gorbachev lost power?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.320
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Right,
well, one thing that I seek to do

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.560
in this book is to dismiss
one of the explanations

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.470 position:56%
that you sometimes get about Russia,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.130
that the Russians somehow don't
have the right DNA for democracy.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.440
Right, I just don't believe that
there are any people on the face

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.650
of the earth who aren't
capable of democracy.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.310
And David you know that we
have used cultural arguments.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.860
So the Germans were once supposed
to be too martial for democracy.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.900
The Asians were too Confucian.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.080
But of course you've got
South Korea, you've got Japan.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.080
The Africans, well
they were too tribal,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.740
but of course you've got Ghana.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.040
You've got Botswana.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.340
You've got a Kenya that's going

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.440
through a very interesting
period in its own democracy.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.010
Latin Americans, well they prefer
caudillos, men on horseback,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.350
but of course now there's
Brazil and Chile and Columbia.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.710 position:56%
And by the way African-Americans
well they were too childlike to care

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.010
about that thing called the vote.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.680 position:56%
But of course we've had a black
president, a black attorney general.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.620
We've had attorneys general.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.640
We've had black secretaries
of state.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.450
So, I just reject this
cultural argument

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.940
and with the Russians
you get it all the time.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.530
They just like strongmen.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.570
But really what the story is,
it's the story of the failure

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.440
of institutions to take hold
under enormous pressure.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.840
If you think about the collapse
of the Soviet Union and you think

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.990
about the kind of rapid
effort to build capitalism,

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:08.400
50% of the Russian population fell
into poverty practically overnight.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.430
The country broke apart overnight

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.380
and unfortunately their
first President,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.080
Boris Yeltsin who I admired
for a lot of reasons,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.840
but instead of strengthening
the institutions and working

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.390
through them he starts
to rule by decree.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.030
He weakens the legislature.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.290
He weakens the independent
judiciary.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.530
Now, that presidency, really
strong presidency in Russia

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.800
under Boris Yeltsin is one thing,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.980
but when Vladimir Putin
becomes president

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.310
that same very strong presidency
is now in the hands of somebody

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.170
with authoritarian instincts.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:50.540
So the Russian failure is a story
of the importance of institutions.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.620 position:56%
You can't depend on a single person,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.040
you have to depend
on the institutions.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
deep down you don't see Putin

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.900
as a Jeffersonian democrat?

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.200
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: No,

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.870
I don't think you would
confuse him with a Jefferson.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.170
You know I know him pretty well.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.470
I spent a lot of time with him.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.770
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Does he speak English?

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.070
When you talked to him?

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.370
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: You know
he's, he was learning English

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.670
from the time that
we came into office

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.200
and his English is now,
I understand passable.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.240
But, I would chitchat with him
in Russian but he really kind

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.010
of liked me at the beginning I
think because I was a Russianist.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.800
But I remember once sitting with
him, toward the end of my time

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.440
as secretary and he
said Conda you know us.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.530
Russia has only been great when
it's been ruled by great men

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.140
like Peter the Great and
Alexander the Second.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.370
Now you want to say, and do
you mean Vladimir the Great

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.850
but you know you're secretary
of state you can't do that.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.240
That would be rude.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.710
And, but in fact that's
who he thinks he is.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.550 position:56%
He thinks he's reuniting the Russian
people in greatness and I think

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:53.020
that instinct has led him
to destroy all of the kind

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.300
of institutional constraints
on the presidency,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.380
the independent judiciary, the free
press, civil society et cetera.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.680
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And you think the chance

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.080
of his voluntarily
stepping down is slim?

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.150
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I think
so though you know relation,

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.300
the thing about regimes like
that is they, they're vulnerable.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.770
And you don't know that they're
brittle until something happens.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.540
We have to remember
that the only district

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.570
that Vladimir Putin did not win

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.330
in the fraudulent election
of 2012 was Moscow.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.690 position:56%
That tells you about, something
about how he's viewed in the cities.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, let's
talk about another country

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.940
that adjoins Russia that
you write about, Poland.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.240
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.290
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Poland,
democracy did break out in Poland

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.280
and what do you think the state
of democracy is in Poland today?

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Poland is a
story that we should try and emulate

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.170
at its beginning because
what Poland is,

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.930
is the story of having
institutions in place

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.990
when what I call the
democratic opening comes.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.280 position:56%
Solidarity, a nationwide labor union

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.230
under Lech Walesa had actually been
underground from the declaration

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.320
of martial law at the
beginning of the 1980s.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.490
It had been sustained by the
Vatican and village priests.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.090
The AFLCIO, which was
sustaining as the labor union,

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.370
and Ronald Reagan's CIA,
kind of an interest troika.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.010
Now, when Gorbachev comes to power

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.460
and Eastern Europe breaks
free Poland already had

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.490
that institutional
infrastructure in place

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.560
and so the democratic
transition was easier in Poland

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.530
than almost any place else.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.850
But now what we're
seeing in Poland is

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.750
that it's still a young democracy.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:41.200
It has for the first time a very
strong, centralized executive

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.920
and you're starting to see a kind
of erosion of the independence

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.800
of the judiciary, the
independence of the press

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.450
but people are fighting back.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.320 position:56%
Civil society is mobilized on social
media against these moves of the,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.240
what's called the Law
and Justice Party

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.560
which is the president's
party, and the president,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.020
President Duda actually
ended up having to veto a law

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.340
that he had sponsored, that
would have gone a long way

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.150
to undoing the independence of
the judiciary so don't count

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.220
out Polish democracy just yet.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: No.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.820
Let's go further south.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.120
You next write about Ukraine.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.730
Ukraine flirted with democracy.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.180
What would you say is the state
of democracy in Ukraine now?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.650
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah,
Ukraine is in many ways a kind

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:28.970
of sad situation because if you
are trying to build a democracy

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.150
with a very watchful and assertive
and aggressive neighbor that is

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.360
in the process of taking
your territory

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.020
and making the eastern half of
your country unstable it's kind

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.430
of hard to build democracy.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.850
But, they've made some progress.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.520
Poroshenko who is the
president now has launched an

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.920
anti-corruption campaign.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.610
One of the great, one of the
great checks on democracy,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.680
one of the great challenges
for democracy is

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.560 position:56%
when you have corruption and they've
made some good moves on corruption.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.690 position:56%
There are some young people there in
the Legislature who are determined

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.310 position:56%
to deliver democracy and it's a
vibrant society in its Western part.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.530 position:56%
The problem for Ukraine is that
with the troubles in Eastern Ukraine

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.400
and you don't read much about
them in the newspapers these days

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.560
but people are dying every
day in Eastern Ukraine

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.730
as these Russian separatists
who are supported

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.910
by the Russian Armed Forces are
causing all kinds of problems.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.040
So Ukrainian democracy is
always kind of on a knife's edge

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.200
but it's not an authoritarian
regime either

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.520
and that's something to celebrate.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.070
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But as
long as Putin is in charge

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.060
of Russia you don't see Eastern
Ukraine all of a sudden going back

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.060
to Ukraine and Crimea
going back to Ukraine?

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.460
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well, Crimea,
I think it's going to be very hard.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.680
But here's one point
that I'd like to make.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.790
One of the reasons I wanted to
write this book also was to talk

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.250
about the role America can
play in supporting democracies.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:59.000
We have a tendency, and I take
some responsibility for this,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.140
to associate democracy promotion

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.800
with what happened in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.630
Those were extremely
stressful situations

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.140
where we had a security
problem and later on tried

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.680
to help build democracies.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.590
But most of the time democracy
promotion is much simpler

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.890
and much less complex.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:24.190
If you think about the way that
we dealt with the Baltic states,

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.090
so the 45 years that they
were under Soviet occupation.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.810
David, when I was the
special assistant

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.160
for Soviet affairs I had a stamp

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.840
and it said 'The United States
does not recognize the forceful

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.640
incorporation of the Baltic
states into the Soviet Union'.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.330
And whenever you mention Lithuania,

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.810
Latvia or Estonia you
stamped it with that.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.290
Now we couldn't do
anything about the fact

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.360
that the Soviets had enforceably
incorporated the Baltic states but,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.200
we stood for the principle.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.850
In Crimea we have to stand
for the principle even

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.710
if we can't do anything about it.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.010
We have to stand for the principle

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.610
that the annexation of
Crimea was unlawful.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You mentioned
Iraq and Afghanistan and I wanted

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.180
to talk about the Middle
East and democracy there

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.710
but before we do, where
were you on 9/11?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah, I was the
national security advisor on 9/11

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.130
and if you were in a position
of authority on 9/11 every day

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.320
after was like September 12th.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.770
I was at my desk.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.380
My young assistant came in and said

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.890
that a plane had hit
the World Trade Center.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.160
I thought well that's
a strange accident.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.460
I called President Bush.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.910 position:56%
You would remember he was in Florida
at an education event and I got him

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.280
on the phone and he said well
that's a strange accident,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.580
keep me informed.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.130
A few minutes later I was
having my staff meeting

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.640
and somebody handed me a
note, it said a plane had hit,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.630
the second plane had hit
the World Trade Center

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.970
and now we knew it was
a terrorist attack.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.190
And so I went into the
situation room to try

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.030
to reach the national
security principals.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.460
Colin Powell was in
Peru at a meeting

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.680
of the Organization
of American States.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.410
George Tenet, the CIA director
had gone already to a bunker.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.920
And they said we can't
reach Secretary Rumsveld,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.970
his phone is just ringing
and ringing and ringing.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.490
We looked behind us on television
a plane had hit the Pentagon.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.360
And about that time they came
and they said, you've got to get

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.650
to a bunker because planes
are flying into buildings all

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.660
over Washington, D.C. Now, when the
Secret Service wants to escort you

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.170
under those circumstances they
don't actually escort you,

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.750
they kind of pick you
up and they carry you.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.670 position:56%
So I remember simply being grabbed,
kind of levitated toward the bunker,

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.790
saying wait a minute, I
have to make a phone call.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.920
I called my aunt and
uncle in Birmingham.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.320
You have to know the Rices
and the Rays [phonetic],

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.620
they would have made their way.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.640 position:56%
And then I called President Bush
and I said you can't come back here.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.990
The United States is under attack.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.040
And the rest of the day was
dealing with the reality

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.970
that American security
would never be the same.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.320
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, on Afghanistan,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.930
it's been in the news lately,
it's our longest war, 16 years.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.840
Do you see any solution
in the near term?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.450
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I'm
worried about Afghanistan.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:58.720 position:56%
I have always said that what, the
point that we have to get to somehow

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.950
in Afghanistan was that the Afghans
were able to prevent the Taliban

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.130
from an existential threat
against the Afghan government.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.490
I've always thought that you
were going to have remnants

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.280
of the Taliban that would be kind
of hit and run terrorists here

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.180
and there in the country.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.380
But as they've been able to
carry out bolder attacks closer

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.620
to the capital, even in
the international zone,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.210
you have to wonder how
well we're doing in getting

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.840
to that place of stability.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.960
And so I think the decision by the
president and by Secretary Mattis

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.470
to try to really stabilize
the military situation is one

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.770
that I support.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.120
But eventually there's going to
have to be a political solution

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.350
in Afghanistan and I suspect that's
going to have to involve Pakistan

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.220
which is a really big
part of this problem

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.960
because the Pakistanis
aren't really convinced

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.220
that a stable Afghanistan is in
their interests, and they've got

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.570
to be made to help
stabilize that territory.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.750
And you know we're talking about
democracy, look it's very tough.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.070
Afghanistan was the fifth poorest
country in the world during the,

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:13.860
at 9/11 but it is at least
a place now where girls go

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.430
to school in large numbers.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:21.880
It is a place now where women are
not beaten in a soccer stadium

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.220
that was given to the Taliban
by the U.N. It is a place

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.620
where men are not lashed
because they don't wear beards.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.300
It's not a place that
harbors terrorists

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.780
and so I think we've
had some achievements

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.190
in Afghanistan but
yes, I'm concerned.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Now democracy in Iraq,

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.850
do you think we've
made progress there?

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.930
And what do you think really went
wrong after the invasion of Iraq?

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.710
It didn't quite go the way
you had thought it would.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.010
What went wrong?

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.310
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.300
Well, I talk a lot about
the Iraqi case because I lay

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.750
out several different scenarios
of what the circumstances are

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.570
when the democratic
opening comes right.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.570
Now the best is a place like Poland
where you've got institutions

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.210
in place or Columbia where
you have institutions

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.800
that were weak but were there.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.850
The worst situation is when
you've had a cult of personality,

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.010
tyrannical leader where
everything had been

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.550
at the service of that leader.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.400
That was Saddam Hussein.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.330
And so there were effectively
no institutions to think of

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.660
or we thought underneath him.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:35.580
And so the distance
between people's desire now

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.110 position:56%
that they've overthrown the dictator

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.430
or that we've overthrown the
dictator and the institutions there

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.350
to channel all of those
passions, there's a great distance

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.370
and you don't have much time.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.450
I relate in the book that
we made a lot of mistakes.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:55.350
We undervalued the potential
for the tribes, the Sunni tribes

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.730
to play an important role.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.830
We didn't understand the tribes.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:05.650
When we got back with the surge
in 2007 the tribes were a big part

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.140
of the reason that we were able
to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.540
I think we didn't fully understand
the implications of the disbanding

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.900
of the army which wasn't
supposed to take place by the way

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.480
and I describe that in the book.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.460
And so in the fog of
war a lot happens.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.590
But the one thing that I'd
like people to understand

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.970
about Iraq was we did not go
to Iraq to bring democracy

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.790
to Iraq, that's an urban legend.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.450
I was in those meetings,
it doesn't happen

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.500
to have the benefit of being true.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.910
We went to Iraq because we
thought we had a security problem

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.110
in a Saddam Hussein who had rebuilt
his weapons of mass destruction.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.040
I would never have said to the
president of the United States,

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.610
use American military force
to bring democracy to Iraq,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.840
or to Afghanistan for that matter.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.550
But once you've overthrown
the dictator you have

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.060
to have a view about
what comes after.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.240
And the president and his
advisors believed we had to try

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.330
to give the Iraqi people a
chance to build their democracy.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:06.660
Now, a lot of bloodshed, a lot
of lives lost, that we'll never.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.470
We'll never be able to
bring those people back.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.410
I will say that as the
Iraqis now are on the verge

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.970
of defeating ISIS you're
beginning to see

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:20.060
that the Iraqis do have some
democratic institutions.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.950
They have a prime minister
who is accountable to them.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.570
Their people protest and
they're not shot in the streets.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.690
You don't have mass
graves of the kind

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.620
that Saddam Hussein put people in.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.350
Iraq's big challenge is going to
be, can the country hold together

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.480
with the Kurds who for
a long time have wanted

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.780
to be an independent people?

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.360
That's the big challenge
for the Iraqis

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.570
but they do have some institutions
that I think can help them.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.190
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now
the Arab Spring was supposed

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.270
to produce democracy throughout
various parts of the Middle East.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.160 position:56%
Talk about Syria, Syria doesn't seem
to be having democracy anytime soon.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.460
What kind of solutions?

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.760
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: And by
the way I would rather be Iraqi

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.060
than Syrian right.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:02.760 position:56%
The Syrians, Bashar al-Assad is
unfortunately, it's going to be hard

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.400
to get him out of power because
the Russians who have people

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.810
on the ground, want him in power.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.270
Eventually if he's going to go it's
going to have to be the Russians

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.140
who make the decision that he goes.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.160
The rest of the Middle
East, I'm not ready to give

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.640
up on the Middle East finding its
way toward democratic institutions.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.850
You know we get very impatient
with people when they're trying

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.240
to find their way to democracy.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.550
And we say either they
just don't get it or look

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.930
at all those you know those,
the Muslim Brotherhood and all.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.680
And we forget as we've
just talked about David.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.410 position:56%
Our own history of
democratization is a pretty long one

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.710
and a pretty tough one.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.840
And so I would say use
the Polish example.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.700
Try to plant some seeds
for democracy.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.260
There are entrepreneurs
who are people

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.010
on whom you might build
further democracy.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.740
There are civil society
groups, women's groups.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:04.190
Tunisia is an example of
where a national labor union

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:08.510
and women's civil society groups
have actually managed to bring

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.450
about something that looks like a
nascent democracy so I'm not ready

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.920
to give up on the Middle
East just yet.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Take
Egypt, after Mubarak,

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.260
has there been a real movement
towards more democracy in Egypt?

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: No, in Egypt
the Egyptian military rulers look an

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.050
awful lot like Egyptian rulers
have looked for a while,

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.380
Mubarak, Sadat et cetera.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.250
But underneath again there are
civil society groups that we ought

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.230
to be supporting to try to help.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.190
You know what happens in the
Middle East is that at the moment

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.490
when you have a chance

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:49.870 position:56%
for a democratic opening the
strongest institutions are often the

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.170
radical Islamists.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.470
Now why is that?

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.900
It's not an accident.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:59.110
It's because leaders like
Mubarak destroyed the foundation

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:03.210
of more liberal institutions and
parties, people like Ayman Nour

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.910
and others who might have been
a foundation of democracy.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.030
But they didn't destroy these
radical Islamists who organized

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.510
in radical mosques
and radical madrasas,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.470
so they were the best
organized when elections came.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:20.200 position:56%
We have to help more liberal forces
be organized when opportunity comes.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.500
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.800
Talk about two other parts

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.100
of the Middle East before
we go to the Far East.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.570
On the Middle East, Israel,

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.530
there's either a one-state
solution or a two-state solution.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.830
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: If you
have a one-state solution,

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.800
do you think you can
really have democracy?

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.100
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: No.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:40.030
I think for Israel to remain a
democratic Jewish state it has

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.470
to have a democratic
Palestinian state.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.390
I'm a believer in the
two-state solution

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.950
and eventually they're
going to have to get there.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.250
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Alright.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.020
Let's talk about the Gulf
states, the GCC states,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.860
the Gulf Cooperation
Council countries.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.800
You don't think, I assume

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.120
that democracy will break
out there or should?

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.460
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
No, these are monarchies

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.440
and they have varying degrees
of liberalism toward issues

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.380
like women's rights
and varying degrees

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.940
of liberalism toward the
marriage of religion and politics.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.530
But some interesting things
are happening there even

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.430
in a place like Saudi Arabia right.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:21.870 position:56%
So Saudi Arabia has really basically
now set a generational shift

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:29.690
and most, and a majority of the
people studying in university

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.150
in Saudi Arabia, in their
great university built

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.880
by King Abdullah are women.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.210
Now they're going to have an
interesting kind of test here.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.810
Can you educate women at this level

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.450
and still tell them
they can't drive?

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: We'll find out.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.210
So, let's go to the
Far East for a moment.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.810
In your book you point out
that authoritarian governments,

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.740
while not perfectly
Jeffersonian democracies,

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.640
can actually have some
good democratic features

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.970
and can have some good
pluses for the people.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.880
And you cite for example Singapore.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.180
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yeah.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What do
you admire about Singapore?

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well Singapore,
first of all it's very small right.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.810
And what I really say is that
when people say authoritarians are

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.660 position:56%
sometimes better, they have two
examples, China, the largest country

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.490
in the world and Singapore,
one of the smallest.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.440
And Singapore was fortunate.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.650
It had a wise man leader
in Lee Kuan Yew.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:32.920 position:56%
It was at a time when democratic
values were not very obvious in most

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:38.060
of Asia and he turned out to
be a truly wise, benign leader.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.930
But the problem with that
theory is then you'd better hope

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:45.110
that the next one is benign
and then that his son is benign

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:49.800 position:56%
and that his son after him is benign
because you don't always get lucky.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.450
The Singaporeans got very lucky.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:56.670
And we have this tendency to hold
democracies to higher standards

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.530
than we do authoritarians.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.920
So there are all kinds of really
bad authoritarian leaders,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.240
just read Caracas in Venezuela,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.540
so the idea that authoritarians are
somehow better because they deliver

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.100
for their people, the
Chinese have delivered,

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:16.350
although that particular model is
kind of running out of steam now.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.490
Singapore delivered but there
are so many authoritarians

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.520
that didn't deliver that I think
we sometimes hold democracies

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.820
to a higher standard.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now China,

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.370
you don't expect a
Jeffersonian democracy will break

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.670
out there anytime soon right?

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.970
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
No, I don't expect

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.610
that Jeffersonian democracy
is going to break out there

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.530
but I will tell you
something about China.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:38.890
China is also about to
have an interesting test.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.680
China's economy grew rapidly.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.200
It lifted 500 million
people out of poverty.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.150
It's a miracle what
they were able to do.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:50.860
But they did it with a heavy
export-led economy being the low

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.680
cost of labor provider in
the international system.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.500
They did it with a kind
of command economy,

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.230
a lot of state-owned enterprises.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.650
That model has run out of steam.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.720
They can't get growth out
of that model any longer.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.930
Now they're having to
free up market forces.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.410
When you free up market forces
there's a kind of mismatch

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.870
between those market forces

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.960
and a top-down authoritarian
political system.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.030
And so the question is,
how long is it going

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.280
to be before you have
a clash of those?

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.450
So just as an example China had
186,000 riots over the last couple

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:28.000
of years, 186,000 reported
riots, not because someone was

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.950
out protesting for democracy
but because a peasant would find

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.970
that a party leader and a
developer would seize their land.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.520
They have no courts to go
to so they go and riot.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.640
So even Chinese leaders will say
now well we need independent courts

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.110
so that that doesn't happen.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.590
How long is it before
independent courts become an

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.120
independent judiciary?

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.810
Now you're starting
to get a difference

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.720
in the institutional
landscape in China.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.110
And I'll tell you one other story.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:44:00.420
I gave a lecture at Tsinghua
University, their great university.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.760
They affectionately call it their
cross between Harvard and Stanford.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.730
And I wanted to give a talk
that was not about U.S.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.300
/China relations so I decided to
give the same talk I would give

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.640
to Stanford students,
find your passion,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.190
do something hard,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.830
The questions blew me away.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.070
The questions were,
well I'm an engineer,

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.790
why do I need to take literature?

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.050
Suppose, what do you do
if your parents don't

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.280
like the major that you've chosen?

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.060
I thought these are Chinese kids?

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.390
They're questioning in this way?

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.520
How long is it, before
questioning your parents' choice

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.870
of your major becomes
questioning your government?

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.710
And so I think there are
a lot of trends in China

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.510
that may ultimately lead,
at least to liberalization,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.810
if not to democratization.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.110
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And you
didn't write about it in your book

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.400
but I can't help but ask
you about another place

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.610
where I don't expect
Jeffersonian democracy will break

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.040
out which is North Korea.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.520
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Ah yeah,
that's a ways away yeah.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where, if you
were advising the president today,

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.270
the current president of the United
States, or any president today,

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.590
who would you, what would you
tell him to do about North Korea?

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.890
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Now,

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.320
this is the most dangerous
situation that we face.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.680
When I was secretary we tried
to negotiate with Kim Jong-il,

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:22.010
Kim Jong-un's father to
denuclearize the country.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.220
We made some progress but
ultimately they wouldn't live

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.520
up to the agreements.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.700
We walked out of the talks.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.010
Ever since, they've
been on a rapid course

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:35.750
of improving their bomb
design, harvesting fuel

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:41.120
and increasing their, the range
of their delivery systems,

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:47.620
no American president can tolerate
a somewhat unhinged North Korean

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.220
leader because if he's
not crazy, he is reckless.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.760
This is somebody who reached into
Malaysia, killed his half-brother

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.060
who was under Chinese
protection so he's reckless.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.350
I don't think any American
president can tolerate that leader

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.840
with the capacity to
reach the United States.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.100
And what the administration
is trying to do,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.770
and I support what
they're trying to do,

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.070
is they're painting a very
bleak picture for the Chinese.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:17.540
That's the only country with any
real leverage on the North Koreans.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.920
The Chinese have never really been
willing to use their leverage fully

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.850
because they worry that
the regime could collapse.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.020
Then they'd have unstable
law and order

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.130
and they would have refugee flows.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.430
But what the administration
is saying to them is,

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.830
your choice now is
either we do something

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:35.920
about the North Korean
problem or you do something

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.440
about the North Korean problem.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.640
And hopefully that will
get through to the Chinese

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.120
because the military solutions
here are not very pretty.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, if a missile went

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.170
and came near Guam would you
think we would still have to wait

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.860
for the Chinese to do
something or are we?

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.000
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: I think at
some point the American president

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.020
and I'm not inside so I don't
know what he's being told

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.590
about how long he has
but at some point,

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:05.510
you know if you're threatening
Guam and already firing missiles

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.360
over Japan we're getting
pretty close to a [inaudible].

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.270 position:56%
We're getting pretty close to the
president having to make a decision.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:15.740
I will note that when Kim Jong-un
came out and said he was going

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.970
to attack Guam the Chinese
must have talked to him

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:20.420
because within a few
days he came back

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.290
and said maybe he wouldn't
attack Guam

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.610
so I think we do have the Chinese
attention, it's a just a question

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.930
of what are they willing to do.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now your
book covers two other parts

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.720
of the world I'll cover briefly.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.050
One is Africa and you
talk about Kenya

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.970
and there's an election
going on now.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:39.510
But let me ask you about South
Africa, you met with Mandela.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.040
You knew Mandela.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.540
Why do you think democracy
hasn't worked as well

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.280
after Mandela as it was expected?

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.270
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well,
Mandela was a remarkable man.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.100
I don't think I've ever met anybody

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.920
who I was more inspired
of, found more impressive.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.530
In fact he said to George W. Bush
when President Bush asked him,

00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.850
he said so why didn't
you run for another term.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.090
He said I wanted my African
brothers to know it was okay

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.440
to step down from office.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.900
And on a continent that
had too many presidents

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.740
for life this was really
an important statement.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.720
But it's again a story
of institutions.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.290
It was a single, essentially
a single-party system

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.060 position:56%
under the African National Congress.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:24.230
Somehow Mandela's great
authority was never transferred

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:27.120
into institutions which
could then survive him

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.890
and they've had considerable
trouble since,

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:33.360
but the institutions
are still there.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.850
It's just that it's been hard
to really deliver through them.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:38.560
You know first presidents matter.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.060
The United States of
America was pretty lucky

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.840
that George Washington
actually didn't want to be king.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.430
I don't know how many of
you have seen "Hamilton",

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:51.410
it is really a great, great
show but it becomes very clear

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:57.720
that we got lucky with a particular
combination of founding fathers

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.670
that we had and many places
haven't been that fortunate.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, you write
about Latin America and you talk

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.220
about Columbia, how democracy
has made progress there.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.520
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.820
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
generally the military juntas

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.120
of the 60s and 70s are.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.420
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Gone.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.720
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Gone.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.020
But what happened to Venezuela?

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.770
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Hugo
Chavez happened to Venezuela.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.120
You know you can get a really
bad leader who doesn't,

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.240
doesn't get checked by those around
him, with considerable oil wealth.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.360
The oil curse is real.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.240
And when I was secretary
of state the price

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.850
of oil went to $147 a barrel.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.270
It empowered people like
Chavez who then tried

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.290
to buy elections across
Latin America.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:42.970
And he singlehandedly
step by step destroyed all

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.420
of the really important
institutions, the opposition.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.540
He was succeeded by somebody
who is Chavez without charm

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:57.080
and Chavez without, I think,
without Chavez' street smarts.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.920
And Maduro has taken
the country down.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.240
I hope that this is one where the
Organization of American States,

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.790
the Latin American states need to
be all over Maduro to do something

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.530
because it's sad to see
a middle-income country

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.730
where people can't find food
and they can't find medicine.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, we've
had an African-American president

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.920
but we've never had
a female president

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.800
and never had an African-American
female president.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.100
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
Right [laughter].

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.400
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Have
you ever thought that?

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:34.510
[ Applause ]

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.250
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Well,
thank you very much but no.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.920
You have to know your DNA.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.370
You have to know your DNA.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:44.060
And I was on the campaign
trail with George W. Bush.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.360
I'll never forget.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.710
You know we'd go to
five campaign events.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.420
At the end of the day
he was rearing to go,

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.180
I just needed to get
back to the hotel.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.120
You know there are people who
draw energy from the process.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.770
I don't so much and I've never
liked politics particularly.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.790
I love, I do love policy.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.090
The other thing is, I am.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:06.440
My calling is what I do,
I love being a professor.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.710
I love teaching millennials.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:12.420
They are a challenge,
they're wonderful.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:17.250
You know they come to me and
they say I want to be a leader

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.540
and I say you know that's
not a job description

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.410
and it's not a destination.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.090
Let's talk about what you're
going to learn and know

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.040
so somebody will follow you.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.880
And then my other favorite line, I
want my first job to be meaningful.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.910
And I say, your first job is
not going to be meaningful,

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.550
it's going to be your first job.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.850
What will be meaningful is
somebody will pay you to do it

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.050
for the first time,
that's what's meaningful,

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.510
so I've got my work cut out for me.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, if you
don't want to run for office,

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.180
suppose some president came along
again and said you did a great job

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.700
as secretary of state,
why don't you do it again?

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.720
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: You should
never try to go home again.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.060
I had an amazing alignment
of the stars.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.910
I had a president who told, would
tell leaders you know we grew

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.170
up together he would
say because we started

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:08.600
out when he was just leaving
the governorship of Texas,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.850 position:56%
and he trusted me and I admired him.

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:14.070
It was a time of consequence
for the country.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:19.240
I have great admiration for
people in public service.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.530
I don't think we, we admire
enough people [inaudible]

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.830
to public service.

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.130
It's hard.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:26.430
It's hard work.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:30.000
And I just hope.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.090
I try so hard with my students not

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.180
to let them be cynical
about public service.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.790
I served as secretary of state.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:41.900
The foreign service and the
civil service people who work

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.330
in the State Department,
not to mention the more

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.750 position:56%
than 30,000 foreigners who staff our
embassies around the world are some

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:53.830
of the most dedicated people you'll
ever find, and so I was honored

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.510
to lead them and I loved being
the nation's chief diplomat.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.160
And there was nothing
like getting off a plane

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.980
that said the United States of
America and thinking what can I do

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.360
to represent this great country?

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.920
But I'm done [laughter].

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, when
you stepped down as secretary

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.350
of state you handed the
reins over to another woman.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.650
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
I did, Hillary yes.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Hillary Clinton.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.250
What was it like, one
female secretary

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.310
of state handing the reins
over to another female?

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:20.920
Were you saying we don't
need these guys anymore?

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.570
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: [Laughter]
well, you know and so Madeleine,

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:29.100
colon, myself and then
Hillary, it had been 16 years

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.070
since there had been a white,
male secretary of state

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.100
and so we were saying mm-mm,
you know I don't know.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.610
Maybe we're going to have to do
a little affirmative action here

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:41.250
and see what happened
but, no it was great.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:46.390
And it's a nice little club,
the secretaries of state.

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:50.480
We are. The dean of the secretaries
of state is George Shultz

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:57.220
who is 97 years old and is
still one of my great mentors.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:00.120
I will tell you a little story
because you'll appreciate it.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.880 position:56%
He had a birthday party not too long
for Henry Kissinger who turned 94

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.430
and the two of them did a
20-minutes-walk around the world,

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:12.000
no notes, completely coherent.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.320
I don't know but I'm sure hoping
it was something in the water

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.870
at the State Department
so just amazing people.

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: As I remember,
because I heard from that party,

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.270
George Shultz said something
odd, 'to be 94 again'.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:26.960
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice: Yes, he said.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.560 position:56%
He said from his point of view Henry
was still a promising young man.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, as
you look back on your career

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.920
which was extraordinary, what
would you say you're most proud

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.790
of having done?

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.190
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
Well, with the caveat

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:47.060
that history takes a long time to
judge, I think I'm most grateful

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:51.580
that we stood up for the right
of people to live in freedom.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:55.930
I know that there were a lot of
cynics about and a lot of criticism

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:59.610
and some of it totally justified
about the freedom agenda

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:02.550
and declaring that America's,

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.590
one of America's most
important purposes was to,

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.910
to work hard so that no
one would live in tyranny.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:17.020
But I think America is at its, is
at its best, its highest calling

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.060
when it leads both from
power and principle.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.670
When we stand for the
proposition that the rights

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:28.060
that we enjoy are indeed
universal and if they are universal

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:35.360
that there are no people for
whom they shouldn't be secured.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.890
And so I'm very grateful
that we were able to do that.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:42.890
When I think back on some of my
travels it was always when it was

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.080
about people and a couple of
things stick out in particular.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.490
I went to China to Chengdu
after the great earthquake there

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.650
and a little boy, couldn't have
been more than 12 years old,

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.140
walked up to me and he
said you're that lady

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.440
from the United States aren't you?

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.440
And I thought yeah, I am.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.700
And then just with the
people have asked me,

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.830
what was it like to be a woman
representing the United States

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.150
in the Middle East where women
were second-class citizens?

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.590
And one story really
sticks in my mind there.

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:12.020
I was, had a very difficult
meeting with a Shia cleric,

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.050
a very conservative Shia
cleric who couldn't touch me

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:17.180
because I was a woman
outside of his family.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.350
And at the end of this meeting,
this very difficult meeting,

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:23.580
it was in Iraq, he said,
will you do me a favor?

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.880
He didn't speak English.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.760
Through the translator, he
said will you do me a favor?

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.060
I thought a favor, really?

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.780
I said sure.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:33.000
He said my 13-year-old
granddaughter watches you

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.920
on television and she loves you.

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.860
And she and her mother are coming
to the States, would you meet them?

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.860
And so on that day, this little
13-year-old girl runs, comes in,

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:47.410
in a pink t-shirt that says
'Princess' and she walks up to me,

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.330
in perfect English and says 'I
want to be foreign minister too'.

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.030
And I thought, you know there
was something in that moment

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.690
because her very conservative
grandfather beamed

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.310
when he thought about
this little girl.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:04.940
This problem, this progress that
we try to bring through democracy,

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.580
through justice and equality
it's a long, long, long road.

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:15.450
And people have travelled
that road for a long time.

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.540
America has travelled
it for a very long time

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.620
and we're still working at it.

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:25.140
And so the thing I'm most
grateful for is that even

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.310
with our own troubles here
in the United States we stood

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:30.070
for the proposition that every man,

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.860
woman and child should
live in freedom.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well,
I want to highly recommend

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.790
to everybody here this book

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:37.510
which I enjoyed very
much reading "Democracy".

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:48.060
[ Applause ]

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.950
And I want to thank you for
your service to our country

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:51.250
for over many, many
years, thank you.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.550
&gt;&gt; Condoleezza Rice:
It was an honor.

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:54.350
It was an honor, thank you.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:59.420
[ Applause ]

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.080
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
