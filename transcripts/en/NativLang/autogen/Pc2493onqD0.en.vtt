move on to some examples in English we

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910
move on to some examples in English we

have prepositions if they take a pronoun

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970
have prepositions if they take a pronoun
 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.030
have prepositions if they take a pronoun
in other words if they govern a pronoun

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040
in other words if they govern a pronoun

like me we expect that the preposition
 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.770
like me we expect that the preposition
is followed by an object pronoun rather

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
is followed by an object pronoun rather
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.050
is followed by an object pronoun rather
than a subject pronoun in other words

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060

must be in the object of case so I would
say for me but not for he I instead say

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450

preposition for that matter I use the
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.400
preposition for that matter I use the
object case so we say that prepositions

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
object case so we say that prepositions
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.740
