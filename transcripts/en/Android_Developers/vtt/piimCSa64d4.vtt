RETO MEIER: Hello, and welcome
to a very special episode of

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.480
The App Clinic.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Today, we're
broadcasting our pilot episode

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.340
of the GDG App Clinic, starring
talented developers

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.040
from Prague.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.280
RETO MEIER: We thought it might
be fun to visit Prague--

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: But we couldn't
get the budget.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.540
So instead, we invited one
of the Prague GDGs

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.850
to join us via Hangout.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.360
RETO MEIER: We gave each
developer a few minutes to

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.970
introduce their app, and it was
our turn to give candid

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.910
feedback on how to make their
good apps even better.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're hoping to
repeat this with GDGs all over

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.670
the world, so let us
know if you want to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.070
be part of the magic.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.110
But be warned, Czech
developers know

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.130
what they're doing.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.970
RETO MEIER: So without further
ado, welcome to the GDG App

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.220
Clinic, Prague.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.860
RETO MEIER: Thank you very much
for inviting us to your

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.820
GDG in Prague.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.980
I'm a big fan of Prague.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.610
I love the city-- been there a
few times, not just for Google

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.020
Developer days, but
for fun as well.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.209
And one of the things which I
always come away from whenever

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.250
I go to Prague is how great
the developers are.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760
It's one of the big reasons why
Google has a big interest

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.330
in what happens in Prague, so we
are really honored to have

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.435
this opportunity to take a look
at some of the apps that

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:18.690
you guys have put together,
hopefully give you some

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.090
feedback, and just basically
hear from you guys as well as

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.130
to what you've been working
on and what

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.940
inspires you about Android.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I've been to
Prague once on the way to

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.190
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.300
That's pretty much it.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.220
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.660
Great.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.050
OK, so let's invite
our first speaker.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.120
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, guys.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.620
Nice to meet you.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.840
It's a pleasure to kick off
this fantastic event, so I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.110
hope we get some
great feedback.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.700
So our application is
called Big Launcher.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.710
As the name suggests, it's a
launcher suitable for seniors,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.840
for people who are visually
impaired, and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.460
for disabled people.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.170
It uses big icons and large
text for all the basic

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.150
functions of the phone,
including contacts, including

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.050
messaging, including call log,
and also it can launch

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.760
applications.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.930
RETO MEIER: So this is Big
Launcher up on our giant,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.310
giant phone, and it, exactly
as the developer said--

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.860
oh, by the way, make sure you
guys introduce yourselves when

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.010
you get started as well, so
we know what to call you.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.050
What is your name, sir?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.936
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:31.380
RETO MEIER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.760
All right.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.140
Perfect.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
a great name.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.160
RETO MEIER: It is
a great name.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.320
I feel like we're not going to
be able to pronounce any of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.660
the names today, so we've
started about as simple as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.760
it's going to get, and
it's going to go

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.120
downhill from here.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.570
Nonetheless, [INAUDIBLE] has
done a great job here.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.820
You can see Big Launcher is
exactly what it says it is.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.550
It's a replacement
launch screen.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.920
And it is exactly that.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.390
So it's nice big buttons, bright
icons, really easy to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.870
see what's going on.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.750
One of the things that I
did find was during the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.570
configuration process, there's
a setup wizard that you go

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.350
through, and as part of that
process, it feels like that's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.760
actually quite complex.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.470
So it's almost as though it's
an app that you're going to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.145
want to set up for someone else,
rather than have the

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:17.340
visually impaired older person
set it up themselves.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's kind of
the impression that I got.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.010
I don't know how else you could
do it, really, because

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.610
obviously, you're going to have
some steps where you have

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.730
to dig into this stuff
that's in the phone

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.010
already, you know?

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.270
At least just to set it up
as the default launcher.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.830
RETO MEIER: So that's something
that you may want to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.810
consider is what is the target
audience for that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.060
phase of the app?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.850
So if that's more for your
expert user, so yourself or

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.780
whoever is setting up a phone
for your parent or

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.880
grandparent, then you may want
to try and make that a little

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.510
bit more familiar to the
standard phone UI, and then

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.330
keep the large screen simplified
stuff for the final

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.370
home screen itself.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.140
There's is also a couple of tips
about the wizard setup

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.400
process itself.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.940
It doesn't quite follow a
standard wizard type UI.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.910
So in a normal wizard, I want
to be able to go to navigate

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.910
backwards and forwards until
I'm complete, and I noticed

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.320
that when I was doing
this setup, I

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.520
had to simply progress.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.290
It was just sort of a series
of questions that

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.760
got put up on screen.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.630
I answered them, I chose
my default, whatever

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.040
else, and moved on.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.850
Now, if the idea here is that it
is for the older person to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.880
use themselves, then that kind
of makes a lot of sense.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.950
You don't want to have to put
too many buttons on screen,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.330
too much confusing navigation.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.690
Just one big question,
make a decision, move

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.230
on to the next part.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.160
But I'm not sure that
it quite worked.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.980
It was a little bit too complex
for that use case, a

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.170
little bit too basic for
the more expert user.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.030
One of the things that I noticed
through that wizard

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.010
process as well was that
you're able to select a

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.360
language, or go by default.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.040
Now, I was a little confused by
that, because the phone is

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.750
obviously going to have
a language set.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.910
You can have the different
resource folders to make sure

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.590
the correct assets are loaded.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.080
Was there a particular reason
why you wanted to allow people

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.820
to select a language
independent

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.350
of the phone itself?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.960
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
there's a reason.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.100
Because we feel that's some
of the users can have the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.700
different language set in the
system settings, but and they

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.650
want to use a different language
in Launcher itself.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.880
For example, some immigrants
or people like that.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.040
So that's why.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.440
I think if I were setting
up this phone for my

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.420
mother-in-law, Chinese, I think
that I would want the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.780
setup to be in English, but she,
of course, would want to

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.410
see it in Chinese.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.220
RETO MEIER: Would want to have
the launcher in Chinese.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.880
That makes a lot of sense.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.440
All right.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.370
I'm learning stuff myself.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.390
So when I'm actually using the
app-- so you can see here that

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.160
the buttons are responsive,
which is nice.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.350
Whenever you're building custom
buttons, custom UI,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.130
it's really important to make
sure that they behave the same

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.520
way that standard Android
buttons work.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.340
And so you need to have some
sort of feedback when you're

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.490
pressing things.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.560
What I did notice, which I
would be interested to

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.520
understand better, is generally,
for stuff like

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.460
this, it might be useful to
have a long press, which

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.340
triggers the accessibility by
default on the Jelly Bean

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.070
[INAUDIBLE] phones.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.322
So the same way where on action
bar items, when you

00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:14.902
press it, it displays
help [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:15.890
explaining what it is.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.400
That actually--

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: He actually
mentioned that though.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.400
He said that he felt like the
long press was unfriendly to

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.680
this type of user.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.130
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.330
And it could be.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.290
So how does one trigger the
accessibility talk back

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.800
functions of the phone, then?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.570
MALE SPEAKER: Well, there
are two things.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:46.730
The first is that senior
people got problems to

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.390
distinguish between long
press and short press.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.450
So we wanted to get
rid of that.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.470
And then, during the
development, we got to this

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:06.580
idea, or the possibility to
use a long press for some

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.600
other function.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.330
So you can turn on in the
accessibility options that on

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:20.460
long press, the Big Launcher
reads the activated item.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.990
This is useful for older phones
with previous versions

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.660
of Android, which doesn't have
the explore by touch function,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:40.690
so even on these older phones,
people can use this read by

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.830
touch or read by long press
function developed by us, and

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.420
they can be, for example,
reminded of

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.190
what this icon does.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.550
So when you create a shortcut
for some application, you see

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.710
only the icon, but when you
long press on it, the

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.720
description of this icon
is red, so you'll

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.280
remember what it does.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.040
RETO MEIER: Very nice.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.820
Very nice.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.550
So I mean, overall, there's not
a huge amount of feedback

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.860
that we can give, apart from
getting a little bit nitpicky.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.260
I think that the padding around
the time and date on

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.090
the top here is a little
bit narrow.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.610
You probably want to indent that
a little bit more to make

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.100
it feel a little bit
more balanced.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.950
But really, a lot of the
feedback is going to be that

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.020
kind of nitpicky stuff, so we're
going to make sure that

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.750
we include that in an
email, and send

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.960
you off those details.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.919
We're going to get Roman,
Nick, and Adam from the

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.510
Android Design In Action Team
as well to provide a little

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.015
bit of extra feedback on UI
elements to this app, and all

00:08:40.015 --> 00:08:42.770
the ones we look at today,
rather than spend too much

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.630
time complaining about two
pixels being missing from a

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.370
particular part of the UI.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Although I did
have one comment on the clock.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.440
I was little surprised, because
I've always been told

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.540
that digital clocks were less
accessible, and that older

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.120
people would prefer
analog clocks.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.870
But you used a digital
clock here.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.760
I'm wondering, was that
a conscious decision?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.360
MALE SPEAKER: Well, it's, again,
because of the support

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.730
of low res devices and older
phones, because you don't have

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:22.890
too much space on phones
with 240 by 320.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Good point.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.480
MALE SPEAKER: We also, if you
turn on the option in

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.920
preferences, there's also
enlarge, better indicator, and

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.020
mobile signal indicator, and we
are really getting low on

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.803
space there.

00:09:37.803 --> 00:09:39.350
RETO MEIER: No, that's
a really good point.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, that
makes sense.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.830
RETO MEIER: So a couple of very
quick last minute points.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.990
So it does have an old school
venue button, which does

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:52.190
display a custom, more easily
pressable menu, I suppose.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.910
I'd like to say, I understand
why you've got this,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.610
particularly for backwards
compatible

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.370
support for older devices.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.000
I did note that you still have
the Menu button, and it is a

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.080
little more shameful
in the wizard.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.610
There's no need to have
it available there.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.680
And here, I would think about
having a default mechanism on

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.000
newer versions of the
device which get rid

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.800
of that menu button.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.900
So I know that there is a
setting within the setup

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.720
wizard which lets you optionally
choose to have

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.170
preferences show up within
the UI itself.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.450
I'd consider defaulting that
to on and hiding that menu

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.300
button away.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.420
It just will make the app look
more polished on newer

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.350
devices-- make people feel
like it's a more polished

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.930
final product.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.820
And the other piece of
suggestion I would have as

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.000
well, particularly around-- it
seems like you're having to

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.080
make a lot of UI compromises
and choices based on what

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.820
makes it easier to use
by older people.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.120
I would, if you're not already,
strongly suggest that

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.220
you make sure to use a lot of
analytics to find out exactly

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.380
what people are doing.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.610
Are they long processing?

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.960
Are they then hitting back?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.400
What are the behaviors?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.080
What are the choices?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.630
What are the outcomes of some
of those compromises?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.470
MALE SPEAKER: We did lots of
testing with the UI itself,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:06.245
but currently, we don't include
any analytics in the

00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:11.780
app, because again, it's
about the target group.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.090
We suppose that lots of seniors
don't have data tariff

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:21.590
or mobile data at all, so we've
created this from the

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.270
beginning to be a completely
offline application.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:26.550
RETO MEIER: Great.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.035
Well, I can't argue with that.

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:29.310
It sounds like you've
thought it through.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.910
So nicely done.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.930
That's the thing.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.240
We could go on praising it,
but that doesn't seem--

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: No,
it looks great.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.310
Well, actually, I've always got
one last thing, but you've

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.390
got a really good point
that you don't want to

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.280
use the data tariff.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.440
But have you considered maybe
doing analytics anyway and

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.000
just storing it to persistent
storage?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.120
Because I feel like, especially
in the scenario

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.400
where you have a caregiver
that's setting up the app, and

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.790
then you've got the senior
that's using it, it might be

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:05.300
useful to have that data, even
offline, to just debug issues.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.280
RETO MEIER: And you could also
do things like store up the

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.890
analytics and only upload it
when it's connected to Wi-Fi.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.430
Those sort of things might
be [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which all of you
should be doing anyway.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.930
That's a really important
step.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.460
RETO MEIER: All right,
perfect.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.040
So thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, thank
you very much.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.860
RETO MEIER: Great app.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.290
We'll send you through
some tips, but

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.500
basically, nicely done.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.350
MALE SPEAKER: I think
this also.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.550
Thank you very much
for your feedback.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.176
RETO MEIER: Of course.

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:33.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right,
who's the next victim?

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.250
MALE SPEAKER: Next victim?

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.400
Our victim?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.040
OK, next application is
a stocks tracker.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.430
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Hello, guys.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.990
RETO MEIER: Hey.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.020
TOMAS VONDRACEK: So my name
is Tomas Vondracek.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.160
RETO MEIER: OK, cool.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.853
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Shortly
Tom, for you.

00:12:57.853 --> 00:12:58.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: That
sounds great.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.850
We can deal with that.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:00.960
RETO MEIER: That's way
more our speed.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thank
you so much.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.290
RETO MEIER: Tom it is.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.130
TOMAS VONDRACEK: OK, so let me
introduce my application that

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.950
I published a few days ago.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.780
It's a stocks tracker,
so as its name

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.450
suggests, it's about stocks.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:24.220
So one day, I bought a stock
here at Prague Stock Exchange,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.270
and I wanted to watch it all
the time with my phone.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.080
But by the time, there was no
application that could provide

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.170
me data from Prague Stock
Exchange, so I decided to make

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.810
my own app.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.230
RETO MEIER: All right,
perfect.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.540
All right.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.030
So let's take a look.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.675
So one of the things that I
really liked about this app is

00:13:40.675 --> 00:13:44.100
just the story you told us of
having a need that you wanted

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.180
to have fulfilled, and
then building an app

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.880
that fulfills that.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.320
I think a lot of the best apps
come from people who have a

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.150
problem that they want to solve
for themselves, and so

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.360
they build an app which does
that, and I think that's a

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.280
great way of knowing what your
users want, if you're your own

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.530
first customer.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.535
So let's start it up.

00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:01.770
You promised it would
be really quick

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.680
as soon as it started.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.390
So let's--

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.590
boom.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.530
That's pretty fast.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:04.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Very nice.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.610
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.050
So this is a really nice app.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.230
What I really like about this
is how you've followed the

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.890
Android design guidelines in a
way that makes it really easy

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.370
to use, really familiar, but
it still has its own unique

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.110
look and feel.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.230
So if we look at the front page
here, we've got this sort

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.570
of custom little thing down at
the bottom here which is

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.950
giving us the NASDAQ index.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.660
Nice little graph
control there.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.560
All of this is custom.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.165
There's nothing like this
built into the platform.

00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:33.215
So that looks really nice.

00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:34.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's
really pretty.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.090
And it's a good use of space
there, too, because we've

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.800
always said don't put too much
on the bottom, because you

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.840
don't want to accidentally press
something when you're

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.050
trying to hit the back button
and the home button.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.360
So it's nice to see something
there that's visual and

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.360
important, but doesn't have to
be interacted with too much.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.610
In fact, honestly, the only
problem that I had when I

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.160
first picked up this interface
was looking

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.680
for the search button.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.930
I sort of expected it to be up
at the top, and instead, it

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.560
was up at the bottom.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.850
Now, it's a perfect icon--

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.740
search with a little plus?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.420
Like, oh, that's how
I add a stock.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.180
No worries there as soon
as I found it.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.450
It just took a little while to
find it, because it wasn't in

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.650
the place I expected
on the action bar.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.570
RETO MEIER: Feels like it
should be in action.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.980
So that may be one piece of
feedback is to extend that

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.415
bottom part out, move the
button up to the top.

00:15:22.415 --> 00:15:22.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.500
We also usually say don't
put a refresh button.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.660
RETO MEIER: Yeah,
it's possible.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.930
I had a little bit of a look to
see how the refresh worked,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.230
and it seems that within
preferences, you're able to

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.022
select your refresh frequency.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.512
So whenever I see that
sort of thing, I get

00:15:40.512 --> 00:15:42.130
a little bit nervous.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:48.700
So I feel like I need to ask how
you doing your refreshes.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.152
TOMAS VONDRACEK: I
beg your pardon?

00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:54.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, sorry.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.280
How are you doing
your refreshing?

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.520
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Well, the
application starts an alarm in

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.790
particular interval.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.220
It's not waking up alarm.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.770
RETO MEIER: So it's an inexact
repeating non-wake alarm?

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.370
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Not repeating,
but I set alarm

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.080
every time I need to schedule
next update.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.400
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.370
So one of the things about
that-- if you're doing that

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.000
yourself and it's not repeating,
then it's going to

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.920
trigger it basically
the exact time.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.160
So you may want to consider
sitting an inexact repeating

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.270
alarm, even if you then disable
the alarm each time

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.770
and reset it.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.890
That will give the system a
little bit of leeway to time

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.600
shift all the alarms from the
different apps, and make sure

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.000
that they're not waking up the
cell radio within in a few

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.180
seconds of each other and
keeping the radio hot and

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.610
draining the battery
more quickly.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.080
If you want to take it even a
step further, given that you

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.100
said you have a server where
you're remembering what

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.810
people's stocks are--

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.860
so if you wanted to be really,
really battery efficient,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.890
really, really awesome, you
would actually do all of the

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.210
parsing of the stocks on your
server, and use Google Cloud

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.010
messaging to tell each of the
devices which have those

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.119
particular stocks listed that
it's time for a refresh.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.220
And in fact, because the stock
data is so small, you could

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.290
probably bundle that
within the payload.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.290
So you wouldn't actually need
to do any refreshing at all.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.089
You can just tell the devices,
GOOG is up 10%, and have it

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:21.730
update that way.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.940
TOMAS VONDRACEK: So it wouldn't
mind if there was a

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.079
lot of push messages from server
to all those apps?

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.400
RETO MEIER: No, we have social
media apps like Twitter

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.080
clients and instant messaging
apps all use

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.560
Google Cloud messaging.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.250
There's no quota, very
efficient, definitely,

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.838
definitely the way to go.

00:17:43.838 --> 00:17:45.170
TOMAS VONDRACEK: OK.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:45.860
RETO MEIER: So that's something
to look at.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.270
I think that's probably the
biggest piece of feedback

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.840
which is going to really
transform this app.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.180
It's going to reduce your
latency, it's going to

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.290
increase your battery life,
it's going to let you hide

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.510
away these refresh buttons.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.900
So I think that would be
a tremendous asset.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.370
From the UI perspective,
I was worried.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.720
We don't have the Android Design
In Action guys here.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.850
Roman, Nick, those guys are
kind of the experts.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.340
You've done a great job.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.130
A lot of these apps have
done a fantastic job.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.580
You look here, we've got the tab
strip along the top, and

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.440
so you've got this really
beautiful view page, your

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.860
implementation, so
you can switch

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.660
between the stock exchanges.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Is that your own,
or did you borrow that

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:26.790
from the apps page on AOSP?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.340
TOMAS VONDRACEK: I
beg your pardon?

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I
just noticed that

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.740
the 3D effect here--

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.190
I wonder if that's the AOSP
implementation, or did you do

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.560
that yourself?

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.250
TOMAS VONDRACEK: No, it's simple
page transformer that

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.890
is available in support
library.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.000
So nothing special.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.200
RETO MEIER: It looks
really nice.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.940
And what really impresses me is
you've got the view pager,

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.620
and you've also got the correct
implementation for the

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.050
drawer pattern-- like,
correct in every way.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.740
It displays correctly, it comes
in and out correctly.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.120
Just really, really
nicely done.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.180
So, bravo.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.620
We so rarely see a correctly
implemented drawer pattern,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.870
even within some Google apps.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.930
So it's impressive.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.450
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Thank you.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.590
RETO MEIER: And you've got
the right details here.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.790
One possible nitpick--

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.222
you've got settings and account
within the drawer.

00:19:14.222 --> 00:19:16.935
I'm not entirely convinced
that's the right place for it.

00:19:16.935 --> 00:19:19.990
I think the drawer is better for
just navigation, so all of

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.330
these other things-- stocks,
portfolio, indices, and market

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.580
news, perfect.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.160
But I'd consider moving settings
and account back into

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.530
the overflow menu over here next
to select markets, and

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.300
possibly even switch
them around--

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.090
move select markets, potentially
move that into the

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.260
navigation drawer.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.550
But these two things, settings
and accounts, are things which

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.030
you would rarely change.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.410
You'd set up once or twice maybe
at the beginning, and

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.490
then never see them again.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.715
So you want to move them out
of the general UI and hide

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:48.300
them away in the overflow.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.270
In fact, things like select
market I might even want to

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.770
see in the settings.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.130
Basically, settings is a really
good place to tuck away

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.380
things that you don't expect
to be used particularly

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.450
frequently.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:11.210
So when you go to select
markets, I figure that not

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.350
being an international super
trader, I'll probably set up a

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:21.420
couple of markets and then
forget about them and just

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.670
switch between them.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:32.920
I do think that it was a little
confusing in terms of a

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.360
difference from the stock apps
that I normally use to have to

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.100
remember which market each
my stocks is listed on.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.380
That might be more of a US
thing, where we've got NASDAQ

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.990
and the New York Stock Exchange,
and we don't

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.050
really think of--

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.690
I mean, they're treated the same
for tax purposes, so I

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.810
don't really think of them
as being different.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.880
So I looked for a couple of
stocks, and I couldn't find

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.080
them, and it turned out they
were on the wrong exchange.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.150
RETO MEIER: That might be a
really useful search feature,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.295
so that when you are searching
to add, it works across all of

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:04.240
the exchanges that you
have selected.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.890
Not across every exchange, but
just the ones which you are

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.530
interested in.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.260
That might be really
useful shortcut.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.090
I noticed when Ian added the
Prague Stock Exchange, it has

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.962
a whole bunch of default
stocks set up.

00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:19.380
I really like that, because it
was actually one of the pieces

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.300
of feedback that I had was when
you first start up the

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.350
app, you end up with
this screen, which

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.190
is perfectly fine.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.560
It tells you to add stock.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.180
But it's kind of almost
cheating, because it's asking

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.230
you to add stock using a button
which you'll never be

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.780
able to use again.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.490
So it's almost training
the user to use the

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.960
app the wrong way.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.300
I think it would be really
interesting to instead have a

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.230
few default stocks, so that you
sort of see a screen like

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.180
this when you get started,
immediately understand how the

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.680
app works, and then are looking
to add your own

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.330
stocks, which you then do
using the button, which

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.530
hopefully will be
up at the top.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Another thing that
a lot of apps do that I

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.860
think I like a lot--

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.020
I think it's particularly
helpful-- is if you do have

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.810
empty space in your list, what
you can do is put the outline

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.460
of another item, which then if
you press it, it will take you

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.720
to the ad page.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.760
Because that's the thing is when
I look at these stocks,

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.030
the first thing I think
is, how do I get more

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.210
things into this list?

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:22.800
And if the button is right
there, it's very intuitive, as

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.190
opposed to down here in the
corner, where it's certainly

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.650
visible, but just not
as intuitive.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.310
RETO MEIER: Otherwise, like I
said, really, really nice app.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.750
You click through, you have the
stock details here, nice,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.510
again, custom graph, which
shows the stocks.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.010
Looks much better over
that time frame.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.810
And then you can click again
further through, and I quite

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.610
like this, because you can
actually annotate the graph,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:56.210
and save that, and even share
using the standard share

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.330
intent, which is all really,
really nice.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.600
One thing I did notice--

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.570
you obviously have the ability
to zoom in and out using the

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.530
buttons at the top.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:10.380
I was kind of always looking to
zoom and pan left or right

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.210
within this, so it's kind
of screaming out for a

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.730
gesture of some kind.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.620
And I think we actually have
an Android training class

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.370
around gesture support, so it
may be worth having a look at

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.280
that, considering it.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.280
I've build so many graph
implementations in so many

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.500
different programming languages
over the years, so I

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.740
know how much of a pain it is to
implement that second level

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.490
of zooming and panning.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.370
So not a P0, not a high,
high priority bug.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.000
Certainly, the faster,
more efficient

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.780
updates is more important.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.420
But as a nitpicky thing which
might be really nice, I don't

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.155
think I've seen any
stock [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:44.155 --> 00:23:46.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's odd,
because I've built many graph

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.500
libraries, and I think it's
actually very easy to

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.420
RETO MEIER: Well, I guess we
all know who's the better

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.120
programmer.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.765
So yeah.

00:23:54.765 --> 00:23:55.870
I've taken a few notes.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.110
I just want to see if I'm
missing anything here.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.130
No, I think we've covered
pretty much

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.040
everything I wanted to.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.740
It's a great app.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.420
The thing that I think we have
to point out-- and I don't

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.600
know how well it comes
out in the video--

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.070
is just how fast this app is.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.850
It's completely smooth.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.070
RETO MEIER: It's lightning
fast, yeah.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.640
Really, really quick.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.320
TOMAS VONDRACEK: Yeah, I put a
lot of effort to make it fast.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.655
RETO MEIER: And it's paid off.

00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:21.240
Project Butter, a big part of
what we do with the framework

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.580
now, trying to get everything
to be snappy, fast, and

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.310
smooth, and everything
in this app is.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.780
Updates, there's never any
jag, never any latency,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.050
everything just sort of works,
which is really nice.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.520
Portfolio stuff here, again,
tells you how much money

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.840
you've theoretically made.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.420
Go back to stocks, it's
all just fast

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.700
and quick and intuitive.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.640
So congrats.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.900
Nicely done.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.140
If you do get a chance to
implement the Google Cloud

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.640
Messaging, we'd love to hear
about that, because I think at

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.840
that point, this could
be an app which we

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.760
could talk about featuring.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.820
Not that it's our choice, but
we can certainly talk to the

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.390
people whose choice it is.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, we certainly
do have the ability

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.520
to get into the pure
Android process.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:00.990
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.530
This is looking pretty
pure Android.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.550
But yeah.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Once we get a
couple little changes, and

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.070
getting rid of the refresh
button and going to a

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.070
different refresh cycle,
that would be--

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.670
because we need a stock
up in Pure Android.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.600
RETO MEIER: We totally need a
stock app, and this is nice.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.280
So yeah, definitely keep
in touch, and let us

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.830
know how you get on.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.800
And we'll see what we can do.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.410
And add Hong Kong
and Shanghai.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.580
TOMAS VONDRACEK: OK, thank
you very much.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:24.830
RETO MEIER: Perfect.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.480
Thank you.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.600
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.040
The next speaker is application
SMS Ticket.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.560
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.420
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:42.660
I am from Inmite company, and
I'm happy to introduce last

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.860
update of SMS Ticket,
which our team has

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.790
just released yesterday.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.090
Let me say a couple words about
the use case, because

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.390
you might not be that
familiar with it.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:59.070
Let's say I want to take a
bus or tube in Prague.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.890
What I need is a ticket.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.230
And I can buy a ticket in a
shop, or in ticket vending

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:12.980
machine, or I can send a special
text message to some

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.730
special number, like this.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.320
RETO MEIER: I love a man who
brings his own props.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.340
MALE SPEAKER: And after a minute
or two, I receive a

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.405
text message, which I can
officially use as a ticket.

00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:27.840
RETO MEIER: Perfect.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.750
MALE SPEAKER: And what our
application does--

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.970
it remembers all of those codes
and special numbers for

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:41.980
you, so you can, within three
clicks, send a text message,

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.780
you will receive a text
message back.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.190
The application parses validity
information from the

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:54.080
ticket, sets some alarms to warn
you 10 minutes before the

00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:01.940
ticket expires, fires
notifications, and saves the

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.210
ticket in the database
for later reference.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.630
Later on, you can see how much
you spent on tickets in

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.880
detailed statistics.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.600
Let me say just some numbers.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.510
We have about 883,000 users,
and about ever second user

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:28.000
uses the application actively,
and we support 22 tickets in

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.450
nine Czech and four
Slovak cities.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.260
What do we cook for future?

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.280
We would like to add push
notifications to keep the

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.150
ticket database up to date,
and we would like to add a

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.930
widget to make the order of
a ticket just one click

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.744
experience.

00:27:48.744 --> 00:27:51.184
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:27:51.184 --> 00:27:54.810
MALE SPEAKER: OK, I'm pleased
to be here, and I would

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.610
appreciate any feedback.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.870
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.350
Thank you for coming along.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.470
So, like I said, I've been to
Prague a couple of times for

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.420
Google Developer Days, and the
folks from Inmite are always

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:05.910
impressive.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.520
You guys do some really
good work.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.820
So it's wonderful to see.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.740
I think two apps from you guys
are nominated today.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.310
SMS Ticket--

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.740
we're going to be able to be
pretty quick on this, because

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.720
it's actually really good.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.940
I love the simplicity.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.430
I love what you guys
have done.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.620
You've got your custom branding,
this sort of golden

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.680
orange color, which is really
distinctive, and it pervades

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.230
the entire UI in a way that is
subtle but really effective.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.530
It's obvious what
your brand is.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.170
Icon coloring and everything
else really works.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:41.400
Once you're in the app, again,
you have this really subtle

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.170
user guide so that you know what
you're supposed to do.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.280
It tells you right here you can
choose to look at the list

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.060
of tickets or statistics, buy
a new ticket, so the whole

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.880
process is laid out for
you in a way that

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.015
doesn't feel too obnoxious.

00:28:52.015 --> 00:28:53.820
I don't need to click past
it, and I don't need to

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.580
go through a wizard.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.260
It's just there.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.580
If I order a ticket, again,
you're given the cities, all

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.030
of this detail.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.400
So we'll go with Pilsen.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.120
And then, again, it's
just this really

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.410
simple click process.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.650
Everything's really obvious.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.920
35 minutes.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.620
Buy a ticket.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.760
And again, you've even
customized the color of the

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.435
text in this dialog.

00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:17.840
Now, normally, I wouldn't be
convinced that that's actually

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.150
a good idea, but it kind
of works here.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:20.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it flows.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.350
RETO MEIER: It just
feels authentic.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.040
And that's kind of the key.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.980
We always harp on about how
important it is to follow the

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.910
guidelines.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.895
Don't change the standard
UI in ways that

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:33.230
will confuse users.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.125
And a lot of people assume
that means that they have

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:37.130
create apps that look exactly
the same as all of the

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.090
standard apps.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.400
It's not what we mean.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:39.940
We just mean that they have
to look the same--

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.080
MALE SPEAKER: We did the app
in orange, so why not have

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.370
orange dialogs?

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:44.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.110
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.830
MALE SPEAKER: Why should
we use blue dialogs?

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: In fact, if you've
ever seen our game

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.520
review show, which is sadly off
the air right now, one of

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.060
the things that we would harp on
is when you'd be playing a

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.580
game, and it would all of a
sudden pop up a standard

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.190
system dialog, and it took you
straight out of the game.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.960
So having a skin for those
dialogs, and making it feel

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.380
like it's part of your app,
without doing too much

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.550
rearranging or alteration
of the

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.605
functionality is a great idea.

00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.360
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.170
So if we try and buy a ticket,
we can't, because we can't

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.470
send an SMS, which is perfectly
appropriate.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:26.030
You guys have happily sent us a
special version where we can

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.855
add a test ticket, so
thank you for that.

00:30:27.855 --> 00:30:30.210
That definitely makes
our life easier.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.380
And boom, so there you go.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.350
You have a ticket.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.320
Really straightforward.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:33.890
12 minutes.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.220
It's got a little orange
indicator saying that

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.600
actually, you're going
to need to use this

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.490
ticket pretty soon.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.660
So that's a really
good indicator

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.220
to make sure people--

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.700
what you're doing here is adding
value above and beyond

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.312
what they would have gotten if
they were just looking at

00:30:46.312 --> 00:30:49.350
their SMS texts in
their SMS viewer.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.790
Change that metaphor presenting
them with a ticket.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.010
And now it's turning red,
because I guess

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.500
it's within 12 minutes.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.520
We can click here.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.300
We can see the valid
to and from.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.330
We can see the code, and I guess
the code's important,

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.310
because I'm guessing you have to
show that to conductors or

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.530
what have you if they accost
you, demanding to know if you

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.640
paid for your ticket.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.210
So you go through, and
you can show the SMS

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.730
itself, which is perfect.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.200
So that can all be validated.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.660
All consistent.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.790
What I really like here is
they've actually used

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.520
notifications really,
really cleverly.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.010
So you have this notification,
and it's a rich notification,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.390
so you're able to show the SMS,
which, again, you need to

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.492
do if someone wants to know
you've got a ticket.

00:31:30.492 --> 00:31:34.430
Got the details, and it's got
an icon here which if we

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.920
continue to prattle on,
which we will, this

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.960
would become red.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.670
Oh, look at it.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.950
It's like I scripted it.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.100
So it's red, which means, hey,
you've got less than probably

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.740
10 minutes before the ticket
expires, so you need to get on

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.560
and use it.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.990
Really, really useful, really,
really effective way of using

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.720
notifications.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.910
Now, again, this
is nonstandard.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.540
The guidelines say that the
notification icons should be

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.980
black and white, small,
et cetera.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: I disagree.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.600
I disagree.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.720
Because the guidelines actually
say they should be

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.500
monochrome.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:09.920
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: You could take.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.210
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: There's only
one color there.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.920
RETO MEIER: I think
it is monochrome.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.475
There's only one color.

00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:16.670
So I can't argue with that.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:20.230
But again, it's a really
practical way of showing more

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.940
information in a way that
just makes sense.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.620
You go, well, obviously
it's going to be this.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Really smart.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.270
RETO MEIER: What else
would it be?

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.350
So again, really nicely done.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: In fact, the
only thing that I was

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.850
surprised about that I kind of
wanted to be different is I

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:39.520
would love to have the SMS and
the important codes show up in

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.630
a much larger font.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.340
I imagine myself needing to show
that to somebody, and my

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.530
day is going to go faster if
it's about two or three times

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.590
as big as everything else.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.860
RETO MEIER: It's OK.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.720
I'm sure every single person
in Prague who uses the app,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.940
everyone in Prague who uses
public transport, is using

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.400
your app anyway.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.160
So the conductors are totally
going to get used to it.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.610
RETO MEIER: No, that's
a good point.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.160
It would be nice to make
it more visible.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Same thing with
the order ticket button.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.180
I think that could be bigger and
a little further away from

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.040
the status bar.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.420
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think that would
make me a little more

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.060
comfortable.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:12.210
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.580
It might be useful to emphasize
the actions you want

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.710
people to take or the
information that they may need

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.530
and make that a little
more obvious.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.420
UI nitpick-- if you have tabs,
you should be able to swipe

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.660
between them.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.820
So you want to have that view
pager implementation on the

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.560
front page to swipe between
tickets and statistics.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't know why
we do tabs without view

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.260
pagers, you know?

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.560
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.680
We should just not allow it.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.090
RETO MEIER: So that's the only
other sort of nitpicky--

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.020
as well, when you've got
the notification--

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.690
so you've got when the ticket
will expire, valid from, code.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.790
I'd almost want to change it
around a little bit so that

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.010
you, again, made it a little
bit more obvious how long

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:50.870
until it expires.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.670
So you've got that countdown
that's indicated by red.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.100
I just want to see
like, 10 minutes.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.880
5:00.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.110
Whatever those two numbers are
should be kind of made bolder,

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.221
made more obvious.

00:34:03.221 --> 00:34:03.600
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.870
The orange stands for 20
minutes, and the red one

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.570
stands for last 10 minutes.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.980
And then it goes gray
for expired tickets.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.770
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.489
And beautifully, once I'm done
with my ticket, I can swipe it

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.396
away, probably after it's
expired, is that right?

00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:20.820
MALE SPEAKER: Mmhmm.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.440
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.540
That explains why I can't
get rid of it.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.760
So that's fine.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.889
And I'm guessing--

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.699
I haven't actually tried adding
multiple tickets.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.719
Yeah, nice.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:29.969
Let's add lots of tickets.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.670
I'm testing you.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.489
But that works nicely.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.469
Now, one thing that you may want
to consider, though, is

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.150
that if I do have a lot of
tickets-- and that's, in

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.550
fairness, probably not a
very common use case--

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.934
I risk flooding my
notification bar.

00:34:47.934 --> 00:34:51.290
So you may want to consider
collapsing that in so that

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.980
it's just got the latest
one and the

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.193
total number of tickets.

00:34:56.193 --> 00:34:56.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't know.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.170
How uncommon is that if you're
traveling with your family,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.580
for instance?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.880
You might buy four tickets
to the same place.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.830
MALE SPEAKER: But we still
can group them.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:05.610
RETO MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.400
If you group them by expiration
time, something

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.810
like that, I think that would
really work well.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that
would be great.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.430
RETO MEIER: Let's see.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.840
And they do dismiss.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.680
Perfect.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.420
So, yeah.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.090
Nicely done.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.710
I'm going to check to see if I
have any additional notes.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.240
Not really.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.870
I think the only real
issue we had was the

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.070
swiping between tabs.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.640
Everything else is nitpicky.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.770
Hopefully you'll find
some of that useful.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.980
But totally your call.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.880
And of course, one argument for
not swiping between the

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.330
tabs is that if you can dismiss
these tickets by

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.090
swiping them away, it might be
hard to distinguish between a

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.500
swipe on the ticket and
a swipe between tabs.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.420
But I think what we're really
asking people to do now is an

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.900
edge swipe.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.940
So if you've got something
where you're swiping

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.000
internally, then it's
understandable that that

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.120
gesture wouldn't switch between
tabs, but an edge

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.540
swipe always should.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:57.760
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.290
The stock tracker app that we
just looked at actually does

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.005
this really well for bringing
out the action.

00:36:03.005 --> 00:36:04.710
The draw at the side.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.900
It does sort of an edge swipe
for that, which works really,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.410
really well.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.710
Perfect.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.020
All right.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.220
So we shouldn't spend too much
more time on what is already a

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.150
really nice app.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.555
We want to be able to take a
look at a couple more in the

00:36:16.555 --> 00:36:17.580
time that we have available.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.230
So thank you very much, really
nicely done, and yeah.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.760
Let us know how you get on.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.100
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.350
Thanks a lot.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:30.790
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.690
The next speaker needs to jump
a little bit to get here.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.500
OK, so the next application
is Swim Places.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.200
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, guys.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.955
So, just to let you know,
I'm not a developer.

00:36:51.955 --> 00:36:58.980
I'm in charge of the project
management for BIPORT.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:04.640
And I'm the spokesperson
for them.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.910
I'm going to talk about our app
that conceived together.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.870
Oh, by the way, my name
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.950
That's one of the tough names.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.670
RETO MEIER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.314
MALE SPEAKER: Sort of.

00:37:18.314 --> 00:37:19.890
RETO MEIER: Everyone always
messes my name up.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.140
I'm allowed to mess
up other people's.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:27.500
MALE SPEAKER: And this app was
originally conceived by our

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.730
mate COEX, who designed the web

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.620
application for Swim Places.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:40.290
And one day, when we decided on
a hot day, when we decided

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.710
to go out swimming, and we
couldn't find anything, we

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.050
didn't have a computer
with us.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.123
We decided that we were going
to create the app.

00:37:48.123 --> 00:37:50.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
a good idea.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.380
MALE SPEAKER: It's a
non-commercial community app

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:59.760
which basically allows and
provides users with the option

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:06.900
to add places that they love
or discover new places that

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.360
they haven't visited yet.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.060
The target group is pretty
much wild swimming

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:18.720
enthusiasts, but also, that
doesn't mean skinny dippers.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.830
But it also does include them.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.820
RETO MEIER: It's not against
them, it's not for them, but

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.380
they're welcome.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.430
Excellent.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.160
MALE SPEAKER: They're
welcome to use it.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.710
Yeah.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.150
RETO MEIER: Let's take a look.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.160
You can't judge anyone's
preferences on me.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.700
So I guess one of the quick
questions I did want to ask--

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.570
so it sounds like all the places
that get added are

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.980
based on your community.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.240
So you're not sourcing data
from anywhere else.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.900
You're asking your users to add
places as they visit them,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.980
is that correct?

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.500
MALE SPEAKER: Correct.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.270
It's correct.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.350
The first couple were
added by us.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.560
The most known ones.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.370
But then the community picked
up, and basically is in charge

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.060
of adding everything.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.650
RETO MEIER: Perfect.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.320
OK.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.240
And that's what we can see.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.500
So if we look at our list-- so
I like that it knows where I

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.320
am, and gives me nearby places
based on my location.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.910
But it didn't turn
on the GPS, or at

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.860
least not that I noticed.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.930
So it was all done quite
quickly, quite quietly.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.850
I don't feel like it's draining
my battery for

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.340
something which it shouldn't
need to.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.460
So that's a really nice touch.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
that's good.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.630
These sorts of apps, you won't
really need a very accurate

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.900
location to be useful.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.590
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:26.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of course, this
one draws a pretty wide--

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.760
we've got all the way down from
San Diego up to Seattle.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.320
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.445
IAN NI-LEWIS: And Madison
Park Beach.

00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:33.750
I know that place.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.170
One of my best friends lives
two blocks from there.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.560
Well, he was my best friend
until I found out his wife was

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.935
working on the Kindle
Fire project, and

00:39:41.935 --> 00:39:42.780
now we don't talk.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.625
RETO MEIER: That was it.

00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:44.645
Well, what are you gonna do?

00:39:44.645 --> 00:39:47.720
MALE SPEAKER: Tell your
friend to add more?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.520
RETO MEIER: So that's kind of
our problem in terms of using

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.180
it is just that.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.950
Obviously there's not a big
community of Swim Places users

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.800
yet here in the Bay Area,
because I'm pretty sure that

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.450
there is a beach closer
than Pismo Beach.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
but you don't want

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.060
to swim around here.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.050
It's awful.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.800
RETO MEIER: That's
actually true.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Not in
the Bay, anyway.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.740
RETO MEIER: It's so cold here.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.260
There's the beautiful Pacific,
and we've got the Bay, and you

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.330
would just die.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.340
Then again, I'm talking to
people in Prague, so I'm

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.570
guessing if you enjoy outdoor
swimming, you don't have a

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.920
problem with getting cold.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: No.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.510
RETO MEIER: App looks nice.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.350
I think overall, you've
obviously got a

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.310
color scheme going.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.200
You've got the blue.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.800
It gets perhaps a little too
blue here, in that you've got

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.100
dark blue at the top, then a
lighter blue for your tabs,

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.130
and then a lighter blue for
each list item, and then a

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.660
slightly darker blue
for distances.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.680
What it means is that your
contrast is getting a little

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.760
washed out.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.730
The app seems to almost fall on
itself, where the bits of

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.930
white become almost
too pronounced.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.580
So this little white bar that
says Places Around Me in the

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.050
tiny, tiny text seems more
important than it is, because

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.310
it's one of the only pieces
of UI that isn't blue.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.300
So you want to be really careful
about how those color

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.610
choices and that color template
can affect the way

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.400
that people are looking
at the app.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.730
Overall, I feel like the
list items feel a

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.350
little bit too narrow.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:12.040
I'm not sure how high they
are, but they feel like

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.640
they're a little bit less
than 48 pixels.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.990
I'm not quite as good as Roman
when it comes to picking exact

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.110
pixel heights, but it feels
a little narrow.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:21.950
MALE SPEAKER: Possible.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.070
Possible.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.600
RETO MEIER: It's a really small
thing, but it makes a

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.820
real difference in terms of
how easy it is to click on

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.380
things and to navigate
through the app.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.500
So you want to make sure you're
at least 48 dps in

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.150
height for anything that
you want to touch.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Again, like on
the last app, we really

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.150
encourage you to use a view
pager so that you can swipe

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.470
between those tabs.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.760
At this point, that pattern is
so common that it feels wrong

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.820
when it's not there,
to me, anyway.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.460
And then the action
bar, I think.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:57.900
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.080
So it's an interesting choice.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.390
So I'm guessing this is
a split action bar

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.170
implementation?

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.370
I'm not entirely sure, but it
feels like these buttons could

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.450
just as happily live at the top
as part of the standard

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.620
action bar.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.020
MALE SPEAKER: Well, basically,
they're at the bottom, since

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.660
we couldn't really fit them next
to the tabs there already

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.170
on the top.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.450
And it changes when
you flip it.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.630
When you flip it 90 degrees,
it changes and

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.650
it goes to the top.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:29.950
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:30.770
And that makes sense.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.190
So you are using the
split action bar.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.330
It's a legitimate pattern.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.960
It can be, at times, a little
bit disconcerting to have the

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.760
things along the bottom.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.070
It is a standard pattern,
so I can understand

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.840
why you've done that.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.040
Again, you probably want to
see if you can lose the

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.230
refresh button.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.930
It doesn't seem like an app
that's going to be refreshing

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:52.390
data so rapidly that a user is
going to want to have to

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:53.900
manually do a refresh.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.870
It makes sense an instant
messaging or in email, where

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:58.330
you're waiting for an
email, so you keep

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.460
pressing the button.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.560
I think the update rate for
this is going to be much

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.780
slower, so you're better off
doing maybe a server push,

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.790
again, using Google
Cloud Messaging.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.285
When something gets updated, you
send it out to all of the

00:43:10.285 --> 00:43:12.910
phones to tell them, hey,
there's some new locations.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.340
You may even want to include
the location of the newly

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.800
added spot in that Google Cloud
Messaging payload, so

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.410
then the app only needs to
do an update now if that

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.660
application is near
where the user is.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.430
So if it's 1,000 kilometers
away, don't worry.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.860
We'll do the update later.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.890
If it's right next door, hey,
maybe that's going to be

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.370
interesting to them.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, unless
you're phenomenally wealthy.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: So Sergei would
use that, I think.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:41.935
RETO MEIER: Sure, sure.

00:43:41.935 --> 00:43:43.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: But
other than that.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.910
RETO MEIER: For the rest
of us, not so much.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.440
Your list views as well-- so
you've got a lot of content in

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.180
each of these, and it seems
like some of it may be

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.410
duplicated.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:56.340
So I'm not entirely sure what
the icons on the left mean.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.610
I'm guessing it's the
kind of place.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.930
So the sea shell means the sea,
the Loch Ness Monster

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.540
means a lake.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.760
Is that the idea?

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.300
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.180
RETO MEIER: That's
really nice.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.800
I really like that.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.990
I like the visualness of it.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.080
Makes it much easier
to see at a glance.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: I like that it's
both color coded and--

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.030
RETO MEIER: Yes, it's
a picture and a

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.580
color, which is nice.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.490
But it does mean you're
duplicating data.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.290
So I don't need to
see the word sea

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.270
next to the sea shell.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.050
Like, you should just train your
users so they understand

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.980
that that's what that means.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.890
And certainly when you click
through to details, it's

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:31.400
useful then to say what it is,
just so that they can learn

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.210
what those different
icons mean.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.720
But on this main screen, I want
to see the name of the

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.280
beach be bigger, basically.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.390
Make it easier to read,
easier to see.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.610
That's the main piece of
information that you're trying

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:43.240
to pass on.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Same with
the distance, I think.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:45.420
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Especially here,
where we've got some beaches

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.870
that are relatively close,
and then some that

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:50.880
are very far away.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.650
It would be useful to
have the distance

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:53.750
a little more scannable.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.610
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.980
One other thing that you may
want to do-- so if I navigate

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.120
in, I have the ability to
hit map or navigation.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.680
Really nice touch.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.290
I would consider adding the
navigation action to this main

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.800
list view on the right hand
side, because if I was using

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.000
the app, a lot of the time,
that's what I'm going to do.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.770
So if I'm driving upward down
the Pacific coast, and I want

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:18.280
to watch the sun set at a beach,
I'm going to take a

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.180
look at this, look for all of
the pink things, and the

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.750
nearest one I find, I'm just
going to hit navigate to find

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.530
out how to drive there.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.580
So again, this depends
on your use case.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.980
So this is a really good example
of why analytics can

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.940
be useful, to find out, well,
what percentage of your users

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.570
are going through here and
straight away clicking

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.740
navigation?

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.110
If that's a common use case,
then that's something you want

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.000
to promote.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.850
And similarly, try to decide--

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.520
and this is kind of good advice
for most developers--

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.090
decide what do you want
your users to do?

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.610
What are the main actions?

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.030
What counts as success?

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.540
So do you want them to go
through and read as many of

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.660
these as possible, or add
photos, or use it to navigate?

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.140
What are those primary
actions?

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.222
And make that as simple as
possible for them to achieve.

00:46:02.222 --> 00:46:03.210
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.770
As of now, we mostly want them
to add as much information as

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.512
possible, upload photos.

00:46:09.512 --> 00:46:11.940
The navigation is
just a candy.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.660
RETO MEIER: Just nice to have?

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:13.920
I get that.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.840
And so that's good advice.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.930
So then what you may want to do
is consider adding one of

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.410
those actions to this main
screen so that you can say,

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:22.540
oh, I'm at that beach.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.910
So you just open it up, you go
oh, the one at the top is

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.620
where I'm at, and have the
button there to add photos

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.180
directly from it.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.750
Obviously, that introduces a UI
challenge, and making it a

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.430
little bit more cluttered.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.300
So you may only want to add that
button for the item at

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.090
the very top of the list.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.440
But it's something
to consider.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.480
You want to reduce the number
of clicks between the user

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.810
opening your app and performing
whatever action you

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.430
want them to perform.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.870
So similarly, you've got
the ad here, which

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.470
is for adding places.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.340
Obviously, that's the main thing
that you want them to

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.570
do, to build up that
community.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:47:01.570
So that may be another example
of why it may make sense to

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:02.820
have that at the top.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.430
Because when most people are
opening the app, they're

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.170
expecting the main actions
to be up here.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.430
And so by not having it there,
it makes it a little bit less

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.830
likely that they hit
that plus button.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:14.240
You may even want to go a step
further, and if that really is

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.130
the most important thing for
the app, is to have a big

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.880
button somewhere maybe above
the list view, which

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.010
encourages them to do that
first and foremost.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:26.830
Now, I wouldn't always do that,
but you can tell how

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:27.490
important that is.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.980
So in Prague, you've got
probably most of the important

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.270
swimming places there,
strong community.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:33.130
It's less important.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.400
So definitely don't show
it to people in Prague.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.840
Here in California, most of the
things here are missing.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.730
And so I open this app and I go,
well, this isn't actually

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.575
that useful to me, because
there's nowhere nearby.

00:47:43.575 --> 00:47:45.970
But if the first thing up at
the top of the screen was

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.785
actually a button asking
me to add places,

00:47:47.785 --> 00:47:49.280
well, that I can do.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.075
I know a bunch of places around
here that I can add.

00:47:52.075 --> 00:47:52.740
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a great point.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.730
Well, do add them.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.250
RETO MEIER: I will.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.270
I will set that as an action
item for myself.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.812
But that's my point is that you
want to make it obvious to

00:48:00.812 --> 00:48:03.220
the user, what do you
want from me to do?

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.030
And then I can decide whether
that's something that is

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.350
useful and interesting for me.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.400
So maybe have a look.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.040
If there's nowhere within
100 kilometers, make

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.960
that the main option.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.290
Just say, please help
grow our community.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.050
People love that
sort of thing.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:20.020
So that may be something
to consider.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.190
MALE SPEAKER: Good point.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, for the ad
screen, this might just be me,

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:30.330
but I really feel like you'd get
a better user experience,

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:36.240
and possibly more additions if
the first thing was a map.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:42.810
Because you have this nice
positional thing, but what I

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:46.810
really want to do is-- the first
thing is I wanted to

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.290
point to it on a map, and then
fill in information.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.470
The problem with this screen is
that the very first thing I

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:57.980
see is three or four
text boxes and

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.920
the on screen keyboard.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.475
And that immediately says to
me, oh my god, I'm going to

00:49:02.475 --> 00:49:06.360
have to do a lot of typing, and
I'm not into right now.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.880
I think I'll just go and
do something else.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.720
RETO MEIER: Yeah, that's
a good point.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.600
Because this is what you
get straight away.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.220
All you see is the text, and
you're like, oh, I just wanted

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.660
to-- thing.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.520
So what Ian's saying is
a really good point.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.100
If this was the very first
thing-- so as soon as you

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.000
click in here, you see a map
with an icon next to a quarry

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.710
or a lake that I'm in,
it's like, OK, great.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.000
So I click that, and then the
next thing I get is it asks me

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.860
for a name and stuff.

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.190
And hopefully, as much of this
is optional as possible, so

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.300
that you can just say, yeah,
it's the Pacific Ocean.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do we still
have the Places API that

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.030
they can look up?

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.000
RETO MEIER: I think
we do, yeah.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: We used to
be able to do that.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.240
RETO MEIER: I think that there's
still an API from

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.930
Google-- a Places API that
allows you to search for

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.420
points of interest.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.410
You may be able to use something
like that to help

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:50.580
make suggestions
for your users.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Help auto fill.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:52.470
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.460
I don't think you're able to use
the data itself, but you

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:58.020
can use it as a way to suggest
places that people can then

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.560
fill in the data themselves.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.970
But do check the API terms of
service, because I don't want

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.220
to steer you in the
wrong direction.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.410
MALE SPEAKER: I'll
look into it.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.675
RETO MEIER: Otherwise, all
this is really nice.

00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:09.460
Are you sure you
want to cancel?

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.080
Ah, so this is a really
interesting dialog.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.500
Do you really want to cancel?

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.110
All inserted data
will be lost.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.941
And if I hit cancel,
it doesn't cancel.

00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:21.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because it's
cancelling a cancel.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:22.960
RETO MEIER: Be careful
with that.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.690
MALE SPEAKER: All right, we
got a bug right there.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.350
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.330
So make sure that you're
getting that right.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:31.370
I always forget what the correct
button order is here.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.630
I think you've got it right, but
make sure that you've got

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.600
the yes no in the right order.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.710
It's all detailed in
the style guide.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: And maybe stay and
leave would be better than

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.900
cancel and leave in this
case, because--

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.190
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.840
You just want two objective
things which it's clear which

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.730
button is going to make you go
away, and which button is

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:51.860
going to make the go away
button go away.

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: Also, I would
suggest not showing that

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.550
dialog if the user hasn't
actually entered in any

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:56.930
information.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:57.655
RETO MEIER: That's
a good point.

00:50:57.655 --> 00:51:01.310
If there's no data to lose, then
there's no reason not to

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.880
just let them back out.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in point of
fact, unless that becomes

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:11.020
non-editable later, the absolute
best user experience

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:16.410
is, if I haven't entered any
data, leave without prompting.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.890
If I have entered data, save
that data and leave without

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.040
prompting, and then allow me to
delete the data that I've

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.170
entered if it turns out that
I didn't actually want it.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.050
And that covers the 90% use case
with the least amount of

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.880
intrusive dialogs.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.220
RETO MEIER: Otherwise, all of
the details are reasonable.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.180
The only issue here I have is
you've got these custom

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.760
colored buttons along
the bottom here.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.540
In this example, I'm not sure
that it does make sense.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.305
They just feel a
little garish.

00:51:47.305 --> 00:51:50.220
The colors are really strong,
particularly around defaults.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.640
This makes me think defaults may
do something really bad.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.920
Big, bright red button,
like, seriously red.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.990
I think that's 25500 red.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.520
It's like composing in Gmail.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.380
That's dangerous.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.760
RETO MEIER: That's a big deal.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.980
If nothing else, it makes it
seem like these are the two

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.750
most important things on the
screen, and that show is going

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.190
to do something magical, whereas
all it's really going

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.890
to do is apply my
filters, right?

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.320
Which is perfectly appropriate,
but I don't think

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.760
that it's necessary to have
them differently colored.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.210
Let's see.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.040
So-- oops.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.930
So this is one of the dangers of
having all of your actions

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.470
right here at the bottom,
is it's really easy to

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.860
accidentally click
the wrong thing.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:38.230
So I totally did that
on purpose to

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.770
demonstrate that point.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.110
Search.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.490
It would be nice to have
search as inline--

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:45.490
so an action bar search
rather than

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:47.710
popping up its own screen.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.830
Particularly, that way you can
see what is already there

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:53.940
before we start searching and
having auto complete in that

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.950
would be nice as well.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:57.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: I actualy feel
that way about filters, too.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.830
I think it's a little harder
to do, but especially when

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.250
your filter is just a list of
check boxes, if you can pop it

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.130
over, like drop it down from
the top, or put it in the

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:10.000
bottom so that you can
see the results.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.490
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.570
And one thing that you may want
to consider trying-- so

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.190
I'm not entirely sure how useful
this would be, given

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.350
that we don't have so much
local information, but it

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.750
might be interesting to apply
filters by basically pivoting

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:23.510
on the information
that you have.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.880
And so if I click on the
seashell icon, I hit the icon

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.610
specifically, maybe that just
shows me all of the sea.

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:33.880
So it applies that filter that
way, rather than having to go

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.470
through the second screen.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.160
Again, I think that's something
you probably want to

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.700
beta test with people to see
if that means that they get

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.930
lost, and they don't know
how to go back.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:43.910
But something like that as a
way of being able to click

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.570
here, get a list of all of the
lakes, and if I hit back, it

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.000
takes me back to the main screen
that's unfiltered.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.165
I think that would be
really interesting.

00:53:50.165 --> 00:53:51.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: I would get
lost on the list.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.380
I might be OK with that
on the second screen.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.140
RETO MEIER: On the
second screen ?

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:55.670
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's tough.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.530
RETO MEIER: It's interesting.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.785
Again, basically, what we're
trying to come up with here

00:54:00.785 --> 00:54:03.550
are ways to reduce the
number of clicks to

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.420
implement any behavior.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.740
So the problem here is if I hit
filter, that's one, and

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.010
then I have to unclick a bunch
of these so that I can just

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.030
get the one that I want.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:17.616
Or I can do one, two, three--

00:54:17.616 --> 00:54:21.830
so it's taken me four buttons
to get there, and it doesn't

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.040
actually look like
it's applied my

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.040
filter, which is upsetting.

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Also, I'm
wondering why I have a long

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:36.000
list of filters with text when I
thought you were training me

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.840
to use these really
pretty icons.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.220
And if it had been with the
icon, then you might even be

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:46.390
able to group them a little
closer together.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:50.770
My main issue with the text is
that you've got a bunch of

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.030
check boxes, and you have to
scroll up and down to actually

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.180
use the filter.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.730
You don't want to pack things
tightly and make them

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.720
impossible to use, but let's say
that, for instance, if you

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.420
had just the buttons that you
could turn on and off, and you

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.960
were highlighting them
in some way to make

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.470
them active and inactive--

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.820
Reto, you need a
new microphone?

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.830
RETO MEIER: I'm struggling
today.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Is he blowing
out your ears every

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.310
time he does that?

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:15.765
Boom.

00:55:15.765 --> 00:55:17.585
Aah!

00:55:17.585 --> 00:55:18.040
RETO MEIER: Apologies.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.040
I need to figure
out something.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:25.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: But again, just
minimizing the amount of

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.720
scrolling would be
really great.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.250
But yeah.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:34.530
I could literally see just a big
box at the bottom of your

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.980
results list with all those
icons in it, and I could just

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.610
turn them on and off and see
the results immediately.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:42.550
That would be awesome.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.540
That would be magical,
I think.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.510
Would that be magical?

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:46.352
RETO MEIER: I think it
could be magical.

00:55:46.352 --> 00:55:46.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.610
He knows what magic
is, don't you?

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.180
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.770
So otherwise, really nice.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:52.360
I really like the community
aspect.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.970
I like the general UI.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.230
I like the functionality.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:57.050
Huge potential.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.630
I think there's a few little
things which could make a big

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.790
difference.

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.330
So we're going to, again, put
some of these nitpicky stuff

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.940
in an email, send it through
so that you have all of our

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.000
feedback in one place.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.750
We'd love to see
how you get on.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.335
And I'll add some local swimming
spots, I promise.

00:56:11.335 --> 00:56:13.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
it's really cool.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.450
Just last thing, because we say
this about any app that

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:20.040
has community is, you might want
to think about hooking

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.070
into more communities--

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:25.350
so having some more information
about your users.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:27.860
Maybe hook into Google+.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.400
You might think about it.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.895
RETO MEIER: You could consider
a Google+ login so you could

00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:35.255
share the swimming places
with your friends.

00:56:35.255 --> 00:56:36.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: With your
circles or whatever.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.326
RETO MEIER: Be kind of cool.

00:56:38.326 --> 00:56:38.860
All right, nice.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.980
Thank you.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.420
MALE SPEAKER: All right, well,
thank you very much.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.996
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thank you.

00:56:42.996 --> 00:56:45.070
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
thanks a lot.

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:49.800
So I would like to thank both
of you for participating in

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.160
this, and organizing
this with us.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.745
We are proud to be
first GDG in the

00:56:52.745 --> 00:56:55.035
world to host App Clinic.

00:56:55.035 --> 00:56:55.870
RETO MEIER: Woot.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.870
Thank you very much
for having us.

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:01.120
It's been really rewarding,
really interesting, and great

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.960
to see that Prague developers
continue to be some of the

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.320
most talented app developers
in the world.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:06.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:10.170
Thank you for giving us apps
that we didn't hate.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.530
You don't know how hard
our job is sometimes.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.470
Today, it was easy.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:14.720
Thank you.
