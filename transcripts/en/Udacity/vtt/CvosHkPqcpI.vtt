00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:02.850
So now, since we're talking about the incremental and iterative

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.950
nature of the Rational Unified Process, let's have a quiz on

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.460
the benefits of iterative approaches. So I'd like for you to tell

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.710
me what are these benefits. Is one benefit the fact that

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.129
iterative approaches keep developers busy or maybe that they give developers

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.480
early feedback, that they allow for doing the same thing over

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.930
and over in an iterative way. Maybe they also minimize the

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.210
risk of developing the wrong system. Can they be used to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.170
improve planning, or is it the benefit

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.160
that they accommodate evolving requirements. Also, in this

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.360
case, I would like for you to check all the answers that you think are correct.
