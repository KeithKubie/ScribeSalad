00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
you just need to sort of figure out what
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.570
you just need to sort of figure out what
the what the main screen would mean and

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.580
the what the main screen would mean and
 

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.310

all seem like there should be you know

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:18.820
all seem like there should be you know
 

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.699
all seem like there should be you know
the actions for other than being on the

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:20.709
the actions for other than being on the
 

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:23.130
the actions for other than being on the
on the home screen but the question

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.140
on the home screen but the question
 

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.590
on the home screen but the question
there would have to be you know what

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600
there would have to be you know what
 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.820
there would have to be you know what
what is the home screen what would you

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:26.830
what is the home screen what would you
 

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.500
what is the home screen what would you
go into or what are your thoughts there

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:28.510
go into or what are your thoughts there
 

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.620
go into or what are your thoughts there
i think that that's i think for this

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.630
i think that that's i think for this
 

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.670
i think that that's i think for this
particular app since you can either view

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680
particular app since you can either view
 

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.040

debt or add that I think you know it's
 

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.819
debt or add that I think you know it's
probably okay to have the high level of

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:41.829
probably okay to have the high level of
 

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:44.400
probably okay to have the high level of
the most likely used items surfaced up

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.410
the most likely used items surfaced up
 

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.370
the most likely used items surfaced up
on the same screen but you probably want

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:47.380
on the same screen but you probably want
 

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.580
on the same screen but you probably want
to put some thoughts into how to

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:49.590
to put some thoughts into how to
 

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.860
to put some thoughts into how to
has arranged the different icons yeah

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:51.870
has arranged the different icons yeah
 

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.680
has arranged the different icons yeah
okay so let's switch to the to the

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:54.690
okay so let's switch to the to the
 

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.510
okay so let's switch to the to the
tablet you guys number i got this out

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:56.520
tablet you guys number i got this out
 

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.300
tablet you guys number i got this out
later on yeah so this is you know as you

00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.310
later on yeah so this is you know as you
 

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.340
later on yeah so this is you know as you
can expect a widened view of what we

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:01.350
can expect a widened view of what we
 

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.840
can expect a widened view of what we
just looked at on the Galaxy Nexus

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:02.850
just looked at on the Galaxy Nexus
 

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.200
just looked at on the Galaxy Nexus
device so there are two versions right

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.210
device so there are two versions right
 

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.390
device so there are two versions right
what we look at is the free at sponsored

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:08.400
what we look at is the free at sponsored
 

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.940
what we look at is the free at sponsored
version and you can see the ads up here

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:10.950
version and you can see the ads up here
 

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.000
version and you can see the ads up here
down here actually rather it's actually

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
down here actually rather it's actually
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.670
down here actually rather it's actually
in terms of the ad type is the same size

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680
in terms of the ad type is the same size
 

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.920
in terms of the ad type is the same size
as the one but that was on that little

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:18.930
as the one but that was on that little
 

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.590
as the one but that was on that little
smaller screen device and so you can

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600
smaller screen device and so you can
 

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.680
smaller screen device and so you can
think of you know using a bigger ad type

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:24.690
think of you know using a bigger ad type
 

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.090
think of you know using a bigger ad type
if available in the particular ad

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100
if available in the particular ad
 

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.010
if available in the particular ad
network to sort of fill up the

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.020
network to sort of fill up the
 

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.500
network to sort of fill up the
application a little bit more it sounds

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.510
application a little bit more it sounds
 

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.000
application a little bit more it sounds
it sounds almost counterintuitive to

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.010
it sounds almost counterintuitive to
 

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.190
it sounds almost counterintuitive to
make a bigger ad but in this case it

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200
make a bigger ad but in this case it
 

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.590
make a bigger ad but in this case it
would actually look better all right so

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600
would actually look better all right so
 

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.690
would actually look better all right so
I think it's definitely worth doing yeah

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700
I think it's definitely worth doing yeah
 

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.670
I think it's definitely worth doing yeah
because of the bigger screen and also

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680
because of the bigger screen and also
 

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.040
because of the bigger screen and also
the size of icons we just sort of

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.050
the size of icons we just sort of
 

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.900
the size of icons we just sort of
similar to and earlier comment on the

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:44.910
similar to and earlier comment on the
 

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.640
similar to and earlier comment on the
size of icons here but on a bigger

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:46.650
size of icons here but on a bigger
 

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.700
size of icons here but on a bigger
screen it becomes more parents that the

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:49.710
screen it becomes more parents that the
 

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.130
screen it becomes more parents that the
icons are too small probably on this

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:52.140
icons are too small probably on this
 

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.970
icons are too small probably on this
screen size absolutely yeah so let's

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980
screen size absolutely yeah so let's
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.670
screen size absolutely yeah so let's
have a look at payments log so i have

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680
have a look at payments log so i have
 

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.370
have a look at payments log so i have
created a few payments before the

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380
created a few payments before the
 

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.350
created a few payments before the
hangout as i was playing around with the

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360
hangout as i was playing around with the
 

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.720
hangout as i was playing around with the
application and you have a list video

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:05.730
application and you have a list video
 

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.650
application and you have a list video
showing all the available payment

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:08.660
showing all the available payment
 

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.130
showing all the available payment
records and when I tap on it I was on an

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.140
records and when I tap on it I was on an
 

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.750
records and when I tap on it I was on an
assumption that I would actually go into

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760
assumption that I would actually go into
 

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.760
assumption that I would actually go into
the detail of the payment but instead a

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:16.770
the detail of the payment but instead a
 

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.520
the detail of the payment but instead a
pop-up came up and which gate which

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.530
pop-up came up and which gate which
 

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.550
pop-up came up and which gate which
gives me an edit or delete options so I

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560
gives me an edit or delete options so I
 

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.790
gives me an edit or delete options so I
think it would make sense to probably do

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
think it would make sense to probably do
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.160
think it would make sense to probably do
the Edit payments as soon as you tap on

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.170
the Edit payments as soon as you tap on
 

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.960
the Edit payments as soon as you tap on
one of the list views and you get to

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:29.970
one of the list views and you get to
 

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.940
one of the list views and you get to
this screen and then somewhere on this

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:31.950
this screen and then somewhere on this
 

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.830
this screen and then somewhere on this
screen you exposed to delete payment

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:33.840
screen you exposed to delete payment
 

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.260
screen you exposed to delete payment
option the other users to delete if they

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:36.270
option the other users to delete if they
 

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.750
option the other users to delete if they
want it to be so what are your thoughts

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760
want it to be so what are your thoughts
 

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.380
want it to be so what are your thoughts
on that David

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:44.390
 
 

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.990
 
I just want to talk more about the

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000
I just want to talk more about the
 

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.100
I just want to talk more about the
dashboard pattern yeah everything should

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.110
dashboard pattern yeah everything should
 

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.590
dashboard pattern yeah everything should
be actions when I plot of actions that

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600
be actions when I plot of actions that
 

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.230
be actions when I plot of actions that
are already so I was thinking that it

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240
are already so I was thinking that it
 

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.300
are already so I was thinking that it
will be too confusing everything in the

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.310
will be too confusing everything in the
 

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.660
will be too confusing everything in the
action bar and like these four functions

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:01.670
action bar and like these four functions
 

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.700
action bar and like these four functions
are like what I'm pitching to the user

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:03.710
are like what I'm pitching to the user
 

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.980
are like what I'm pitching to the user
which is ok I mean that's a fair home

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:08.990
which is ok I mean that's a fair home
 

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.740
which is ok I mean that's a fair home
it's what we found is one of the reasons

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:11.750
it's what we found is one of the reasons
 

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.800
it's what we found is one of the reasons
why the dashboard pattern is is becoming

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:14.810
why the dashboard pattern is is becoming
 

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.960
why the dashboard pattern is is becoming
less counterintuitive is because it kind

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:16.970
less counterintuitive is because it kind
 

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.720
less counterintuitive is because it kind
of it works in in your instance but but

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:19.730
of it works in in your instance but but
 

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.370
of it works in in your instance but but
kind of that that's almost the edge case

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:21.380
kind of that that's almost the edge case
 

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.350
kind of that that's almost the edge case
as soon as you have more than sort of

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360
as soon as you have more than sort of
 

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.570
as soon as you have more than sort of
four things it's not clear how you

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:25.580
four things it's not clear how you
 

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.220
four things it's not clear how you
expand that and if you look at it on the

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.230
expand that and if you look at it on the
 

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.600
expand that and if you look at it on the
tablet in particular it's a great

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:28.610
tablet in particular it's a great
 

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.580
tablet in particular it's a great
example because you've got sort of your

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.590
example because you've got sort of your
 

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.500
example because you've got sort of your
four icons sort of swimming in the

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:32.510
four icons sort of swimming in the
 

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.110
four icons sort of swimming in the
middle of this large space and so that

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120
middle of this large space and so that
 

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.100
middle of this large space and so that
you know that's one of the challenges

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.110
you know that's one of the challenges
 

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.340
you know that's one of the challenges
that you have when when you're using

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:39.350
that you have when when you're using
 

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.770
that you have when when you're using
dashboard you know certainly does give

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:41.780
dashboard you know certainly does give
 

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.240
dashboard you know certainly does give
you the the right sort of pathway into

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.250
you the the right sort of pathway into
 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.460
you the the right sort of pathway into
showing what the key elements are but if

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:45.470
showing what the key elements are but if
 

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.600
showing what the key elements are but if
you have a look at something like google

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:46.610
you have a look at something like google
 

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.310
you have a look at something like google
maps which does something similar like

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320
maps which does something similar like
 

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.350
maps which does something similar like
it's they've got like a bunch of sort of

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360
it's they've got like a bunch of sort of
 

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.780
it's they've got like a bunch of sort of
sub apps within there's like latitude

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:52.790
sub apps within there's like latitude
 

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.030
sub apps within there's like latitude
and places and all those things all

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040
and places and all those things all
 

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.370
and places and all those things all
available from that spinner that that

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:57.380
available from that spinner that that
 

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.930
available from that spinner that that
tends to be more of a preferred way

00:14:58.930 --> 00:14:58.940
tends to be more of a preferred way
 

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.520
tends to be more of a preferred way
because it scales better and it makes it

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:00.530
because it scales better and it makes it
 

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.990
because it scales better and it makes it
easier for you to figure out how you're

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000
easier for you to figure out how you're
 

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.190
easier for you to figure out how you're
going to make that layout work on

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:03.200
going to make that layout work on
 

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.490
going to make that layout work on
tablets in principle it's fine but like

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:06.500
tablets in principle it's fine but like
 

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.020
tablets in principle it's fine but like
I say if you look at the tablet version

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.030
I say if you look at the tablet version
 

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.610
I say if you look at the tablet version
you can see where the drawbacks are you

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:09.620
you can see where the drawbacks are you
 

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.620
you can see where the drawbacks are you
just got this for little icons and in

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:11.630
just got this for little icons and in
 

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:17.380
just got this for little icons and in
the middle of the screen yeah it's too

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:17.390
the middle of the screen yeah it's too
 

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.240
the middle of the screen yeah it's too
much these fragments and stuff for

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.250
much these fragments and stuff for
 

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.689
much these fragments and stuff for
example good night

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:21.699
example good night
 

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:23.669
example good night
yeah the last thing I want to point out

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:23.679
yeah the last thing I want to point out
 

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:26.299
yeah the last thing I want to point out
is that under the overflow menu you have

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:26.309
is that under the overflow menu you have
 

00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:29.429
is that under the overflow menu you have
remove ads and more it's an upsell

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:29.439
remove ads and more it's an upsell
 

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:32.519
remove ads and more it's an upsell
option basically directing the user via

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:32.529
option basically directing the user via
 

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:35.879
option basically directing the user via
an intent to goo what do so you go

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:35.889
an intent to goo what do so you go
 

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:38.039
an intent to goo what do so you go
through this dialog box and then if the

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:38.049
through this dialog box and then if the
 

00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:40.769
through this dialog box and then if the
user hits by you bring the user to the

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:40.779
user hits by you bring the user to the
 

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:43.559
user hits by you bring the user to the
google play store with the peg as the

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:43.569
google play store with the peg as the
 

00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:46.530
google play store with the peg as the
paid version of your application so this

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:46.540
paid version of your application so this
 

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.599
paid version of your application so this
is for totally perfect implementation

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:48.609
is for totally perfect implementation
 

00:15:48.609 --> 00:15:50.159
is for totally perfect implementation
but also you know one thing that you can

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:50.169
but also you know one thing that you can
 

00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:52.639
but also you know one thing that you can
consider using is in app purchase

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:52.649
consider using is in app purchase
 

00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:55.019
consider using is in app purchase
available for applications and the

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:55.029
available for applications and the
 

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:57.299
available for applications and the
second thing they like to point out is

00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:57.309
second thing they like to point out is
 

00:15:57.309 --> 00:16:00.090
second thing they like to point out is
that it's more for the intent flag so

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.100
that it's more for the intent flag so
 

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.759
that it's more for the intent flag so
really as if you remember from settle

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:02.769
really as if you remember from settle
 

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:05.400
really as if you remember from settle
app now that we are at the Google Play

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.410
app now that we are at the Google Play
 

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.720
app now that we are at the Google Play
client you can think of it as an

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:06.730
client you can think of it as an
 

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.789
client you can think of it as an
activity stack so if the user at this

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:08.799
activity stack so if the user at this
 

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:12.479
activity stack so if the user at this
point tabs on home it goes back to the

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:12.489
point tabs on home it goes back to the
 

00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:14.789
point tabs on home it goes back to the
home screen as expected but if the user

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:14.799
home screen as expected but if the user
 

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:20.280
home screen as expected but if the user
goes back to settle up now this previous

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.290
goes back to settle up now this previous
 

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.429
goes back to settle up now this previous
scene Google Play client popped up

00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:23.439
scene Google Play client popped up
 

00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:25.739

interesting android oh okay yeah hey at

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640
interesting android oh okay yeah hey at
 

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.160
interesting android oh okay yeah hey at
the end it's kind of and my

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.170
the end it's kind of and my
 

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.800
the end it's kind of and my
understanding is that for some

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:37.810
understanding is that for some
 

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.820

characters you have to swipe on one of
 

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.360
characters you have to swipe on one of
the keys so it's it's not obvious if I

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:46.370
the keys so it's it's not obvious if I
 

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.340
the keys so it's it's not obvious if I
that's the backspace this wiring so I

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:48.350
that's the backspace this wiring so I
 

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.410
that's the backspace this wiring so I
think that way is giving me gee it's

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:50.420
think that way is giving me gee it's
 

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.030
think that way is giving me gee it's
interesting interesting and anta doesn't

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.040
interesting interesting and anta doesn't
 

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.750
interesting interesting and anta doesn't
really give me a every time but if you

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760
really give me a every time but if you
 

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.790
really give me a every time but if you
switch to you'll be able to switch how I

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:00.800

do that but I think that's a view where

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:06.740
do that but I think that's a view where
 

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.990
do that but I think that's a view where
there's a help screen but I think one

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000
there's a help screen but I think one
 

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.780
there's a help screen but I think one

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.930
sort of feedback from a technical angle
is that when you tap on any of these

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:16.940
is that when you tap on any of these
 

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.560
is that when you tap on any of these
keys you don't get the visual feedback

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:19.570
