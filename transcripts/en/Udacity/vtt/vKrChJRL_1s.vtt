00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.200
Your final project in this mini course
is to create a portfolio optimizer.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
That might sound like a tough problem,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.750
but you've already got
the tools to do it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.990
In this short lesson, we're going to
lay the groundwork to help you know

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.210
what portfolio optimization is and
how to build one.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.700
First, what is portfolio optimization?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.900
Given a set of assets and a time period,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640
find an allocation of funds to
assets that maximizes performance.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.820
What is performance?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.170
We could choose from a number of
metrics, including cumulative return,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.740
volatility or risk, and risk adjusted
return, which is Sharpe ratio [LAUGH].

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.760
You can use any criteria you like,
but for this assignment,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.020
we're going to focus on Sharpe ratio.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.700
Now, let me show you how to use
a minimizer to optimize a portfolio.
