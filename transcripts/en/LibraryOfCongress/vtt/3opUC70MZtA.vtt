00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.950
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
I'm very pleased

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.830
to launch the program this
morning with a few words

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.360
of welcome from the Library.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.740
Mark Sweeney was named
Acting Deputy Librarian

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.750
of Congress soon after the
appointment of Carla Hayden

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.070
as the new Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.370
Previously, Mark served

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.550
as the Associate Librarian
for Library Services.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.110
This position, in essence,
is the National Librarian.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.250
He was responsible and
still is for carrying

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.790
out Library Services' mission
which is to acquire, organize,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.470
provide access to, maintain,
secure and preserve the Library

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.720
of Congress' universal
collection

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.890
of over 140 million items.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.010
This vast collection
contributes to the advancement

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.040
of civilization and knowledge
throughout the world.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.070
Documents the history and
culture of the United States

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.630
and records and supports
the creativity

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.950
of the American people.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.570
Mark is one of us.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.880
He hails from McGill University
and has worked his way

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.350
through the ranks of the
Library beginning in 1987 --

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.700
I know that was a
long time ago --

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.670
in the serial and government
publications division.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.730
He soon advanced to Coordinator

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.320
of the very important United
States Newspaper Program

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.900
and then to Chief
of the Humanities

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.210
and Social Sciences Division of
the Library of Congress and then

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.670
to the Director of the Library's
Preservation Program before he

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.290
moved into the Associate
Librarian position.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.330
He is a valiant advocate
of the collections

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.420
and it was his support
in large part

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.040
which made this symposium
possible.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.790
So please welcome
Acting Deputy Librarian

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.590
of Congress Mark Sweeney.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:09.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.540
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
morning, everyone.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.610
It's my pleasure to
welcome you to the Library

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.850
of Congress' Symposium,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.430
Imagining the Extraordinary
Scientific Illustration

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.360
from the Renaissance
to the Digital Age.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.590
Over the next two days,
you will hear from experts

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.240
across the humanities, the arts

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.410
and sciences discuss
the different ways

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.520
that creative scientific
illustration has extended the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.200
reach of human understanding
about the natural world.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.260
And as Mark mentioned
later today,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.090
you'll have an exciting
opportunity to view select items

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.840
from our Rare Book Collection
both historical and contemporary

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.440
that intersect and
illustrate discovery.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.740
So it's really a remarkable
opportunity for you,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.040
if I hope you have
an opportunity

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.390
to take advantage of that.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.820
So in many ways, this symposium
speaks to what makes the Library

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.460
of Congress such a
unique institution.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.320
As the largest library in the
world, we maintain stewardship

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.340
over millions of items in
a dizzying array of topics.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.080
And with over 20 reading rooms,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.950
our expert staff
have an opportunity

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.200
to make this incredibly
vast collection accessible.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.630
Sometimes, it's challenging
to find creative ways

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.880
to bring our different
expertise into the conversation

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.260
and to share the
Library's vast physical

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.130
and intellectual
resources with users.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.030
Imagining the Extraordinary,
today's program and tomorrow's,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.460
speaks to this primary mission.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.320
Inspired by Library collection,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.840
this symposium brings
together experts

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.980
from multiple disciplines
to talk about everything

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.140
from the unimaginably large
to the inconceivably small.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.240
I really want to thank
and acknowledge staff

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.160
that put together this program
today especially the Rare Book

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.650
Division obviously and
Stephanie Stillo who played

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.890
such a large part in it as
well as Mark Dimunation.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.320
And I want to thank our staff
of our special collection,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.080
our Special Events Office
for organizing this.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.290
And also, of course,
the Library wants

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.090
to thank the Gladys
Kriebel Delmas Foundation

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.580
for their support
of this symposium.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.700
Without their support,
it wouldn't be possible.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.400
So it's in this spirit of
inclusion and discovery

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.040
that we welcome you to
the nation's library.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.660
I thank you for being here

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.180
and I hope you have what
I suspect will be a very

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.820
enlightening two days.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.290
So thank you very
much and welcome

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.590
to the Library of Congress.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.390
Thank you.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo:
All right, good morning.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.150
My name is Stephanie Stillo and
I am delighted to welcome you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.920
to Imagining the Extraordinary.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.340
This symposium has
been a long time

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.350
in the making for our division.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.780
So I am so pleased to be able
to share it with you today

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.500
and those that are
to come, I guess,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.480
a little bit later
this afternoon.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.990
I must say you're in
for quite a treat.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.690
Our speakers are truly inspired
and we're just delighted

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.570
to welcome them to the Library.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.060
So before we begin,
I'd like to, of course,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.470
also thank the Gladys
Kriebel Delmas Foundation

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.770
for their support.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.950
I'm sure as many of you know,
keeping these events free

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.800
and open to the public
requires a fair amount

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.270
of financial assistance
and we're very grateful

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.030
to the Delmas Foundation
for their generosity.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.770
I'd also like to
thank the Library

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.500
of Congress Events Committee
particularly Kimberly Crawford

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.250
and Mary Eno for helping
organize this event.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.420
And lastly, thanking Helena
Zinkham and of course,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.280
Mark Sweeney, for supporting
the Rare Books Division

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.420
in their vision of this program.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.090
So as I mentioned, my
name is Stephanie Stillo.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.260
And I am the curator,
the lucky curator

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.700
of the Lessing J.
Rosenwald Collection

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.460
in the Rare Books Division
here at the Library.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.080
The Rosenwald Collection is
an ambitious graphic arts

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.580
collection with thematic
concentrations and everything

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.240
from the history of science
to the decorative arts.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.210
In many ways, the Rosenwald
Collection and the vision

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.290
of the man who created it,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.920
was the inspiration
for this symposium.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.720
Lessing Rosenwald was a
collector that was inspired

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.550
by the history of printing.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.490
And how that technology
encouraged historical change.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.690
He celebrated this interest by
collecting illustrated books

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.590
that documented or sometimes
created shifts in taste

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.350
and intellectual tradition
over the last five centuries.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.360
Now, as someone with a
purely humanities background,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.860
I found Lessing's
collected books

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.350
on science particularly exotic.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.840
Euclid's Elements of Geometry,
Vesalius' Human Dissections,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.570
[Inaudible] impossibly
complex celestial

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.600
and geometric calculators,
Galileo's moon.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.210
I wanted to find a way to
talk about these books,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.860
about the profound and
excited dialogue that had

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.160
such a massive historical
impact.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.930
And I eventually
realized that my interest

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.770
in these books really were
their images and the ability

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.330
of these images to convey
meaning hundreds of years

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.160
after their publication.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.930
And it was this interest
that inspired this symposium.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.950
So the harbingers
of historic shifts

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.590
and scientific understanding
were often changes in methods

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.680
of image production, from wood
to metal, from metal to stone,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.500
from stone to the wide-ranging
methods of photomechanical

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.450
and photographic production.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.200
It was these images, flawed
as they may have been,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.770
that most people
experienced new,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:33.450
heady and exciting revelations
in mathematics, physics,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.150
biology and the cosmos.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.670
Now, in 2018, digital tools
are sounding the trumpets

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:46.050
of a new chapter in the history
of scientific illustration.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.850
While Robert Hooke's
engravings brought us dozens

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.550
of miniscule phenomena,
the point of a needle,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.210
a strand of silk, the barbs
of a stinging nettle --

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.610
digital visualization
tools can now envision

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.240
and circulate images
of infinitesimal

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.950
yet vast and unique bioscapes.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.240
And visualize structural
variations

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.000
within the human genome.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.460
The speakers here today and
tomorrow will discuss this long

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.830
and varied history of
scientific illustration,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.190
of intellectual dialogue,
of radicalism and orthodoxy,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.600
of artistic and technological
innovation.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.950
But within all of these talks,

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.530
we find gratifyingly
common questions.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.950
How do we imagine the universe
and our place within it?

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.290
How can we capture the
wonder and the mystery

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.220
of the natural world
and the human body?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.050
How do very human choices

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.530
in illustration processes
impact public understanding?

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.980
I'd like to think that
this symposium is our way

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.020
of celebrating this
complicated history

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.190
and these complicated questions.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.170
Over the next two days, you
will hear historians talking

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.220
about finding our
place in the universe.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.240
Artists will address
scientific convention.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.900
Biologists will talk
about breakthroughs

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.240
in historic illustration

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.570
and technologists will face the
frontiers of cultural heritage,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.570
storytelling and access.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.750
It's in this spirit of
dialogue and discovery

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.220
that we warmly welcome you to
Imagining the Extraordinary.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.020
Thank you.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:37.670
[ Applause ]

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.580
I would now like to
invite our colleague

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.010
from the Folger Shakespeare
Library,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.120
Caroline Duroselle-Melish
on stage

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.420
to introduce our first speaker.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.350
&gt;&gt; Caroline Duroselle-Melish:
Good morning.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.880
It is my pleasure to
introduce Roger Gaskell.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.090
Gaskell is an antiquarian
bookseller based

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.560
in England specializing

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.640
in scientific medical
and technical books.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.890
But this is only a
part of his resume.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.070
Gaskell has also been sharing
with others his vast knowledge

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.420
of books on science, not only

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.770
through his Dealers'
Catalogues but through teaching.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.400
He is an affiliate of the
Department of the History

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.270
and Philosophy of Science at
the University of Cambridge

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.600
where he teaches a
regular seminar entitled

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.020
"Science in Print."

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.670
He also teaches courses on
illustrated scientific books

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.210
at the Bodleian Library
in Oxford

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.280
and at the Rare Book
School at the University

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.930
of Virginia in Charlottesville.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.060
He has published widely
on printing history

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.180
and the bibliographical
book illustrations.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.590
Recently, he built a replica of
an 18th century rolling press

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.530
which is now at the
University of Virginia.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.710
Gaskell is also interested
in the history of libraries

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.650
and in working on an edition
of the library catalogue

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.540
of the Royal College of
Physicians of London,

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.050
first published in 1660.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.760
The title of Roger's talk is
"How Books Shape the Universe,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.620
The Impact of the
Printed Image."

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.690
Please join me in
welcoming Roger Gaskell.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.490
Thank you.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:38.500
[ Applause ]

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.470
&gt;&gt; Roger Gaskell: Good
morning and thank,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.260
Stephanie for inviting
me to come and speak.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.320
I'm absolutely thrilled
to be here.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.260
Thank you, Caroline,
for that introduction.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.300
It's a little bit of -- it
feels rather a responsibility

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.420
to be asked to go first.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.750
But on the other hand,
then on reflection,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.050
I thought, "Well, yes.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.820
But then by the end
of the seminar,

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.370
you'll all have forgotten
what I had to say."

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.750
So it's not such a risk, I hope.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:12.100
So, with that, well let's
just hope for the best.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.580
Let's hope for the best.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.190
The night sky has always
been a source of wonder,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.420
of mystery and of utility.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.980
In the ancient world, it was
important to map the heavens

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.680
and learn the movements of
the wandering stars, the sun

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.960
and moon, and Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.300
Timekeeping, planning the
farming year, the calendar

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.660
of religious festivals,
navigation

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.030
and astrological divination
were motivations enough

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.490
for serious scientific
study of the heavens.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.160
But science has always also
been motivated by curiosity,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.560
by wonder, by the beauty
of the natural world.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.950
As Nicolaus Copernicus puts
it in the first sentence

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.380
of <i>De revolutionibus </i>, "Among
the many various literary

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.620
and artistic pursuits which
invigorate men's minds,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.760
the strongest affection and
utmost zeal should, I think,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.120
promote the studies concerned
with the most beautiful objects,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.560
most deserving to be known.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.040
What indeed is more beautiful
than heaven, which of course,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.990
contains all things of beauty?"

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.880
I want to stress this aspect of
scientific discovery, curiosity,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.190
wonder, the aesthetics.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.020
Because as well as
being a driving force

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.390
to scientific inquiry, it
is also to a greater extent

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.410
than is sometimes
appreciated, a driving force

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.610
in the making of
scientific books.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.260
A young person visiting a
literary home cast his eyes

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.430
over the thousands of
books lining the walls

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.730
and on the tables.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.870
He asked nervously, "Have
you read all these books?"

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.660
His host's reply, "I have never
bought a book I did not intend

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.190
to read."

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.220
[Laughter] This is the
secret of publishing.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:11.200
You have to sell more books than
are actually going to be read.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.850
In this, pictures
play a major role.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.520
Pictures sell books.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.280
Historians of science
sometimes forget this.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.730
And this is one of the reasons
that images can get overlooked.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:29.910
I'm going to look at three kinds
of astronomical images which are

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.920
of some importance to the
development of astronomy,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.810
to our understanding of
our place in the universe,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.320
and to our appreciation
of its beauty.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.570
The images are mostly well-known
but by looking at them

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.300
from the point of view of
their origins, the technology

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.590
of their production
and their impact

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.110
on the nonprofessional readers,
I hope to give you some hints

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.330
about their place
in cultural history,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.910
not just the grand
narrative of the development

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.810
of astronomy told by
intellectual historians.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.410
Three things are essential
to understanding the heavens

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.520
and they will require
the use of images.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.300
First, we need a map
of the fixed stars.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.580
Only once their positions are
known can we track the movements

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.830
of the wandering stars, the
strange dance of the planets

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.880
as they advance in one
direction and then loop back.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.620
So that's my first topic.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.080
My second topic is a geometrical
model of these movements,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.930
the heliocentric
system of Copernicus.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.100
And finally, I want to look
at the first investigations

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.870
of the heavens not with geometry
but by direct observation

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.140
with the telescope, Galileo's
<i>Siderius Nuncius </i>of 1610.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.490
So let's start with star maps.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.350
The night sky is
a confusing sight.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.120
In order to make
some sense of it,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.260
it became traditional
probably in prehistoric times

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.450
to group together stars that
suggested the shapes of animals,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.550
gods or mythological figures.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.970
And these are the
constellations.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.230
They are arbitrary
groups of stars

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.080
but they provide a framework
defining star positions verbally

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.700
with descriptions such
as the Bright Star

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.000
in the right shoulder of Orion.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.300
More accurate positions would
be provided by coordinates

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.210
but the verbal descriptions
as well as the names

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.270
for specific stars
continue to be used

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.970
and constellation
figures continue

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.190
to be prominent features
on star maps,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.070
even for professional
astronomers

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.800
into the 19th century.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.890
And they're still important
for amateur astronomers.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.290
Constellation figures with star
positions were first printed

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.620
in Venice in 1482 in
the mythological poem,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.030
"Poeticon Astronomicon"
attributed

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.580
to the Roman historian
Gaius Julius Hyginus.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.040
But the stars dotted about
the constellation figures have

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.710
little to do with their
real positions in the sky.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.280
Albrecht Durer's famous woodcut
celestial maps of the northern

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.580
and southern hemispheres --

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.550
we're just looking at
the northern one here --

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:19.200
are the first printed maps
with accurate star positions.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.300
The lettering on
the map credits --

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.680
well, actually, it's not
on the map but anyway.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.730
I think it may be
on the other map.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.920
But well, the contributors
to the map are credited

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.410
as Johannes Stabius,
who is astronomer

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:39.080
to Maximillian the First,
who drew the coordinate grid,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.410
the Nuremberg astronomer
Conrad Heinfogel,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.390
who positioned the stars on
the grid, and finally, Durer,

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.380
who drew the constellation
figures around the stars.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.600
The image is printed from a
large, a very large woodblock.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.780
It's about 17 inches wide.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.080
And it would have been executed

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.850
by a professional block
cutter, not by Durer himself.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.340
So the print is a collaboration
between at least four people.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.400
And we should bear this in
mind when loosely referring it

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.950
to as -- referring to it
as Durer's planisphere.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.860
The sun, moon and planets move
within a band of sky known

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.930
as the zodiac which is tilted at
an angle to the Earth's equator.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.990
Here, you can see the
familiar constellations

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.630
of the zodiac arranged
anti-clockwise

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.220
around the graduated circle.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.320
Durer's constellation figures
are shown from the back

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.030
as if we were looking
at the celestial sphere

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.610
from the outside as if
looking at a celestial globe.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.150
These designs for the
constellation figures were

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.830
important models for
later celestial mapmakers.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:54.690
In the corners of the print,
you can see the four depictions

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.270
of ancient authorities
on the sky.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:03.860
So we have the Greek poet
Aratus, the Roman poet Manilius,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.380
Al-Sufi, who is an
astronomer working

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.410
in Baghdad in the 10th century.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.430
And finally, looking
suspiciously

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.720
like the Mad Hatter
is Claudius Ptolemy.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.550
Ptolemy was of Greek
origin and he wrote in Greek

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.180
but because he -- but he
became a Roman citizen

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.480
and lived in Alexandria.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.970
So this is why he's referred to
on the map as Ptolemy of Egypt.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.560
Ptolemy's textbook,
the <i>Almagest </i>,

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.580
written in the 2nd
century CE is one

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.420
of the most influential
scientific treatises

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.270
of all time.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.820
Although an epitome
was published in 1496,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.890
the full text was not in print
until 1515, the same year

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.310
as the woodcut planisphere.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.760
The <i>Almagest </i>contains a
catalogue of fixed stars

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.060
and a geometrical
model of the universe

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.540
with the stationary
Earth at the center.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.650
This model is known as
the Ptolemaic system.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.620
Ptolemy arranged his catalogue

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.230
of 1022 stars in
48 constellations.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.170
Star locations within the
constellations are given

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.530
verbally on the left and
by coding it for longitude

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.160
and latitude in degrees with a
scale of brightness or magnitude

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.590
from one, the brightest
to six, the faintest.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.690
These are in the
table on the right.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.600
Ptolemy's constellations

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.950
and star catalogue
actually lasted longer

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.410
than his planetary system

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.610
for while the geocentric model
was replaced, although not

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.960
without a struggle

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.230
by the heliocentric sun-centered
model put forward by Copernicus

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.040
in the 16th century, most

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.970
of Ptolemy's constellations
are still in use today.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.480
Although Durer's planispheres
are the first printed star maps,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.190
the first set of charts in
book form to show the positions

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.490
of the stars relative

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.340
to one another accurately is
Piccolomini's De le stelle

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.040
fisse, printed at
Venice in 1540.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.250
The magnitude of each star is
indicated by the use of symbols.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.360
So these maps are a
graphic representation

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.470
of Ptolemy's catalogue, the
numerical coordinates translated

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.590
into positions and the
magnitudes into symbols.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.740
It was another 50 years
before Giovanni Paolo Gallucci

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.380
published the first star atlas
to combine constellation figures

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.120
with accurate star positions.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.610
So now, we have all the elements
of the typical star atlas.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.590
A series of maps with
constellation figures,

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.460
accurate star positions,
and a system of coordinates.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.760
Gallucci took his star positions
from the catalogue printed

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.500
at the end of Copernicus'
<i>De revolutionibus </i>of 1543.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.900
Copernicus made a few
corrections to Ptolemy based

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.530
on fresh observations and he
changed the coordinate system.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.970
But his catalogue is
essentially Ptolemy's catalogue.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.550
The images on these two small
Venetian atlases, Piccolomini

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.740
and Gallucci, are
like the planisphere

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.320
with constellation
figures designed

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.470
by Durer printed
from woodblocks.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:34.030
Very different in appearance is
<i>Uranometria </i>of Johann Bayer

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.340
printed at Augsburg in 1603.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.960
Here you see the elaborate
engraved title page

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.260
and here is one of the maps.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.720
This is one of the most
beautiful star atlases

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.550
and the first to
have charts printed

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.050
from copper plate engraving.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.140
It was also the most
accurate to date being based

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.870
on the star positions calculated

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.840
by the Danish astronomer
Tycho Brahe from new

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.850
and highly accurate
observations.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.990
As well as using these more
accurate positions established

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.550
by the Danish astronomer,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.070
Bayer also introduced a
new system of nomenclature.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.170
In each constellation, he gave
the principal stars the letters

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.550
of the Greek alphabet in
descending order of magnitude.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.890
Thus the star in Orion's left
shoulder is Alpha Orionis.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.820
Being one of the
brightest stars in the sky,

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.680
it also has its own
name, Betelgeuse.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.110
But most stars do not
have individual names

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.160
and Bayer's nomenclature
is important

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.930
and still in use today.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.590
But above all, Bayer
provided the first really

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.260
accurate plates.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.660
Gallucci had shown the way by
providing scales and gridlines

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.980
but his small page
size and the costliness

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.970
of the woodcut illustrations
meant

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.610
that his star positions could
not be read off the plate

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.330
with any accuracy.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.720
Bayer's much larger
plates and the finer lines

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.260
of engraving allowed him

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.550
to achieve a quite new
level of precision.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.760
The plates are about
18 inches wide.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.020
So if you compare these with
Gallucci's page which is

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.960
about seven inches wide,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.230
but Bayer's atlas is still
small compared to later atlases.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.070
John Flamsteed's atlas of
1729 is almost twice as wide

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:24.330
as Bayer's at 32 inches and
some atlases were even bigger.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.230
The plates are generally
attributed

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.470
to the German engraver
Alexander Mayer around early use

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.370
of stipple engraving where the
image is made up of small dots.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.940
This is the perfect technique

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.770
for rendering the constellation
figures so that they are easy

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.860
to read without interfering

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.540
with the star symbols
and their lettering.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.690
Bayer's atlas was important
for practicing astronomers.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.070
We know that when Flamsteed

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.350
of the Royal Greenwich
Observatory made his great

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.940
3000-star catalogue, beginning
his observations in the 1670s,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.140
he used Bayer's charts to
locate the naked eye stars,

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.320
filling in the new
telescopic stars between them.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.510
But as with most books,
professional users make

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.930
up only part of the market.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.160
These well-drawn and finely
engraved mythological figures

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.540
would have appealed to buyers

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.300
of other high-end
illustrated books.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.870
Important for the publisher

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.500
of what must have been a very
expensive book to produce.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.970
So I'll the evolution of
star atlases with here

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.350
with Bayer's atlas published

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.830
in 1603 representing the
situation just a few years

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.310
before Galileo started
looking at the heavens

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.610
through his telescope.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.940
But before we get to Galileo,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.250
what about the wandering stars
whose movements are defined

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.970
with reference to
the fixed stars?

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.480
This diagram is one
of the most famous

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.820
in the history of science.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.330
It is, of course,
the heliocentric.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.280
It is, of course, the
heliocentric model

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.310
of the universe in Nicolaus
Copernicus <i>De revolutionibus</i>

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.980
<i>orbium coelestium</i>
or <i>The Revolutions</i>

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.180
<i>of the Heavenly Spheres</i>
published at Nuremberg in 1543.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.670
This is the diagram that
shows that our world is not

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.220
at the center of the universe

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.530
but just one among the other
five known planets circling

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.100
the sun.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.670
One of the advantages
of the new system was

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.730
that it made it possible to
compute periods and distances

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.510
of the planets from the sun.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.970
The diagram shows how
elegantly this works.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.490
With the planets ordered
by the time each takes

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:50.020
to orbit the sun related to its
relative distance from the sun.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.020
The period of each
planet is given

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.830
in the legend on each circle.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.400
The outermost planet,
Saturn, has a period

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.270
of 30 years then comes Jupiter
at 12 years, Mars at two years,

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.310
Earth, one year, of course
and the inner planets,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.750
Venus and Mercury with periods
of nine months and 80 days.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:13.690
The outermost sphere is labeled
Stellarum Fixarum sphaera

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:18.080
immobilis, the immovable
sphere of the fixed stars.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.630
I want you to remember
this phrase,

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:25.240
the immovable sphere
of the fixed stars.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.200
Copernicus had been working
on his treatise for many years

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.870
when the young Joachim Rheticus
arrived at the monastery

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.880
in Frombork in Poland where
Copernicus was a priest.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.090
This was in 1539.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:43.230
This neatly written manuscript
was completed two years later

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.480
in 1541.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.430
It seems to be a presentation
manuscript, not printer's copy.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.240
And it certainly was
not the manuscript

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.870
that went to the printer.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.710
A copy was made after
Rheticus had left Frombork

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.390
and sent to him in Nuremberg.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.320
At some point, some very
interesting changes were made

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.000
to this famous diagram.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.280
What we are familiar with in
the printed book is not what is

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.800
in Copernicus' own manuscript.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.980
In the manuscript,
there are eight circles.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.420
But in the woodcut,
there are nine circles.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.040
An extra circle has been
introduced within the sphere

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.590
of the Earth with a sphere
for the moon around it.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.190
I'm sure you can -- so sorry.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:43.840
So there is the Earth,
Telluris com Luna but here,

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.970
it's now got its own circle and
an extra circle for the moon.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.250
Copernicus believed that
the planets were carried

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.990
around in solid orbs.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.600
The introduction of a circle

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.040
in the Earth's sphere implies
something quite different.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.010
Not a solid sphere in rotation

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.550
but the Earth moving
freely through space.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:11.280
The line in the diagram
indicating an orbital path.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.990
Since Rheticus oversaw
the printing

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.580
of <i>De revolutionibus </i>in
Nuremberg or at any rate,

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.060
in the early stages,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.180
he presumably supplied
the block cutter

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.020
with a sketch to work from.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.350
In this case, he would
have been responsible

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.460
for introducing the
circle for the Earth

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.610
and the subsidiary
circle for the moon.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:33.270
Innumerable textbook diagrams
supposedly illustrating the

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.660
Copernican system followed this

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.080
and showed the planets
positioned

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.750
on the circles rather
than between them.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.170
Copernicus actually
thought that the planets --

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.070
of the planets being carried
around in solid spheres

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.030
within which they had
further complex movements.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.590
Just as in the Ptolemaic
system, in the Copernican model,

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.040
the planets moved in small
circle called "epicycles"

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.280
at the same time as being
carried around in their spheres.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.210
This was necessary to account
for their looping dance.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.430
The ambiguous woodcut in <i>De
revolutionibus </i>is responsible

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.920
for the misconception that the
Copernican system involved the

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.500
planets moving through
space along circular paths

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.240
without epicycles and
therefore more elegant

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.290
than Ptolemy's system which
also required epicycles.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.080
In fact, orbital paths without
epicycles were not introduced

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.000
until later in the
century by Johannes Kepler.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.590
Then something curious happens
outside the sphere of the Earth.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:44.240
The next ring is empty
so this ring is empty.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.410
And all the lettering has now
been shifted to the outside

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.970
of the lines compared to how
it was in the manuscript.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.230
So the lettering
from Mars, Jupiter,

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.200
Saturn are now sitting
on the lines.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.490
And so by analogy with the
Earth's path, they seem also

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.690
to indicate not solid
spheres but orbital paths.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.200
But shifting the
lettering to the outside

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.430
of the circle has another
highly significant effect.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:17.890
The sphere of the fixed stars
no longer has any boundary.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.890
This, I think, gave a hint

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.620
for another significant
reinterpretation of Copernicus.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.880
In 1576, a startlingly
new picture

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.810
of the universe was printed.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.500
Both in this diagram
and in his text,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.210
Thomas Digges states
emphatically

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.360
that the universe is infinite.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.390
He also shows the
planets confined --

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.750
he also shows the planets
confined in their spheres

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.990
as Copernicus had intended.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.760
So he's correcting the
Copernican diagram.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.450
He's correcting the <i>De
revolutionibus </i>by carefully

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.170
reading the text.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.660
So in fact, this is the
first really accurate diagram

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:05.500
of what Copernicus was getting
at, apart from the fixed stars.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.610
Digges' major intervention
concerns his interpretation

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.310
of what Copernicus says about
the size of the universe

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:15.140
and the possibility of
an infinite universe.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.300
This woodcut appears in an
appendix to a new addition

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.140
of the popular almanac
by Thomas Digges' father,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.080
Leonard called "A
Prognostication Everlasting"

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.380
which was based

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.310
on the traditional Ptolemaic
Earth-centered universe.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.870
Thomas reprints his father's
work with a few corrections

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:38.520
and adds a perfect description
of the celestial orbs according

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.330
to the most ancient
doctrine of the Pythagoreans.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.360
Lately revived by Copernicus

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.990
and by geometrical
demonstrations are proved.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:52.520
And the free translation
with some additions of parts

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.040
of the first book of
<i>De revolutionibus </i>,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.110
it's the first English account
of the Copernican system

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:03.430
and the first publication of the
heliocentric diagram in Britain.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.020
But with a hugely significant
addition of an infinity

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.340
of stars beyond the
solar system.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.640
This was before Giordano Bruno's
more metaphysical speculations

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.510
on the infinite universe
which was possibly influenced

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.870
by Digges and was
published eight years later,

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.180
also in London in 1584.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.620
Digges' work has recently been
discussed by David Wootton

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.230
in his well-received <i>History
of the Scientific Revolution,</i>

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.250
<i>the Invention of Science </i>.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:39.360
According to Wootton, and I
quote, "The illustration spreads

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.500
over two pages and it
appears to have been added

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.060
as an afterthought as the
book went through the press.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.170
Binders were never quite
sure what to do with it

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:54.220
to incorporate it as a foldout
page or as a two-page spread.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:59.940
As you can see, the text of
the first part ends finis

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.970
so this is the end of Leonard
Digges' part of the book.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.550
But the image has
[inaudible] or 43 printed

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.750
in the upper right corner of
the sheet in the last page

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:21.040
of the first part of the text
is obviously [inaudible] or 42.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.460
So it's clearly intended
to be bound here

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.760
as an upright foldout.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.840
As a frontispiece and
the kind of title page

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.860
to Thomas Digges'
Perfect Description

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.650
of the Celestial Orbs since
there's no other title page

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.700
to this part of the book.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.300
Third, the bibliographical
analysis shows

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.550
that it cannot possibly
be an afterthought.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.850
It is an integral part

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.160
of the book printed
along with the text.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.970
I mention this as
a cautionary note.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.270
Paying a little attention

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.900
to the physical object
might have saved Wootton

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.630
from his condescending
suggestion

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.370
that the illustration
was an afterthought.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.290
And by implication, of less
importance than the text.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.590
On the contrary,

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.400
it was carefully planned
from the beginning.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.310
The woodcut would have
been an expense --

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.010
would have been expensive
to make

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.610
and printing it complicated
the production process.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.030
So let's look at
it more closely.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:21.990
The lettering within the outer
ring states that this orb

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.940
of stars fixed indefinitely
out extended itself

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.330
in altitudes spherically
and therefore immovable.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.720
It is garnished with perpetual
shining glorious lights

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.360
innumerable far excelling
the sun both

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.070
in quantity and quality.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.370
The striking thing about this
diagram and the reason it is

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.970
so often reproduced is that
the fixed stars are not

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.300
in the outer sphere
which only has text in it

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.860
but are outside it and at
variable distances from the sun.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.050
In the text, Digges explains
that the stars are fainter,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.720
the farther out they are,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.120
until our sight is no longer
sharp enough to distinguish them

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.230
and the greatest
number are, as he says,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.390
by reason of their wonderful
distance, invisible unto us.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.270
I asked you to remember the
label on the outermost sphere

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.920
in the Copernican diagram,

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.050
the immovable sphere
of the fixed stars.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.580
A central tenet of the
Copernican system is

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.920
that the Earth is not
stationary but spins

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.640
on its axis every 24 hours.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.250
So when we see the heavens
wheeling over our heads,

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.780
they are not really moving.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.270
We are. Copernicus could
not detect any paradox

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.570
in the fixed stars.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.270
No measurable difference
in the angles

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.290
between the stars
wherever we are

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.720
on our annual journey
around the sun.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.030
So the sphere of the fixed stars
must be at an immense distance

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.280
from the planetary spheres.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.310
Copernicus only says that this
distance appears to be infinite,

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.780
appears to be infinite compared
with the tiny dot of the Earth.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.460
Whether the universe outside
the fixed stars is infinite is

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.210
something that he,
Copernicus, said should be left

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.990
to the natural philosophers.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.770
And historians have debated
whether Copernicus really

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.100
believed in an infinite
universe.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.580
But the crucial thing is that
even if he did, he still meant

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.690
that the fixed stars are
contained in a spherical shell.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:28.010
The astonishing new idea put
forward by Digges in his text

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.810
and in the image is that
there is no boundary

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.190
to the fixed stars.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.500
They extend out to infinity.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.970
The majority so far off that
they are invisible to us.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.170
Another early English
Copernican, William Gilbert,

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.870
well-known for his pioneering
work on magnetism, wrote a work

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:53.860
on cosmology sometime in the
1580s but it was not published

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.560
until after his death.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.140
This is "De mundo
nostro sublunari"

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.200
in which Gilbert made
clear that he believes

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.960
that the universe is
infinite and that the stars

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.210
and planets move
through a vacuum.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.500
Gilbert distinguished
between light-giving stars

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.170
and reflecting bodies.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.470
And it has been suggested

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.940
that this image demonstrates
Gilbert's belief

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.170
in multiple solar systems.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.700
The largest stars
might indicate suns

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.530
and the smaller stars, planets.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.750
But we have here to
be even more careful

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.840
about taking the
illustration to be an expression

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.960
of the author's ideas.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.380
The woodcut is an accurate
representation of the diagram

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:39.400
in the manuscript which
survives in the British Library.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.010
But it was compiled from
Gilbert's papers sometime

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.080
after his death in 1603.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.750
We don't know if the diagram
is derived from something

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.750
that Gilbert drew or
if it was introduced

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.990
by his younger half-brother
when he assembled the text.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.940
Whatever the source
of the diagram,

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.240
it is clearly influenced
by Digges.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.800
And I think that
the largest stars

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.740
in this woodcut simply
represent brighter stars

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.380
and would refer --
therefore refer back

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.750
to the tradition begun
by Piccolomini in 1540,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.210
as we saw earlier where the
different symbols represent

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.510
different magnitudes.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:34.370
Having looked at the
maps of the heavens

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:38.140
up to Bayer's beautiful
[inaudible] of 1603

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.960
and then the movement of the
planets against the background

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.790
of the fixed stars, for the last
part of my talk, I want to look

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.210
at the book to put an
end to speculation,

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.950
if not to controversy.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.290
In the words of the
great Galileo scholar,

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.160
Albert Van Helden,
after the publication

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.290
of Galileo's <i>Sidereus
Nuncius </i>in 1610, the universe

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:08.640
and the way in which it was
studied would never be the same.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.500
The universe would
never be the same.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.370
<i>Sidereus Nuncius </i>, the
"Starry Messenger" was decisive

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.120
because instead of debating
with ancient authority

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.960
and using complex
geometrical models,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.700
Galileo used visual arguments.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.640
He shows us what he
observed for the first time

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.650
with the telescope and argues
that this leads inevitably

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:36.250
to conclusions about the
nature of the universe.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.690
Digges' speculation that
the more distant stars were

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.230
invisible to the naked eye
was excitedly confirmed

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.890
when Galileo first focused his
telescope on the fixed stars.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.000
Referring to the classification
of the stars introduced

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.310
by Ptolemy, remember the first
magnitude is the brightest

00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:02.150
and the sixth is the faintest,
Galileo writes, "With the glass,

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.580
you will detect below the
stars of the sixth magnitude

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.360
such a crowd of others
that escaped natural sight

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.440
that it is hardly believable.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.520
For you may see more than six
further gradations of magnitude.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.760
Here, Galileo shows part of
the constellation of Orion

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.540
on the left and the
Pleiades on the right.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.520
The large open stars
are the ancient stars,

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.890
that is, the naked eye stars.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:32.600
The new stars are solid black.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.350
Of different sizes to
indicate different magnitudes.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.880
The woodcut on the left shows
the three naked eye stars

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.160
in Orion's belt.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.460
I'm sure you can see that.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:52.280
So here's the belt and then
there are six in Orion's sword.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:58.130
Surrounding them are 18 more
stars revealed by the telescope

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.050
and never seen before.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.880
It's one of the many
puzzles about this book

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.520
that the woodcut is
too big for the page.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.070
In this copy, the star

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.900
on the right is almost
full and into the gutter.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.640
I'm not using fanciful
language here.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.490
The gutter is the
bibliographer's term

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:20.150
for the inner margins
of the book.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.350
Even in Galileo's
original drawing,

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.890
the page barely contains
the stars.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.230
The printed woodcut follows the
finished drawing very closely

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.470
and the dimensions
are identical.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:39.320
In many copies, one or more of
the stars at the top of the page

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.280
and one on the left are cropped
or trimmed away by the binder,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.690
one of the reasons
that the Library

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.350
of Congress' untrimmed
copy which is on show

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.690
in the exhibition
is so important.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.760
It might be argued that
this is a rhetorical device,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.990
the unbounded page
becomes a metaphor

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.250
for the boundless,
infinite universe.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.610
Whether or not this
was in Galileo's mind,

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.420
it could well have
had this resonance

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.940
for contemporary readers
as it does for us today.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.780
Now the discovery of the vast
numbers of stars invisible

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.610
to the naked eye is only one

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:18.370
of the discoveries
reported in Galileo's book.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.560
What made Galileo particularly
anxious to rush his book

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.400
into print was his discovery
of the satellites of Jupiter

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.830
which he dedicated to Cosimo
de Medici calling them the

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.190
Medician stars.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.510
The satellites of Jupiter helps
to confirm the Copernican theory

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.530
by showing that the Earth was
not unique in the solar system

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.270
in having satellites or moons.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.120
The -- excuse me --

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.240
the <i>Sidereus Nuncius</i>
is a news book

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.870
and Galileo could
easily have been scooped.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:54.310
Third of the great
revolutions in the book

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.430
which actually comes first
is Galileo's discovery

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.250
of mountains on the moon.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.770
This contradicted Aristotelian
orthodoxy that everything

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.940
in the heavens must be
perfect and unchanging

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.030
and the moon, a perfect sphere.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.950
The impact of the printed
images is remarkable.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.050
Nothing like this in
terms of either the medium

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.400
or the message had
been seen before.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.130
There are four images,
one of which is repeated.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.000
In the first image,
the new moon is shown

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.860
on the fourth or fifth day.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.220
The terminator, the
division between light

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.620
and dark is not a smooth curved
line as seen with the naked eye.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.030
But the telescope
reveals it to be jagged,

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.050
uneven, on a sinuous curve.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.520
Several white spots are
seen in the dark areas.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.160
And dark spots in
the bright areas.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.190
The white spots gradually
enlarge and merge

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.490
with the bright areas

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.850
of the moon while more
appear in the dark part.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.070
Galileo explains this by analogy
with terrestrial geography.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.430
Only the peaks of mountains
are illuminated at sunrise

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.180
and the valleys are in shadow.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.910
But the dark shadows diminish
as the sun climbs higher

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.470
until the whole valley
is flooded with light.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.810
The first and third
quarters are shown here

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:19.910
to illustrate how
the shadows cast

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:24.330
by the sun define the huge
mountains around the large area

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.190
in the upper part of the moon.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.560
Unlike the mountains,
the appearance

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.030
of the large ancient spots
on the moon, the ones seen

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.240
with the naked eye, do
not change as the angle

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.090
of illumination changes.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.170
They might, following
the opinion

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.470
of Pythagoras [inaudible].

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:51.020
Here, the second image is
repeated and a fourth is added,

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.030
continuing the visual evidence

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.400
for the vast mountain
range in the upper area.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.170
Now these are etchings,
intaglio plates printed

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.120
on a separate operation
from the text.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120
The text was printed first

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.550
by the letterpress printer using
a common press on the left,

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.730
in this contemporary
image, leaving blank spaces

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.230
for the illustrations.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.670
The etchings were then
printed into these spaces

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:23.230
in a separate workshop
using the rolling press

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.570
which is quite a
different kind of press

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:26.870
which is shown on the right.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.150
And as the caption to this
plate explains, this is a press

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.770
for printing images from
incised copper plates.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.920
The plates are rather
clumsily printed

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.790
with a significant
amount of surface tone.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.710
And there are ink
deposits on the plate edges

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.920
which have not been
well-cleaned before being put

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.220
to the rolling press.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.680
So this -- so this is
sort of surface tone.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.260
It hasn't been cleared off

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.970
and then there are some actual
ink deposits along here.

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.010
The lines and dots of
the image are created

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.210
by etching identified by
the fluidity of the lines

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.510
and the blunt ends

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.440
of the strokes viewed
under magnification.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.570
The circular outline seems
to have been made with a pair

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.800
of compasses but
rather carelessly

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.630
as the lines have
doubled up in places.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.610
There was little
conventional syntax of lines

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.370
or cross-hatching which we
would expect at this period.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.140
Both the etching
and the printing

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.100
of the plates seem
amateurish in comparison

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.200
with what one would expect
of etching for this period.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.340
For example, in the
contemporary,

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:39.950
by the contemporary Venetian
etcher Odoardo Fialetti.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.980
Original watercolor
drawings by Galileo survive.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.670
But they are not the direct
originals for the etchings.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.980
Six moons are shown here and
a seventh is on another half

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.960
of the sheet numbered eight.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.140
These finished drawings
are presumably based

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.590
on earlier sketches
as the field of view

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.440
of Galileo's telescope could
only take in at most half

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.610
of the moon's surface.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.810
Galileo could never
have seen the whole disk

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.370
of the moon looking like this.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.600
The four etchings in the
printed book are even further

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.320
from what was visible through
the telescope on any one night.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.000
In the text, Galileo describes
observations of the surface

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.250
of the moon over
several nights but refers

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.980
in each case to the first image.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.640
The etching is a composite
combining geographical features

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.970
of the lunar surface only
visible on different nights.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.010
Even more extreme
is the appearance

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:55.550
of the large round crater in the
lower half of the moon's disk.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.220
The crater on these two images
is derived from earlier sketches

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.870
of the crater alone and
drawn to a larger scale.

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.040
These are subsidiary figures.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.640
Overlaying them on the main
image creates a completely

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.930
erroneous view of the moon.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:17.150
The crater is nowhere near
this big but representing it

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.360
in this way allows
Galileo to argue his point

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.810
without introducing
another etching.

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:28.540
The four etchings are synthetic
images making a visual argument

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.710
in support of Galileo's
contention

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.950
that the changing appearance
of the moon surface as it waxes

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:37.780
and wanes are due to the shadows
cast by its physical features,

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:43.980
huge mountains, valleys, and
seas like those on Earth.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:47.340
When the <i>Sidereus Nuncius</i>
was published in 1610,

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.790
the dominant form of book
illustration was engraving,

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.280
not etching.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.840
With an established syntax
for representing the effects

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.380
of light on uneven surfaces,

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:01.310
the <i>Sidereus Nuncius </i>was the
messenger bringing the news

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.860
of Galileo's discoveries
to the public.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.410
The etchings certainly
gave a sense of immediacy

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.500
to the printed pages
than the stiffer style

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.560
of engraving would have
done which the stiffer style

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.470
of engraving would
not have done.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.610
The full scientific report
was intended to follow.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.690
Writing to Cosimo de Medici
in the summer of 1611,

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:28.020
Galileo informed his patron,
"I want to draw the phases

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.180
of the moon for a whole period
with the utmost diligence

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.730
and imitate them
in minute detail.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.160
And I want to have
them engraved in copper

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.320
by an excellent artist."

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.770
Galileo was well aware that his
images were not accurate maps

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:47.410
of the lunar surface and the
etchings was somewhat informal

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.350
for a scientific treatise.

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.300
For that, he needed a new
series of observations

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.870
and engravings made by a
professional printmaker.

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:59.830
In the event, Galileo next
turned his attention to sunspots

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.720
and it was Johannes
Hevelius who, in 1647,

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.570
published the first accurate
engravings of the moon surface

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:09.510
for a full lunation in
a spectacular series

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.820
of 20 engravings in
an imposing folio.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.130
But that's another story.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:20.690
So where does Galileo
leave us in 1610?

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.870
In 1603, the positions

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:24.910
of the fixed stars had
been accurately mapped

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.430
by Johann Bayer.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.740
His beautiful atlas was on the
library tables of the wealthy

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.410
and it was also later used by
astronomers like John Flamsteed.

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.710
As Thomas Digges realized
and Galileo confirmed

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.810
with the telescope,
there were far more stars

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.530
than Bayer had recorded.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:44.060
At greater and greater
distances,

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.930
stars are fainter and fainter.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.080
There must, as Digges
pointed out, be many stars

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.490
which are simply too
faint for us to see.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:56.120
Not only was the Earth no longer
the center of the universe

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.200
but the universe
itself had no end.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.780
The Earth, as Copernicus
had explained,

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.500
was just another planet.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.400
There are other planets like
ours, other solar systems.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.250
Men in the moon,
extraterrestrial life,

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:15.750
such speculations were
not long in coming.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.870
John Wilkins' <i>Discovery of a
World in the Moone </i>published

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:23.250
in 1638, is an account of the
new world, the new world view

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:26.110
of Copernicus, Kepler
and Galileo.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:30.980
The Galileo moon -- Galilean
moon has Earth-like features

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.480
and says Wilkins
on the title page,

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.530
"Tis probable there may
be another habitable world

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.130
in that planet."

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:43.800
The image is a woodcut
with type set below it.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.150
A very rare, it's a very rare
case of a title page designed

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.370
as a double page spread.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:54.220
This is a very self-conscious
combination of text and image.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.780
Again, it's no afterthought.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.810
The makers of this book
put a lot of care into this

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.990
and we need to take
it seriously.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:05.570
The woodcut is reproduced
as the top half

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.120
of the engraved title page

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.970
of the second enlarged
edition of Wilkins' book.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.830
Below this, the figures of
Galileo on the left is copied

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.590
from the Latin edition
of Galileo's dialogue

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.790
on the two world systems

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.970
where the other figures
are Aristotle and Ptolemy.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.710
Copernicus uncertain

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:39.540
and perplexed says,
"What if it is true?"

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.660
And Galileo gesturing to the
superior vision of the eagle

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.780
which his telescope had given
him says, "Here are his eyes."

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.910
And Kepler says, "And his
wings," hinting that to find

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.500
out more, we should fly
to the moon referring

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.050
to his science fiction dream,
<i>Somnium </i>, written in 1608

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:03.500
and published in 1634, a few
years before Wilkins' discovery.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.480
The scroll on which the
title is written is a map

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.210
of the moon's surface.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:14.020
The top half of the engraving
elaborating on the woodcut

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.560
in the first edition
is a wonderful example

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.310
of how much information can
be packed into a small space.

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.530
And this is only possible
with the fine lines

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:26.170
of engraving rather than the
coarser lines of woodcut.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.630
What you see here on the screen
is less than four inches wide.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:35.410
Here are the stars of different
magnitudes taken from Digges

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:38.390
but in the planetary system --
but in the planetary system,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.700
the planets are on
orbital paths in space,

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.380
not confined to solid spheres.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.500
The Earth is personified
as Ceres,

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.840
the goddess of agriculture.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.870
With her, with actually
is with her sickle

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:53.780
and her sheaf of corn.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.200
She is yearning for her
daughter, Proserpina,

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.700
personified as the moon.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.900
Combining -- combined
with this is a lesson

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.910
in astronomy demonstrating how
the planets are lit by the sun

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.840
and the phases of the
moon as shown below.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.380
This is a serious scientific
work, not mere science fiction

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.270
like William Godwin's <i>Man</i>

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:18.260
<i>in the Moon </i>which was
published in the same year.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:24.930
So in conclusion, I hope that I
have shown, I have convinced you

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:28.470
that the printed book
shaped the universe.

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:32.090
The production of printed
images was not unproblematic

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:35.380
but the efforts made by
authors, editors and publishers

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.190
to put ideas into pictorial
form shows how important these

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.010
images were.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:45.010
Copernicus' <i>De revolutionibus</i>
is a handsomely produced folio,

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:48.390
a worthy companion to books
of theology or philosophy.

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:51.980
Engraving allowed Bayer to
produce more accurate charts

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:55.140
and provide the opportunity
to present multiple layers

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.660
of allegory and science
in a book

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.690
for both connoisseurs
and astronomers.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:04.790
High quality printing
and illustration helped

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.090
to sell these books and not
just to professional scientists.

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:11.150
These, in turn, helped
to bring the meaning

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:14.680
of the scientific findings
to a wide audience.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.060
Images were necessary
for professional readers,

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.500
perhaps even more so for book
owners who were not going

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.740
to follow the science
too closely.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.670
It is said that we live in
a visual age and I wonder

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.420
if images are significant
to scientific discovery

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.990
and communication
as they once were.

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:35.110
I'm looking forward to the
lectures on modern science

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:36.590
in this symposium to learn more.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.390
Thank you.

00:57:38.390 --> 00:58:10.290
[ Applause ]

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.060
&gt;&gt; Lilla Vekerdy: Good morning.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.710
My name is Lilla
Vekerdy and I am

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:20.970
from the Smithsonian Libraries
here to introduce Pedro Raposo.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:29.060
Pedro Raposo is curator of
the Adler Webster Institute

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.540
for the History of Astronomy.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.900
He holds a doctorate in
the history of science

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.240
from the University of Oxford.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:43.660
He has published on topics such
as the history and heritage

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.610
of 19th century astronomy,

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:50.580
the history of colonial
observatories

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:56.700
and the circulation of knowledge
in 18th century Europe.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.340
Raposo is responsible
for the use and research

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:05.200
of the Adler Planetarium's
varied collections

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.970
of historic scientific
instruments,

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:11.560
rare books and works on paper.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:19.970
Sometime ago, I asked Dr. Raposo
when and why he decided to work

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.350
with heavenly objects.

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:31.270
He answered, "At the age of 18,
that is, a long, long time ago,

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:36.930
I founded a local astronomy
club with some friends.

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:40.210
We often went to
school associations,

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:45.270
festivities to show the moon
and other celestial objects

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:52.640
through a telescope to attendees
of all ages and walks of life.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:58.400
I always liked to talk about
history topics in these events

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.190
such as Galileo, astronomy
and navigation in the age

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:06.970
of discoveries, the
discovery of the Uranus."

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:16.030
"I irrevocably became fascinated
with astronomy around 1993

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.030
when there was a lot of hype

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:22.750
about the Perseids
meteor shower.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:27.340
Even though the shower was
not at least to the eyes

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:31.990
as a beginner observer in a
factory town in the suburbs

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:38.350
of Lisbon as spectacular as
the media promised it to be.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:45.290
It made me look up and want
to identify the constellations

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:51.520
and learn more about
astronomy in general."

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:59.020
Dr. Raposo's talk is about
[inaudible] the heavens size,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:04.550
scale and depth in
astronomical illustrations.

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.350
Dr. Raposo?

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:13.620
[ Applause ]

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.920
&gt;&gt; Pedro M.P. Raposo:
Good morning.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.620
I would like to begin by to
thank well, Lilla Vekerdy

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.440
for this lovely introduction,
revealing my past

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.100
and my own romance
with astronomy.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.500
You know, I also like to thank
the organizers of this workshop

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.430
for the invitation to be here.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:33.800
I'm really thrilled to be
here among other reasons

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.620
because I am a historian
of science specializing

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.590
in the history with focus
on the history of astronomy,

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.720
who finds himself
working in an institution

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.890
which some 88 years now, has
been precisely in the business

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:53.550
of scientific visualization,
the Adler Planetarium in Chicago

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.920
which was the first optical
projection planetarium

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.340
in America.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.940
And through our sky show,
through our exhibitions,

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.480
through our, for example,
space visualization laboratory

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.380
which is a part of the Adler
where you can go to daily

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.680
and see some really impressive
images and visualizations

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.260
and talk to an expert.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.400
We've been trying
precisely to visualize

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.090
and to present the heavens
before our audiences.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:29.900
I would like to share a brief
story with you, a recent story.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.910
One of this is I was at one of
our neighbors, the Field Museum

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:36.250
which is in the Museum
Campus in Chicago.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:40.140
And I met one of the volunteers
at the field museum, a lady who,

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.150
when I told her that I
worked, I was curator

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.510
at the Adler Planetarium,
she told me that, "Oh,

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.490
I don't really like
to go to the Adler."

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:49.040
Well, not a great
beginning of conversation

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.730
but then I asked her,
"So why is that?"

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.950
And she told me, "Well,
because it really reminds me

01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:56.410
that the universe is immense.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.670
The universe is overwhelming
and it makes me feel small."

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.100
Well then, I felt relieved.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.020
Okay, we are doing
our job properly then

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.700
because all of that is true.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:10.480
But in fact, imagining, more
than imagining the arrangements

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.750
of the spheres in the sky, the
arrangements of the planets

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:17.470
of the orbits, or imagine
the surfaces of other bodies,

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:22.390
thinking of the scale, the size
and thinking of space precisely

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:26.750
as space and our place in it,
is effectively challenged.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:31.950
And what I would like to do over
the next 30 minutes or so is

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:35.520
to take you in a journey
through the Adler Planetarium

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.950
collections to see some examples
and to show you some examples

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:45.480
of how this three-dimensional
thinking in astronomy

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.420
and in cosmology expressed
itself through the centuries.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.230
In the Middle Ages, one of
the most important tools

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:58.210
to teach astronomy was
the armillary sphere

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:02.770
which appears here in this
lovely manuscript fragment.

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:06.470
The armillary sphere represents
the central hearth as according

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.210
to Aristotle and Ptolemaic
universe surrounded

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:13.870
by the major astronomical
circles.

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:17.850
It is not exactly a physical
model of the universe but more

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:21.830
of a tool that helps think of
the centrality of the Earth

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.560
and of those astronomical
circles which are fundamental

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.760
to understand every other
motion and phenomena in the sky

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.630
as projected in the
celestial field.

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:34.350
But nonetheless, it did
convey the strong impression

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:37.050
of the place of the
Earth in the arrangement

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:39.300
and in the order of things.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.930
In this frontispiece,

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.630
with French mathematician
Oronce Fine --

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.000
Oronce Fine appears
holding a [inaudible] light

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.840
in conversation with the muse
Urania and look that above him,

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.940
we see a complex diagram

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.360
in which the armillary sphere is
combined with a typical diagram

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.290
of the arrangement of the
orbs precisely to give this,

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:06.250
convey this idea that the
arrangement of the orbs

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.890
and the sphere all
converge in this idea

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.470
of how things are
arranged in the cosmos

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:18.630
and how motions can be
understood from the idea

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.860
of this relative arrangements.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.760
Armillary spheres
sometimes were taken

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.330
to high degrees of complexity.

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:30.480
In this example from 1562,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.030
by the prominent instrument
maker Gualterus Arsenius,

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:39.140
the armillary sphere includes a
substantial number of circles.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:43.530
It's a very intricate
arrangement that has the purpose

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:46.250
of simulating different
motions of the heavens

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.040
and explain different
motions in the sky.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.940
You see that it's a
very elaborate piece

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.550
and even the fact that it
survives [inaudible] suggest

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.920
that well, made by
a prominent maker

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.200
and such an exquisite piece,
more than a teaching tool

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.190
or more than a model of the
universe, it was also a symbol

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.440
of intellectual sophistication.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.300
And we might guess
maybe of status

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.340
of the owner having the
universe and an object

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.620
that reproduced its
motions basically at hand.

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:22.650
Some paper engineering was
also used to try to make sense

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:29.860
of the complex, the complexity
of planetary orbits as presented

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.610
in the works of Ptolemy and then
has explained through the works

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.210
of other authors such
as Georg von Peurbach.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:40.470
Here, we see a manuscript,
a [inaudible] manuscript

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:43.210
with volvelles illustrating
Peurbach's famous Theoricae

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.480
novae planetarium, the new
theories of the planets,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.260
which was a work that had wider
circulation and was widely used

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.340
as a textbook in the 15th
and in the 16th centuries.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.880
And what you see on
your left here --

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.890
so this is essentially a paper
device with movable parts

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:07.800
which would convey to
the user a better sense

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:12.240
of how the intricate arrangement
of circles and circular motions

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.880
that we heard of in the first
talk actually could explain

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.550
and help predict the position
of a planet in the sky.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.650
But imagining the
specific arrangement

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:28.120
for each planet was
actually quite complicated.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.780
Here we see this illustration
which is almost daunting,

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:37.600
really, where you see an attempt
of representing well on an image

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.600
on a [inaudible] image
the arrangements in space

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.190
of the specific arrangement
of orbs

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:50.200
and circles for each planet.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.080
Some instrument makers undertook
the challenge of turning this

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.080
into a natural three-dimensional
object.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.980
And what we're going to see
now in the image on your right,

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.110
it's very much resembling
of an armillary sphere

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:06.270
but it's actually
much more than that.

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.130
While the armillary sphere
was pretty much just the basic

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.210
representation of
the central Earth

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:13.770
and the major astronomical
circles --

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:17.820
that object on the right made
by Girolamo Della Volparia

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:23.320
in Florence, 1582, it's
actually a material realization

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.220
of the Ptolemaic theory
for the orbit of Mercury.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.060
And you see all the
arrangement of circles

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.740
and how complex it was.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.090
So these were all
techniques and ideas

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.570
that helped visualize the
complex arrangement of spheres

01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.330
that was used to --

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:44.860
was necessary to explain the
celestial motions according

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.710
to Ptolemy and the
theories of Ptolemy.

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:51.210
Of course, they have -- with
the advent of the telescope

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:58.010
and of telescopic observation
and we have heard already,

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.690
we've heard substantially about
it in the first talk, of course,

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:08.410
that the use of visual evidence
and the use of visual arguments

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:12.040
to convey telescopic discoveries
and to inform debates

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.450
about what these findings
really meant in terms

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:16.750
of the order of things.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.610
Of course, it brings
about new challenges

01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:23.820
and opens new pathways
for visualization

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:25.800
and for representation.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.870
And it's not only the
telescope, I think,

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:30.050
and it's not only
the printed image

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:34.850
that will help create really a
whole new image of the universe.

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.520
There was already a
background to accommodate all

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.820
of these new visual evidence.

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:45.020
Developments in perspective
throughout the Renaissance

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.880
[inaudible] new instruments

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.840
to measure the extensive mapping
now extending to the whole world

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.420
and refine old geographical
theories.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.900
And also the development of
the mapping of the heavens

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.390
which is eloquently represented
on your right together

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:06.230
with the very mapping
of Earth in this image

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:09.050
from the famous Andreas
Cellarius atlas,

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.810
<i>Harmonia Macrocosmica </i>.

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.040
All of these provides
a background

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.510
in which visualization
of the universe,

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:21.240
of its and of the celestial
objects will reach new heights.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.360
The old diagrams
showing the arrangements

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.710
of the orbs will
still be widely used

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:31.750
and they are still very
helpful to help situate

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:38.850
and to illustrate the different
arrangements that are central

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.790
to the debates of
the mid-17th century.

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:43.440
So here we see Ptolemy here.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.190
This is the frontispiece of
Giovanni Battista Riccioli's

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:50.590
"Almagestum novum" from 1651.

01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:55.350
And what we see here is pretty
much the visual synthesis

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:59.270
of mid-17th century astronomy.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:05.970
You have here -- here, you
have Ptolemy basically assuming

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.820
that he was wrong and his
system here is pretty much

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.120
on the corner.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.800
And you see that Astraea or
what seems to be some kind

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.090
of crossing between Astraea, the
goddess of justice and Urania,

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:23.710
the muse of astronomy -- she is
weighing two competing systems,

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:27.750
the system of Copernicus
and Riccioli's own version

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.860
of the system of Tycho Brahe
whose basic principle is

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.590
that you let the Earth
stay at the center

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:39.890
but you put the sun
orbiting the Earth

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:43.770
and then you can reason planets
orbiting the sun and in the case

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:48.070
of Riccioli's own system, two
planets still orbit the Earth.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:52.410
And the trick was that
with a model like this,

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.510
you could still explain
and accommodate things

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.250
that you observed
with the telescope.

01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:01.700
So she has, for example, the
phases of Venus and Mercury.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.960
So there was no decisive
argument besides the issue

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.060
of stellar parallax which
was impossible to measure

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.450
at this point in history.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.230
And that was already
mentioned in the first talk.

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.100
But there was no
decisive proof yet.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.640
But what's really fascinating
here is that if you look

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.720
to the upper corners
of the frontispiece,

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.190
you see the planets
represented with features

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.390
that could be already
observed with the telescope.

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:32.580
Note, for example,
the bands in Jupiter

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.960
and the satellites
of Jupiter around it.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.820
And here, a planet that is
very familiar and recognizable,

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.120
Saturn with its rings.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.740
And Saturn was precisely one
of the bodies that boast one

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.610
of the major challenges
in terms of visualization.

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:51.940
The varying appearances
of Saturn as seen

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.840
through a telescope through
time was very intriguing.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.600
So for decades, since
Galileo first observed it

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.240
with the telescope and
throughout the 1620s and 1630s,

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.540
it was very intriguing

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.790
to see Saturn showing sometimes
it had the appearance --

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:08.610
it seemed that it
had two satellites,

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:11.200
sometimes you could
see what astronomers

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.820
at the time called
[inaudible] or handles.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.920
But it was difficult to figure
out what this really was.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.120
It was Christiaan Huygens,
the author of the book

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.760
in which this illustration
appears,

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.280
the book called <i>Systema
Saturnium </i>published in 1659,

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.440
that came up with a
consistent explanation.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.760
He used good telescopes that he
built himself which are now some

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.100
of the -- those telescopes are
now in the Boerhaave Museum

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.770
in Leiden in the Netherlands.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:44.880
But he also made analogies
between the Earth-moon system.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.330
He also discovered the first
satellite of Saturn, Titan.

01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:51.020
And he also used some principles

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:54.690
from the mechanistic
philosophy of Rene Descartes.

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:58.150
So using all of these, but
above all, trying to figure

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:04.280
out the relative positions of
the Earth and Saturn in the sky

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.920
and imagining that
Saturn has a ring.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.080
He comes up with what
is basically the correct

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.820
explanation in this very
striking illustration.

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.340
So what you see here,
so you have the sun

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.930
at the center, the Earth.

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:27.310
And then you have Saturn with
its ring and what the outer ring

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:32.150
of images actually shows to
you is how Saturn when seen

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:34.730
from the Earth with a
telescope in a certain position

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:36.870
and a certain relative
arrangement,

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:39.650
what is the impression that
it produces in the telescope?

01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:44.810
And this image is quite
remarkable because it's not just

01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:46.920
about explaining the
different positions

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.050
of the celestial bodies in
the sky but also an appeal

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.690
to reposition the observer.

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.640
So imagine what the
perspective of the observer is

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.900
and what the relative
disposition

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.600
of bodies in space are.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.280
And so, this is really
remarkable and this is really

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.730
to a great extent, it's a
turning point in the way

01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:11.110
of visualizing things in space.

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:15.650
Throughout the 18th century,
these objects, the orreries,

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:20.230
mechanical models of the solar
system in which you have --

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:23.820
well, a record of visual
mechanical representation

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.060
of the Copernican and now, of
course, of the Newtonian view

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.790
of the universe, of the planets
in their orbits around the sun.

01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:34.080
Orreries are extremely important

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.900
in showing not just the
arrangement of the planets

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.310
but also showing the order

01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.600
of the celestial
motions in the sky.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.960
And there is a rich
iconography about the orrery,

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.110
this is probably one of the most
striking images of the orrery,

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.550
the famous painting
by Joseph Wright

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.650
which is [inaudible]
in an engraving.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:58.700
And you can see those three
children and one philosopher

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:04.360
in the audience around the
orrery having this lively image

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.650
of things moving in space.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:09.120
The Newtonian order
of the universe

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.320
which also carried a metaphor
of a moral order, of the harmony

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.270
of things, the harmony of the
heavens which was the same kind

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:20.170
of moral harmony
that we were supposed

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.120
to look for in our lives.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.890
Perhaps most of the times
unsuccessfully but still --

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.070
still a powerful metaphor.

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:31.850
And even in the 19th century,
when the orrery, now competed

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:35.350
with many other technologies
of visualization,

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:38.160
the idea of the orrery as
something that provides a sort

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.950
of a key to the true
arrangements in motions

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.430
of planets in the sky
is still very strong.

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:47.790
Here on the left,
you see a plate

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:51.030
from <i>Smith's Illustrated
Astronomy </i>,

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.830
sort of a visual textbook in
astronomy that was produced.

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:55.500
There were several editions

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.840
and I suppose it must have
been widely used in schools

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.470
in the U.S. And see, you look
here, the teacher is pointing

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:07.250
at a diagram, a flat diagram
of the orbits of the planets

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.370
and here, apparently
another teacher is pointing

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.670
at Saturn in the model.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.600
And there's a figure
here which, of course,

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.160
very beautifully we imagine is
putting, cranking the orrery

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.700
and putting it in motion.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.920
[Inaudible] that it can
make this connection

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.460
between the motions in the
model and the actual motions

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.390
in the sky and answer
the problem.

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:29.450
And that's a striking
image shows to you,

01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.810
the image on the
right shows you.

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:35.370
You see Urania taking a young
lady who's looking at the orrery

01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:37.260
and she's taking
her to the heavens

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:42.260
so the orrery is the very
key to the arrangements

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.130
and the order of the planets.

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.600
And the orrery is certainly
one of the ancestors

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.150
of my own institution,
the Adler Planetarium.

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:54.570
Here, we can see on the
left, you see the first model

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:59.120
of a project planetarium
from 1925 made

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.610
by the Carl Zeiss Company.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.960
And there, you can
see model number two

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.300
which was the projector that was
set up at the Adler Planetarium

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:11.900
in 1930 and which again, was the
first of its kind in America.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.200
It's important to remember

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.260
that even though
originally the planetarium,

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.030
the planetarium projector
was meant

01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:20.180
to reproduce what
we can actually see

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:22.200
in the sky outdoors in the dome.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.110
Basically, it brought
the heavens indoors.

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:29.110
But in the origins of the
orrery was the intention

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:34.530
to create a connection as an
experience between what you see

01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:37.730
in the actual sky and what
the actual arrangement

01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:39.840
of the planets in space are.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.540
So the concept of the projection
planetarium was originally

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.370
developed intended
as a counterpart

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:49.210
to a Copernican orrery.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.510
So and the projector,

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:54.050
the planetarium projector was
originally called the Ptolemaic

01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:57.010
planetarium precisely
because it brings us back

01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:58.690
to the geocentric perspective.

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.890
And so the very idea
in the beginning was

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.190
to create this connection

01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:04.230
between that geocentric
perspective

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:08.480
and the actual arrangements
of the orbits of the planets

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.390
in the sky and you see that in
this Copernican planetarium.

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:15.070
You have a moving platform and
there's a gentleman here looking

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:17.000
for some kind of periscope.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.380
And is looking at the
orrery in the ceiling.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.180
And supposedly what he's seeing

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.770
in through the periscope is
how the planets would appear

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:29.580
in profile in the actual sky.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.490
Now, one of the things
that planetariums and all

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:36.040
of these models could not
convey efficiently was the idea

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.100
of the true size,
the true dimensions

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:43.050
of both the planets
and their orbits.

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:45.860
And this has always been
a very important question.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.790
So in the 17th century, debates
about the sizes of stars,

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.880
for example, were extremely
important in discussions

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.610
about the actual
cosmological arrangement.

01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:57.910
Was Tycho right?

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:59.420
Was Copernicus right?

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.010
And the sizes of the stars
together with the debates

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:06.140
about it being possible or
not to determine the parallax

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:08.080
of stars, this was
extremely important

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.050
in the cosmological
debates of the periods.

01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:12.410
Here we see going back

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:15.600
to Andreas Cellarius'
<i>Harmonia Macrocosmica </i>,

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.490
here we have again a very
striking illustration

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:22.710
which pretty much I won't dare
say it was the first of its kind

01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:27.690
but sets up a visual convention
that will be extensively used

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:30.680
in the following centers
to show relative sizes

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.880
and dimensions of
celestial bodies.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.810
So basically, what this
image does is to superimpose

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:40.960
in a single representation
bodies of different sizes

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.900
as they were derived on the
basis of Ptolemy's theory.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.920
So basically, you
have the moon here.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.940
You have a scale here
which is marked in --

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.770
sorry, you have the Earth here.

01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:53.070
So this is the Earth.

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:54.550
And so basically, the diameter

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:58.260
of the Earth is the
unit, the basic unit.

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.430
And then you have
several bodies.

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:04.110
You have the planets
and you also have stars

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:07.290
that were supposedly of
different sizes according

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:10.050
to their brightness which is
a conception that, of course,

01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.710
we know now that
it's not correct

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.010
but that's not the point.

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:17.680
This is a very powerful way of
representing the different sizes

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.260
of celestial bodies by
showing their proportional

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.900
relative sizes.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.130
It's Christiaan Huygens again

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:32.190
who apparently is among the
first to use the same kind

01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:34.320
of convention [inaudible]
to convey the idea

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.420
of the planets according
to the Copernican system.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.640
So in his <i>Kosmotheorus </i>which
was published posthumously

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.070
and which is work in which
Huygens very much speculates

01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:48.210
about the possibility
of life existing

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:51.040
in the other planets
based on the principle

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.030
that the other planets again,

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.670
must be pretty much
like the Earth.

01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:58.090
They simply, they are different
in size and in appearance

01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:59.390
but they must be the same thing.

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:02.320
So they must have
their own inhabitants.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.900
And of course, with
developments in telescopes

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.640
and in the growing use of the
telescope as a measuring device,

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.000
a better knowledge --
sorry, a better knowledge

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.920
of planetary diameters
and the dimensions

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.990
of the planets now allows
Huygens to create his model

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:21.620
in which he represents the sun

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:25.610
and then he can show the
relative sizes of the planets

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:28.050
as compared to that of the sun.

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:31.890
And of course, you see here
that the internal planets, Mars,

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:36.130
the Earth, Venus and --
Mercury, Venus, the Earth

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.510
and Mars are very, very small.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:42.370
But again, for Huygens, it was
essentially a matter of size

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:44.160
and appearance because
he considered

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.510
that all planets
potentially could have their

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:47.830
own inhabitants.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.420
The same kind of
convention then will appear

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.370
in different types
of publications.

01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:56.360
For example, in broadsides
which were popular publications

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.630
that were aimed at a
variety of audiences,

01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:01.590
here we have a broadside
on the left.

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.640
We have a broadside
by William Whiston,

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.640
<i>A Scheme of the Solar System</i>
from around 1720 and you see

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.640
that this is meant to represent
the arrangements of the orbits

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.770
of the planets, also in there
with their relative sizes.

01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:16.910
And then you see
that's superimposed

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:20.050
to this illustration which
also shows you the orbits

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:23.050
of the comets, you
also have this diagram

01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:27.600
that again shows the relative
dimensions of the planets.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.170
Same thing here in
this illustration

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:35.440
from 1763 from the Netherlands.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.740
And some authors will add
further visual strategies

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:45.090
to convey further, convey this
idea of distances, of sizes

01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:48.580
and importantly, to
make the observer

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.590
and the reader reposition
herself

01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:54.000
or himself in other worlds.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.520
So here in this plate

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.800
from <i>Astronomy Explained upon
Sir Isaac Newton's Principles</i>

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.660
Mwhich was an extremely
important book and plenty

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:05.980
of editions throughout the 18th
century, very important book

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.500
in the popularization
of the ideas of Newton,

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:12.400
James Ferguson was himself a
very keen popularizer and maker

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.270
of scientific instruments.

01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:17.750
And you see that here, you
have very much the same kind

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:21.570
of conventions showing the
relative dimensions of orbits,

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:23.730
showing the different
sizes of the planets

01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:26.330
in proportion to each other.

01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:30.560
But here, this is a
remarkable addition.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.840
What you see here is basically
the apparent size of the sun

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.390
as seen from the
different planets beginning

01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:42.760
with from Mercury to -- this
one goes from Mercury to Saturn.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.040
And this is remarkable
because this is not just

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.610
about showing different sizes
or showing different dimensions

01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:55.260
but again, appealing to the
observer and to the reader to go

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.020
to different locations and
imagine how things would be seen

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.700
from different locations.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.410
Here in this illustration
from <i>A Compendious System</i>

01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:07.670
<i>of Astronomy </i>by
Margaret Bryan,

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.440
we see very much the
same kind of conventions.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.740
And it's interesting to note

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:16.080
that these visual strategies
will appear throughout a large

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.140
number of different
publications in which the image

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.850
of the solar system
itself, it's changing.

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:26.220
Notice here, for
example, "Georgium Sidus"

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.920
which eventually was
renamed as Uranus.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:33.390
So this diagram already shows a
new planet that has been added

01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:36.470
to the inventory of
the known planets.

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:38.200
And the more things
were discovered

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.380
and during the first
half of the 19th century,

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.110
several asteroids
were discovered

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:47.620
and they were generally
considered as planets, at least,

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.170
as long as you could still
include them in the model

01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:52.990
of the solar system, you
could still call them planets.

01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:56.540
By the mid-19th century,
perhaps around 10 were known.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.290
By the late, by the end of the
19th century, 500 were known

01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:01.730
and so eventually, they
had to be reclassified

01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.030
as a group of their own.

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:06.090
But before of that, they were
entitled to their own presence

01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.860
in diagrams of the solar system.

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.470
And here, you see
again from Asa Smith,

01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.800
here you see a diagram
showing the sizes

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.210
of the planets including
the asteroids.

01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:17.330
And here is a very
interesting diagram

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:21.160
which shows the relative
inclinations of the orbits

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.230
of the planets in the solar
system, a very intricate image

01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:30.090
because it also includes
the asteroids.

01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:33.820
This was a period when
there was a growing market

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.060
and a growing demand for
this kind of publication.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.030
There's a growing middle class.

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:42.070
There's a growing
access to education.

01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:44.840
And of course, instrument
makers and printers try

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.530
to take advantage of
these new market niches.

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:51.430
This was also a period when
the techniques of projection

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:56.370
and the Magic Lantern was
widely used in public lectures

01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:59.480
and widely used to convey
ideas about astronomy

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.710
and other fields to
general audiences.

01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:06.670
Here we see a rather
remarkable example

01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:10.870
of how these visual [inaudible]
to convey the different sizes

01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:12.860
of the planets and
the different --

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.970
and the distances and sizes of
their orbits appears in a set

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:19.310
of transparencies
which how the idea is

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:22.250
that he would hold the
transparency against the source

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.260
of light and he -- and this,

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.840
the image here would
gain vivid color.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.900
So it was in a sense bringing
the techniques of projection

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:34.730
and the magic -- the
effect of the Magic Lantern

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:37.170
to a small group,
a small audience

01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:41.130
and maybe more even a
domestic environment.

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:46.080
This form of visual
representation is very enduring.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.040
We still use it nowadays
everywhere in planetaria

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.730
and in science museums
all over the world.

01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:53.430
This is a gallery at
the Adler planetarium.

01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:57.170
And here, you have the
planets of the solar system,

01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:58.470
the Solar System Gallery.

01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:03.000
And we basically have the
planets at their relative sizes

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.750
and here, you can see this is
the top of one of our theaters.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.630
And so that stands for the sun

01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:12.050
and these are the relative
sizes of the planets.

01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:13.450
This is very much reminiscence.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.870
You will see this kind of
thing in science museums

01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:17.430
and planetaria all
over the world.

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:21.450
And this is very reminiscent
of the visual conventions

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:23.280
and the strategies
that we just saw

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.990
in those publications
and illustrations.

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:27.570
Now, we always have
to challenge that.

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:31.150
If you want to combine
the scale of the planets

01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:33.520
with the actual scale of
the orbits, in that case,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.140
it helps if you use a whole
city because the scale is

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:41.800
so overwhelming that we cannot
really combine it efficiently

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.350
within a planetarium.

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:46.660
So this is again, this
is a kind of installation

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.950
that you will also see in
different science sites

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:52.640
and science museums and
planetaria all over the world.

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.310
So we did at the
Adler Planetarium,

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:58.400
we've been using 2015 and
so the idea is that in order

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:04.180
to [inaudible] the scale
of the solar system,

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.300
we would have the sun basically
at the door of the planetarium

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.240
and then we will have the orbits

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.470
of the planets extending
throughout the city.

01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:17.790
So it will be a 10-minute walk
to Mars which would be right

01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:19.570
by the Field Museum
and the Shedd Aquarium.

01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:22.290
But if you want to reach
Pluto, and of course,

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.590
we have to include Pluto,

01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:26.970
not to hurt anyone's feelings
[laughter], you would have

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:30.370
to go almost to Evanston to
the very limits of the city.

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:34.440
So you would have the
super-imposition of well,

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.190
the scale of the solar system
with the scale of the city

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.830
which is a kind of
[inaudible] that they use

01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:43.810
to basically create the
sense of familiarity with all

01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:46.000
of these overwhelming scales.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.830
And I think the word
familiarity,

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:50.050
it's very important here.

01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:52.470
But still, I think
nothing is compare --

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:55.900
when we deal with scales and
sizes, we're still dealing

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.150
at the very geometrical
and abstract level.

01:29:58.150 --> 01:30:01.080
I think nothing is more
compelling than natural,

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.760
actually thinking of the
planets as actual places.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.070
And I think this sense of place,
it's pretty much what is --

01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:13.910
it underlies the space age
really because you don't,

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:17.380
you don't send spacecraft
to moving dots in the sky.

01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.810
You send spacecraft to
places where you would expect

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:25.060
to find some kind of
landscape topography features.

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:27.440
Of course, the telescope
gave faces

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.660
and features to the planets.

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:32.540
And I find these plates
from Alain Mallet,

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.970
this <i>Description de l'Univers</i>
from 1686, very striking

01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:39.940
because clearly, he
doesn't respect the scale

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.010
and he presents the planets just

01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:45.800
against these bucolic
landscapes.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.530
But I think the fact that
he doesn't respect scale,

01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:51.280
he wants certainly to create
a compelling visual effect

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.230
and I think there is some, there
is some kind of statement here

01:30:56.230 --> 01:30:58.240
that the planets have --

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.280
are also part of our
cosmic landscape in a sense.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.020
And they have their own
features, their own landscapes

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.520
and their own spatiality
as things here on Earth.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.030
Of course, we heard about how
the moon and how the discoveries

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:12.590
in the moon excited
the imagination,

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:16.200
the early modern imagination
and excited ideas about again,

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:20.110
repositioning the observers, the
idea of traveling to the moon.

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:23.380
The moon was, in fact, extremely
important because it's the --

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.410
well, it's the closest
celestial body

01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:30.570
that we could actually map early
in the history of the telescope.

01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:34.320
So astronomers like
Hevelius and others

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.720
in the 17th century produced
the first atlases of the moon.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.680
In many cases, using resorting
to conventions that were used

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:46.040
in terrestrial photography and
even trying to use the same kind

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.660
of nomenclature which
eventually gave way

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.270
to a nomenclature more based
on the names of astronomers

01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:54.550
and scientists connected to
the moon, which of course,

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:57.420
is sort of a self-reference
[inaudible]

01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.720
for astronomers themselves.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.280
But the fact is that these
moons really created this idea

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.850
of a celestial body being
the celestial body becoming a

01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:10.450
cartographic object,
becoming a natural place.

01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:13.080
And throughout [inaudible]
the 19th century,

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.950
even before photography
entered into the picture,

01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:20.760
we have very detailed maps of
the moon such as this chart

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.190
of the moon with 25
plates by Julius Schmidt

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:28.350
which really gives a very
strong topographic impression

01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:29.950
and image of the moon.

01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:33.870
But more than that, this
is still a representation

01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:35.570
on a sheet of paper.

01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:39.590
Julius Schmidt himself got
involved in giving a sort

01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:45.530
of a volumetric existence to
the moon by becoming involved

01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:47.900
in the making of
this moon globe.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.580
A very impressive moon globe
that was made in Germany

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.560
under the coordination and the
supervision of Julius Schmidt

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:59.760
and which eventually came to
the United States in the 1890s

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.880
and was put on display as shown
in this photograph at what,

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.180
at what at the time,

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:06.910
it was called the
Field Columbian Museum.

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:10.080
However, we know that there
are newspaper articles

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.240
so before the globe was put on
display at the Field Museum,

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.690
it was used as a kind
of a traveling exhibit.

01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.110
And it seems that it
was not very successful

01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:21.020
because people didn't
really seem to engage

01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.180
with it which is interesting.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.190
Could it be because it
basically just presented them

01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:30.210
with a very barren moon
and that was an exception?

01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:34.360
I think -- I find it
actually much more striking

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.750
than these moon globes with its
three-dimensionality is the idea

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:43.550
of again, the moon
having its own landscapes,

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:44.850
being its own place.

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:48.440
Here we have an extremely
interesting use of photography,

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.890
not to photograph the moon
itself because when this book,

01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:54.720
<i>The Moon Considered
as a Planet, a World,</i>

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.500
<i>and a Satellite</i>
by James Nasmyth

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.210
and James Carpenter
was published,

01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:01.020
actually the first
edition is from 1874.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.000
Photography was not still --

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.190
astronomical photography
was not developed enough

01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:09.170
to make an accurate
mapping of the moon.

01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:14.680
But so Nasmyth used, made
plaster models of lunar craters

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.300
and had to imagine some
lunar features to look

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.480
like to create these
really, really impressive

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.780
and striking images that
made us imagine, I think,

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:30.250
made the reader imagine
herself as being in the moon.

01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:32.010
Although Nasmyth advised

01:34:32.010 --> 01:34:34.060
that it's probably not
a very good place to be

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:36.570
and not a very suitable
place for life.

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:39.540
But still, this idea of
the moon, of a landscape

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.800
in another body, I
think, it's very striking.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.220
And nothing contributed as much
to that, I guess, as the debates

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.900
around the supposed
canals of Mars.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:53.310
Here we see an image of Mars
with its supposed canals

01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:58.920
from 1908 or the appearance of
Mars in 1905 by Percival Lowell.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.650
So many of you know Percival
Lowell became fascinated

01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:05.030
with the idea that there
could be canals on Mars.

01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:06.330
And it was announced

01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:09.170
by an Italian astronomer
called Giovanni Schiaparelli.

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:11.030
He talked about canal
in Italian.

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:14.460
It was translated as canals
and it conveyed the impression

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.310
that perhaps those were
artificial structures made

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:22.670
by some kind of Martian
civilization.

01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:28.800
So here, we move from not only
Mars becomes a cartographic

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.300
object but it becomes even
almost like an arena space

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.850
for infrastructure
public works program

01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:36.150
which is quite impressive.

01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:38.900
And needless to say, what's
happening in all of these images

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.730
and ideas is very much a
straightforward projection

01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:45.140
of things that are
happening in Earth.

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:48.510
All of this is happening
in an age of empire,

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:50.910
an age of great infrastructural
projects,

01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:54.860
an age of extensive
cartographic imperial projects.

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:58.290
And so, the Martian canals are
very much a resonance in this.

01:35:58.290 --> 01:36:01.370
But they have a tremendous
effect in public imagination.

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:05.310
For example, here we move
from the map of the planet

01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:09.850
with its supposed canals which
was just basically an effect

01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:12.720
of the brain trying to
connect disparate features

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.310
and this was proved
in the 1940s,

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.440
there were no canals
in Mars whatsoever.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.870
But Pandora's Box
had been opened.

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:23.490
So the [inaudible], public
imagination will remain excited

01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:24.790
about Mars to this day.

01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:27.860
There is something, I guess,
that connects Elon Musk

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.370
to what was happening
in this period,

01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:32.360
this fascination with Mars.

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.210
And of course, space
artist Chesley Bonestell,

01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:40.410
[inaudible] too but
in the United States,

01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:42.950
Chesley Bonestell -- they
played a very important role

01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:45.690
in further exciting
the public imagination

01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:48.130
by depicting the planets,

01:36:48.130 --> 01:36:53.190
combining available scientific
information with well,

01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:54.660
a great leap of imagination.

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.300
And of course, Bonestell before
becoming a fulltime space

01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:01.660
artist, he had worked as a
matte painter in Hollywood.

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.700
So he was well acquainted
with perspective and shadow.

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.150
And of course, he used
all of those techniques

01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:09.940
to create his very impressive

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.570
and realistic planetary
landscapes.

01:37:12.570 --> 01:37:16.780
Here on Mars and here again, the
idea of relocating the observer.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.680
Mars, as it would be seen
from its larger satellite.

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.620
And here, the famous painting
set on a scene from Titan.

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:32.850
And Chesley Bonestell went even
further down the solar system

01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:37.360
and he even invited us
to position ourselves

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.020
in other planets orbiting other
stars which is very impressive.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.360
Now imagining, we've
been talking essentially

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.660
of the solar system.

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.300
And now, I move to the
final part of my talk.

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.510
Imagine the solar system,
imagine this through scale

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:55.900
and its true dimensions
and getting the sense

01:37:55.900 --> 01:38:00.080
of place was difficult enough
but more so was to imagine

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.390
to depict and to represent
the stellar heavens.

01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:06.880
Of course, we had the debates
and the rise of Copernicanism

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.660
in the 17th century excited the
imagination of several authors

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:13.950
and thinkers about
the possibility of

01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:16.340
or what was called the
plurality of worlds,

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.640
the idea of other stars.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.780
So if the Earth is just a planet
orbiting the sun, it is possible

01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:27.580
that other stars have their
own planetary systems as shown

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:33.580
in this theatrical frontispiece
of Fontenelle's <i>Dialogues</i>

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.800
<i>on the Plurality of Worlds </i>.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:40.550
And here again, we see the same
idea in display by Nicolas Bion,

01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:45.410
in this case meant to illustrate
the ideas of Rene Descartes

01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:48.220
and this idea that
matter created vortices

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:49.860
that kept things in motion.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.990
But interestingly, it's how --

01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:54.230
so we have the depiction
of the solar system here

01:38:54.230 --> 01:38:57.430
and then the solar system is
just another star among other

01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:01.510
stars with their own
planetary systems.

01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.980
Eventually the ideas of
Descartes are overthrown

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:08.680
by Newton and Newtonian
mechanics.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.010
And in this very
dramatic representation

01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:15.280
of the Newtonian universe, which
interestingly was made by a man,

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.140
Issac Frost, who was part of the
Muggletonian sect so he wanted

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.210
with this image to show
this system is wrong

01:39:21.210 --> 01:39:23.490
and is not compatible
with the bible.

01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:26.840
However, it produced one of
the [inaudible] most beautiful

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.490
and striking representations
of the Newtonian idea

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:34.230
that stars are uniformly
distributed in space.

01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:37.630
And of course, here, the element

01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:41.400
that maybe stars have their
very own planetary systems.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.160
And note the colors
which are very impressive

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.460
so this was a technique,

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.120
an early printing
technique developed

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.730
by George Baxter using
different woodcuts

01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:52.260
and colors producing
this striking effect.

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.450
But now, even those
images convey this idea

01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:58.570
of the immensity of the universe
and the stellar universe.

01:39:58.570 --> 01:39:59.890
They don't really tell us much

01:39:59.890 --> 01:40:02.040
about how are stars
actually arranged in the sky?

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.670
And more importantly, a question
that was [inaudible] question

01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:10.620
and not that many people
there to address at least

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.010
up to the 18th century, what
is that white swath that we see

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:16.770
across the sky, the Milky Way?

01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:18.320
Of course, that Galileo
and others knew

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.420
when they pointed
their telescopes,

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.940
they knew they were
essentially stars

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:26.150
but why is there a concentration
of stars in that direction?

01:40:26.150 --> 01:40:29.230
One of the first authors
that not only speculates

01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:33.660
about the shape of the
Milky Way and that this --

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.670
but also of the distribution
of stars is Thomas Wright.

01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:41.510
Thomas Wright was essentially
a teacher so he had many hats.

01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:44.320
So he was essentially a teacher
but he was also a surveyor

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.280
and an architect who had
learned astronomy essentially

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.580
by himself.

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.930
And Thomas Wright's
project was not just

01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:55.070
to apprehend the structure
of the Milky Way but in fact,

01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:59.740
his major concern was to combine
the idea of a distribution

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:02.230
of stars in the universe and
their order in the universe

01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:07.130
with the moral and divine
center of the order of things.

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:11.020
So Wright essentially
speculates about the structure

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.320
and distribution of stars.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.020
But he has one correct intuition
which is that if we see

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:19.640
so many stars and this is
basically what is meant,

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.620
what this plate is
meant to show.

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:24.030
If you are here and if
you look in a direction

01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:27.940
where most stars are
concentrated, so of course,

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.990
you will see a swath of
stars in the white swath

01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:33.960
in that direction in the sky.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.880
But now, what is the
actual arrangement of stars

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.900
and what's our place in it
that produces this effect?

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:44.630
Wright plays with
different concepts.

01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:46.930
So one of the concepts
he comes up with is

01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:50.730
that maybe the stars
are arranged in a sort

01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:55.350
of a sphere forming a kind of a
hollow globe and in the center

01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:57.960
of that globe, so here are
the stars and in the center

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.870
of that globe is
the very divine,

01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:03.220
the center of divine
providence and the moral

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.980
and divine center
of the universe.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.370
And if we are positioned here,

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:10.030
if our sun is positioned
somewhere around here, so again,

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:14.230
when we look in the tangential
direction to the sphere

01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:18.990
of stars, we will an effect
like the Milky Way in the sky.

01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:21.350
Wright was not using
observational evidence.

01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:23.410
So he was basically
speculating and he played

01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:26.780
with other possible
arrangements as well.

01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.230
So here in the analogy
of Saturn,

01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:33.950
he imagined how the stars
could create the appearance

01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:38.440
to an observer on Earth, if
they were distributed in rings

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.650
around a center which is here
as the appearance of the planet

01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:46.790
but precisely just to emphasize
this idea of a metaphor.

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:49.960
And even though Wright was
not very fond of the idea

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.480
of multiple centers in the
universe, he also played

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.790
with that hypothesis and this
is what this image actually

01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:59.090
shows you.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.390
And now, I would
like to show you

01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:03.060
to better help us visualize
how this would work in space.

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:06.000
I would like to show you a
brief animation made by some

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.500
of my colleagues at the Adler
Planetarium based on Wright's.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.480
So this an animation made by
my colleague, Mark Subbarao,

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.500
who's the director of our
Space Visualization Laboratory

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.510
and Julieta Aguilera, who's
no longer with the Adler

01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:23.200
but also worked in the Space
Visualization Laboratory.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.820
So here, we have original
Wright's illustration.

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.360
So this is how the
stars would look

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.930
like according to
that model of his.

01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:37.290
And now, we will soon
get into, precisely get

01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:40.800
into a tangential plane
for the sphere of the stars

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.970
and get this impression
in space.

01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:50.130
But of course, again, these
conceptions, these of course,

01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:51.430
don't really have --

01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:54.870
don't really explain what
we actually are observing

01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:56.170
in the sky.

01:43:56.170 --> 01:43:59.140
It had the merit of trying to
bring and trying to materialize

01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:02.610
and to create a spatial
thinking about the arrangements

01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:05.620
of stars in the universe.

01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:08.850
But the connection between
actual astronomical observation

01:44:08.850 --> 01:44:12.280
and the attempt to study the
structure of the galaxy came

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.160
with William Herschel.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:16.650
So William Herschel, who is
better known for his discovery

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:20.230
of Uranus, his major project,
one of his major projects

01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:23.930
in astronomy was try to figure
out the structure of the galaxy.

01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:26.590
And he carried about him
extensive observing program

01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:29.210
using large telescopes
that he made himself

01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:33.000
and used some sort
of proto-statistics.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.070
So basically, he made
several assumptions

01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:36.370
which now we know
are not correct.

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:39.000
But he basically assumed
that he could see the borders

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.300
of the galaxy.

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.810
And so, he began by
pointing a telescope

01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:44.120
to different directions
in the sky

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.160
and by counting how many stars
he could see in each direction.

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:53.350
And so, by using that data, he
established this first attempt

01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.290
of a model of the galaxy.

01:44:55.290 --> 01:44:58.120
And again, I can show
you another animation.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.690
So basically what we have
here, and you have the Earth

01:45:01.690 --> 01:45:04.360
at the center and you
have most of the stars

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.790
in the Milky Way concentrated
along a single plane.

01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:11.520
And even though, of course,
the actual model of the galaxy

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:14.520
as according to the astronomy
of today is much different,

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.740
the basic intuition that the
stars must be distributed along

01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.730
the same plane is
basically correct.

01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:24.270
And now, I would like to --

01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:27.970
I'd like to show you
another animation.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.890
So here, we have it again.

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:35.480
It's basically again
the intuition

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.250
that the stars are more or
less distributed along the

01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:39.550
same plane.

01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:42.160
And of course, that the idea

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.230
of a spiral galaxy
comes much later.

01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:48.530
And I will actually end my talk
with that in a few minutes.

01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:49.870
So here, we have --

01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:52.230
so basically, from the
illustration made by Herschel,

01:45:52.230 --> 01:45:55.020
we turned that into the
actual distribution of stars.

01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:57.700
And here is the production of
the effect of the Milky Way

01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:01.240
so when you're looking precisely
in the direction of the plane

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.570
where most of the
stars are concentrated.

01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:07.200
It was only in the 20th
century, even though it's

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.290
such a familiar image, it
was only in the 20th century

01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:14.130
that astronomers were finally
able to prove that the shape

01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:17.970
of the galaxy is
actually a spiral shape.

01:46:17.970 --> 01:46:22.050
And what you see here is one of
two models, actual models made

01:46:22.050 --> 01:46:24.920
by William Morgan who was
at the Yerkes Observatory.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.260
And so he basically, by studying
the distribution of stars

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:32.770
and clouds of gas, whose
positions are represented

01:46:32.770 --> 01:46:39.850
by this tiny cotton spheres, it
was already known that old stars

01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:44.080
in spiral galaxies tend to
be concentrated at the center

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.530
of the galaxy and then you have
the younger stars, blue stars

01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:51.710
and you have ionized gas in
the outer arms of the galaxies.

01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:55.480
And so when Morgan and
his collaborators tried

01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.350
to map some clusters of the
young stars and ionized gas,

01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:03.750
they found these positions
and what you see here

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:06.500
and this was presented
at the meeting

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.220
of the American Astronomical
Society in 1951

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:12.470
and Morgan had gotten
a standing ovation

01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:14.280
when he presented
this very model,

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:18.050
that materialized what he had --

01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:21.660
what he had derived
from his data.

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:24.270
So this is pretty much
where the first time

01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:26.880
where you can see more or
less, the spiral shapes

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.410
of the galaxy being
derived and being presented

01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:33.130
which is now a very
familiar shape.

01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:37.210
So familiar that we even
have it in our backyard,

01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:38.710
in the Adler Planetarium.

01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:45.720
So what you see here on the left
is a model, a sculpture inspired

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.870
on the spiral shape of
galaxy by Johan Dave Mooney.

01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:52.080
He replaced the gas with
the skyline of Chicago.

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.450
And this is kind of our own
local Stonehenge in a sense.

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:56.910
So you could call
it the Adlerhenge.

01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:59.510
So basically it's a
monument, it's a sculpture

01:47:59.510 --> 01:48:01.650
with several stones with
astronomical alignments

01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:05.530
but again, based on the
shape of the galaxy.

01:48:05.530 --> 01:48:08.290
So that pretty much that shape
that was first derived using

01:48:08.290 --> 01:48:12.190
that model is now pretty much a
very familiar image in astronomy

01:48:12.190 --> 01:48:15.990
to the point that it's even
used in artistic installations

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:18.340
around the planetarium.

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:21.440
I like very much the fact
that this sculpture is just

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.840
by the lake which serves
in a sense as a reminder

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:30.690
that our galaxy is actually just
part of a much broader horizon.

01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:34.220
But by creating familiar
shapes and familiar forms

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:37.690
and by somehow making
the heavens tangible,

01:48:37.690 --> 01:48:42.100
giving them dimensions,
bringing them closer to us,

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:44.780
super-imposing the scale
of the heavens with scales

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:48.810
of things we are more familiar
with like the scale of a city,

01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:52.760
and essentially trying
to present them in a way

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.530
that gives a sense of place,

01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:58.180
I think we make the heavens
more familiar and apprehensible.

01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.840
And I would like to end by
saying that and going back

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.290
to the story I told
in the beginning

01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:06.720
about that lady was overwhelmed
by the scale of the universe,

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.930
I think imagining the
extraordinary is essentially an

01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:16.530
attempt to make it ordinary,
apprehensible and familiar.

01:49:16.530 --> 01:49:18.330
Thank you very much.

01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:28.120
[ Applause ]

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.100
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo: All right,
thank you very much, Pedro.

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:36.330
It is my true pleasure to
welcome Kimberly Arcand,

01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:40.030
our next speaker and our last
for this session to the stage.

01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:42.360
Kimberly is the visualization
lead

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.550
at NASA's Chandra
X-ray Observatory

01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:47.380
which has its headquarters

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.290
at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory

01:49:50.290 --> 01:49:52.660
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.090
Arcand is an award-winning
producer and director.

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:59.820
And she is a leading expert
in studying the perception

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.510
and comprehension of high
energy data visualization

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:07.510
across the novice
expert spectrum.

01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:12.030
As a science data storyteller,
she combines her background

01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:15.270
in molecular biology
and computer science

01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:20.410
with her current work in the
fields of astronomy and physics.

01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:23.690
Today, Kimberly will be
talking about the intersection

01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:26.870
of data visualization
and human choice

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:30.570
which is a sort of
fascinating topic.

01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:34.050
On a personal note, it
was with some timidity

01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:38.580
that I first approached
Kimberly for this symposium.

01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:43.830
I was aware of her intimidating
amount of publications,

01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:48.570
her work with NASA and her
TED talks but I imagine

01:50:48.570 --> 01:50:50.900
that she would have
little interest in talking

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:54.630
to a rare books curator
about her research.

01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:58.420
One can fake many things
but knowledge of physics

01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:02.320
and molecular biology
was beyond my capability.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:07.260
I was happily proven wrong and
Kimberly is here with us today.

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.910
Her enthusiasm and
dedication to stories

01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:15.010
about science is truly
inspiring and so I am so pleased

01:51:15.010 --> 01:51:16.810
to welcome Kimberly
to the stage.

01:51:16.810 --> 01:51:24.280
[ Applause ]

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.580
&gt;&gt; Kimberly Arcand:
Thank you so much.

01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.250
I have an artifact and I'm
going to put it on display.

01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:30.900
I'm like a proper curator.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.050
So I'm going to talk about
things that are very big

01:51:42.050 --> 01:51:44.410
and also things that
are very small.

01:51:44.410 --> 01:51:47.490
And the reason I'm
going to do that is

01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:49.940
because I started out with this.

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:52.360
This is Ixodes scapularis.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.270
It is essentially a deer tick.

01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:58.270
And inside its stomach are
these little tiny spirochetes,

01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:00.430
these bacteria that
when transmitted

01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:04.110
to humans can give us Lyme
disease if the tick is attached

01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:06.700
to you for like 24 to
48 hours but details.

01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:08.900
The point is this is
where I started out.

01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.220
This was kind of my introduction

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:13.130
into science as an
undergraduate.

01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:15.520
But I quickly realized that I
was actually more interested

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:19.470
in the tools that I was using,
the computer essentially

01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:23.140
than I was interested in
staring at the stomach

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:28.280
of the deer tick 24 hours
a day under a microscope.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.340
So I went and studied
data visualization

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:33.640
and image and meaning.

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:36.240
And that actually
landed me a job working

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.180
for NASA's Chandra
X-ray Observatory.

01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:40.750
Now, I got this job
when I was --

01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:43.380
let me see, it must
have been 1998

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.040
so it's been almost 20 years.

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:48.230
The Chandra X-ray Observatory
was just about to launch.

01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:51.410
And it's an amazing
technological achievement.

01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:54.200
It studies the high
energy universe so things

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:58.450
like exploding stars, black
holes, colliding galaxies --

01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:02.630
these really violent
cosmic events

01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:06.650
that we can study high
energy information from.

01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:10.570
It was great to be a part
of that as it was launching.

01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:14.460
But again, this is where
I was starting out.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.760
This is actually an image

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.230
of the spirochete
inside that tick stomach.

01:53:19.230 --> 01:53:21.140
It's Borrelia burgdorferi.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:24.850
And this each -- one of these
little spiral things is about 10

01:53:24.850 --> 01:53:26.990
to 25 micrometers long.

01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:30.450
So I had to translate that
information that I was used

01:53:30.450 --> 01:53:34.390
to dealing with into looking
at things like this instead.

01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:36.570
This is the [Inaudible]
galaxies.

01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:40.990
It's a sort of spiral-shaped
collision of two galaxies.

01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:43.880
And this is 60,000
light years across.

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.710
Where a light year is the
distance that light travels

01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:49.830
in a year which is about
10 trillion kilometers.

01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:53.030
So 60,000 times 10
trillion kilometers.

01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:57.120
So it's a pretty big
scale difference, I think.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.650
But really, what I want to talk
about today is this idea and I'm

01:54:01.650 --> 01:54:04.520
so happy that the
historians went before me

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.060
because I'm not a historian.

01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:08.920
So it's great that that language
has already been introduced

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.110
and I can just ride
on their coattails.

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:13.990
Because I want to talk about
this idea of a visual language

01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:17.200
which both speakers earlier
talked about briefly.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:20.460
And they also introduced
Galileo's moon

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.760
which I will show too.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.360
But I won't have
to talk about all

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.950
because you're all
experts obviously

01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:26.370
in Galileo's moon by now.

01:54:26.370 --> 01:54:29.060
So when we talk about
how our images

01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.120
of the universe are really how
any image in science is created.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.240
It's through a selection
of choices.

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:39.820
It's through a human using
software that has been created

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:44.600
by humans using data that
was collected by hardware

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.370
that was made by humans.

01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:48.400
So there are these
strings of choices

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.790
and human biases along the way.

01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:53.280
I'm going to try to
talk about some of that.

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.470
So to make images like this,

01:54:55.470 --> 01:55:00.660
there's this visual language
scale, context, dimensionality,

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:03.970
field of view, cropping,
selection itself.

01:55:03.970 --> 01:55:06.840
These things are done
to make a point, right.

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:10.760
There is a science story to
tell but there's also this idea

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:14.780
that you want your image to be
memorable, to be persuasive.

01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:19.580
So we're going to look at
bugs because obviously,

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.210
I love bugs if I spent so
much time looking at them.

01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:27.170
These are from Hooke's
<i>Micrografia </i>who we also heard

01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:30.480
about from, I think, both
-- no, Gaskell mostly.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.420
And we've got a couple
of examples here

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:34.330
that I particularly like.

01:55:34.330 --> 01:55:35.730
One, I just think
they're beautiful.

01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:37.920
These are really
beautiful illustrations.

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:41.180
Hooke, I think, had a really
amazing talent for being able

01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:44.420
to bring his objects to life.

01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:46.980
But he's also using very
specific visual techniques

01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:49.860
to translate something that
started out in three dimensions

01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.660
into a two-dimensional form.

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.830
He's collapsing that
information onto a version

01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:55.510
that works on the page.

01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:59.160
And he's carefully
creating his images through,

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.620
you guessed it, a
series of choices.

01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:05.570
So in this case, Hooke is
really placing his instrument,

01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:08.700
a microscope typically but he
did also work with telescopes

01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:11.140
as an extension of our senses.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.190
With this introduction of this
new equipment in the 1600s,

01:56:15.190 --> 01:56:19.280
it offered that the observer
could then function as a bridge,

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.140
a bridge between
an invisible world

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:23.830
and in other interested parties
who didn't necessarily have

01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:25.400
to do the observing themselves.

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.300
That immediately gives you
a sense of distance already

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.950
as the third party viewer,

01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:33.680
not just the distance
physically but also in time.

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:36.700
So what kind of visual
strategies did Hooke use?

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.470
Well, he used his
space really well.

01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:41.650
Isolation, composition,
contrast, shading,

01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:44.290
dimensionality, all these
really important things

01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:48.180
that we use today, hundreds
of years later in astronomy.

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.310
So a really quick description
of what it is we're looking at.

01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:53.500
On the left, we've
got a lovely gnat.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:56.860
And this beautiful gnat has
been zoomed in quite a bit

01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:59.410
so that you don't
see all of its body.

01:56:59.410 --> 01:57:01.690
That's a very intentional
framing.

01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:04.810
It's just enough so you can
see the details of the wings,

01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:08.450
of the body on the
bottom, of just the hairs

01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:10.660
on its legs, really lovely.

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:14.230
On the right, we actually
have the eye of a drone fly.

01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:17.390
I think it's a grey
drone fly, to be precise.

01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:19.590
And again, with this
image, we're cropped

01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:21.570
in really, really tight.

01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:25.240
Hooke is taking you to a very
specific place really guiding

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.240
your eye on what to see
and what's important.

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:30.080
There's a really
interesting perspective here

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.020
on what he is choosing to do.

01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.940
So this sort of visual
language then has

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.080
to be essentially
decoded, right.

01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.920
By the cropping, by the framing,
he's giving you a very specific

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.730
but also very dramatic and quite
beautiful thing to look at.

01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:47.910
He was always one for drama.

01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:50.260
So how do we compare
with astronomy?

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:52.220
And I had a little
fun here because both

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:55.710
of these nebulas are
named, nicknamed after bugs.

01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:59.630
So on the left, we have the
Ant Nebula because why not?

01:57:59.630 --> 01:58:02.930
But you can see, here I chose
to crop in pretty tightly.

01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:05.060
This is using optical
or visible data

01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.720
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.980
And what a planetary
nebula like this is,

01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:12.720
is essentially a sun-like
star that is slowly dying.

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:15.370
As they die, they puff
off their outer layers

01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:18.350
and create these beautiful
nebulas that you see here.

01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:19.820
Now, in both of these examples,

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:22.220
they're really nice
with their symmetry.

01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.420
So I also picked that on
purpose besides the fact

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:25.950
that they were named after bugs.

01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:28.700
And I've cropped in really
tightly for a reason.

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:30.540
So there is more
data to see here

01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.400
but I'm not allowing
you to see it.

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:35.250
The cropping is a
very specific intent.

01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:37.830
You want to see all of the
action, all of the things

01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:42.100
that are going on as this
sun-like star is throwing off

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.400
its outer shell.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.250
And then, of course,
on the right,

01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:47.430
that one's called
the Bug Nebula.

01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:49.570
It's also nicknamed the
Butterfly Nebula but I'm going

01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:52.320
to use bugs since it's
closer to the previous slide.

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.620
And it's the same thing.

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.130
It's the same type
of planetary nebula.

01:58:55.130 --> 01:59:00.080
This beautiful death of a star
and we're cropped in so tight

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.120
because right inside
the center point

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:06.980
of that bipolarization is the
star itself that we can't see

01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:09.390
because in this case,
we're using optical light.

01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:12.870
And optical light cannot get
through that gas and dust.

01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:16.580
So again, very intentional.

01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:19.520
Now, we're going to look at
rosemary and other leaves,

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.900
not as exciting as a topic
but what I really liked is

01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:29.000
that the scope view provides a
sort of secondhand experience

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.100
that makes it feel more virtual
like you're actually there.

01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.000
You're actually looking
through the microscope yourself.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.920
Of course, by doing
this, you get to tie

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.450
in really close again.

01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:40.240
You get to look at this texture.

01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.620
You get to look at how he's
done the shading in the area

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.980
that he selected of interest.

01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.000
But it's also again
quite intentional.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.380
And in astronomy, we
can do similar things.

01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:52.950
So here, I picked these images
because well, they're round

01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:54.770
and I thought the symmetry
was nice for the texture.

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:56.320
But essentially, we're looking

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:59.080
at three examples
of exploded stars.

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.320
So these are stars
larger than our sun

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.940
that have, you guessed it, died.

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.180
And I'm not like really
morbid but it's just --

02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:08.640
this is, you know, the nature
of the universe in some sense.

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:11.670
So we're going to be talking
about a lot of dead stars today.

02:00:11.670 --> 02:00:15.510
But again, what this really
tight closed circular crop

02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:18.180
allows us to do is to
see a lot of the detail

02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:22.250
and also it's a practical thing
because in all three examples

02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:25.000
of these super nova remnants,
all the data was taken

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.060
by the Chandra X-ray
Observatory.

02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:31.360
Outside of those frames,
there's not really much to see.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.010
It's just kind of black space
and a little bit of x-ray noise.

02:00:35.010 --> 02:00:37.580
So if you leave an
entire frame like that

02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:41.650
around this important x-ray
observation, it gives a sense

02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:44.680
to the viewer that there is
nothing else around that object.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.160
And that's actually not true.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:49.140
It's just we can only
see this in x-ray light.

02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:51.860
If we were to combine it
with say, an optical field

02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.870
or infrared, we would see yet
more of the universe behind it.

02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:58.200
So by cropping in really
closely to the objects,

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.480
we're actually helping to view,
to help guide the viewpoint

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.160
that these are specific objects

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.970
that we're just concentrating
on right here.

02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:11.050
Now, not bugs but
looking at seeds.

02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:14.440
Why I selected these images
from Hooke's drawings was

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:15.740
that I just thought the texture

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.180
and the dimensionality
were really exquisite.

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.390
On the left, we have
poppy seeds.

02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:23.690
So this magnification
is really quite amazing.

02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:27.740
And on the right, we have
seeds of thyme, I believe.

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:32.840
Now, you can see all the
little mottling, the texturing,

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.510
the ridging, you can see
where his light is coming

02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:38.770
from because it's
casting shadows.

02:01:38.770 --> 02:01:42.780
And that kind of dimensionality
again makes it feel more real

02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:46.890
as if you're closer to the
observation, to the information,

02:01:46.890 --> 02:01:49.450
to the data than you
might be otherwise.

02:01:49.450 --> 02:01:52.930
In astronomy, dimensionality
is incredibly important too.

02:01:52.930 --> 02:01:55.880
Now, this image, I just selected
because it kind of looked

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:57.360
like the seeds in a way.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:00.150
But again, you're looking
at individual galaxies

02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:03.170
that are many, many
billions of light years away.

02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:04.910
A light year is the distance
that light travels in a year,

02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:06.950
10, you know, trillion
kilometers.

02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:09.140
So these are billions
upon billions.

02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.590
This is pretty much as far as
we can see in astronomy today

02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:14.360
in the observable universe.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.250
And still when we're talking our
image, when we're creating them,

02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:19.150
we are trying to make
sure that the idea

02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:21.240
of dimensionality
is still there.

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:24.780
But probably an even better
example is this image which is,

02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:26.080
I think, kind of famous.

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.280
It's from the Hubble
Space Telescope.

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.450
It's called the "Pillars
of Creation"

02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:34.750
and it's also nicknamed
the Eagle Nebula and M-16.

02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:36.050
Astronomy has a thing for names.

02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:37.350
We've got a lot of nicknames.

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:41.470
But these are really beautiful,
tall columns of gas and dust

02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:43.460
where stars are being born.

02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:44.760
So there's -- so there we go.

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:47.580
It's not all about death.

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.410
The column on the left is
about four light years tall.

02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:53.850
So four times 10
trillion kilometers.

02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:56.120
So it's quite a difference
in scale,

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:58.360
four times 10 trillion
kilometers

02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:01.230
versus the 400 times
magnification that we looked

02:03:01.230 --> 02:03:02.900
at in the previous slide.

02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:08.190
But the way this image was
created again, was intentional.

02:03:08.190 --> 02:03:11.850
It was to talk about the science
and the science in this case,

02:03:11.850 --> 02:03:17.240
is this idea of these immense
pillars of gas and dust

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:20.650
where these baby
stars are being made.

02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:25.310
And to get across the point
of the dimensionality, we --

02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:26.670
well, the image processers

02:03:26.670 --> 02:03:30.190
on this specific data
set applied colors

02:03:30.190 --> 02:03:34.670
in a very strategic way to
encourage that dimensionality

02:03:34.670 --> 02:03:37.810
to be immediately
visible to the viewer.

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:40.500
And that was purely
by color selection.

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:41.800
So I'll talk a little bit

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.570
about more how we make
astronomy images in a second

02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:48.660
but essentially for this
image, the colors were chosen

02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:53.170
by chemical elements, by the
light emission due to them.

02:03:53.170 --> 02:03:57.320
So red was from sulfur and
the blue color was assigned

02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.350
to hydrogen and helium.

02:03:59.350 --> 02:04:01.610
And I think green was
assigned to oxygen.

02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:04.530
So it's kind of like
an elemental map

02:04:04.530 --> 02:04:10.070
of the stuff that's going on in
this really beautiful nebula.

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:12.770
By choosing those colors,

02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:14.830
now this is something we
can't see with our human eyes.

02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:19.040
Even though it's mostly optical
light, our eyes are kind of puny

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:22.200
in the grand scheme of things
and we could never detect all

02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:26.030
of this information with
just the eyes that we have.

02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:29.030
So these telescopes give
us superhuman vision.

02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:31.210
So when we're working
with our data,

02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:34.220
it doesn't particularly
matter what colors these are

02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:37.550
because it's not something we
could really observe directly.

02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:40.900
So the color assignment was
meant to help further the idea

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.850
that this has dimension
and shape to it.

02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:46.010
And so with blue being
more on the background

02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:48.090
and the reds being
more in the foreground,

02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:50.730
that idea of dimensionality
and shading, I think,

02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:53.670
was really made a lot stronger.

02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.380
When we think about things
like scale, which is, I think,

02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:01.220
a really difficult thing to
talk about when you're looking

02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.310
at something really, really
small or when you're looking

02:05:03.310 --> 02:05:05.700
at something really, really big.

02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:10.120
One of the easiest techniques
to do is to provide some sort

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:13.510
of sense of scale through
a physical representation.

02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:16.920
So on the left here, we have
this really lovely louse

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.620
and I don't think that's
probably something I say

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:20.920
very often.

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:25.610
But it's grasping a
single strand of hair.

02:05:25.610 --> 02:05:28.750
So that immediately gives
you a sense of scale.

02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:31.470
But also context because
well, let's face it.

02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:33.650
Lice, they like hair.

02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:37.970
So it provides so much more
than just a little, you know,

02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:39.450
something for it to hold on to.

02:05:39.450 --> 02:05:42.490
It gives you that immediate idea
of scale and contextualization.

02:05:42.490 --> 02:05:47.410
On the right is essentially
another idea of scale.

02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:51.150
The idea here that he was trying
to show was that sometimes,

02:05:51.150 --> 02:05:54.110
things that seem so
smooth are really not.

02:05:54.110 --> 02:05:58.230
And the pollen grain
looking-like thing is actually a

02:05:58.230 --> 02:06:00.650
printed full stop, a period.

02:06:00.650 --> 02:06:04.480
And for scale, you can
also see the needle point

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.710
and then underneath
that is the razor.

02:06:06.710 --> 02:06:10.810
So it's this idea of you know,
known things and looking at them

02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:13.750
in a different way but still
providing a relationship

02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:16.050
to each other.

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.900
Scale in astronomy is hard.

02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:22.260
It's really hard.

02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:26.570
So our sun is kind of small
in the grand scheme of things.

02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:28.430
It's just an ordinary star.

02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:30.140
It's kind of on the
smaller size.

02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:32.140
It's not super exciting.

02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.440
It's perfect for us.

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:34.740
Don't get me wrong.

02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.040
I love our sun.

02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:38.550
I'm not, you know,
dabbling at that much.

02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:40.670
So when it comes to
talking scale, well,

02:06:40.670 --> 02:06:43.990
you could fit maybe a
million Earths inside our sun.

02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:47.910
So we can show the idea
of scale by positioning

02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:50.200
that one single Earth
in relation

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:53.230
to this one outburst
coming out of the sun.

02:06:53.230 --> 02:06:56.640
And that single outburst which
was not particularly big,

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:59.720
dwarfs the Earth by quite a lot.

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:01.400
Now, the issue is as soon

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:05.890
as you get beyond something
that's a little bit more doable

02:07:05.890 --> 02:07:08.860
in size like the sun
is to bigger things,

02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:13.720
how do you portray the scale in
a meaningful way to the viewer

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:18.430
who might not necessarily have
any sort of personal connection

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:22.650
to sizes of these things,
like not of us really do?

02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:24.910
Scale bars have been
used for a while.

02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:27.820
As you can see, Hooke
used quite a lot of them

02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:29.300
in his <i>Micrografia </i>.

02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:33.320
This is blue mold that's
been magnified, I think 200

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:36.040
or 300 times, really lovely.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.080
Again, he's using the
circular view but this idea

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:41.520
of the scale bar
was really useful.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.510
We apply scale bars
in astronomy as well.

02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:47.740
In this case, however, the
scale is quite difficult.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.070
We actually are looking here

02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:53.260
at the El Gordo cluster
of galaxies.

02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:56.640
This is the most
massive distant cluster

02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:59.840
of galaxies we've ever been
able to detect with a mass

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.740
of about three quadrillion suns.

02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:08.070
This image is seven
million light years across.

02:08:08.070 --> 02:08:11.580
Again, light year, 10
trillion kilometers.

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:13.000
It's really huge.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.230
We provide a scale in
[inaudible], not super helpful.

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:18.960
So typically, when I'm
talking about scale,

02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.790
I really do like to
try to break it down,

02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:22.970
at the very least,
into light years.

02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:24.910
But even light years, I think,

02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:29.930
are hard to really
grasp the size of them.

02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:33.450
When we talk about how we
represent these objects

02:08:33.450 --> 02:08:37.270
physically, I was always
struck by this image

02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:39.990
from <i>Micrografia</i>
which is the flea.

02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:43.750
And if you've ever seen it
in person, it's like the size

02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:46.400
of a cat or maybe a
small dog even, right?

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.720
I think it's kind of
ironic because, you know,

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.020
fleas like cats and dogs.

02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.320
So I don't know if that
was intentional or not.

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:53.940
But I've always thought
it was really funny.

02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:58.360
But it's this idea of the
outsized, it adds such a sense

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.580
of drama and spectacle
for the viewer.

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.520
And I think spectacle might
perhaps be a little undersold

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:07.820
as a technique.

02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:11.170
I really do appreciate
the artistic merit

02:09:11.170 --> 02:09:14.020
that creating something
like this took

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.380
and what effect it has.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:19.310
In astronomy, it's
difficult to go really big

02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:22.610
because the objects are so huge.

02:09:22.610 --> 02:09:25.600
So we can show something
on a wall.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.890
I guess you guys are looking
at a pretty large version.

02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:29.190
That's kind of cool.

02:09:29.190 --> 02:09:32.650
We can go, you know, a little
bit more dimensional and big

02:09:32.650 --> 02:09:34.890
and really the only reason
I chose this picture is

02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:36.240
because when I was
looking through it,

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:40.050
I saw that Her Majesty
the Queen was in there.

02:09:40.050 --> 02:09:43.400
I thought we would maybe
take a little quick stop

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.430
for all the talking this
morning and play a game.

02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:53.040
What I thought we would do is
look at a few modern images

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.270
from microscopy because I didn't
want it to be just historical.

02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:59.040
A lot of the things that I'll be
talking about and haven't talked

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:03.040
about so far reflect on new
just as much as the old.

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:08.170
And so here, I've actually
gathered pairs of images

02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:12.030
from microscopy as well as
astronomy just to showcase some

02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:15.100
of the unintentional
similarities that are

02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.810
to be found in these
things across such very,

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:20.110
very different scales.

02:10:20.110 --> 02:10:24.260
So if we look at the --
let's take the bottom right.

02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:26.520
Now, one of these is
really big and one

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:27.820
of these is really small.

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.300
How many people think
the one on the left

02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:34.560
of those two far right panels is
the really big one of the pair?

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.440
Just raise your hands.

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:37.800
How many think that
one's the big one?

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:39.160
A couple. How many think the one

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.670
on the very far right is
the biggest of the pair?

02:10:41.670 --> 02:10:43.140
Oh, wow! All right.

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:44.970
It must be the field
that you're all in.

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:46.270
You're correct [laughter].

02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:51.920
So the image on the far bottom
right is a quasar 3C273,

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:55.330
incredibly distant,
billions of light years away,

02:10:55.330 --> 02:11:00.680
powered by this massive, super
massive black hole at its center

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:03.560
that is pumping out
this ridiculous stream

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.060
of high energy particles.

02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:06.730
It's gargantuan.

02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:11.350
And the image right
next to is -- oh, me --

02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:12.650
which one is that one?

02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:15.230
That one is not my image.

02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:16.730
It is membrane fission.

02:11:16.730 --> 02:11:18.180
So it's really small.

02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:21.570
But I was struck by how
similar they look just

02:11:21.570 --> 02:11:23.100
in their visual sense.

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:27.810
How about perhaps the
images on the upper left?

02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:30.730
There are two red-like images.

02:11:30.730 --> 02:11:35.500
Who thinks the one on the left
is the biggest of the pair?

02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:36.800
Raise your hand.

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.100
I just want to see.

02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:39.400
Yeah. And who thinks the one

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.660
on the right is the
bigger of the pair?

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.900
Oh, wow. So this one
was much more split.

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.930
So the image on the left
is actually stars dying

02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:51.460
because that's my favorite
in the Small Magellanic Cloud

02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:54.460
which is a really small
satellite mini-galaxy not too

02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.960
far away from us but still,
it's like, I don't know,

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.750
100,000 light years away.

02:11:58.750 --> 02:12:05.800
And then the image on its right
is Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:08.060
And when you look at
these images up close,

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.110
I don't know how
great your view is.

02:12:10.110 --> 02:12:13.110
The visual resemblance
between the two is really

02:12:13.110 --> 02:12:14.440
quite striking.

02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:18.780
So the fact that we are able to
look at this from a microscope

02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:20.700
for the one on the right and
through a telescope for the one

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:22.710
on the left is absolutely
incredible.

02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:25.130
I'll just do the other pairs
really quickly for people

02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:27.460
who want to finish
the game on their own.

02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:31.070
Pair two is the sun
compared with Raji cells.

02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:34.380
And those Raji cells can lead
to Epstein Barr syndrome.

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:38.210
Pair three, onion cells and
another dead star, my favorite.

02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:40.940
So that's the ones here
on the bottom left.

02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:44.750
Pair four is rabbit tongue
cells compared to Jupiter

02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:46.840
so that's the upper right.

02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:49.670
And the one underneath it is
a comparison between Mercury,

02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:52.600
our planet and embryonic
stem cells.

02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:55.830
Now I think, you know, a lot
of you got the answers right.

02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:57.480
Not that you know, it's a quiz.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:02.170
But I think it is -- there are
visual cues that you can follow,

02:13:02.170 --> 02:13:04.960
resolution and scale
and structure.

02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.440
But I just thought it
was really interesting

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.180
to see so many similarities.

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:10.470
And when I'm talking about
that visual language,

02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:14.350
it still applies to modern
microscopy images as well

02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:16.450
as astronomical images.

02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:20.720
So I'm just going to
do a little brief segue

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.580
into what I do all day.

02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:25.860
So this is an image of our sun

02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:27.960
and it's actually showing
the many different kinds

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:29.940
of light that our sun emits.

02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:33.700
One of the really important
tools in astronomy is the fact

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:37.040
that there is this entire
multi-wavelength spectrum

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.060
of information in order

02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:41.880
to understand things
in the universe.

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.360
And we really need to understand
many different kinds of light

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.970
in order to grasp the
objects that we're looking at.

02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:52.040
This is one of my favorite
objects in the entire universe.

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:57.620
And I get to see that because
essentially it's the first

02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:01.220
object that the telescope that
I work for ever looked at.

02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:04.840
It's Cassiopeia A which
is a star that exploded.

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:06.400
Yes, I know.

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.700
It's a super nova remnant.

02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:11.260
It is about 10 to
11,000 light years away

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:13.770
so 10,000 time 10
trillion kilometers.

02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:15.750
And we're looking
at it with data

02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:18.030
from the Hubble Space
Telescope, quite beautiful,

02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:22.730
showing this 10-million-degree
filamentary structure.

02:14:22.730 --> 02:14:26.130
We look at that exact same
field of view that I've selected

02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:29.060
from Chandra's X-ray Observatory

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.500
and we get a completely
different view

02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:33.360
of the same patch of sky.

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:34.750
So utilizing different kinds

02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:36.690
of light is really
important for us.

02:14:36.690 --> 02:14:39.110
If we composite the
two images together,

02:14:39.110 --> 02:14:40.940
we get a better sense
of what's going on.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:43.890
Because as we noticed from the
exercise earlier, sometimes,

02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:46.540
if you're looking at
an image like that,

02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:49.010
if you don't have some
sort of recognizable sense

02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:51.560
or if the fact that you know
there's an astronomy person

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:53.960
in front of you talking about
it, you might not be aware

02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:56.760
that it is actually an
image of a universal scale

02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:59.580
versus something small.

02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.600
But images of the universe,

02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.330
they start out looking
a little bit more

02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:05.820
like this or maybe like that.

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.220
But really, it's this.

02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:10.970
So these images start
out in this digital way.

02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:12.700
We create them.

02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:16.260
You know, these are not
giant cosmic selfies.

02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:21.150
We have to create them from
the stream of ones and zeroes.

02:15:21.150 --> 02:15:24.610
And the way we do that
is we have the object

02:15:24.610 --> 02:15:26.660
in the sky quite far
away, Cassiopeia A

02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:28.700
in this example,
10,000 light years.

02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:31.250
That light has been
travelling for a while.

02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:34.110
It's recorded by this spacecraft

02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:35.630
and this is the Chandra
X-ray Observatory.

02:15:35.630 --> 02:15:38.500
And then that information is
bundled up in the form of ones

02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:45.980
and zeroes and sent down to my
laptop wherever that might be.

02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:50.770
We then get to turn it into a
table which is very exciting.

02:15:50.770 --> 02:15:55.840
This table essentially records
the distance of the location X

02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:00.460
and Y, the amount of energy,
how long it was observed,

02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:03.120
very fascinating
to look at, I know.

02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:04.440
But then we use more software

02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.160
and then we finally get a visual
representation of the object.

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:12.890
So we have quite a few steps
before it gets to here.

02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:15.210
And this is pretty
far along already.

02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:18.490
I've scaled it, removed
artifacts,

02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:21.480
perhaps composited a couple
of observations together

02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:22.780
to get a deeper data set.

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:25.560
And then the final
step is color.

02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:31.310
Typically, we use again the
science to tell the story.

02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:32.790
We have a perspective.

02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:35.040
We are trying to get
something across.

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.100
And in this case, the
way we cut up the colors

02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:41.840
and the energy cuts, we can
see the blue was assigned

02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:43.690
to the highest energy x-rays.

02:16:43.690 --> 02:16:46.150
The green, to the medium x-rays.

02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:48.450
And the red to the
lowest energy x-rays

02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:51.420
to create what we call
a chromatic ordering.

02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:55.640
Now, it's like a weather map on
weather.com or the nightly news.

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:59.620
The point is to help fit
more information to add

02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:01.500
to the information
quotient of this image.

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:07.160
It's important to see where that
high energy x-ray material is,

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.460
for example.

02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:10.110
As you can probably
tell, it's along the rim

02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:13.520
and that's essentially the
expanding shockwave going

02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:14.940
out into space.

02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:17.440
So we've colored
it this way here

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.600
but we could color
it a different way

02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:20.900
for a different purpose.

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:23.710
For example, we put out a
release not that long ago

02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:27.750
that had this image color-coded
by chemical element so similar

02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:29.310
to the one I talked
about earlier.

02:17:29.310 --> 02:17:32.000
And the whole point of
that image was to show

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.740
that essentially, the
elements that we have inside

02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:38.680
of us come from,
they originate the --

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.560
original originals from stars
like this when they explode.

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.940
So we have this data.

02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:45.930
We don't have to look
at it just in 2D.

02:17:45.930 --> 02:17:48.350
We can look at it
in two D over time.

02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:50.230
This is looking at
versions of the data

02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:53.620
from 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2007.

02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:56.630
And we can see that this
observation is changing

02:17:56.630 --> 02:17:59.020
and that this image
is expanding.

02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:02.040
And what we learned from
this is that outer shockwave

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.990
that I mentioned a
minute ago is traveling

02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:06.760
at around 11 million
miles per hour.

02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:10.010
So adding time to our
data, again adds more

02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:12.370
to that information quotient.

02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:15.200
But we wanted to do more so
we worked with a scientist,

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:19.930
Tracey DeLaney to figure out how
to create a 3D map of this data.

02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:24.690
We included optical and infrared
data to get a stronger picture

02:18:24.690 --> 02:18:27.730
and mapped it by using
the Doppler Effect

02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:31.800
by a simple assumption of the
geometry that it was radiating

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.730
out from a specific point.

02:18:33.730 --> 02:18:37.830
And also by borrowing
brain imaging software

02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:39.960
from a local Boston hospital

02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.600
because we didn't have our
own free software at the time.

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:45.420
So again, big and
small, who knows?

02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:48.460
But this image is the
first time we're ever able

02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:52.400
to see a data-driven map of
our friend, Cassiopeia A,

02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:54.480
this exploded star
10,000 light years away,

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.170
10,000 times 10 trillion
kilometers.

02:18:56.170 --> 02:18:58.730
And we're seeing it
in three dimensions.

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:02.110
Now, it does not look very
recognizable in that form

02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:05.000
so we took a wire frame of
that data and we brought it

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.010
into a 3D software package
so that we could apply colors

02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:10.080
and textures that
looked a little bit more

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.860
like this thing might look.

02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:14.240
That made it look a little
bit more astronomical

02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:18.060
to help give it that
visual contextualization.

02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:21.300
And so, it's data-driven in this
sense but it's a step removed

02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:23.450
from the last version
which is a step removed

02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:26.650
from the version before
that, et cetera, et cetera.

02:19:26.650 --> 02:19:30.100
So this is the first time we're
ever able to see through, below,

02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:32.050
above, behind a star

02:19:32.050 --> 02:19:34.240
that exploded 10,000
light years away,

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.630
10,000 times 10 trillion
kilometers.

02:19:36.630 --> 02:19:40.410
But it was created by data.

02:19:40.410 --> 02:19:42.200
We weren't quite done.

02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.990
We thought, "Wouldn't it
be fun to hold this thing?"

02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:46.290
Yes, we did.

02:19:46.290 --> 02:19:48.850
So we worked with our friends
from the Smithsonian and then

02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:51.890
over here but we figured
out how to 3D model

02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:56.970
or a 3D print this 3D model
and we finally just last week,

02:19:56.970 --> 02:20:00.200
figured out how to add
color to our 3D model.

02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.340
So now, we can hold a
dead star in our hands.

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:06.010
And we can understand
in this case,

02:20:06.010 --> 02:20:09.300
the various chemical elements so
where the sulfur is coming from.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.840
I think that was the
red in this version,

02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:13.620
where the silicon is coming
from, where is the iron.

02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:17.370
And the only thing I noticed
just for posterity is that I had

02:20:17.370 --> 02:20:19.460
to leave the jets at home
because they're so fragile

02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:21.060
and I was on an early
flight this morning.

02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:23.140
I just didn't want to deal so
just pretend there are a couple

02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:26.140
of jets sticking out of that.

02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:28.450
But yeah, so this is the first
time we could hold the dead star

02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:29.750
in our hands.

02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:32.230
Again, hugely scaled down.

02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:36.660
This is about 40 million
billion times the area

02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:39.430
of our sun and eight planets.

02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:40.730
You could toss in Pluto.

02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:45.140
It wouldn't make a difference
but it's really big, right.

02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.880
And it's dynamic, as
I mentioned before.

02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:49.560
It's changing over time.

02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:53.000
So you're seeing it, you
know, small in plastic.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.480
So take that for what it will.

02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:56.540
It's another representation.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:58.960
But we weren't done yet.

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:00.260
Let's see.

02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.560
I think this is the only video

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:03.190
that does not play
on automatically.

02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:04.490
Here we go.

02:21:04.490 --> 02:21:08.250
I thought wouldn't it fun if we
can walk inside this dead star?

02:21:08.250 --> 02:21:10.270
So we took it to
Brown University

02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:13.120
and some fantastic
collaborators there.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:15.340
We were able to create a
virtual reality version

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:17.260
of that same data.

02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.640
And now, you can see this
is one of my students.

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:21.750
She is walking inside
a dead star.

02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:23.400
The camera person
is outside the star

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:24.700
which is why it looks
like she's not it.

02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.000
But she's in it.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.840
Trust me. So she's walking
around inside a dead star,

02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:33.110
Cassiopeia A, 10,000 light
years away, and she's inside it.

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:34.410
And this is data.

02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:36.390
This is data representations.

02:21:36.390 --> 02:21:40.040
So we've created many
different versions

02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:44.620
of this one famous super nova
remnant and I think as --

02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:48.190
I think Roger mentioned this
point, very collaborative.

02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:49.560
This is not me doing this.

02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:50.920
This is not one person
doing this.

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.970
This is just teams upon
teams of people working

02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:56.330
to create different
versions of their data

02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:59.920
for very specific reasons.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.340
But they all started here.

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.340
All of these data versions came

02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:06.330
out of this original
bit of code.

02:22:06.330 --> 02:22:08.600
So really quick.

02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:11.990
I thought [inaudible] to
do a little case study,

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:15.050
I guess, of images over time.

02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:18.790
And it was this whole
idea of the image as truth

02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:20.850
that I thought would
be really interesting.

02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:23.200
I think there is this idea

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:28.970
that modern photography
has removed the objectivity

02:22:28.970 --> 02:22:32.920
of these things or
subjectivity, I should say.

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:35.490
And that they are
more truthful now.

02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:39.600
Well, perhaps but when we look
at this image from Galileo

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.630
of the moon, we already
heard there was an issue

02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:42.930
with it, right?

02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:46.040
So this is not "accurate
representation."

02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:49.050
He was creating this
version for his own purposes

02:22:49.050 --> 02:22:51.170
and it's really lovely.

02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:55.050
We can look at this version
which is a daguerreotype

02:22:55.050 --> 02:22:57.210
and that's essentially
a process that was kind

02:22:57.210 --> 02:22:59.430
of like a precursor
to modern photography

02:22:59.430 --> 02:23:02.000
that uses a combination of
chemical agents essentially

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.190
to create something that
looks very photographic.

02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:06.180
This is the oldest
surviving daguerreotype

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.480
of the moon, by the way.

02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.860
I think it was from
John Whipple.

02:23:10.860 --> 02:23:15.630
And then, we can see the moon
from the Apollo missions.

02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:22.290
And this was as Apollo 11
was on their way back home.

02:23:22.290 --> 02:23:26.230
And I think this was maybe
10,000 nautical miles away.

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:29.380
And it was one of
them snapped a photo

02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:31.490
and we have this
version of the moon.

02:23:31.490 --> 02:23:35.970
Is that more real than
this one or this one?

02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:38.820
Perhaps. Is it more truthful?

02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:41.830
Perhaps. Then we
have this version.

02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:45.450
This is using a special
nine-millimeter telescope,

02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:47.080
super top of the line,

02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:50.320
the
astrophotographer/astrophysicist

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:53.620
who's a friend of mine who's
working on this, Travis Rector,

02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:55.670
got this great deep data set.

02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:57.600
It's just incredible,
high resolution

02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:59.540
that we're able to
see the moon in.

02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:02.270
But he wanted to put
it in the perspective

02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:04.280
of its cosmic background.

02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:06.370
So he grabbed a shot from
a different telescope

02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:09.720
of the exact placement of the
moon from the stars behind it.

02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.090
So this was a composite of
the two images together.

02:24:13.090 --> 02:24:16.260
You can't physically take
these two images as one just

02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:18.710
because of the brightness
and the resolution issues.

02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:20.520
So is this one more truthful?

02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:22.020
Is this one more real?

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.480
And because you know, I'm paid
by NASA's Chandra Observatory,

02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.790
this is a version from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory.

02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:32.360
The x-rays are shown
in blue and mapped

02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:35.230
over an optical image
of the same phase.

02:24:35.230 --> 02:24:38.610
And here, it was really
useful for us to understand

02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:40.670
where x-rays from the
moon were coming from

02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:44.430
and they are essentially a
reflection of the solar x-rays.

02:24:44.430 --> 02:24:47.240
But we understood that
fluorescence has happened here

02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:49.490
and it helps resolve a
mystery that had been

02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:51.260
around for decades
so it was cool.

02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:53.560
Is this one more truthful?

02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:01.070
So my last little
mini-story that I want to tell

02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:03.960
because I'm sure the [inaudible]
is getting a little antsy is

02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.620
just that it's one thing to
talk about how people like me

02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:11.230
or teams of me create
images like this.

02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:14.330
But when we talk about who
we're creating them from,

02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:15.730
that's a whole other
thing together.

02:25:15.730 --> 02:25:18.610
You can have as much data
in an archive as you want.

02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:21.270
But that has potential value.

02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:24.610
Data that's been visualized
for a specific point

02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:29.520
but for a specific audience has
even more added value to it.

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:33.550
So we started a research project
called Aesthetics and Astronomy.

02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:36.620
It's me and a couple
of other folks imaging,

02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:39.150
psychologist, aesthetics types.

02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:43.050
And we were able to
understand how experts

02:25:43.050 --> 02:25:45.390
and non-experts approach images

02:25:45.390 --> 02:25:48.020
of our universe quite
differently.

02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:50.760
In this case, we're looking at
the Bullet Cluster of galaxies.

02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:56.580
It's this really tremendous
image about where the separation

02:25:56.580 --> 02:25:58.890
of normal matter and
dark matter occurs.

02:25:58.890 --> 02:26:00.720
And it's actually a
visual representation

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:02.040
of that process happening

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.570
which we have never
been able to see before.

02:26:04.570 --> 02:26:07.780
The normal matter is in
pink and this dark matter

02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:09.780
of which there's an awful
lot of it in the universe

02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:12.820
that we know very little
about, is shown in blue.

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:14.940
And when an astronomer
looks at this image,

02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:17.700
they immediately want to know
what telescopes are involved.

02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:19.000
So what's the science?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.550
What's the interesting,
you know,

02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:22.810
observational thing
going on here?

02:26:22.810 --> 02:26:25.450
When a non-expert looks at
the same image, it's wow,

02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:27.240
that's beautiful first.

02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:29.230
Then eventually, they
want to know things

02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:30.990
like well, what is it?

02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:34.150
What does the scientist
see when he or she looks

02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:35.690
at something like this?

02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:39.230
The expert, after formulating
those first questions,

02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:41.340
slowly drifts into,
"Wow, that's beautiful."

02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:43.630
Or maybe, you might get a
"That's cool," if they're,

02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:46.450
you know, a little
more on the down low.

02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:50.880
But so, that idea of wonder
is immediate for a non-expert

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.290
and secondary for an expert.

02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:56.380
Color, incredibly important.

02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:58.680
As I mentioned, we're looking
at something we can't see

02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:01.500
with our sad, puny
human eyes, right.

02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:04.770
So does it matter
what colors I choose?

02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:06.330
If it doesn't really
have anything to do

02:27:06.330 --> 02:27:08.910
with the science story, in
this case, we're looking

02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:11.190
at a galaxy, NGC 4696.

02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:14.150
I think it's about 50
million light years away.

02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:16.340
Relatively close in the
grand scheme of things.

02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:18.790
There is this super
massive black hole inside

02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:22.870
that white core that is spewing
out these high energy particles

02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:25.410
and then causing all of this
material that you're looking

02:27:25.410 --> 02:27:27.370
at to be super-heated.

02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:29.810
This was the way the
image looked at first.

02:27:29.810 --> 02:27:33.000
The main difference
between those two,

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.300
the x-ray is colored
blue in this version

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.390
and colored red in this version.

02:27:38.390 --> 02:27:41.150
Now this image was meant to
be for a non-expert audience.

02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:45.130
We were trying to talk about
the heat in this galaxy.

02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:48.120
So which version should we
have released to the public?

02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:49.730
Who likes the red version?

02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:51.250
Raise your hands.

02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:52.550
Yeah, who likes the blue?

02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:53.850
All right.

02:27:53.850 --> 02:27:56.900
You're a physicist,
aren't you [laughter]?

02:27:56.900 --> 02:28:02.390
So physicists like this version
because in physics, blue is hot.

02:28:02.390 --> 02:28:05.990
But the rest of us
non-physicists,

02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:07.570
who says to their
kid, "Don't touch

02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:09.870
that stove, it's blue hot?"

02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.260
Maybe you do.

02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:15.730
But I don't so the whole point
is color has a very specific

02:28:15.730 --> 02:28:18.320
cultural context, a very
specific power to it.

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:21.860
And if you're trying to get a
point across, red versus blue?

02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:23.450
It doesn't matter for the data.

02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:25.250
The data does not care.

02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:28.480
But it does matter for
who's looking at it.

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.050
Scale, I know [Inaudible]
talked about this briefly.

02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:34.510
What I'm just bringing up
very quickly is that again,

02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:38.060
scale is hard in astronomy
to do in a really well way.

02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:40.940
But people at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York,

02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:43.760
they typically spend about 17
seconds on standing in front

02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:46.970
of a masterpiece, define
masterpiece how you will.

02:28:46.970 --> 02:28:50.050
People looking at astronomical
images on a screen just

02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:52.720
about the same amount of
time, that 17-second mark.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.420
However, you add a scale bar and
it could have very minimal text,

02:28:56.420 --> 02:29:00.460
just something like this,
doubles that, that viewing time

02:29:00.460 --> 02:29:03.310
because it gives them
something to think about.

02:29:03.310 --> 02:29:06.370
Now, why am I showing
this picture?

02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:11.010
So this is one of my favorite
stories by an artist that --

02:29:11.010 --> 02:29:13.430
I just love his taste.

02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:16.240
This is Madame Henri-Francois
Riesener --

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:18.860
I don't speak French so
excuse my pronunciation --

02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:22.660
by the artist Eugene
Delacroix, 1835.

02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:26.430
Now, I'm not an artist or an
art expert or a historian.

02:29:26.430 --> 02:29:29.780
If I were in a gallery at the
Smithsonian and there were tons

02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:31.970
of pictures to look at,
I wouldn't know to look

02:29:31.970 --> 02:29:33.830
at this one specifically.

02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:38.490
But this woman was
the artist's aunt.

02:29:38.490 --> 02:29:41.590
And really you can see kind
of like this frank tenderness,

02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:43.000
I think, in the portrait.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.960
But I just want to read
this one little bit.

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:46.490
She was known for her beauty.

02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:48.600
Some 30 years before the
date of this portrait,

02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:51.530
she served as a lady-in-waiting
to Empress Josephine

02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:52.900
and having caught
Napoleon's eye,

02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:54.690
engaged in a brief
liaison with him.

02:29:54.690 --> 02:29:58.330
After she died, Delacroix wrote
to his friend, George Sand,

02:29:58.330 --> 02:30:01.620
"Each of the beings necessary
to our existence who disappears,

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:04.160
takes away with him a
whole world of feelings

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:08.190
that no other relationship
can revive."

02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:09.490
My husband's here.

02:30:09.490 --> 02:30:10.790
I hope he would write
something like that about me

02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:14.640
after I'm gone because that's a
pretty powerful letter, right?

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:18.040
But that immediately makes this
piece so much more interesting.

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:20.690
Now that I know the
story, I would stop.

02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:23.370
It's the similar situation
in astronomy, right?

02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:26.190
We see that this is
beautiful and now,

02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:29.610
I can kind of see something in
there that I didn't see before.

02:30:29.610 --> 02:30:32.810
But if we're just looking
at a picture such as Saturn

02:30:32.810 --> 02:30:34.650
in ultraviolet light, it's great

02:30:34.650 --> 02:30:36.730
to have scientific
purpose, absolutely.

02:30:36.730 --> 02:30:38.030
But if we're trying

02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:39.950
to communicate something
interesting about it,

02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:42.700
the one thing that typically
gets people is that --

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.400
oh, if you can see
on the screen.

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:47.210
Let me see if I can -- oh, yeah.

02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:48.510
There it is.

02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:49.810
See that little dot?

02:30:49.810 --> 02:30:52.480
That's Earth waving back

02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:54.960
at the Cassini mission
that took this image.

02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:59.530
So we are in the context of
this image taken very far away

02:30:59.530 --> 02:31:01.960
from us and in a
different kind of light.

02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:04.860
But that idea that we
can add to the story,

02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:06.470
I think is really helpful.

02:31:06.470 --> 02:31:11.540
And we found that when we
add really important, useful,

02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:15.450
relevant, interesting
descriptions or images,

02:31:15.450 --> 02:31:17.530
we increase the viewing
time dramatically,

02:31:17.530 --> 02:31:20.460
not just the amount of time
it takes them to read the text

02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:23.150
but also in just how much
people will ponder it.

02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:27.630
But beyond just the viewing
time, the aesthetic appreciation

02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:31.250
for this image improved
dramatically

02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:34.040
when we had the contextual
information presented with it

02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:36.860
than when it was
presented just on its own.

02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:38.470
So there is a time for spectacle

02:31:38.470 --> 02:31:40.660
and then there is
a time for context.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:42.370
So, I'm pretty much done.

02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:44.960
I'll just say, "I read books
about this stuff because I'm

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:46.260
so fascinated about it.

02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.210
I'm really happy to
be here today to learn

02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:51.090
from everybody else and see
what everybody else is doing.

02:31:51.090 --> 02:31:52.700
But essentially, you
know, these images

02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:56.590
of our universe are not
just cosmic selfies.

02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:57.890
We create them.

02:31:57.890 --> 02:31:59.190
We have a viewpoint.

02:31:59.190 --> 02:32:00.490
We are people.

02:32:00.490 --> 02:32:01.790
We have our biases.

02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:05.310
We should be more transparent
with how we do them and why.

02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:09.520
We try very hard to be for the
telescopes that I worked for,

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:13.620
using descriptions and having
features on how we made things

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:16.640
and breaking down the
image into various pieces.

02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:19.020
But I just want to
end with this quote.

02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:22.270
"By means of telescopes, there
is nothing so far distant

02:32:22.270 --> 02:32:24.900
but maybe represented to
our view and by the help

02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.020
of microscopes, there
is nothing so small

02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:28.630
as to escape our inquiry.

02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:30.860
Hence there is a new
visible world discovered

02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:32.160
to the understanding."

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:34.290
That is Robert Hooke
from <i>Micrografia </i>.

02:32:34.290 --> 02:32:35.590
I leave some websites.

02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:36.890
If you want to see how
you did on the quiz,

02:32:36.890 --> 02:32:39.280
you can go to
chandra.is.edu/micro.

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.590
If you want to learn more about
the research, go to the last one

02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:43.130
in the list and then the
other ones are just probably

02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:44.430
more obvious.

02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:46.230
Thank you.
