- [Voiceover] This episode
of CC: Social Scene

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:06.439 align:start size:97% position:3%
is based on your suggestions
for weird family members.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.409
- Summertime means
family reunions.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.445
They were fun when you were
a kid but now you're older

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.181
and they just don't
have the same magic.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.250
- Can I just not go?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, it'll break
your mother's heart.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.788
But don't worry because I'm here

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.823
to give you tips
on how to survive

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.059
your summer family reunion.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.560
Step one, breathe.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.963
Take it all in.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.297
This is your family.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start size:88% position:13%
You share the same
genes with these people.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.136
Some are older, collecting dust.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.406 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
And some are young, collecting
nine volt batteries.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.275 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Like it or not, you're
connected to them.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.644
Step two, hug your mother.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.479
Do this immediately.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.481
The sooner you hug your
mother and let her tell

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.083
an embarrassing
story about you--

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.285 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He used to pee
his pants every day.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.486
(laughs)

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.754
- The sooner you can leave.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.689
Step three, free food.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.025 align:start size:84% position:16%
Make your way to
that food but beware.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.594
There are obstacles
you have to avoid.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.396
Like your cousin Kibbers.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.397
- Hey Doug!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.466
I was hoping I'd see you here.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
Have I told you
about Gift Buddies?

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.804
- I don't know.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You don't know
what Gift Buddies is

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.207 line:0%
but you know one thing,
it's a pyramid scheme.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.176 line:0%
- It's not a pyramid
scheme, it's just gifts

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.244 line:0%
for your buddies.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.546
I'll email you about it.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.747
- Sounds legit.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Voiceover] Woah,
woah, woah, woah, woah.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.350
Who's that?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.652
- Hey, Doug.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.287
- Hi.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.988
Do we know each other?

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Doug, you remember
your cousin June?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.093
- Oh yeah.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.828
- [Voiceover] Get out of there.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.062
It's food time.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.332
- Dude, V.R. goggles.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.733 line:0%
- It's Uncle Rick.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.302 line:0%
He's a self-proclaimed tech head

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.205 line:0%
and undying conspiracy theorist.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.373 line:0%
- It's a fake world,
like the moon landing.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.908
- [Doug] Okay.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:49.742
- T-T-Y-L.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.011
Oh, chem trails.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.181
- It's just a cloud.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.016
(regal music)

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.685
- You made it.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.687 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now enjoy that burger
with some chips and beer.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.988
You earned this.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.959
And now it's time
for the final step.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.227
Leave.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.795
- Really?

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.630
- Yeah, you did the
whole thing, right?

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.065
You hugged your mother.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.600 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now it's time to go before
she tells that story

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.268
about how you ate a urinal cake.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.436
- It was one time.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, find the
quickest route and go.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.975
(dramatic music)

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.022
- Get me out of here.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And that's how you survive
a summer family barbecue.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.369
Good luck out there.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.604
And don't drop your grandmas.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Hey, I fixed the
satellite dish.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.009
(screams)

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.744
I'm okay.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.182
- So, want to get out of here?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.750
After you, my lady.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.454
