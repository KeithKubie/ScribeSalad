00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.005
- I was a little
cheesy back in the day.

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.707
Like, if you're over 30,
I don't know,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.409
you remember
that one asshole in the club

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.077
with just a vest on?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.313
[laughter]

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.849
I mean, like, like,

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.185
who goes out with just a vest?

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.254
Like, what are you, Han Solo?

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.758
- Welcome to
"This Is Not Happening."

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.894
I'm your host, Roy Wood Jr.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.430
We all have that special woman
in our life,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.331
the one we like to put up
on a pedestal.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.000
- Finger sandwiches, boys?

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.368 align:start position:0%
- Aw, thank you, Mom.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.403
- Go on, little Roy,
make it rain.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:40.273
- Aww, skeet, skeet.
- There you go.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:47.547
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.355 size:84% position:42%
Now, make sure you separate
the ones from the fives.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.357
- I know, Ma, I know.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.693 align:start position:0%
- Such a gentleman.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.261
- Now I got to pick up
the money.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.629
Separate the bills.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.431
She the one that told me
to make it rain.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.367
<i> - That's my boy.</i>

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.769
- You all know him as the host

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.871
of the "You're on the List"
podcast.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.474
You know him from his comedy
album "American Comic."

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.242
Bret Ernst, everybody.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.512
[cheers and applause]

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.383
- I'm actually dedicating
this story to my mom.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.486
It's a story about her

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.454
catching me jerking off.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:30.456
[laughter]

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.758
Listen, I'm a comic,
all right?

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.328
I don't write songs or poems.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.297
I'm dedicating a jerk-off story
to my mom, all right?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.834
That's--that's the extent.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.569
Well, I was raised
by a single mom,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.571
and she had three boys,

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.673
and you know--
and it's hard for moms

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:51.144
to try--you know, to try
and talk to their sons about

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.913
the animalistic shit we do,
you know what I mean?

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.948
Like, my little brother
and me were animals.

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.252
My older brother was a little
bit nicer and knew how to act.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.255
He was--well, he was gay.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.589
So it makes sense.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:04.991
Gay guys know how to act.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.592
Literally,
they're amazing actors,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:10.429
but I meant
they know how to behave.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:11.864
But we never had the talk.

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.432
I mean, I learned how to be
with women

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.969
from, like,
R&amp;B videos and porn.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.006
And my little brother learned
from me.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.809
So when you're raising sons,
you know, they catch you doing

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.711
messed up shit, you know?

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:29.282
I remember one time I hid
my rubbers--remember, you ever

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.650
hide your rubbers?

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.485
You know, 'cause I don't
want her to know.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.620
But then one time, I opened
my drawer, and they were there,

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.456
perfectly folded in the drawer.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.526
So she let me know she knew,
but then never said anything.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.728
When moms catch you rubbing one
out, they don't say--

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.731
like, I've been caught
a few times

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.034
by my mom and by my wife.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.202
All right.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.404
[laughter]

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.172
But I'm saying, like,
when your mom catches you,

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.674
they don't say--like,
if your wife catches you,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.409
you know,
now there's a problem.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.045
Now we have to have a sit-down,
you know what I mean?

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.247
Is there a problem
in the relationship?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.815
You know, moms are cool.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:03.883
I remember, one time,
I was rubbing one out,

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.318
and my mom walked in.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.485
She's like, "Hey, Bret. Okay."

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.021
Turned around and left.

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:11.424
Nothing was ever said,
you know what I mean?

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.492
[laughter]

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:14.827
So I'm home from college.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.495
Like, I was one
of those losers

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:19.398
that went away
to community college.

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:21.033
You know what I mean?

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.902
Like, I went to a community
college in another town,

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:27.206
acting like I was doing shit
with my life.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.009
So I come home from
community college, and...

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.777
[laughs]

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.512
And it's a Wednesday night.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.514
We're going out on a Wednesday
night 'cause, you know,

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:38.184
that's what you do when
you're in community college.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.852
And my friends
are picking me up.

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.020
They're like,
yo, we're gonna go out.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.555
We're gonna go down to Miami,

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.023
you know,
so get ready to go out.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.625
So you know, and you know,
and, by the way,

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.060
I'm a reformed guido, okay?

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:50.596
There was an intervention,
like '99.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.298
They took my cologne
bottles away.

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.900
[laughter]

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:56.869
But, you know, I was a little
cheesy back in the day.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:58.371
Like, if you're over 30,
I don't know,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.206
you remember
that one asshole in the club

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.641
with just a vest on?

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.710
[laughter]

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.413
I mean, like, like,

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.548
who goes out with just a vest?

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.651
Like, what are you, Han Solo?

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.819
Who the fuck?

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.154
And I would wear
Timberland boots,

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.491
like that would offset
the vest?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.892
Like, yeah, I do construction

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.761
after I fly
the "Millennium Falcon."

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.298
[laughter]

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.066
So my boys are getting ready
to pick me up,

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.336
so you know, I'm doing
my pre-going-out rituals,

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:31.971
shaving the chest.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.410
Cologne daub.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.511
Did my curls.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.413
Got the vest on.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.782
You know what I mean?
I'm ready--I'm ready to go out.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.517
So now we go pre-drinking.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.352
There was this club down--
it was, like, a little ways

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.788
down from me.
It was called Crickets, right?

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.489
It was a real shithole.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.259
Like, people got stabbed there,
whatever, but, you know,

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.127
we would pre-drink there,
and then we would

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.830
head down to Miami to go out.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:00.966
So we get to the bar.
Vests everywhere.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.269
You know what I mean?
It's jumping.

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.038
[laughter]

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.773
And as soon I get in there,

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.608
I make eye contact
with this girl, right?

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.146
Beautiful girl, cute,
strong six, know what I mean?

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.215
So I see her, I zero in on her,
you know?

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:18.284
I'm like--just walk
right up to her.

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.119
I'm like, "Hey, how you doing?"
You know, "What's your name?"

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.821
She's like, "Francesca."
"Okay, Francesca.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.356
How's it going?"
So I'm talking to her.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.325
We're doing shots, you know,
getting hammered,

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:27.960
and then my friends come up
to me, and they're like,

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:29.528
"Yo, we're gonna go
down to Miami.

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.731
Let's bounce," you know?
And I'm like, "All right."

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.532
And I go to the girl.
"Can I get your number?"

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.835
And she's like,
"Well, why don't you stay?"

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.503
I'm like,
"Well, they're my ride.

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:38.904
I got no way of getting back."
And then she's like,

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:41.474
"I'll take you home."

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.809
[laughter]

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:45.644
I'm like, "All right."
[laughs]

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:48.147
You know? I told my boys to
bounce, you know what I mean?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.816
By the way, we didn't have Uber
back then either, all right?

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.852
A strong six was your Uber.

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:58.057
So now we're drinking.
We're getting hammered, right?

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.992
And she's like, you know,
"Let me take you home."

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:02.495
So we drive back to the house,
and, again, I'm drunk.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.230
You know, slamming around.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:07.066
And we lived
in a little apartment.

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.702
So I'm making noise,
and then the lights go on,

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.270
and I woke my mom up, right?

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:13.205
And my mom had like--
she had that mom robe.

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:15.007
You ever seen
the mom robe?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.176
She's like, she's like,
"What are you doing?"

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.711
You know, I'm like, "Fuck."

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.546
I'm like,
"Yo, go to bed, Carol."

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:21.580
You know what I mean?

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.549
[laughter]

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:24.784
I'm like,
"What are you doing up?"

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.352
You know?

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.254
But she's like, you know,
"Who's your friend?"

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.723
I'm like, "Francesca,
this is my mom.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.725
Ma, this is Francesca,"
you know.

00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:34.727
She's like, "Can I make
you guys something to eat?"

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.896
And I'm like, "No."

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.697
So my mom goes back to sleep.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.367
Now Francesca was half Italian
and half Spanish, all right?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.870
So she understood the family
thing, you know what I mean?

00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:46.272
'Cause the fact that
she met my mom--

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.207
now the whole dynamic changed,
you know?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.543
'Cause I'm making out with her,
and we're fooling around,

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.044
but it's just not the same.

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:53.479
She's like, you know,
"I can't do this."

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.381
You know, your mom's
in the other room.

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:56.882
I'm like, "Carol don't care.
Don't worry about it."

00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:58.384
You know what I mean?

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.052
We're still going,
and she's like, "I can't.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.420
I feel disrespectful."

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:03.422
I'm like--you know.

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:06.325
So she gave me her number.
She said, "Hit me up later."

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:09.161
And she left.
So now I'm alone

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:12.832
with a worked up...
[mumbles]

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.834
All right, so this is
where it goes south.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.270
[laughter]

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:21.574
Now this is back
in the VCR days,

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.309
by the way, okay?

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:26.245
They had DVD players, but I was
still working with VCR.

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:27.780
[laughter]

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:32.418
Well, I amassed, like,
this huge VHS collection, okay?

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.487
And, you know, back then,
you had a porn tape

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.655
like, that, you know,
it was on a VHS tape,

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.324
but I had so many tapes

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:40.125
that I would hide my tape
in plain sight,

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:42.027
so, like, my mom would never
find it, you know?

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.030
Like, my porn tape said
"NFL's Greatest Hits" on it.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:46.932
You know what I mean?

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.501
I found my older brother's
one time.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.269
I'm like, "I haven't seen
'Grease' in a while."

00:07:50.302 --> 00:07:52.805
[laughter]

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.640
Ahh!
You know?

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:57.042
[laughter]

00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:58.277
Anyway, so...

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.179
And that's the other thing.

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.181
You didn't have Internet porn
back then, all right?

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:06.619
You had a VHS tape that you
passed around to your friends.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.655
And when you put it in, you saw
exactly where he finished,

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.591
which made it really awkward.

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:16.161
Right?
And you had to rewind it,

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:18.364
and find your own little scene.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:21.634
[laughter]

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.470
All right, so I got
"NFL's Greatest Hits"

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.305
in the VCR, right?

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:29.341
And now I decide I got to get
one off, you know what I mean?

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:31.010
And the whiskey's
really kicking in.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.912
I'm hammered.
Room's spinning.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.581
So I get butt naked, okay?

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.082
And I'm laying in bed.

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:38.884
Now, I don't know if you
ever do this or not

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:41.186
when you're rubbing one out
in bed, but do you ever make,

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.856
like, that toilet paper runway?

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:46.325
You know what I mean?

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.860
It's relevant to--
[laughs]

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:50.262
It's relevant to the story.

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:53.232
You know what I mean?
Like...

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:55.334
You ever make that
toilet paper runway?

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:56.835
It's like nice quick,
easy cleanup.

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:58.370
You just throw it
under the bed,

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.072
wake up the next morning,
get rid of the evidence,

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.374
nobody knows nothing, right?

00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:06.345
So I'm laying there butt naked,
covered in Charmin two-ply

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:08.548
'cause I knew it was gonna be
a strong one, right?

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:13.219
I got my little root
in my hand.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:17.623
I'll literally maybe five
strokes in, right?

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:20.025
I'm so drunk...

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:21.694
I pass out.

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.096
[laughter]

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:27.466
Now, when I wake up
the next morning, okay?

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:31.904
The TV's off,
and I'm tucked in my bed.

00:09:31.937 --> 00:09:33.038
I'm like...

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:36.575
[laughter]

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:40.379
[cheers and applause]

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.281
Now, you know
when you were like--

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:43.782
you know when you were out
drinking the night before--

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:45.150
you ever get really drunk

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:46.385
and then you wake up
the next morning

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:47.886
and there's, like, ten seconds

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.455
where you forgot
you were drinking?

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.290
And then you realize
you were drunk

00:09:51.323 --> 00:09:53.993
and start praying to God
for things that don't exist?

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:55.227
You're like, "Oh, God,
please let there be

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.595
"little magical jerk-off elves

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:58.698
that came in here
and cleaned me up?"

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.334
And I can imagine my poor mom.

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.236
Just imagine being a mom,
walking in,

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:08.741
seeing your son laying there
covered in toilet paper

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.777
like some perverted mummy

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.679
with just a vest on.

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.749
[laughter]

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.984
And she's never said a word
to this day,

00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:21.487
which is why I love my mom.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.688
All right, guys.
