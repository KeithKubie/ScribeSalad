00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.590
RACHEL: Today I'm very, very
excited to host our speaker,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.610
author Sarah Drew.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.930
And I have a little
intro for her

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.860
to talk about the
"Gaia Codex" talk,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.120
the talk about feminine
wisdom and the evolution

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.480
of technology.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.080
I actually know Sarah
as a personal friend

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.080
and I think she's one of
the most inspiring women who

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.650
embodies feminine values.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.487
I think if you just watch her on
stage you'll know what I mean.

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:32.070
But I'm really pleased
that she's here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.930
today to talk about her book.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.840
So a little bit
about that and we'll

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.920
go ahead and hand
it over to her.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.300
So basically the "Gaia Codex" is
what we're going to talk about

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
and this is both an
ancient found wisdom text

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.890
and a sumptuous epic novel.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.100
"Gaia Codex" reveals
the hidden histories

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.150
of a world long forgotten,
the secret wisdom

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.770
of an ancient lineage of women.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.410
Set in a near future
of impending societal

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.610
and environmental
collapse, the novel

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.360
is a tale of hope
and remembrance

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.300
as well as an inspired
vision of humanity's origins,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.660
and on the potential we hold
for conscious evolution.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.930
Very important topic.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.240
With growing numbers of
international readers,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.590
"Gaia Codex" is a
flourishing phenomena

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.690
that is capturing the passionate
spirit of the feminine rising

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.330
and our deepening reconnection
to our Mother Earth,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.580
and very timely with
Earth Day coming up.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.630
A life-long explorer of
cultural consciousness, Sarah

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.550
has traveled the world from
the high plateaus of Tibet,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.180
to the jungles of the Amazon,
to remote villages in Buton.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.480
She studied religious
studies at UC Berkeley

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.380
and has lectured internationally
and at the graduate level

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.840
on topics such as
technology and consciousness

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960
and the design of mind.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.720
Sarah's consulting and
innovation firm Metamuse

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.890
brings seasoned
expertise in the areas

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.290
of innovation media,
emergent technologies,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.720
and evolutionary culture.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600
Metamuse works with
clients and companies

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.700
to help shape regenerate
vital cultures that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.000
catalyze the optimum
potential of the human species

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.820
and honor the sanctity
of Mother Earth.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.729
Sarah lives in Mill
Valley, so she's local,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.832
and please welcome Sarah.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:14.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.430
SARAH DREW: Thank you, Rachel.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.600
It's wonderful to be here
with all of you today

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.820
and to be here at Google.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.730
And may our time here together
benefit all beings, benefit

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.820
life.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.040
I'm going to be doing a
little exploration about how

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.820
we, as a species, can create
vibrant, regenerative cultures

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.134
at this critical point
in our evolution.

00:02:38.134 --> 00:02:39.550
Now a little bit
later we're going

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.660
to go deep into the
"Gaia Codex" and are

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.830
going to be looking at
how we, as women and men,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.320
can reconnect with the
ancient wisdom that is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.570
the feminine wisdom traditions.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.570
But right now I want to
look at how we can create

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.320
conscious, wise technology.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.940
There's an ancient
body of wisdom

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.520
and our emergent
cultural knowing

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.300
that our Mother
Earth, Terra Gaia,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.900
is a living, breathing entity.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.540
We are part of her
and she is part of us.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.010
She is consciousness, the pure
vibration of consciousness.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.980
And she is matter.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.760
Evolving, learning,
experimenting, and breathing.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.070
An endless stream
of knowing, we are

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.680
but one of the many forms
of life co-emergent with her

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.980
over time.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.680
Pythons, and elephants,
Redwood trees, and lotuses,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.760
ancient tyrannosauruses,
saber toothed tigers,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.900
and ferns whose origin
spread back 350 million years

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.250
in their origins.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.600
We human beings,
we homo sapiens,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.840
have only been here
for a blip in time

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.980
in the history of Mother Gaia.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.575
200,000 years in a 2.5, in
a 4.5 billion year history.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.899
And if we dig deep into
our DNA's own knowing,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.730
we find that Gaia
is ever evolving

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.080
and that we are just
part of this living

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.490
consciousness, this
evolving spirit of life

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.025
running through us.

00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:37.780
And I'd like to pose
that technology is also

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.140
part of Gaia's blueprint.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.495
Now in its optimum
form, technology

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.960
is consciousness manifest
and deeply resonant

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.340
with life flourishing
here on Mother Earth.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.330
I'm going to say
this one more time.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.440
In its optimum form, technology
is consciousness manifest,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.370
consciousness manifest,
and deeply resonant

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.120
with life flourishing
on my Mother Earth.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.760
Now there's a lot
of debate right

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240
now about different
scenarios of how

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.680
we are evolving as a
species, especially

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.860
in regards to technology.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.960
And kind of the simplistic
polarity of that right

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:27.010
now can be, on one hand,
there's the AI singularity.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.110
Human beings and carbon
life would become obsolete.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.830
This is scenario that we've seen
played out in many Hollywood

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.570
movies at this point.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.790
One of the factors of
this is that technology

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.240
is seen as something
separate from us

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:53.280
and Mother Gaia, in this
sense, is seen not as a living,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.220
breathing entity
but as a resource

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.070
to be extracted to
develop technology.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.880
What I'd like to pose is that
technology is indeed actually

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.270
part of our self and that
we are sacred technology.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.230
And in particular,
our Mother Earth

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.210
is one of the most
extraordinary technologies

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.450
that we can learn from.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.410
Our Mother Gaia is a 4.5
billion years library of wisdom,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.070
of living technology,
is here for us

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.920
to cherish and to learn from.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.360
And we have a choice about
how we evolve as a species.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.600
We're all part of the
participants in this game,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.950
in this divine play.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.810
There is a wonderful word,
a Sanskrit word, lila,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.780
which means the divine
play that creates worlds.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.350
What lila presupposes
is that we are actually

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.190
[? creaking ?] our creations
with consciousness,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.990
or at least the aspiration
towards awakened consciousness

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.090
that understands the
laws of causalities.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.770
All our actions have an effect.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.440
And that we work within a
web of interconnected being,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.110
and that we're here to
the best of our ability

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.440
to benefit all beings
and to benefit all life.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.980
So from this view,
this middle way,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.740
that we are living, breathing
technology, sacred technology

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.680
and consciousness,
and that we're

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.980
a part and intrinsic to Mother
Gaia who is also a technology

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.280
and consciousness, there's
a couple of anchor points

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.680
to look at.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.450
One, that technology is
a tool for the evolution

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.030
of consciousness.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.830
It's a teaching tool
and in its optimum form

00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:00.150
can be used as a bridge
to activate qualities

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.159
that the human being
already has within oneself.

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:06.700
A lot of areas that
have been covered

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.570
in the esoteric
traditions, which we'll

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.410
go into too in a
minute, technology

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.220
at this point in
time in its evolution

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.820
is there as an
externalization of that.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.980
The other, that Mother Gaia is
a 4.5 billion year old library

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.520
and blueprint of a highly
functional and sustainable

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.890
technology.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.700
And we've only scratched the
surfaces of what is here.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.200
And it's our imperative to
nourish her and to sustain her,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.970
and to learn from her.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.530
Not to burn her, not
to pollute her rivers,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.640
not to cut down her forest or
blast out her mountaintops.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.880
It's equivalent to destroying
the library of Alexander, maybe

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.770
even worse because it's 4.5
billion years of information

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:56.060
and data which can inform how
we are living on the planet.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.274
And this goes into
a lot of the work

00:08:58.274 --> 00:09:00.190
and teachings, which
you're probably aware of,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.620
of Janine Benyus
with biomimicry.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.390
Looking to the Mother
Earth to find design

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.730
for evolving technology.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.190
And also Bucky Fuller who is
working with Planet Ship Earth.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.180
The third thing, we
must make the transition

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.450
from extractive
technologies to technologies

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.270
where the energy sources
are regenerative so

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.380
that we don't
continue to deplete

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.185
the resources of the planet,
and that we're looking forward

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:28.210
to not just to seven
generations ahead,

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.980
but we're looking
forward to how do

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.880
we keep the planet
livable for homo

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.085
sapiens for the next millennia.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.450
A doorway into standing
technology and regenerative

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.240
energy is maybe to dive
into the metaphysics

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.805
or esoteric practices.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.030
These have often been, in a
span of many human traditions,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.520
a bridge to understanding
this precious give

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.290
of life and our Mother Gaia.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:04.830
Across our epics, cultures
and epics of time,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.420
there's been these
practices that

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.970
allow us to go directly
in to the wisdom

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.240
of our sacred technology
of a human being.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.230
Now probably many of you
are familiar with yoga

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.590
and probably practice it.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.350
The first level of yoga,
when we go into a yoga class,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.680
we'll just be working with
the physical body, right?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.846
We're going to get in shape.

00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:26.570
We're going to do our asanas.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.200
Go one layer deeper, we
start to work with the energy

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.970
systems of the body, which
is, in Sanskrit, what

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.730
it is, there's a whole
network called nadis.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.660
The nadis are a
nodal network that

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.590
are there, which is
an energy system.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.680
You learn how to activate that.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.820
They're there and
they're in alignment

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.670
with the chakras,
which in that system

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:51.260
are understood to be portholes
to activating the body's

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.590
full energy and
consciousness potentials.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.260
Very key in that is the
balance between the male

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.940
and the female.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.130
It's called the
pingala and the ida.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.900
The sun and the moon.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.360
They understand
that a whole human

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.640
being is a balance between
the male and the female.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.490
Mindful medication
is-- I know many of you

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.150
here are practicing-- helps
clear the mind so that we

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.340
understand where
thoughts come in

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.430
and what we're receptive
to, what types of creation

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.770
we are actually bringing forth.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.880
When the mind is still
and the mind is clear

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.880
we can start to bring forth with
choice, conscious creations.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.230
Causality, there's
a couple of things,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.620
you can go also into Western
alchemy which is working,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.800
in the Western
alchemic tradition

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.780
again, is working at how to
use the technology of a human

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.090
being.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.120
The coding or the
symbolic form of that

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.160
was the transmutation
of material

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.050
which became part of the
history of chemistry.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.800
But its inner practices
were esoteric practices

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.000
about how we transmute
the human being so

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.460
that we have a direct connection
with consciousness itself.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.420
And there's an equation, it
was like an energetic equation,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.610
whether it was tantra,
whether it was yoga,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.520
whether it's alchemy, that
the human being is a microcosm

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.140
and we are a mere replica
of the macrocosms, which

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.320
is consciousness.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.890
And if we understand how
to align these energies

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.930
and go into that, we have the
full energy of a potential.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.480
We aren't just
bodies of material

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.370
but we are also consciousness.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.320
We're also light.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.240
We're also vibration.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.640
And this, from my
understanding, this fusion

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.400
of pure consciousness
with our material bodies

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.470
and our understanding of
working within a network of how

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.425
we can benefit all beings and
all life is really critical.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.140
Again, across these traditions,
inter connectivity, all of life

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.990
is connected.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.880
You'll find this through
many of these traditions.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.250
There's causality, or
effects have action.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.490
This could come across in
karma in the Western Buddhism

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.420
or the Golden Rule
in Christianity.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:32.590
And love, that pure vibration
of the heart where we really

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.300
hold care and compassion
for other beings.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.090
And that replicates
itself out in our actions.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.200
And finally, what
is so essential

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.320
for this point in time is the
reclaiming of our relationship

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.940
with the feminine
part of ourselves

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.080
and our reconnection
into Mother Gaia.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.650
So "Gaia Codex" is a novel
written as an ancient found

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.370
wisdom text.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.400
It's about an ancient
lineage of women

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.100
called the Priestesses
of Astera who

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.880
have been holding
rejuvinecation codes

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.570
for the planet for millennium.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.940
The story takes place a
flash moment right after now

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.990
when there's environmental
crisis, a culture

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:25.090
right at the brink of either
transformation or collapse.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.480
It's also a remembrance
into the deep roots

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.070
of our collective past.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.830
"Gaia Codex" is a
reclaiming and the recasting

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.780
of the lost history of
the sacred feminine, which

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:41.830
in many cultures is a lost
part of our shared human story.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.440
So I'm going to read now from
the prologue to the book.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.324
I'll give you a taste of
how we go into the world.

00:14:53.324 --> 00:14:55.210
Now to the easy part.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.880
SARAH DREW: "Through
the flow of ages

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.700
and the rise and
fall of cultures,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.350
a secret codex has been
inscribed with the tales

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.260
and stories, the
rites and rituals

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.140
of priestesses
who are emanations

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.940
of the eternal goddess.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.140
Caretakers and guardians of
our Mother Earth, Terra Gaia.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.140
In India and China, in ancient
Sumer, in ancient Greece

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.210
and Egypt, in the Serengeti,
and in the Amazon,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.680
and in the Celtic wilds, there
flows a timeless tradition

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.690
amongst those who've walked the
Earth who revere and remember

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.510
the circle of life.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.650
Passed from
grandmother to mother,

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.310
daughter to sister,
aunt to niece,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.730
held safe in the heart of
sisters who have incarnated

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.040
through the ages.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.360
This text is not written on
pages, paper, or papyrus.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.935
Instead it is inscribed
in holograms of light,

00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:53.580
in the leaves of
trees, the hum of bees

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.360
and the codes of spiral DNA.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.210
Hidden from many,
the Codex is known

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.700
to those with the eyes
to see, the ears to hear,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.940
and the heart to feel that
which lies just beyond the veil.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.250
It is said that the
Gaia Codex contains

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.740
jewel seeds of planetary
destiny for all beings

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.860
and life on Planet Earth.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.260
These women, these
priestesses of Astera

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.960
have sheltered and protected the
Codex, and when necessary, kept

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.920
it hidden and ready for those
moments of extraordinary crisis

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.820
and transformation
when it will be

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.646
needed once more
for the nourishment

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:31.880
and regeneration of humankind."

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.100
Now the book has
been out since August

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.090
and it's been really
amazing to receive--

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.570
and it's being read
all over the world,

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.720
have readers in Malta, and
South Africa, and Finland,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.860
and down in South American,
and over in Japan, and all over

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.420
North America.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.190
And it's been really amazing
to get these long letters

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.420
from women saying, I know this.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.850
There's something
that I remember.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.329
And what they will describe is
their own childhood memories,

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.920
their own breakthrough memories.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.500
Many of us have had this, when
we've gone into a place that's

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.750
either ecstasy or crisis.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.780
Where the veils become
a little thinner

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.980
and we remember these essence
truths about our own soul,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.769
about our people.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.490
And each of the women
that are writing

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.380
are adding in their own story.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.040
And how I understand
the Codex is working

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.380
is more as an open source code.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.390
It's a narrative,
but it's also there

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:51.640
as an activator for our
essence connection with life.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.410
I'm going to read
another passage here.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.140
And these are from,
at the beginning

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.540
of each of the chapters, there's
these codes, or Gaia Codex

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.430
Nodes.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.480
"There are Priestesses of
Astera whose bodies and minds

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.750
have been dedicated
as temples of memory.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.260
Into these women's
bones, flesh, and organs,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.560
into their very cells, are
poured historical events

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.840
and knowledge for safekeeping.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.640
In these women,
these memory keepers,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.060
are stored jewels of revelation,
boons for healing and creation.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.690
Some say the true
gift of these women

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.750
is their ability to seamlessly
connect with all life itself,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.780
to read the ancient records
in the tiniest grain of sand,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.820
in the veins of a leaf, in
a constellation of stars,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.820
or in the softness of
a kiss upon the lips.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.180
These memory keepers
are both empty and full

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.450
as they carry the
wisdom through the ages.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:19:01.620
Gaia Codex Node 44.54281."

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.380
There's an ancient
Buddhist sutra

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.770
called the Avatamsaka Sutra,
which is one of my favorite.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.950
It's Mahayana Buddhist.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:18.765
It was actually put into written
form in fourth, fifth century

00:19:18.765 --> 00:19:19.265
BCE.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.730
And what it is, is this
amazing holographic text

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.260
of how reality is structured.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.610
It's 1,000 pages in written
form and it talks about,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.610
very central to it, indra's
net, which probably many of you

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.780
know about.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.650
And an indra's net is this
infinite inter dimensional net

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.700
where at every node
there is a pearl that

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.340
reflects all the other pearls.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.390
And it's talked about as
a inner technology that

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.480
has been discovered by
people who, in this case,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.050
were following the
Buddhist path and were

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.260
going on the path of
being a bodhisattva.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.000
The book also talks
about the stages

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.260
of becoming a bodhisattva
and how we cultivate that.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.430
And there's some beautiful
descriptions of the body,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.680
they call it the
Buddha Body, but this

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.550
is our body when we are
in awakened consciousness.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.210
And it will talk about
billions of worlds

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:31.030
being on one little strand
of hair, and you know,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:35.670
each fingertips holds
the eon of the ages.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.510
And so it's this way of where we
become multi-dimensional beings

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.750
through conscious
contemplative practice.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:55.080
And I would say as women we
have a very close relationship

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.340
to our bodies and a
care of our bodies

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.890
as containers of the universe
and containers of life.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.510
Working with women,
when I've done that,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.640
kind of the entry
point often is first

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.480
that place of where we're
feeling the pain and the sorrow

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.280
of generations of unbalance.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.590
And all of us as human
beings-- and for men

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.200
too-- we're both
male and female.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.260
And balance is what we are
striving for right now,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.090
what we're cultivating,
what were nourishing.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.180
So it's cultivating
the activation

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.880
of the feminine rising
but it's also cultivating

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.150
the honoring of the
masculine part of our self

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.510
in relationship to the female.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.940
One of the sacred technologies
that women have is the circle.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:04.995
And the sacred circle is a
way of activating energies

00:22:04.995 --> 00:22:09.960
and activating direct
connection into wisdom streams,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.050
as it's understood in
the sacred feminine.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.390
It's the activation
of the matrix,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.790
but the original meaning of
the matrix, which means womb.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:29.570
I also, it kind of makes
me laugh that hysteros is

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.780
Greek for the wandering womb.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:37.730
So hysteria happens when
the womb is wandering.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.080
So it's important to
anchor these circles.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.500
And to anchor it together
with other women,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:54.090
it becomes a place where we
can start to directly connect

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.460
with the codes of
the planet, directly

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.320
connect with the wisdom
that wants to come through,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.850
directly connect with
the creations that

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.060
want to come through right
now and give life and form.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.770
This technology of the sacred
circle with women gathering

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:19.825
is a means to activate new
life and to connect to life.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.420
I think there's really
many women right now that

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:34.280
are giving voice to this rising
sacred feminine within us,

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:40.010
and many men that I've met
too that are supportive of it.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:52.940
It's a call to continue
life, and healthy life,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.813
here on our planet.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.910
When I really started to
feel the tears of Gaia,

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.770
when you start to see
devastated rain forests,

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.770
when you see mountaintops in
Virginia that have been blasted

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:14.990
off, this is our body.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.020
This is source to life.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.940
And we may be cosmic
universal beings,

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.880
we may be beings of pure
mind and intelligence,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.810
but we are citizens.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:40.030
We are part of the Mother
Earth and if we destroy her

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:45.100
in the way that we're
going right now,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.910
it will not be here
for our children.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:54.280
And we have a responsibility
as women and as men

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.305
to cultivate life.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.510
Part of it is feeling
it, is feeling

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.430
the pain of what we, as
a culture, have done.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.250
And it's not easy.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.610
We do a lot of things to
intoxicate ourself-- all of us

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.610
have, I have-- to not feel.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.030
But we need to feel.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.885
And from that we can create
a new way of doing things.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.111
That was unexpected.

00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:37.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.692 --> 00:25:39.150
SARAH DREW: Where
to go from there?

00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:51.730
I want to talk a bit about
just the gathering of women,

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:52.790
again from the book.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.130
It's called "The
Temples of Astera."

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.415
These women are called
the Priestesses of Astera.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.500
"Most have forgotten that
the Temples of Astera exist.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.270
This is by design.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.640
Our temples have been
carefully protected,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.630
for in many cultures
and political climates

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.990
the revelation of our
temples' existence

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.110
has meant a certain death.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.360
Conquerors built their
temples on our sacred grounds,

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.430
but even stone edifices
at some point fall.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.630
The wheel is always turning.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.720
Our temples are found
in forest groves,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.480
in the reflection of
a clear glacial lake

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.490
or on the mountaintop.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.380
You may find such a
temple inside a simple hut

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.480
or at the back of an
unassuming merchant shop.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.370
It is known that our physical
bodies are one of our most

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.180
profound and sacred temples.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.050
The Temples of Astera
have been designed

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.820
to look common to the common
eye but for those with the eyes

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.170
to see, the Temples of Astera
are radiant with light.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.970
They're the repositories of
what has been and what may be,

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.630
once again, on our mother.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.520
The Temples of Astera
take inspiration

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.670
from the natural harmonics
of nature herself,

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.140
from the subatomic
to the cosmic,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.610
the walls of our temples
are resonating, fluctuating

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.560
between light and matter, hence
their fluidity and ability

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.390
to transform in the
eye of the beholder,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.120
Our temples are
portals where you

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.490
can enter deeper
dimensions, both in the past

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.970
and in the future,
palimpsest, where

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.840
multiple dimensions co-exist.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.730
Stand in the center of
one and you're anchored

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.750
inside the wheel of life.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.290
All the elements,
earth, water, and fire,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.050
wind are all there
in equal proportion."

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.060
So I think the
simplest way to close

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.390
is that we are here
as defenders of Gaia.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:06.755
We're the voice of Mother Gaia,
whether we are male or female.

00:28:06.755 --> 00:28:09.480
We're vessels into
which the future becomes

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.065
manifest in every one of us.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.450
It's time for us to wake
up from the days, the mire

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.260
of repetitive
action, to go deeper

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.260
into our central consciousness
and to understand

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.210
when a meme or a seed
is planted inside of us

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.450
and to understand
and give caution

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.550
to what we're propagating
for the future.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.870
For those of you here, we're
essential to shaping reality

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.100
through technology.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.530
Consider the impact
of what we're creating

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.780
on generations to come.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.760
Let's create wise, conscious
technologies which nourish life

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.320
and consider the well
being of all being.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.150
And for the women
in the audience,

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.810
it's important for
us in particular

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.440
to return to our ancient ways,
the tried and true technologies

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.000
of our lineage.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.140
But to do it, for at this moment
now, at this critical choice

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.390
point, it's time
for us to gather

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.150
in circles large and
small and to open

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.050
the portals for what has been
long hidden and forgotten.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.540
For we are defenders
of Mother Gaia

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.610
and we are defenders of life.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.880
And we're here to create a
vibrant life-affirming future

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.080
for our children and
our children's children

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.340
for generations to come.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.000
Thank you.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.740
RACHEL: So I know
that from the book

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.500
you have some really
great imagery, just

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.040
wonderful beautiful images.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.150
So can you talk a little bit
about that and the inspiration

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.650
for those?

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.760
Where did those come from?

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.504
And they're just beautiful.

00:29:49.504 --> 00:29:50.420
SARAH DREW: Thank you.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:50.961
RACHEL: Yeah.

00:29:50.961 --> 00:29:54.050
SARAH DREW: Yeah,
such a great question.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.340
When I'm creating--
and it's interesting,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.510
I'm working with a lot
of clients right now

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.490
who are writing and
women and men who

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:10.600
are bringing in a lot of these
new flows of information.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.645
And I found that I actually
receive the information first

00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:15.145
as a visual.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.140
What I mean by that is
that there will be--

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.490
and this is like going
into the creative process.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:31.440
When I went to write
the book there was this,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.130
a scene would come in and it
would be like watching a movie.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.290
And for me, it was so
visceral and so sensorial.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.840
And I was just the transcriber
writing, you know, OK, wow.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.810
OK, this is happening.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.860
This is happening
to the character.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.340
And even though a
lot of my background

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.340
had trained my mind in
the intellectual process

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.520
and had study
religions and I've been

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.070
a curator on different projects
working with global wisdom.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.950
When it came to that
process, it was just

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.800
going into these living worlds.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.590
And it's a way of traveling,
both in the writing process,

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.410
in the past and the future.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.200
So those are, images
are anchors and I

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.270
see it as like a symbolic
language actually.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.780
And it was really
essential, I thought,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.280
in the publication
of the book to have

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.380
the images as part of
the story, like one

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.980
the ancient illuminated
manuscripts.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.480
AUDIENCE: One of
the calls to action

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.120
that you had for
women here and just

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.670
men that may channel
their inner feminine

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.930
was to gather in circles.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.950
And I wonder if you
could share more, like,

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.090
what you mean by that.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.340
Is that more of
a symbolic thing?

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.100
Or I'm thinking in my brain
like new moon gatherings

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.930
or something.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:49.895
SARAH DREW: Yeah.

00:31:49.895 --> 00:31:52.020
AUDIENCE: Where we gather
around the fire and like,

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:52.749
share stories.

00:31:52.749 --> 00:31:53.290
I don't know.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.430
I'm curious if you
have any suggestions.

00:31:58.024 --> 00:31:59.440
SARAH DREW: It's
a great question.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.790
And I think gathering
in circle is something

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:08.850
that's so natural once we go
into it, especially for women,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.530
you know?

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:17.480
And I'm seeing it as a
grounds roots call to action,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.452
but I'm also seeing
it as medicine.

00:32:20.452 --> 00:32:22.410
We're doing it to come
together because there's

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.100
a lot of healing
and transmutation

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.420
that happens first, and
that's really essential.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.050
And a lot of the energies that
we're working with right now,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.600
none of us can do it alone.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.290
We need to do it together.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.560
And it really is
this place where

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.790
our personal life, our personal
joys, our personal pains,

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.240
interact with the
larger ethos of what's

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.810
happening on the planet.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.240
With the "Gaia
Codex" there's been

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.590
women that have been
gathering around

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.881
the book, around the planet,
and it's really wonderful.

00:32:53.881 --> 00:32:58.170
And we're going to be,
coming in the end of May,

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.920
probably mid May, we're
going to be having

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.230
just free online gatherings so
that those that are gathering--

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.990
and just some basic blueprints.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.240
I'm really big on people
being able to access

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.470
their own knowing.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.702
Because I think
once, what I've found

00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.160
when the circle's
set up right, you

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.400
can start to access
these wisdoms

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.430
and you have these
amazing things of stuff

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.390
that maybe we
haven't been taught

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.510
that starts to flow through us.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.740
So but anyway,
we'll be having that

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.130
and I'll give my
information at the end here.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.945
And it would be wonderful to
see you here, all of you, there.

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:35.067
And men too.

00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:35.650
And get your--

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.620
[GIGGLING]

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.556
RACHEL: Yeah.

00:33:37.556 --> 00:33:39.180
I'm getting that it's
like a community.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:44.420
So it's almost like
embracing that feminine value

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.510
and trait of community and
associating with others, men

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.450
or women, about this issue
and how we can help--

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.660
SARAH DREW: Yeah, I love--

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.974
RACHEL: Save the planet.

00:33:54.974 --> 00:33:56.140
SARAH DREW: Yeah, thank you.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.730
It's almost kind of going into
the root word of that, right?

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.175
The communion, the
commune, the community.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.330
Yeah.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:10.026
There's just that empathy
of the heart, right?

00:34:10.026 --> 00:34:11.400
AUDIENCE: While
you were talking,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.900
especially kind of when you
became overcome with emotion--

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.473
thank you for sharing that--
I was curious generally

00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:20.889
to hear your thought process
and why-- it sounds like it's

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.550
a fiction book more or less.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.370
Kind of how you decided to
be fiction or nonfiction

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.410
because these are also very
serious factual issues also.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:32.576
SARAH DREW: I'm getting
shivers as you're saying it.

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:33.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:34.780
SARAH DREW: Thanks
for tuning in.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.570
It was actually, when I
started to write the book

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.980
and I got that I needed
to write the book,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.780
I actually took
three years and was

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.500
very fortunate to
receive a bequest

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.050
from Shawn Hailey, who was an
early Silicon Valley inventor.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.570
You can go over in Silicon
Genesis over at Stanford,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.470
did a lot of work with biochip.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:00.220
She's passed.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.335
And I say she because
she became a transgender

00:35:02.335 --> 00:35:05.000
at the end of her life.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.770
And it could've been fiction or
it could have been nonfiction.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.500
And I felt that fiction,
at this point in time,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.080
allows us to have
more brain elasticity,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.620
to just stretch your
imaginations a bit more on what

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.490
could be without
having to go into--

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.610
and I do it too-- going into
our critical mind of like, well,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.090
no, this isn't how
it is right now,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.020
or going into it logic so much.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:33.190
So it was a very specific
choice with that.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.790
Yeah, just to give
us more-- and I

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.000
wanted to give a real
visceral, sensorial experience,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.290
where sometimes
with facts, I mean,

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.540
facts done well are going
to be visceral and sensorial

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.180
but I wanted to have
more of this real,

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.800
something you can taste,
and eat, and smell.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.970
Yeah.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.810
It's a great question.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.600
AUDIENCE: I'm just
about to finish

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.040
this year and a half
immersion called

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.500
Inner Yoga, this whole thing.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.870
And I just started
a new job here

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.690
and I'm kind of crossing
these two worlds.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.035
So I'm glad you're here today.

00:36:05.035 --> 00:36:05.534
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.534 --> 00:36:06.930
SARAH DREW: I'm glad
you're here too.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.555
AUDIENCE: And I was
just wondering more

00:36:08.555 --> 00:36:12.350
about your personal background
of your spiritual influences

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.510
or rituals that led to this.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.130
And if there's
any, I don't know,

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.300
just certain practices that
you do regularly, or rituals,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.965
or people you follow,
anything else you recommend.

00:36:24.965 --> 00:36:25.590
SARAH DREW: Mm.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:26.270
Thank you.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.260
I'll make it brief.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.730
My journey's been a long one.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.120
You know, when I was
19, 20, I started out

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.260
in a completely different
field and then got--

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.060
which I know some
Googlers did-- that I

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.760
need to take three years off
and travel around the world.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:49.180
SARAH DREW: And I ended up
going to Tibet and India

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.510
and down in the Amazon.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.830
And then came back and
went to UC Berkeley

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.920
and studied religious studies.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.790
I was in journalism
to begin with.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.447
I was going to become a
television anchor or something.

00:37:02.447 --> 00:37:03.469
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:05.260
SARAH DREW: And then
from religious studies

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.473
I went into technology and
had a high-tech startup

00:37:07.473 --> 00:37:11.340
in the '90s that was
working with earlier

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.170
forms of virtual reality.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.510
So my practice became
the crack open.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.730
It wasn't pretty.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.600
It was messy, you know?

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:26.140
It was like me going and
just the top of the head

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:30.440
being ripped open and all of
a sudden, everything that I

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.420
thought was true wasn't true.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.680
And I needed to--
my solution to that

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.270
was to travel to Tibet in 1984
and sit with Buddhist monks.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.210
And a lot of my
practice right now

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:50.990
is in the Tantric
Buddhist yoga tradition.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.000
My main teachers are in Buton.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.300
And I meditate every day,
I work with the goddesses.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.550
Sally Kempton, I don't know
if you know of her work,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:09.730
she's been one of my
mentors for many years.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.890
So the embodiment I think for
women, the Hindu and Buddhist

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.190
Tantric tradition for
embodying the goddess,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.410
I find really useful.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.610
Because there are these
whole templates and they're

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:23.880
almost like kind of
synesthetic multimedia

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.800
templates of how we can have
all the information embodied

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.560
in there.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.100
And it's a really interesting
technology actually,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.580
I think, because you have like
a, as you know, a mandala.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.760
But a mandala also has
a linked connection

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.240
into a mantra,
which is the sound.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.740
Which also has a
linked connection

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.220
into the image of the goddess
if that's easier for you

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.590
to just kind of,
oh, I will be her.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.340
We'll resonate together, right?

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.240
And so it's a fairly, I
found, sophisticated system

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:59.280
of embodiment and
they cultivating

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.630
this deep karmic compassion.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.260
So I really look forward to
hearing more about your journey

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.020
because it just feels like
it's something really big

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.970
and whatever you're-- I mean,
not to put you on the spot

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.035
in the room in front of--

00:39:17.035 --> 00:39:17.659
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:18.430
We can talk after.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:24.505
SARAH DREW: But it feels, I can
feel that after these couple

00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:26.630
years, there's something
quite extraordinary you're

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.990
bringing through.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.824
So thank you.

00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:31.240
AUDIENCE: I had
one more question.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.510
So when you were
getting the visuals

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:38.440
and trying to write
this, was it all at once?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.160
Like it took three
years to write

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.104
but did you just get
an entire story line

00:39:43.104 --> 00:39:45.270
and know what you were
exactly going to write or was

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.750
it piece by piece and
unfolded over years?

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:48.470
What happened?

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.210
SARAH DREW: Right.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.540
The way that I received
the information--

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.420
and it's interesting that
in this Illuminated Creation

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.820
Writing Program that
we're doing right now,

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.910
a lot of the, almost
all the students

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.910
that signed up for the program,
are receiving the information

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.720
in similar ways, which is
like a blueprint at first.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.370
I received it as kind of
like a mandalic blueprint.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.770
And I actually took
a piece of paper,

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.510
drew down certain
images, put down

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.260
certain key words of what
the key memes, if you will,

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.650
on the book.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:25.300
Key information were there.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.250
And then I didn't
pressure myself

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.980
to say OK, let's start
at the beginning.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.680
I just let whatever
scene would come up.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.650
And there was these
key anchor scenes.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.310
One of them for the
"Gaia Codex" was,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.830
there's this extraordinary
gathering of women

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.530
at the Chateau Lumiere
and all of the sudden,

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.580
I found myself in the
midst of this room

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.240
with women from all
different cultures and places

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.510
who were gathering at this
particular time on the planet

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.780
to bring about rejuvenation.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.460
And it was so sensorial.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.090
I mean, I was in tears.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.600
And my job as a writer at
that point was just to--

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.940
SARAH DREW: I was the
scribe really, you know.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.550
So a lot of the key scenes would
come like that, and pretty much

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.200
in their complete form.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.400
And then narrative, arc,
and structure, you know,

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.560
it basically took a heroine's
journey was the narrative

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.210
structure.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.350
And then of course
editing is a whole other,

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.818
I won't say editing
is a bitch but--

00:41:29.818 --> 00:41:31.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.120
SARAH DREW: It's a
whole other process.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.740
I was very lucky to have some
wonderful people to work with.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.500
Anyway, wonderful to
be here and thanks

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.580
for your great questions.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.560
If you're interested
in diving in deeper,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.280
you can go to www.gaiacodex.com.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.510
For those of you here today,
the book is available over here.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.860
It's also available on Amazon
as well as the website.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.895
I am offering a nine week
one-on-one mentoring program,

00:41:58.895 --> 00:42:02.550
The Illuminated Creation,
The Art of Visionary Writing,

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.010
where we dive in deep and
both look at structural stuff.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.920
And it's really
geared towards, if you

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.420
feel that you're
bringing in a new code

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:21.150
or creation for this next
phase of our human existence,

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.320
then this is a good one.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.120
And women and men are invited.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.150
And finally for those who
have projects and start

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.340
ups who are working with
emergent evolutionary culture,

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.440
I consult with
different companies

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.300
and bring together wisdom
circles of both men and women

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.060
on how we can make
this transition

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.870
