press conference I got the impression
 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.830
press conference I got the impression
that this prize people were a bit quiet

that this prize people were a bit quiet
 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.900
that this prize people were a bit quiet
was have many people been waiting for

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910
was have many people been waiting for
 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.920
was have many people been waiting for
this price either well people have been

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
this price either well people have been
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.290

aware of this work you know for decades

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300
aware of this work you know for decades
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.380
aware of this work you know for decades
and you know the work started in the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390
and you know the work started in the
 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.400
and you know the work started in the
1970s and it sort of built throughout

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
1970s and it sort of built throughout
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.389
1970s and it sort of built throughout
the years so in some ways I'm surprised

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399
the years so in some ways I'm surprised
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.910
the years so in some ways I'm surprised
that it wasn't you know more more of a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920
that it wasn't you know more more of a
 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.869
that it wasn't you know more more of a
obvious choice but um so it's a

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879
obvious choice but um so it's a
 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.639
obvious choice but um so it's a
fundamental discovery of cell physiology

a factory and it needs to produce

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540
a factory and it needs to produce
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.730
a factory and it needs to produce
proteins and they need to shuttle these

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740
proteins and they need to shuttle these
 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.889

shuttled from one compartment in the
 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.289
shuttled from one compartment in the
cell to the other and how these

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299
cell to the other and how these
 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.690
cell to the other and how these
molecules can be also exported from the

molecules can be also exported from the
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.319
molecules can be also exported from the
cell so it's that process which we have

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329
cell so it's that process which we have
 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.709

the priests lipsy stuff so Schekman used

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300
the priests lipsy stuff so Schekman used
 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.480
the priests lipsy stuff so Schekman used
yeast genetics and he was studying

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
yeast genetics and he was studying
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.340
yeast genetics and he was studying
temperature senton sensitive mutant

yeast and he could morphologically with

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
yeast and he could morphologically with
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.460
yeast and he could morphologically with
a microscope see that some of the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470
a microscope see that some of the
 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.220
a microscope see that some of the
vesicles in the mutinies were building

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
vesicles in the mutinies were building
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.440
vesicles in the mutinies were building
up in certain parts of the cell he

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
up in certain parts of the cell he
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.810
up in certain parts of the cell he
understood that that disturbed the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820
understood that that disturbed the
 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.000
understood that that disturbed the
traffic and he went on to identify the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
traffic and he went on to identify the
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.330
traffic and he went on to identify the
genes that control this traffic that was

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
genes that control this traffic that was
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.070
genes that control this traffic that was
a pretty bold approach because at the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080
a pretty bold approach because at the
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.110
a pretty bold approach because at the
time people didn't necessarily think

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.830
relevance for mammals rothman took a
really bold approach he studied this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
really bold approach he studied this
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.610

was met with some skepticism because

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
was met with some skepticism because
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.610
was met with some skepticism because
people thought that this traffic would

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620
people thought that this traffic would
 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.940
people thought that this traffic would
be dependent upon the proximity of the

be dependent upon the proximity of the
 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.070
be dependent upon the proximity of the
compartments with each other therefore

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080
compartments with each other therefore
 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.960

you theoretically wouldn't be able to
 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790
you theoretically wouldn't be able to
break up the cell because you'd need to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
break up the cell because you'd need to
 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.880
break up the cell because you'd need to
have an int XL Rothman broke up the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020
knowledge that we're gaining from this
 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.560
knowledge that we're gaining from this
is applicable to all cells from yeast to

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570
is applicable to all cells from yeast to
 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.400

what these individuals have done is

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030
what these individuals have done is
 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.810
what these individuals have done is
they've uncovered this machinery this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820
they've uncovered this machinery this
 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.540
they've uncovered this machinery this
mechanism and that is allowed us to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550
mechanism and that is allowed us to
 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.250
mechanism and that is allowed us to
understand basic physiology but it's

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260
understand basic physiology but it's
 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.170
understand basic physiology but it's
also allowed us to have some insight

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180
also allowed us to have some insight
 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.770
also allowed us to have some insight
into disease progression and prospective

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780
