00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.860
 DNA heals a lot of attention as it stores 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.252
 our genetic information, and deserves it. 

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:07.889
 If we did not have DNA, there would be no way 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.826
 to store the information that makes us who we are, 

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:13.322
 and the other organisms what they are. 

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.654
 DNA has some useful properties, it can replicate, 

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:19.591
 which we have discussed in detail in other videos. 

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.516
 DNA can also produce DNA, 

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.488
 we call this replication. But only the replication of DNA 

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.856
 is not enough 

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:31.527
 to create a new organism. 

00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.059
 To create a new organism you must 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.451
 to take the DNA and DNA information 

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.921
 with it to produce structural molecules, 

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.218
 enzymes, transport molecules, signal molecules, 

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:48.291
 who do the work in the body. 

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.054
 The first step in this process 

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:53.179
 we have spoken in other videos. 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.785
 The first step is to get DNA from the DNA, 

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.774
 namely, information RNA. 

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:02.052
 This process here 

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:04.293
 is called transcription. 

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:06.127
 We talk about the transcription in detail 

00:01:06.127 --> 00:01:08.089
 in other videos. 

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.225
 Then the information RNA 

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:14.126
 goes to ribosomes and interacts with transport RNA, 

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:17.191
 which carries amino acids that form proteins. 

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.359
 Thus, from information RNA, 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.958
 using transport RNA 

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:32.888
 and amino acids - Let's say "+ mRNA" and "amino acids". 

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:35.849
 I will write "amino acids" in a brighter color. 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.123
 Because we will be focusing on this video. 

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:45.990
 mRNA and amino acids can construct proteins (proteins). 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.789
 We can build proteins, 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.180
 which consist of amino acid chains. 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.360
 Proteins are the ones that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.392
 doing a lot of work in the body. 

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:59.550
 Proteins are just amino acid chains, 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.885
 and sometimes they are made by 

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.627
 several amino acid chains. 

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:05.924
 Imagine that this is an amino acid. 

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:07.724
 This is another amino acid. 

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:10.092
 This is another. 

00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:13.041
 This is another, we can continue. 

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.420
 These amino acid chains, 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.554
 based on the properties of 

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:21.017
 individual amino acids determine 

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:23.049
 how proteins are formed, 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.883
 how they interact with the environment 

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:27.855
 and what function they perform. 

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.619
 Proteins can build virtually everything part of the immune system - 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.324
 antibodies, enzymes, even 

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:38.420
 signaling hormones such as insulin. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.986
 They participate in the muscle contraction. 

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.287
 Aktin and myosin for which we have 

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.726
 great video, are proteins. 

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.491
 Proteins are involved in the transport of oxygen - 

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:46.455
 hemoglobin is a protein. 

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:48.719
 Proteins 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.089
 do a lot of work. 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.419
 DNA says what the hereditary information contained, 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.809
 but much of the work in the body is actually 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.526
 is made of proteins. 

00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:02.349
 And as we have said, the building blocks 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.054
 the proteins are amino acids. 

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:07.027
 Let's focus on it for a moment. 

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:10.859
 Here are examples of amino acids here. 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.786
 There are 20 frequent, sputtered amino acids, 

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:17.523
 there are a few, depending on which organism we look at. 

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:19.740
 And theoretically, there may be many more. 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.087
 But in most biological systems, 

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:24.826
 there are 20 commonly distributed amino acids that are encoded in DNA. 

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.219
 Here are two of them. 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.017
 Let's first concentrate on their similarities. 

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:33.022
 We see that both, in fact, all three, 

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:36.761
 have an amino group. 

00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.059
 We have an amino group 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.461
 and that's why we call them amino acids. 

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.423
 We have an amino group. 

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.258
 The amino group is here. 

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:49.056
 Now you can say, "It's called an amino acid," 

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.960
 "where does the acid come from?" 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.720
 "Acid" comes from the carboxyl group here. 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.392
 That's why we call them heartburns. 

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:02.384
 This carboxyl group is acidic. 

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.520
 He can deliver a proton. 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.656
 In the middle we have carbon, 

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:09.152
 we call this carbon atom - alpha carbon. 

00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:12.020
 We call it alpha carbon. 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.493
 Alpha carbon, this alpha carbon is bound, 

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.594
 it forms a covalent bond with the amino group, 

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:18.591
 covalent bond to the carboxyl group 

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.959
 and a covalent bond with a hydrogen atom. 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.187
 From now on, we have differences 

00:04:24.187 --> 00:04:26.242
 between different amino acids. Actually, there is even 

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:30.294
 and some exceptions for nitrogen, 

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.825
 but for the most part the differences 

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:36.018
 between the amino acids are in that with what 

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:38.189
 alpha carbon forms its fourth covalent bond. 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.321
 You see that in serin we have this, 

00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:45.155
 which we can call alcohol. 

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:47.187
 We can have alcohol as a side chain. 

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:50.728
 We have in the valley 

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:54.917
 pure hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon side chain. 

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:58.158
 We can generally call these side chains 

00:04:58.158 --> 00:05:01.154
 R groups. These R groups 

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:05.159
 play a major role in determining the shape of proteins, 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.051
 how they interact with the environment 

00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:08.955
 and what features they perform. 

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.755
 Even only of these examples here, you can guess 

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:13.518
 how different side chains can have different behaviors. 

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:16.084
 Amino acid with side chain alcohol - 

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:18.859
 we know that oxygen is electronegative 

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.378
 and likes to pull electrons - It's remarkable 

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:23.979
 how many chemical and even biological properties we can predict 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.220
 only by electrification. 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.750
 Oxygen attracts electrons, so 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.757
 we will have a partial negative charge here. 

00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:38.259
 Hydrogen has low electrical resistance compared to oxygen, 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.291
 so he can supply his electrons 

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.822
 and will have a partial positive charge. 

00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:46.781
 We also have polarity, 

00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.789
 i. the molecule will be hydrophilic. 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.693
 At least that part of the molecule will be able to 

00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:54.153
 to attract and interact with water. 

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.288
 Compared to serine 

00:05:57.288 --> 00:06:02.489
 here we have a hydrocarbon side chain that is not polar. 

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:04.683
 It will be hydrophobic. 

00:06:04.683 --> 00:06:08.015
 It will be hydrophobic. 

00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:10.523
 When we start talking about the structure of 

00:06:10.523 --> 00:06:12.625
 proteins and how 

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.552
 is influenced by the side chains, 

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.524
 imagine that parts of the protein, 

00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:18.917
 which have hydrophobic side chains, 

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.460
 will be in the interior of the protein, 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.561
 if they are in aqueous solution. 

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:24.722
 And those who are hydrophilic, 

00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:26.255
 will want to stand in the outer part of the protein. 

00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.427
 There may also be side chains that are 

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:29.250
 large and bulky, 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.420
 they will be difficult to pack. 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.080
 Other side chains will be small, 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.355
 making them easy to pack. 

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:39.653
 The side chains can define the shape of the protein. 

00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:41.487
 We will talk about it more when 

00:06:41.487 --> 00:06:44.482
 we talk about the structure of proteins. 

00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:47.861
 But how do amino acids interact with each other? 

00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:49.324
 We will look at this issue in more detail 

00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:51.924
 in another video. 

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:56.684
 But if we have serin here, 

00:06:56.684 --> 00:07:01.514
 and here we have valine, 

00:07:01.514 --> 00:07:03.558
 they are linked by the so-called peptide bonds. 

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:08.515
 A peptide bond is a term that is used when two or more amino acids are linked. 

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:10.257
 This will be a dipeptide, and the relationship - 

00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:12.253
 It's not that big, it will actually 

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:14.692
 I draw again, smaller. 

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:15.585
 So ... 

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.455
 This is a serine. 

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.624
 It's valine. 

00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:23.654
 They form a peptide bond, and this will be the smallest one 

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:27.428
 peptide - dipeptide. 

00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:30.052
 Peptide, peptide bond or 

00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:32.141
 peptide coupling. 

00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:35.253
 And this chain forms a polypeptide. 

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:37.610
 We can add more 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.660
 and more amino acids to it. 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.518
 This may be a protein 

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:47.687
 or a portion of a protein. 

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:50.021
 The last thing I want to talk about is 

00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:52.888
 the way these amino acids are drawn. 

00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:54.920
 They are drawn, as you can often see in a textbook. 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.193
 But at physiological pH, pH in the body 

00:07:59.193 --> 00:08:01.956
 which is about 7, 

00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:08.318
 roughly - between 7.2 and 7.4. 

00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:12.985
 In this situation, the carboxyl group here 

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:15.087
 will probably be deprotonated, 

00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:16.991
 will probably deliver hydrogen. 

00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:19.452
 This is more common. 

00:08:19.452 --> 00:08:21.019
 The concentration of the deprotonated form will be greater 

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.121
 from that of the protonated. 

00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.894
 Physiological conditions are more likely 

00:08:26.894 --> 00:08:33.546
 this oxygen will accept these two electrons 

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.125
 and have a negative charge. 

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.947
 The hydrogen proton is separated. 

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:40.153
 Oxygen has taken the electrons of hydrogen. 

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:43.717
 And then 

00:08:43.717 --> 00:08:46.689
 amino group at physiological pH 

00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:49.150
 will probably connect to a proton. 

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.691
 Nitrogen has a free electron pair 

00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:55.153
 and can use it to connect to a proton. 

00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:56.952
 In fact, at physiological pH 

00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:58.752
 you will find a higher concentration of nitrogen connected 

00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:01.457
 with a proton compared to nitrogen that is not. 

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:05.695
 Nitrogen has captured a proton, 

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.587
 using his free e-pair. 

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:14.321
 So there will be a positive charge. 

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:19.394
 Sometimes you may encounter the amino acids described 

00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:21.217
 in this way, which is actually more accurate 

00:09:21.217 --> 00:09:24.491
 for physiological conditions. 

00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:26.256
 These molecules have an interesting name. 

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:28.752
 A molecule that is neutral, though 

00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:31.120
 its individual parts are loaded, 

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.419
 is called zwitterion. 

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.985
 A funny word, is not it? 

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:39.874
 Zwitterion. 

00:09:39.874 --> 00:09:41.558
 "Zwitter" in German means "hybrid", 

00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:44.809
 and "ion" obviously means there will be a charge. 

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:46.086
 This will be a hybrid charge, 

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.990
 although there are charges at these ends, 

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.293
 they are added to 0.
