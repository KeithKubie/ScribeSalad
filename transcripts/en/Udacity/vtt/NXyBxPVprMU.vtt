00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.840
So the answer is the third one. DNA RNA base pairing. Remember that Uracil

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.310
replaces Thymine in RNA, but that doesn't mean that Uracil from RNA can't base

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.170
pair with Adenine from DNA. Remember, the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.780
ribose sugars are different. They're colored differently

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.590
in the RNA strand compared to the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.850
DNA strand, but the letters, the nitrogenous bases,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.460
can still pair with each other, right? So

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.290
here we have an RNA-DNA hybrid right now. Base

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.350
pairing is a powerful phenomenon, and as long as

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.300
you have these nitrogenous bases They want to form

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
these paired bonds with each other. So as

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.690
transcription occurs, a nucleotide after nucleotide is brought in

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.940
on the RNA side, it will keep being brought

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.030
in for the whole length of the gene until

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
transcription is complete, and you've reached the end. Now, when

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.490
I say the end, this isn't the end of the

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.880
chromosome. There actually is a distinct end to a gene,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.720
and we'll talk a little bit more about that later.
