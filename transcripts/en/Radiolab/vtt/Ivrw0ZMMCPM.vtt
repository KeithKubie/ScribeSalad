00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:07.200
This is radio lab and today we have stories on confrontations, face offs,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.700
throwdowns all of them leading to a question. This was the title of our show.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.110
What's left when you're right, it doesn't make a lick of sense yet. Well, maybe,

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.140
maybe it will when you hear this story. No, I'm afraid not.

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.750
Won't get clear to elevate later in a case. Um,

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.530
this next story began when one of our former producers, uh, Lulu Miller, uh,

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.750
call me up and said, let's just get in the studio.

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.320
I want to talk you through something. Okay. Sorry. You just go. Yeah.

10
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.570
So you've been, you've been, you, so, okay.

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.340
I honestly don't quite know what we're doing.

12
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.770
I think you're going to tell me about something that you've been wanting to tell

13
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:41.190
me.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.730
<v 1>Yes.</v>

15
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.730
I wanted to quickly tell you what the idea is while while I truly like am still

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.370
pretty darn confused by it. Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay.

17
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.800
So done. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.740
It's about my bike trip across the country.

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.870
You say with a certain amount of Chagrin. I don't know.

20
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:07.170
I guess I just get embarrassed because it sounds like boring, self-indulgent.

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 0>Um, now, uh, when I initially talked with Lulu, uh, the,</v>

22
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.720
she was planning to write a book about the story that we're going to tell. Uh,

23
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:19.721
and I was really there to just to help her sound out the ideas and we were gonna

24
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.180
use the recording as a transcript for her. So I was just doing it, you know,

25
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.320
we were just having a daughter a favor kinda. But then when I heard the story,

26
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.440
I decided a favor over,

27
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.770
let's make this a radio story because it's, it's, it's spooky actually.

28
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.500
Everyone here on the staff who heard it has had that reaction.

29
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.970
And I think it also asks in its small way of really big question,

30
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.500
which is how do you do good in a world that [inaudible]

31
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.700
<v 1>wow.</v>

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.700
So I feel like I went into the trip very confident about where I stood on people

33
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.810
being really sure that inside everybody was like just another good soul.

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.391
You know,

35
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:07.310
everyone has quirks and tics that make them angry or obnoxious or conceited or

36
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:07.971
depressed,

37
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.570
but that those ticks are just kind of like a good soul trying to like clot its

38
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.590
way through the world and strikes me as one of your primary assumptions about

39
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.060
the world. Just knowing that well what past tense,

40
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.290
something changed on this trip? Yeah,

41
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.010
there was a moment that

42
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.060
I did the bike trip with my friend sue.

43
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.560
<v 0>So as she explained, um, is an old friend,</v>

44
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.550
they met in college and she says one of the first things that she noticed about

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.900
sue was that she would say the most amazing things. Like for example,

46
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.800
she is Korean and she moved to the states when she was 12 speaks English

47
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.880
perfectly, no accent.

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.940
But every now and then she has like a language Mashup that is so brilliant

49
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.730
<v 1>and she doesn't even notice it. One was like I don't, I don't know.</v>

50
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.240
I was just like running around and I was so crackled that I've done little and

51
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.460
it was like, oh crap, these old, that's not a word,

52
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.650
but I know exactly what you mean.

53
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.370
That's crazy and frazzled and actually that's a better word. And then like,

54
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.850
you know, I'm just, I just don't want to like, why is it when I get down,

55
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.050
I like to eat all this grubbing.

56
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.760
I just don't understand what [inaudible] I'm like,

57
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.170
Grub is invented or like my dad is always worrying that I'm just always going to

58
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.060
be trapezing around and Dah, Dah, Dah.

59
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.910
And she meant traipsing Richard Visa is a much better word, like trippy,

60
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.420
using his better. That's like with our whole generation of like low life ae.

61
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.700
All they're doing with trapezing point is a Lulu was drawn to sue.

62
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.790
They became great friends and part of that connection,

63
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.890
this is the key is that they were so different.

64
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.840
She has a very different personality than I do.

65
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.530
Whereas Lulu is kind of your classic optimist sue.

66
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.210
She's a very um,

67
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.340
grouchy and always like frustrated by people and she's really,

68
00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:00.061
really smart.

69
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:05.061
So she'll like go on the most wonderfully enjoyable rants about people.

70
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.920
So anyhow, they decided to take this bike trip across the country.

71
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:09.390
They'd actually done one before.

72
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:12.150
So they knew they could travel together and they obviously knew they had this

73
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.980
difference in personality. Uh,

74
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.040
and in fact as they were biking and stopping all these little towns,

75
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.330
they would sort of joke about it.

76
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.350
She would always yell at me for being what she called an [inaudible],

77
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.410
which is like we ask for directions and then I'm like,

78
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.800
really old man now are you a farmer? Oh, you're a [inaudible].

79
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.280
How does beaver farming work? Oh you and she's sitting there like, Jesus,

80
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.980
we have 3,500 miles ago. Like so,

81
00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:41.780
so charming. They would tease one another,

82
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.190
but then they came to this moment where that difference between them stop being

83
00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:49.850
charming and it got kind of dangerous. Basically.

84
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.550
Long Story Short, a few weeks into the trip,

85
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.290
Lulus front wheels busted and they roll into this town called Pittsburgh,

86
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.610
Kansas. Kind of a small forgotten town in eastern Kansas near Missouri.

87
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.940
There is nobody there. It was like all desolate and hot,

88
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.210
but there was a bike shop.

89
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.270
So we went to the bike shop and the bike mechanic there, Roger, big ball guy.

90
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.721
I was like,

91
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:15.430
well I don't have any wheels but I can build you one if you guys can stay at a,

92
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.180
I could build you one today and have it free tomorrow.

93
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.300
So they went off checked email, set up camp,

94
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:24.830
came back early the next morning we got there and you could tell he hadn't even

95
00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:25.664
started it.

96
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.620
The wheel was just hanging there where they'd left it and Lulu says at this

97
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:33.230
point her and sister going in opposite directions.

98
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.630
So I registered that and I was like,

99
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.970
maybe it only takes an hour to make a wheel and he'll have it ready by 11 you

100
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:45.740
know, and sewer registered that and it was just like,

101
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.890
what the f? She said, I'm going to talk to this guy.

102
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.210
I immediately got like hot and flushed and didn't want her to say anything.

103
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.170
Lulu rushes sue out of the store telling Roger, well we'll come back soon.

104
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.330
Two hours later they return again and the bike wheel is still there.

105
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.290
Not even touch.

106
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.240
Sue really wanted to say something and I think we kind of had a skirmish in the

107
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.200
back. Like, I was like, well, don't like,

108
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.970
I could tell he was kind of not taking us seriously, but I still was like,

109
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.800
if we continue to be nice to him,

110
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.850
what reason would he have to like sabotage us or,

111
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.470
or not follow through? If we just keep treating him with respect,

112
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:29.030
he'll treat us with respect.

113
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.690
<v 0>And she says, sue on the other hand was like, Lulu, don't you see like,</v>

114
00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:38.250
this guy thinks we're just like these dilettantish college girls.

115
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.610
Uh, he said some weird power thing. He's taking advantage of us.

116
00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:43.170
And he was like, no, he's not.

117
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.370
<v 1>And then his like stupid is Roger gonna make a bike wheel turned into the</v>

118
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.010
[inaudible] test. Yeah. Turned into like a test of the human spirit. Yeah.

119
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.040
<v 0>Pass Lulu and sewer sitting on this couch in the back of the store,</v>

120
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.120
not talking to each other.

121
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.870
<v 1>And um, and then his two little boys come in,</v>

122
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.710
he has two little boys and they were like, Daddy, can we go soon? And he's like,

123
00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:09.040
oh, I got to finish this, but then we can go on the ride. And, and I remember,

124
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.740
I remember that. I remember he called them sweetie.

125
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.540
And I remember that being like a point for me cause I was like,

126
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:20.890
Oh man, who calls his little boys sweetie? Like that's a good person, you know,

127
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.570
<v 0>few more hours pass.</v>

128
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.280
And they're still sitting there on this couch now with these two little boys,

129
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.410
<v 1>all four of us on this couch. And they were watching Nickelodeon cartoons</v>

130
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.560
<v 0>and in the middle of the cartoons, Gordon Lou,</v>

131
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.340
there was a commercial for the army, like in a recruiting ad.

132
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:38.650
And she says that that was the moment where sue just

133
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.190
<v 1>lost it.</v>

134
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.030
She turned to Lulu and maybe it was one sentence and maybe it was 45 minutes

135
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.920
like I don't know. But she said,

136
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.980
you know something along the lines of the way you think you are in the world as

137
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.640
like so nice to people. That's a form of deceit.

138
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.030
<v 0>And then she says, sue stormed right up to Roger</v>

139
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
<v 1>and I'm sitting on this couch fuming and she laid into him,</v>

140
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.640
we're not going to make it by dark and we have to get there and this is your

141
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:09.340
fault. And she like demanded that.

142
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:14.080
One of the like younger guys that worked in his store give us a ride and he's

143
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:16.180
like, well, this guy, he's got things to do.

144
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.260
And it was just this horrible thing that I was just like,

145
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.950
and on my way out after suit already walked out,

146
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.940
I tried to say something to Roger like, Hey, I'm really sorry. I just,

147
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.050
it's been a, you know, I tried to kind of like apologize for her and for myself.

148
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.131
And he was like, well,

149
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:36.490
tell your friend so sorry to have inconvenienced her baby.

150
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.310
<v 0>Lulu said that feeling like this guy doesn't know them just now assumes they are</v>

151
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:47.780
these spoiled college girls that just ate at her. She kept thinking,

152
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:48.321
I don't get it.

153
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.750
Like if we had just been nice to the guy instead of confronting him,

154
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:55.440
maybe he wouldn't think that about us making matters worse.

155
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.160
After they left

156
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.731
<v 1>the bike shop,</v>

157
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:01.350
they piled into this car and this kid from Roger's bike shop drove them into

158
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.530
Missouri because that's what sue had demanded. And we paid him.

159
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.420
And the kid was really nice, but I just was like,

160
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:10.110
this feels so like I feel so disgusting being in this car with her.

161
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.630
And it just like the whole thing was awful.

162
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.290
Got to Missouri and I just remember like Missouri passing in a blur of me being

163
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.750
like I am riding with a crazy person.

164
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.200
Like so you feel like suddenly this difference between you guys was serious?

165
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.880
Yeah. And just to walk me through a little bit of a, I mean I have to,

166
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:33.330
I do have to warn you though. This isn't the moment. This is not the moment,

167
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.070
not the moment. So let me, do you want to tell me about the moment? Yeah,

168
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.950
I want to tell you about the moment really bad. Um, okay. So I was just like,

169
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:45.000
finish this trip and then, um, we get to Damascus,

170
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:49.470
Virginia where the Trans Continental bike route that we were riding crosses with

171
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:50.550
the Appalachian trail.

172
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.580
So it's like in the mountains and the town put this little,

173
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:55.200
they said they have tons of people coming through.

174
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.860
So they put this free hostel for bikers and hikers, um,

175
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.080
to stay and it's unmanned, no one's there.

176
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:04.110
It's basically just kind of like an empty house with wooden bunk beds.

177
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:05.880
You can lie your sleeping bag on and a kitchen.

178
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.210
So we get there and these two appellation hikers are staying there too and it's

179
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:13.590
just us and them guy and a girl.

180
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.150
The guy she says was maybe 23 brown hair, super blue eyes.

181
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.020
The other hiker,

182
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:22.860
she's a young girl doing it by herself and we're all talking late and we're in

183
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.480
this like little living room area.

184
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.600
And he kind of immediately jumps into the conversation and just starts like

185
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.490
taking it over with his life story,

186
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.080
which is that he thinks he's a prophet. Um, he has the gift of prophecy.

187
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:42.081
He also has the gift of extreme empathy where he can come into a room and he'll

188
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:47.280
be like deafened by all the thoughts he can hear and other people.

189
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.750
And I was kind of like, all right, we've got a nutter,

190
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:52.860
but I know what he's saying.

191
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.510
And she was like rolling her eyes and then he says,

192
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.490
oh, and you know, I prophesied the Virginia Tech shootings.

193
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.270
And it's like, oh, okay.

194
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.780
So then there's this silence and it's now like 10:30 PM and I don't know what

195
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.820
you say in that moment. I don't, you know,

196
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:19.200
like I think like in a way make him not feel crazy for that.

197
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.840
It's somehow in that moment, my instinct is like,

198
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.180
just don't rattle this guy maybe.

199
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.790
And then he says, uh, another time,

200
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.580
um, I was getting off from work,

201
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.170
I was walking home from the bus where that he was like,

202
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:36.630
worked as a chef or you cook it, you know, in a kitchen.

203
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.350
And he was walking home from the bus and he's really late and he said,

204
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:45.351
and an African American woman came up to me dressed in really like revealing

205
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:50.340
clothing and turned out she was a prostitute and she offered her services to me

206
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.590
and I said, no. And then blacked out.

207
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:57.880
And the next moment I came to and I had a knife around her throat.

208
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.523
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

209
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.590
<v 1>There's like this pause. And then</v>

210
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.300
<v 3>I remember just like my heart almost like pounding,</v>

211
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.630
not of nervousness. It was just like, but, but, but, but it just,

212
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.760
I couldn't let him go on this.

213
00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:18.080
Of course she just hurts attacking him.

214
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.550
I had to correct him. I think that's really irresponsible.

215
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.600
He pulled out a knife.

216
00:12:23.601 --> 00:12:28.200
He said he was done to do something and the fact that he just so cavalierly

217
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.250
<v 1>and I'm like staring at her clenching my teeth. Like, what the are you doing?</v>

218
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:35.350
Like this is don't behave this way,

219
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:38.060
but don't behave this way right now with this person. Please.

220
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.170
<v 3>No, you're wrong. Like if he didn't want to be corrected,</v>

221
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:43.130
he wouldn't have told that story. She said, [inaudible]

222
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.430
<v 1>you know, I think this isn't demonic possession. You need to like seek counsel.</v>

223
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.410
<v 3>You should confront it. You shouldn't talk with therapists at that moment.</v>

224
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.190
Lou says she reached down and hit record on her tape recorder figuring,

225
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:57.400
all right, if this guy snaps, we still have it on tape for the police.

226
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.220
You'll hear his voice in here, but we've concealed his identity and he's like,

227
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.720
Oh, what? I'm crazy because I have like influenced by other things.

228
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:07.000
And she said, you know, you never know the word schizophrenia.

229
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.330
I'm amazed that they've developed schizophrenia. Yeah, I know it's a big word,

230
00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:15.920
but it's a psychological issue. You do.

231
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.650
I do remember he was like, no. He's like, you're calling me schizophrenia. No.

232
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.680
So typically you would go to that and she is just like taking him to town and

233
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.550
they're fighting and I'm scared because then we'll all have

234
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.880
[inaudible] problem. We just kept arguing and I'm like, why?

235
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.600
What we trying to get from this guy to admit that I almost killed someone.

236
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.510
I almost killed someone, period.

237
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.150
That was me, but it wasn't. She was just like, but why are you telling us this?

238
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:46.670
You come out, you show us your journal, you tell us this story.

239
00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:48.440
We've known you for three seconds.

240
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:51.720
You clearly want to be judged and so I have to judge it.

241
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.770
Of your laws or the Bible, which seems to be what you rely on,

242
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:58.640
say to respect the laws of the land. How dare you take like a life,

243
00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:01.370
a human sacred life, you know, in your hands, you know,

244
00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:04.390
almost more than a black woman. That's scary to me.

245
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.000
And the fact that you won't confront that as that is even worse.

246
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.280
You almost did that. And she like,

247
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.280
<v 1>I don't know, I had this moment like suddenly</v>

248
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.910
<v 2>there you go. They just [inaudible]</v>

249
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.080
<v 3>Lulu says she's not sure why,</v>

250
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.930
<v 1>but it turned</v>

251
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.490
<v 2>even if it's still,</v>

252
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.800
<v 1>and I was like, I am so like</v>

253
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.230
proud to be associated with somebody like this. Like I am.

254
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.690
I would never do any of that.

255
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.200
And she just like knows how to stand up for things. Um,

256
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.520
and it turned for him too.

257
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.080
He kind of like over time slowly started backing down and even conceding,

258
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.420
I really might need help and I don't know how to get it.

259
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.920
And then she sort of softened and they were really having a conversation and

260
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:53.300
this thing inside him, like

261
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.600
a different him came out like not the weird, crazy person.

262
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.120
And I was just tolerantly accepting like I have a little being,

263
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.330
a real confused person came out and was talking to her, you know,

264
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.040
and everyone else kind of dropped away and,

265
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.730
and they like go out and share this cigarette on the porch and come back

266
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.130
literally like arm, like arms slung over each other. Okay.

267
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.510
<v 3>I think when you get to the bottom of something with someone,</v>

268
00:15:18.511 --> 00:15:21.180
you feel a kind of kinship. Right.

269
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.501
<v 1>You know,</v>

270
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.880
I don't know what they set out there and all I knew in the moment was like,

271
00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:28.670
I am so proud of her. I am so like proud to be with this person.

272
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.440
Like I realized that she has so much,

273
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.890
she just has so much more hope.

274
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:41.891
Like she is just raged by anyone who doesn't like live up to their potential.

275
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.510
Like I don't, it's like my little theory was like, oh,

276
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.250
we're all just selfish and we all kind of are assholes, but we're all,

277
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:52.400
you know, but be nice about it. And, and she like,

278
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.430
has this a true hope like that actually we could that actually like we're

279
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.980
capable of have better

280
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.720
<v 4>you [inaudible]</v>

281
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.470
<v 3>I,</v>

282
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.470
that's a really utopian reading of such a crappy pot part of my personality.

283
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.340
Seriously. Like you can't even give me that. Like,

284
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.910
is there really no part of you that sees what is so good about this?

285
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:29.590
The reason why I say it's Romanticizing is that it's actually, it's the kind of,

286
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.821
um, you know,

287
00:16:30.821 --> 00:16:35.200
it's like scratching at a scab or something and that's what I tend to do and

288
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:39.940
it's hurtful for the parties involved and it's, it's, it's alienating to me,

289
00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:42.610
right? Nobody wants to be around that person. Um,

290
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.120
but the change you create on the other side, I mean, it's change.

291
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:51.121
It's like my way of being maybe feels good in the moment and it enables stasis,

292
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.760
you know, but it also sustains, right.

293
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.010
<v 0>A relationship. Right. Let me ask you this. Have you had issues with</v>

294
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.210
<v 3>being cruel to friends and losing friends or something?</v>

295
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.170
And I'm just guessing based on what your, what you just said? Yeah. Yeah,

296
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.920
I think so. Um,

297
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.503
<v 4>yeah,</v>

298
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.690
<v 0>sue actually said that when she got home from the bike trip,</v>

299
00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:22.970
her roommates at the place where she was staying confronted her. Um,

300
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.460
we think you have an anger problem. So I just, I, I moved out.

301
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.340
There was a big blowout fight and then I moved up.

302
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.310
So the story leaves you with some questions,

303
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:39.660
like if you agree that people are messed up, like of course they are.

304
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:44.280
We all are. And what's the best way to heal people? I mean,

305
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:49.281
do you decide as Lulu does or did that you should approach world with kindness

306
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:52.350
and happiness no matter how the world greets you?

307
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.740
Or is that kind of giving up like a happy hopelessness?

308
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.440
So then do you put your foot down as suit did and say, no,

309
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:06.270
you are messed up. Don't be messed up.

310
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.620
Is that hope or just being mean? I

311
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:17.160
don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

312
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.400
I'm still confused. I'm still very confused.

313
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.010
Maybe I have it all wrong.

314
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.890
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

315
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.850
<v 0>thank you, Lulu. Thank you, sue. Thank you. Jad thank you.</v>

316
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.790
Big thanks to Damiano Marchetti we'll be right back.

317
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:53.890
