and if they make another one it's gonna

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
and if they make another one it's gonna
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.640
and if they make another one it's gonna
get into the silly territory like they

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650
get into the silly territory like they
 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.980
get into the silly territory like they
did in the 80s after rocky -

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990

you know that kind of maintained the

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970
you know that kind of maintained the
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.970
you know that kind of maintained the
storyline but then rocky 3 was kind of

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980
storyline but then rocky 3 was kind of
 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.830
storyline but then rocky 3 was kind of
sillier than rocky 4 was really silly

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840
sillier than rocky 4 was really silly
 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.900

and so I feel like it'd be a good idea

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910

for them to just leave it at this
 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.310
for them to just leave it at this
