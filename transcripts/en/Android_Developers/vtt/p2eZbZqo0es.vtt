00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.912
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:10.900
JONATHAN MCNULTY:
Trulia's mission

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.120
is to make it as
easy as possible

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.786
for you to find the
home of your dreams.

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.160
Trulia partners with MLSes
all across the United States

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.885
to bring in an immense amount of
data for available properties.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.620
LAUREN HIRASHIMA:
Trulia's goal, really,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.466
is to help you along in
your home search journey.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.840
JONATHAN MCNULTY: Trulia has
had a tremendous run so far.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.660
We actually see more than
half of our business now being

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060
done on mobile applications.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.220
So when we think about
products in the future,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.440
when we think about how can
we be serving our users,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.960
who are now really
engaging on mobile apps

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.240
more than anything
else, everything

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.810
we do is very much
mobile-centric.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.800
Android provides a lot
of flexibility for us

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.136
to embed new and creative
features for our users.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:43.510
LAUREN HIRASHIMA:
Android enabled

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.920
us to create a much
more stable app

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040
and also to be able to
iterate a lot quicker.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.490
Innovation is core
to Trulia's culture.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.025
And we love that innovation
is core to Google's culture

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:56.525
as well.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:57.983
JONATHAN MCNULTY:
Every quarter, we

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.502
have a week designated for
engineering product design

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:02.460
to really focus on what
they feel is important.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.126
We've seen our push
notification system.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.470
We've seen our mobile apps.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.250
We've seen a lot of the
products that you see live today

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.750
on the site come out of
our innovation weeks.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.666
LAUREN HIRASHIMA: So
after flipping the switch

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.560
on push notifications
on Android,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880
we saw an immediate impact.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.980
And after learning
and iterating,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370
we saw a 30% increase
in engagement.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.180
And engagement on
Android is two times that

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.540
of our other platforms.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090
At first, we saw a
number of complaints

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.340
come through when we were
sending too many notifications.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.010
So we quickly
iterated and realized

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.090
that there is the sweet spot
for the number of notifications

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.030
you should send to
your users a day.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.632
JONATHAN MCNULTY: We recently
launched nearby home alerts.

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:42.510
It actually uses a
geofencing technology

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.900
that Google's empowered us with.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.775
LAUREN HIRASHIMA: Say
you're walking your dog

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.770
and you walk near a new listing.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.830
You'll get an alert.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.530
You can actually get
the alert on your watch,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.840
see high-level details
about the property,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.420
scroll through a few pictures,
and call the agent or email

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.900
the agent directly
from the watch.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.660
Developing for Android
Wear was super easy.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.890
It took one engineer
a couple of weeks

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110
to have our app
live in Google Play.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.980
We see more leads coming
from our Android platform

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.390
than any other platform.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.960
We've been able to
partner with Google

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.090
on these new products
and new platforms

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.680
and deliver value
for both companies.
