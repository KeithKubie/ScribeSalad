00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.410
The first Earthlings sent into space were
brave, calm under pressure, and heroic.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.810
They were also not human and many of them
were furry.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.040
Yes, before Apollo 13, Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong,
and Yuri Gagarin, humans sent fruit flies,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.520
monkeys, and dogs into space to determine
if living beings could survive the trip.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.980
These tests helped prove that, given a certain
amount of precautions and protections, humans

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.730
could endure space flight.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.550
Here is the little told story of these mostly
cute and cuddly astronauts.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.870
The V-2 rocket developed by the Germans was
the first man-made object to reach the so-called

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.090
fringes of space.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.159
The first test flight of this massive rocket
was in May of 1944.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.909
When successful (at least, by standards of
the day), it was rushed into war.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.110
By August 1944, Nazi Germany was raining down
V-2 rockets onto the city of London.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.430
Upon the end of the war, the allied forces
were quite familiar with the potential of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.570
these V-2 rockets and scoured the world for
V-2 rocket parts, as well as German engineers

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.660
and scientists who knew how to build them.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.140
It became a competition between Britain, the
US, and the Soviet Union to see who could

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.290
develop their own, better, version of the
V-2 the quickest.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.960
As the Cold War heated up between the Soviets
and the Americas, it also became a matter

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.960
of national security.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.770
(See: How Did the Cold War Start and End?)

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.140
On February 20, 1947, a mere 22 months after
Germany’s surrender, the United States launched

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.300
a captured V-2 rocket with fruit flies aboard.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.820
These fruit flies were the first Earthly beings,
outside of microbes, in space.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.070
From its launch site in New Mexico, the rocket
traveled to an altitude of about 68 miles

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
(going past the Karman line) on a three minute,
ten second suborbital mission.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.490
The purpose of this test was to determine
the effects of high acceleration and cosmic

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.250
radiation exposure on living beings.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.720
When the scientists retrieved the rocket,
they found the fruit flies alive and well.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.390
Sixteen months later, in June of 1948, the
United States upped the ante by sending Albert,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.490
a rhesus monkey, on trip aboard a V-2 rocket.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.410
Nine pounds and anesthetized, he was placed
in the nose of the V-2, which only went to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.430
an altitude of 39 miles.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.970
Unfortunately, scientists and his human handlers
speculated that he died even before take-off,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330
having suffocated in the cramped capsule.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.420
Even if he was alive, the parachute mechanism
failed and the rocket had a violent crash

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.520
landing.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.840
At least the name “Albert” lived on because,
from that point on, the proceeding tests involving

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.720
monkeys in the United States were known as
the “Albert project.”

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
Almost exactly a year later, the US tried
again.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.459
They sent another rhesus monkey, appropriately
named Albert II, into the sky aboard a V-2.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.580
This time, they gave him more breathing room
with a less cramped space.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.951
Also anesthetized, he reached an altitude
of 83 miles, making him the first primate

00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:45.951
in space.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:49.400
While he was alive through about 99 percent
of the flight, he was killed upon impact when,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.040
once again, the parachute mechanism failed
to work properly.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.240
It was around this time that the Soviet Union
were planning the next evolution of “biological

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.630
objects” being sent into space.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.500
Under the utmost secrecy due to the fear of
spies, to the point that even many of the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.360
scientists working on the project didn’t
know exactly what was going on, the Soviets

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.930
were preparing to send dogs into the great
beyond.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.530
Called “future space scouts,” their reasoning
for selecting dogs was more practical and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770
cost-efficient than science-based.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.830
First of all, as stated later by Vladimir
Yazdovsky, the head of the biological program

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.200
for space research at the Institute for Aviation
Medicine in Moscow:

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.330
We selected dogs as biological objects because
their psychology is very well-studied, they

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.160
adapt well to training, are very communicative,
and social with people.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.520
Also, they were plentiful and cheap.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.670
Moscow was awash with stray dogs and finding
ones to meet the space program’s exact specifications

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.550
wasn’t particularly hard.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.950
The dogs had to be healthy, adults, between
thirteen and fifteen pounds, light coat color

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.530
(more easily seen in photos, which was a huge
part of the publicity), mixed-breed (for their

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.290
supposed “hardiness”), and female.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.750
(Female dogs’ anatomy made it easier for
the suit and “sanitation equipment” to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.100
be properly fitted.)

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.970
The dogs were trained for space travel by
being put in smaller and smaller crates, which

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.980
was an attempt to get them accustomed to the
restrictive space they would have to be in

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.250
during flight.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.379
They also had to get used to all the suits,
contraptions, and equipment they would be

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.489
wearing, including a cumbersome “sanitation
device.”

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.100
They were fed an energy gelatinous food, made
up of bread crumbs, powdered meat, and beef

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100
fat.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.710
Many of the dogs simply didn’t react well
to all of this and were not allowed to train.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.009
The ones that did had numerous health issues
later, including kidney failure and constipation.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.069
Dezik and TsyganIn 1951, the first two dogs
– Dezik and Tsygan (Russian for “Gypsy,”

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.569
see: Where Did the Gypsies Originally Come
From?) – were launched, reaching an altitude

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.300
of 62 miles.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.330
Upon coming back to Earth, the parachute deployed
correctly.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.029
When the scientists opened the hatch, they
were greeted by barking.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.159
Dezik and Tsygan had survived, becoming the
first living beings outside of flies successfully

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.349
recovered from a spaceflight.

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.699
The next week, Dezik was sent on another flight
with a dog named Lisa.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.610
All was fine until the parachute failed to
deploy.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.740
They were both killed.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.919
Upon learning about the accident, the head
of the Commission for the Investigation of

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.759
the Upper Atmosphere, Anatoli Blagonravov,
declared that Tsygan was going to be retired

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.990
from space flight and come home with him to
be his pet.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.039
After Dezik and Tsygan, the Soviets would
send many dogs into space over the next six

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.039
years.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.550
A few died due to mechanical failures, but
many survived.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.080
The scientists and engineers studied the dogs’
vital signs, their post-flight health checkups,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.129
and observed the massive amount of film taken
during the flights.

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.610
They learned that while the dogs got agitated,
disoriented, and perhaps a tad motion sick,

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.589
they were pretty much okay health-wise during
space flight.

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.750
This set the stage for Latka and her travels
aboard Sputnik 2.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.009
LaikaKudryavka or “Laika” which was Russian
for “barker,” initially wasn’t the best

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.150
candidate for the historic flight and the
designation of being the “most famous dog

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.249
in history.”

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.370
Another mutt named Albina was, but according
to the book Animals in Space: From Research

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.509
Rockets to the Space Shuttle, she just had
a litter of puppies and was everyone’s favorite.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.870
The scientists didn’t want to sacrifice
her for what was a suicide mission.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.830
Latka was highly sociable, patient, and scored
well under harsh circumstances.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.229
So she was chosen.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.650
Laika was put under intense training and preparation
leading up to her flight.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.740
She had electrodes inserted into her to detect
vital signs and heart activity.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.319
She was fitted for suits and held in preparation
crates.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.449
On October 4, 1957, about a month before Lika’s
launch, Sputnik I launched into the skies

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.289
and became the first artificial Earth satellite
in space.

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.289
This energized the Soviet people and when
Laika was first introduced via radio to the

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.729
population on October 27, 1957, she delightfully
barked into the microphone.

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.460
Posters, figurines, and even comic books were
quickly mocked up with Laika’s likeness.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.879
She was the most famous dog in history and
ready to go to space.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.969
Laika was kept in the capsule for three days
before she was launched.

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:38.969
During this time, her handlers were so concerned
about her that they had to beg the head engineer

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.219
to give her squirts of water to ensure she
survived until take-off.

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.490
Finally, on November 4th, she and Sputnik
2 was launched.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.289
Now, according to records at the time, Laika
was the first Earth-born living creature to

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.300
go into orbit.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.430
This may not be entirely truthful.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.849
According to reports that only came out in
2002, Laika may have perished about five hours

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.860
into the flight due to overheating (thermal
insulation failure) and possibly even stress

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.970
exacerbated by overheating.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.669
It is not known if she was even alive while
Sputnik 2 orbited.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.610
This was not made public knowledge at the
time, as the world’s newspapers carried

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.620
headlines much like this one from the New
York Times, “Soviet Fires New Satellite

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.620
Carrying Dog.”

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.349
In fact, as Sputnik orbited over the next
four days, Russian press releases kept referencing

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.289
Laika’s good condition.

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:30.520
Regardless of when she died, Laika was, controversially,
never meant to be recovered, and after 2,570

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.530
orbits, on April 14, 1958, Sputnik 2 broke
apart and disintegrated in the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.560
One of the scientists involved in Laika’s
mission, Oleg Gazenko, later stated of this,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.849
“Work with animals is a source of suffering
to all of us…

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.229
The more time passes, the more I’m sorry
about it.

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:47.340
We shouldn’t have done it…

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.349
We did not learn enough from this mission
to justify the death of the dog.”

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:53.349
Meanwhile, the Americans still had monkeys.

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:58.010
They kept sending different types of primates
into space throughout the 1950s, with most

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.699
of them resulting in fatalities.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:06.330
The most famous and successful of these experiments
was the May of 1959 launch of Abel, a rhesus

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.090
monkey, and Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.159
Their safe landing made them the first primates
to return safely to Earth after traveling

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.259
in space.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:18.599
Unfortunately, Abel died several days after
returning to Earth during a procedure to remove

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.009
the electrodes implanted in her body.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:25.129
After her death, she was prepared by a taxidermist
and her body is currently on display at the

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:30.339
Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum
strapped into the harness that took her into

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:31.339
space.

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:34.930
Miss Baker, on the other hand, lived another
twenty five years, mostly at the U.S. Space

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.680
and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.219
When she passed away in 1984, over three hundred
people attended her funeral service.

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:45.860
After the Soviet Union’s Yuri Gagarin became
the first human to orbit the Earth on April

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.340
12, 1961, there was much less of a need for
monkeys and dogs to strap on spacesuits.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.650
The age of manned space flight had dawned.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.470
Nonetheless, a chimpanzee, mice, a cat, bull
frogs, newts, spiders, and many other animals

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.770
have all been sent into space over the years
for various scientific reasons.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:07.050
But one should not forget that Earth’s first
headline space travelers were not humans,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.250
but fruit flies, monkeys, and dogs.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.810
The Karman Line, named after Hungarian-American
physicist Theodore von Karman, is the boundary

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:25.660
that exists 62 miles above sea level and is
generally accepted as the line between the

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:36.370
Earth’s atmosphere and outer space.
