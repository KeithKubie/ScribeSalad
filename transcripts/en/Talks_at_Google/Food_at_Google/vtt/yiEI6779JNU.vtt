00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.425
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:02.425 --> 00:00:05.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.390
Wow.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.990
So many accolades.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.520
I'm so excited that you're
both here to talk with me.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.440
First, I want to tell you all a
little bit about this cookbook,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.420
where Dana consulted with
just a total who's who

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.730
of chefs that would
intimidate anybody else,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.210
but this is in her wheelhouse.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.004
Thomas Keller, for example,
wrote the foreword of the book.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.110
She starts off by saying, "Good
cooking starts with honesty."

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.560
Around this statement, she
has a deep, dark secret

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.460
that inspired this
book, and I wondered

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.550
if you could tell
us a little bit

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.216
about your deep, dark
secret and how you

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:46.830
decided to bring this to light.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.490
DANA COWIN: So the
dark secret was

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.260
that, after being
at "Food and Wine"

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.530
and talking about food all the
time and being on "Top Chef"

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.230
and knowing about food,
I never told anyone

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680
that I actually didn't
know how to cook the food.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.660
I could talk about it, but
I couldn't actually cook it.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.660
That seemed like maybe
I should fix that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.320
after 20 years at
the magazine, and so

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.442
this idea emerged that I
could actually learn myself,

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:23.400
but then I could share
with other people, which

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.720
was the book part, because
I feel like the really

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.590
dumb mistakes that I
make all the time--

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.650
and I really do make
them all the time,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.190
and even after
having done the book,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.980
I still make them in new
ways-- but those mistakes

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.290
that I make other people
make, too, so if I could

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.000
get the greatest
talents in the world

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.940
to tell me how to
fix the mistakes,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.030
than I could spare an
entire universe of humans

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.502
from making the same mistakes.

00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:51.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I want
to hear about the pseudonym

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.890
that you used to have and what
really pushed you over the edge

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.860
and brought you into the light.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.890
It seems like mistakes
have been something

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.540
that you've learned
from all along,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.320
but you really
wanted to go public.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.000
DANA COWIN: I actually come from
a long line of mistake makers

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.150
and also a long
line of non-cooks.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.190
My mother is actually the
original mistake maker

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.106
and original non-cook.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.670
She would walk into an
immobile object in the street

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.877
and say, "excuse me," and
be looking for her glasses

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:31.710
and never find them.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.770
In any case, they were
on the top of her head.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.660
At the magazine, it didn't
seem like the wisest thing

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.910
to share with
people that I didn't

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.450
know how to cook
before I'd really

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.920
established my reputation.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.300
So every weekend, I would cook
at home, come to the magazine,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.080
and I would share
with the test kitchen

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.975
the mistakes I had made, and
they would try to help me,

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.600
and I decided it would be a good
column for the magazine, which

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.766
is what you're referring to.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.920
And so under a
pseudonym, I did a column

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.110
where I made the mistakes
and our executive food editor

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.770
corrected them, and the
nickname Irma Rombauer

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.842
because, of course, she's one of
the greatest cooks of all time.

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:15.300
It was a little
inside joke with me

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.470
that I don't think
anybody else really got,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.390
but I found it
quite entertaining.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.910
That was a good,
solid 10 years ago,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.190
but in the intervening 10
years, I became more confident

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.110
and I decided that
chefs like Jonathan,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.220
if he found out that I
didn't know how to cook,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.390
he would not think less of me.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.962
And the readers, I decided,
they liked the magazine enough

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.420
that if they found that the
editor didn't know how to cook,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.290
they would not think
less of the magazine.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.290
And so I came to the conclusion
that it was OK to share.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.880
And more than that,
I actually believe

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.630
in a philosophy of talking about
mistakes because if you don't

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.620
talk about them,
you can't fix them,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.470
and if you don't fix
them, then you're

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.400
just sent into a life of mistake
making and not improving.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.400
So I thought philosophically,
it was a good thing,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.040
as well as for anyone I was
feeding, it was a good thing.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.414
FEMALE SPEAKER: So nobody was
surprised at these confessions?

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:12.830
DANA COWIN: No one
at the magazine

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.670
was surprised
because they'd lived

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.730
through every painful minute
with me, mostly Monday

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.155
mornings, but the world at large
actually was quite surprised.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.350
I took calls from lots
and lots of people saying,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.730
I don't believe you.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.195
I was like, read the book,
because each of the head

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.430
notes for the recipes is about
the really stupid mistake

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.240
that I made and
then how I fixed it.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.691
I failed in so many ways.

00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:43.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: And what
was Jonathan's reaction

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.350
when you approached him
for his contribution?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.190
DANA COWIN: Jonathan said, I'm
sure you're better than you

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.870
think, which was very nice.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Were
you just being nice?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.810
JONATHAN WAXMAN: You know, I
have an incredible respect.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.540
Listen, 20 years, Dana has
been editor of "Food and Wine"

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.690
magazine.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.930
That's a huge
accomplishment, and when

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.340
she says I couldn't
cook, I think

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.080
she's really being a
little overly modest here.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.350
And I think that
what she really is

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.700
saying that she wasn't an
accomplished chef or cook,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.060
and that's what she's
really talking about.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.160
The whole thing about
mistakes I think

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.770
is the key that binds
everything together

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.160
because I am the biggest
believer in mistakes as a tool

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.410
to get better.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.640
In our society, we have
two ways of mistakes.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.970
We could beat the
crap out of people

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.530
or we could encourage them,
and you could go either road.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.680
I think when you encourage
people, then magic happens.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.119
The other road is
the road to nowhere.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:48.660
DANA COWIN: I will say that when
Jonathan and I were cooking,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.360
we were in the studio together.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.230
And the first thing I
did, I picked up the knife

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.560
and Jonathan was like, that's
not how you pick up a knife.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.644
So though he says I didn't make
mistakes, my very first action,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.060
he was like, that's
how you do it.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.518
JONATHAN WAXMAN: No, I didn't
say you didn't make mistakes,

00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:08.035
but you weren't an
accomplished cook.

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.160
DANA COWIN: I cooked a lot.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.785
Let's say that.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:11.960
So I picked up the knife
and he corrected me,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.880
and then he looked in this pan.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.520
We were making a
gravy, and he came in

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.027
after a number of the things
had been sauteed already.

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:21.610
And this was a recipe
that had already

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.470
been tested in the
kitchen at "Food and Wine"

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.320
and we felt very good about
it, and Jonathan was like,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.370
do you have another set
of all those ingredients,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.540
because I think we
could start again?

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.410
And we did it, and
it was fantastic.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.094
I mean, you made
it so much better.

00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:37.760
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
it's a little bit

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.450
that Malcolm Gladwell thing
about you do it, in my case,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.650
for 40 years, you
do the same recipe

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.820
but you change in such a finite
or infinitesimally small way,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.780
but you get to a different
result, and a good day

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.830
and a bad day.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.610
If it rains or it snows
or the sun is out,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.640
your recipe is different.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: So Dana
give a compliment to you

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.262
when she emailed
me the other day,

00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:07.470
and she said that you're
one of the best people she'd

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.740
worked with as a
professional chef,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.030
being able to teach these
skills to a home cook.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.010
Was there a disconnect
for you, coming

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.077
from the realm of so much
expertise and experience,

00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:20.410
trying to break it down to
an elemental thing for a home

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.680
cook?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.846
Was there a challenge there?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.850
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I've actually
done a lot of teaching.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.860
In fact, I started first
teaching back in 1979

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.090
with Wolfgang Puck.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.590
He was a chef of a
restaurant called

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.377
Ma Maison, a famous
place in Beverly Hills,

00:07:38.377 --> 00:07:39.960
and he started a
cooking school called

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.010
Ma Cuisine with the
wonderful Judy Gethers.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.550
And they invited me to
be one of the teachers,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.740
and I had no clue how to do it.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.450
So I had Beverly Hills
housewives with giant rings

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.720
on their fingers, and that was
an amazing experience for me.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.090
It really was.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.040
In a lot of ways, it
taught me more about myself

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.290
than I really taught other
people, because I didn't

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.850
go to school to become a teacher
but I had to learn on the job,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.030
so I had to fake it.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.130
I had to fake the knowledge
that I could actually

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.560
teach people what I
did, but teach them

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.920
as a home cook versus a chef.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.640
And I think there's
a big dichotomy here

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.920
because people say "cook"
and they say "chef,"

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.300
and there's a big difference.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.550
There's a gigantic difference.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.150
In fact, to be called
a chef, especially

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.950
in a place that reveres chefs,
like France or someplace else,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.309
it's a whole different thing.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.450
To become a chef is
really a hard road,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.880
and a cook is a different game.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.780
But I always think that I'd
rather eat in someone's home

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.120
with a great home cooked meal
than eat in a restaurant.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.010
DANA COWIN: Always?

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.980
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Always, always
because it's so much more

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.182
comfortable.

00:08:58.182 --> 00:08:59.840
It's so much more relaxed.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.673
DANA COWIN: But it's
only about the comfort?

00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:02.770
It's not about the food?

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.080
JONATHAN WAXMAN: And the food.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.170
There's nothing better.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.060
Every summer, I go to France.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.560
I go to this amazing
place in France

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.601
and the kids go to the
garden and they grab stuff

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:12.600
and they cook with me.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.516
That's the greatest thing
in the world for me.

00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:16.334
I'd rather do that
than anything.

00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:18.500
DANA COWIN: Even than cooking
with me in the studio?

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.450
JONATHAN WAXMAN: That
was a lot of fun, Dana.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: Tell us about
your process when you were.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.030
You're on the spot being called
out for mistakes pretty much

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.780
from the get go.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.180
What was the process
like, and how did you

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.250
hone in on the high yum
factor that you talk about?

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.860
DANA COWIN: Well, the
truth is we did start over.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.790
We did have a second
set of ingredients

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.850
so that we could
begin the gravy again,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.850
and the phenomenal thing
was that Jonathan showed me

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.870
that within-- was it
a 14 minute gravy?

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.380
Within 15 minutes, not
starting with the stock,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.530
because among my
many mistakes, I

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.550
can never get a
chicken or a turkey

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.950
to yield enough juice
to make a gravy,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.640
so I have to make
a juiceless gravy,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.190
and that's what we
were making together.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.720
But one of the reasons he's
such a great chef/cook/teacher

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.010
is that we started with these
ingredients and he just, very

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.200
slowly and gently, showed
how to get flavor out

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.290
of each one of
these ingredients.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.310
It was bacon, of course.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.630
He also started with
olive oil in the pan.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.580
I'm like, but there's
bacon going into it.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.731
There's fat in the bacon.

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.980
These things that I felt
like I had learned from chefs

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.170
all along the way, like
why would you start

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.630
with fat if you're adding fat?

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.770
He's like, don't worry.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.567
It's really good.

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:43.150
And it was finished
with butter, so it

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.030
had three fats, which of course
is why it was so delicious.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.290
So we cooked side by side.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.430
I sort of poked at things
and Jonathan really cooked.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you called
him the zen master of birds.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.290
Was there anything that you
learned, aside from the recipe

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.184
and aside from what's in the
book, about just his mindset?

00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:09.600
DANA COWIN: Well,
I think that one

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.530
of the great things
about Jonathan

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.980
is that-- I'm sorry to
say you take the easy way.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.980
A lot of chefs, when I cooked
side by side with them,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.560
they made whatever simple
thing I was doing so much more

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.780
complicated.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.420
I wanted to roast vegetables
with April Bloomfield,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.400
and I thought you would
chop the vegetables

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.983
and you'd put them on the tray,
and then you would roast them,

00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:31.020
but that's not what a chef does.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.000
A chef blanches them,
and then they saute them,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.700
and then they put
them in the oven,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:42.090
and then-- there's 10 steps, and
Jonathan exactly the opposite.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.080
He took the idea of the
turkey, where people

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.560
have so many thoughts about
turkey, and I loved you said,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.490
everyone from an expert
to your son has said,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.290
you need to brine the turkey.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.030
And he's like, no, you don't.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.580
Nothing.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.440
It's like, it's salt
and pepper here, people.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.950
And I had an incredible problem
turning this gigantic bird

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.640
upside down.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.610
I tore the skin.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.150
It was a mess.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:16.110
I had it on this large implement
so I could turn it over

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.560
and it was spinning.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.360
It was not a pretty
sight, and Jonathan was

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.802
like, why are you doing that?

00:12:21.802 --> 00:12:26.335
You just leave the
turkey sitting up.

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:26.960
That was great.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.090
Also never tent.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.480
He said, tents are
only for camping.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.870
Why would you tent your bird?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.310
Every single thing that
you thought you knew,

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.270
he had some incredibly
funny quip for.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.100
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
you know, listen.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.594
You mentioned this whole
thing about California.

00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:48.260
I was talking to
somebody the other day.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.200
He said, I used to go horseback
riding in Napa Valley,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.690
and the cowboys that would
wrangle the horses with us

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.300
used to cook.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.570
They would take steaks and
they'd put mustard and salt

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.160
and throw them in the flames.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.400
And I was 12 years
old and I go, what?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.780
What are you guys doing?

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.220
And it was the most delicious
thing that I've ever

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.160
eaten in my life.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.980
So it really stuck with
me that sometimes simpler

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.870
is always better.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.050
It's not always better, but
it's served me pretty well.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.940
It's not something that
I think is for everybody.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.180
Some people like complicated.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.410
Some people like
to do that 25 steps

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.550
to paradise kind of thing.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.560
I think two steps to paradise.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.160
I'm a little impatient, I guess.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.020
I do this chicken at
Barbuto that everyone

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.580
wants to know how I do
it, and they're always

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.400
flabbergasted when I say
it's a good chicken and salt

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.885
and pepper.

00:13:44.885 --> 00:13:46.510
And they say, well,
what else is there?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.320
What's the magic?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.560
And I said, the oven.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.830
And then, of course, there
is one tool that you need,

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.449
which is a spoon, and you've
got to baste the chicken.

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:00.490
And they're, no, come on.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.920
Tell me the real story.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.830
You brine them.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.930
You talk to them in Mandarin.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.950
What do you do?

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.814
You inject them with soy.

00:14:10.814 --> 00:14:11.480
You put truffle.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.860
I said, no, you
don't do anything.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.050
I think that people
just get so complicated.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.740
That chicken is a
beautiful thing.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.400
Why do you want to mess with it?

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.610
It's so gorgeous.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.880
It needs a little salt,
needs a little pepper,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.040
it needs some love, and
it needs to get basted.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.694
DANA COWIN: It's all
about the basting.

00:14:31.694 --> 00:14:34.110
I think it really is all about
the basting, though, right,

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.410
and that takes some patience.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.240
When Jonathan told
me for the turkey,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.520
I had to keep opening the
oven and basting this bird,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.569
I'm like, do I really?

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:42.610
That's more than I want--

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.550
JONATHAN WAXMAN: It
was so much easier

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.832
than flipping that bird over.

00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:45.320
DANA COWIN: I was going to
say I think I would actually

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.420
rather flip it than baste,
but he insisted on basting.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.420
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
there is something, Dana,

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.690
that people have to really
look into themselves.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.290
People are scared of
ovens and the heat.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.040
We all are because we don't
want to kill ourselves.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.007
We don't want to die.

00:15:00.007 --> 00:15:02.090
We get near them, we don't
want to burn ourselves.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.930
We've all been burnt
by an oven, everybody

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.430
has, so once bitten, twice shy.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.460
And I think that's
the fear factor,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.150
as you become an
accomplished cook,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.050
is to learn to love your oven.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: Dana, did you
learn to love your oven yet?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.430
DANA COWIN: My oven
doesn't love me.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.880
Something that I learned
from so many of the chefs,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.340
and particularly Thomas
Keller was talking about this.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.280
The temperature in your oven
is probably not reflected

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.470
in your dial, I mean, assuming
that it's not an electric oven.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.580
You actually never know what the
real temperature of your oven

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.840
is, so you need to get an
oven thermometer that's

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.610
really reliable.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.060
So I have oven thermometers
but they're not reliable,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.050
and then the oven, my back left
part of the oven is very hot

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.510
and the front right is
a 20 degree difference.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.290
And then if you
open the oven door,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.380
I think he said you
lose 20 degrees of heat

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.910
when you've opened
it and closed it.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.260
So no, my oven does not love
me and I do not love it.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.420
I actually do mostly
stovetop cooking.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Maybe
it's misunderstood.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.716
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
But also, I think

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:14.980
people are afraid to saute.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.064
The one thing when I was in
France and somebody said to me,

00:16:18.064 --> 00:16:19.730
do you know what the
word "saute" meant?

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.760
I said, well yeah, to
fry something in a pan.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.640
They said, no the word
"saute" means to jump.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.780
And it was such a visually
important cue for me

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.080
to realize that sauteing was
not what I thought it was.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.730
And so for young cooks
and people at home,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.430
I always say that
you have to learn

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.150
the difference in pan cooking
and there's many nuances of it.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.950
And those gradations
from simmering

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.620
to sauteing to braising,
all those different things,

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.690
are so important to what I
call the lexicon of cooking.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.940
It's difficult sometimes
but people are, again,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.670
afraid of flame.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.710
That's why electric stovetops
have become so popular

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.970
because there's no flame.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.150
I love electric stovetops.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.329
You take a sponge, you wipe
them off, they're clean,

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.530
but they're also very
difficult to gauge temperature.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.879
So to get precision-- and
I think of Thomas Keller,

00:17:10.879 --> 00:17:11.920
who does owe me his life.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.221
That's another story.

00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.470
DANA COWIN: That's a good one.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.510
JONATHAN WAXMAN: --is a
great master of precision.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.250
And precision started
with pastry chefs.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.910
Pastry chefs cannot live
unless they do it precisely.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.310
My pastry chef does things.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.040
It's 6 and 7/8 cups of flour.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.680
I said, why not
just make it seven?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.000
She gives me that look
like you're an idiot.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.880
That's because
that's what it is,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.050
because she knows that extra
scant one eighth of a cup

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.150
makes the magic happen.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.200
So I think it's
confidence and learning

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.270
how to saute, learning
how to not flip

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.570
the turkey in the
oven, and then learn

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.950
the gradations of cooking,
and those are the fun things.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: But is it
about precision necessarily?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.720
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I'm the least
precise cook that I know.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.386
DANA COWIN: That must
be why I like you.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.030
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Because
I got in this business

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.730
after a being musician,
and when I was a musician,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.890
the most important thing
in life was improvisation.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.310
And I think that the key to
becoming a great cook or chef,

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.240
whatever you want to
call us, is learning

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.450
how to improvise,
but not improvise

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.790
so that you're playing "Stairway
to Heaven" as loud as you can.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:35.330
It's learning how to
be subtle and beautiful

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.834
and respect the ingredients.

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you tell
me more about the ingredients

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.780
piece, because I
feel like when you're

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.330
talking about the simplicity,
the quality of the ingredients

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.720
is just the key to all of that?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.660
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
I think that most people

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.790
think that food comes in a box.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.890
You go to the supermarket and
it's in a box in a plastic bag.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.045
I think with, thankfully,
what "Food and Wine" has

00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:02.280
been doing lately,
and other magazines,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.390
and other people the food world
are discovering the farmer.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.060
And the farmer and the
fisherman and the people

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.010
that produce what we do are,
to me, the most important parts

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.950
of the whole puzzle.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.640
I love this thing
about McDonald's saying

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.670
they're not going
to use antibiotics

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.620
in their antibiotic
laden chickens

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.000
anymore within the
next two years.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.227
Why does it take them two years?

00:19:29.227 --> 00:19:31.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't want
to know the answer to that.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.560
JONATHAN WAXMAN: We all
know the answer to that.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.170
But I think that if we
respect those farmers

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.560
and we revere them more,
I think the world might

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.432
change a little bit.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:46.420
I always think I'm a custodian
for what those people produce.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.230
I grew up on a farm.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.330
I hated being on the farm.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.949
The smell was disgusting.

00:19:53.949 --> 00:19:54.740
I hated fertilizer.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.690
My grandmother used to
make me polish eggs.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.710
Why do you polish an egg?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.640
DANA COWIN: Why do
you polish an egg?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.624
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
It's a long story.

00:20:02.624 --> 00:20:04.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Were you
in trouble, Jonathan?

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.248
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I
was always in trouble.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.380
You go the farmer's market and
you see that perfect zucchini,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.910
it's like an emerald,
and an emerald

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.180
needs to be taken
care of and loved.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.430
I always do this stupid thing.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.180
Dana laughs at me.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.714
I always think the
vegetables talk to me.

00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:27.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: But she
said that Alice Waters

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.460
was the vegetable whisperer.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.012
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well, she is.

00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:32.230
Who did I learn from?

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.820
DANA COWIN: Jonathan
was right there.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.160
Although I have a
totally new passion.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.160
Did you hear about this?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.860
JONATHAN WAXMAN: No.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.290
DANA COWIN: So
Jonathan just outlined,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.480
at the farmer's market,
the emerald zucchini,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.230
and I'm going to
make a plea right

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:56.490
here for the dinged,
misshapen zucchini

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.360
because what's happened
with the farmers,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.820
because not just people like
Jonathan, but because America

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.480
wants all of their
vegetables to be

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.360
straight and perfect
and of a certain size

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.540
and of a certain
color, there's 20% food

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.840
waste in just vegetables
and produce in America.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.830
So these poor farmers that
we revere, both of us,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.410
they toss it out because
they don't have the money

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.150
to have it trucked
away to someplace else

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.900
and they don't have the
time and the equipment

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.490
to turn that food
into something else,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.660
because you could
make tomato sauce.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.540
You could make minestrone.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.706
There's things you could do.

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:39.350
But if you have
this gigantic farm.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.350
So I'm now-- I just
launched this Saturday--

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:50.580
launching a campaign
called Love Ugly Food.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.850
And it's an amazing thing
because if we can all

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.950
embrace ugly food, we could
actually help feed the world

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.150
and reduce food waste.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.950
So I'm so glad you brought that
up because I love the emerald,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.981
and it needs love,
but the unloved ones,

00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:07.730
they need even more
love and they're going

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.820
to do even more for the world.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.050
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's revolutionary.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.080
DANA COWIN: It is.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.580
And I joined a movement.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.220
It's like my eyes
just popped open

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.090
but there's a lot
of people who've

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.548
been working on food waste and
ugly vegetables for a really

00:22:18.548 --> 00:22:20.721
long time, so credit to them.

00:22:20.721 --> 00:22:22.095
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's wonderful.

00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:22.885
Bravo.

00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:25.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.610
So on this
revolutionary theme, I

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.170
was really intrigued by
you talk about the personal

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.170
transformation beyond cooking,
beyond the kitchen, that

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.070
came out of creating this
book, and I thought maybe

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.770
that would be a good thing
to talk about to wrap up.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:44.520
DANA COWIN: Great.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.700
So I thought that I was
going to go in the kitchen

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.450
and learn to cook.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.020
And as it turns out, my cooking
is still somewhat problematic,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.150
but what I did learn, because
I had to codify my mistakes,

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.920
was that the thing
that I really lacked

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:04.060
was the ability to
focus, and that indeed,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.210
if I could focus
and be completely

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.980
present in the kitchen and not
be thinking about something

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.200
I had to do for work or
be looking at my email

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.810
all the time or trying
to do 10 things at once,

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.490
I actually was a
far better cook.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.660
And I'd be a much
better human being

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.510
because, in fact, that lesson
that you learn in the kitchen

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.620
was that you have
to be present, you

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.100
have to show love, which is
what you're talking about,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.250
and you have to focus.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.840
That's a much
bigger life lesson.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.120
Sometimes maybe I don't
hold the knife right,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.960
but the bigger thing was I ran
out of the room to do something

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.750
and that's when the
vegetables burned.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:56.462
So staying focused was a
really important life skill,

00:23:56.462 --> 00:23:57.170
and also honesty.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:02.150
So those two things of admitting
that I was making mistakes

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.602
and saying I can get better
at this, because I'd never

00:24:04.602 --> 00:24:05.310
really done that.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.740
I made all the mistakes
and I ignored them.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.670
I fed a lot of people,
no one was poisoned,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.600
people were happy,
they were fun parties,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.090
but I was never getting better.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.820
So the honesty leading to
my life improving, and then

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.377
the focus, Those two things.

00:24:18.377 --> 00:24:19.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.592
And did you come away
with any big learnings?

00:24:21.592 --> 00:24:23.550
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
I love the whole process

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.950
because the whole
mistake thing, I think,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.060
led to what
everybody's afraid of.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.570
Most home cooks cook the
same thing all the time.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.370
It's the comfort zone.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.210
And I think part of my job is to
get people out of their comfort

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.482
zone, and when you
become uncomfortable

00:24:40.482 --> 00:24:42.565
and you realize that you're
cooking the same thing

00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:45.640
and people are getting
bored through the same dish

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.870
you made every time, that
if you all of a sudden break

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.945
open a cookbook
and find something.

00:24:51.945 --> 00:24:54.070
I always say to people,
don't look at the cookbook.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.310
Go to the market first and
shop and then come back

00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.130
and find a recipe that
matches what you bought.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.760
And then try
something new, I think

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.230
that is what we need as human
beings to really develop

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.910
because change is inevitable.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.270
It can be good, it can be
bad, it can be otherwise,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.400
but is inevitable.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.310
When I started cooking, it
was all about French, Chinese,

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.810
and Italian food.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.370
That was it.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.380
And now the whole world
has come to our table,

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.640
and I think that's the
most amazing thing.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.270
So you can have a little
bit of spices from India,

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.370
you could have a
technique from Portugal,

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.080
you could have vegetables grown.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.490
It's a brave new world,
and I love that part of it.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.680
DANA COWIN: Actually, is anyone
familiar with Dave Chang,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.380
the Momofuku empire?

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:51.220
He has a restaurant called
Ko, which is a tasting menu,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.140
and last night, he
did this agnolotti

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.340
that was stuffed with
a celery root puree.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.220
So the celery root
puree was very French,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:08.880
the agnolotti very Italian,
and then he had a curry sauce.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.060
It was so brilliant.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.390
I would never put
those things together.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:19.270
He had shavings of fresh celery
and then scraps of truffle,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:19.960
and a foam.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.420
And I was like, this
is the whole new world.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:29.790
The pasta was perfect and the
spice knocked your head around.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.975
It's a very exciting time
to be eating and cooking.

00:26:32.975 --> 00:26:34.350
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's wonderful,

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.030
and I'm glad that lunch time is
almost here because now we're

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.370
all hungry.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.930
So I thought we should leave a
little time for Q&amp;A if people

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.230
want to ask questions.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.400
We have two microphones on
either side of the room,

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.277
and I know that there's
some foodies in here

00:26:48.277 --> 00:26:49.110
with some questions.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.960
AUDIENCE: How do you think
celebrity has affected you

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.290
as a chef in both negative
and positive lights?

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.820
What have been the costs
and benefits of encountering

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.299
celebrity as a chef?

00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:07.840
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well, when I
was in a theater on 14th Street

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.625
with my son, I was
peeing at the urinal,

00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:13.540
and a guy taps me on
the shoulder and goes,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.880
you're Johnson Waxman.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.000
My son looks at me with a
horrific look on his face,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.440
so that's the bad side of it.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.070
Somebody was talking
about because you're on TV

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.140
and the TV is in
everybody's room,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.870
you become part of the
family, and I like that part.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.090
And I always felt that I had
a responsibility to myself

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.220
to show myself in the light
of who I hopefully was,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.620
but I had no clue who I
was going to be on TV.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.570
That just happened, and I think
that's a crazy, weird thing.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.070
But as far as the
rest of the world,

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.390
I think my industry
needs great people,

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:58.375
and if television can entice
wonderful individuals to want

00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:02.030
to cook, that's a great thing.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.030
But Bobby Flay worked
for me for five years.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.530
I beat the crap out
of him all the time.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:13.480
He was humble the whole time,
and look where he is now.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.960
So I think that Bobby's base
was really being a cook.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.902
His celebrity as
being a celebrity chef

00:28:21.902 --> 00:28:24.110
is something different, but
they're really connected.

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:29.600
AUDIENCE: I was interested
at the beginning

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.450
to hear that both of
you have some background

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.280
with charitable works
that are related to food,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.020
and since growing and
preparing and distributing food

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.630
is one of the most
nurturing things

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.600
that you can do, can you tell us
a little about how you decided

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.770
to give back and
what you're doing,

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.380
and perhaps ways that we
could contribute or find out

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.670
more about what you work on?

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.760
DANA COWIN: That's
an awesome question.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.530
One of the really great things
about being involved in food

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.200
is there's so many
ways to give back.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.930
I'm involved in
City Harvest, and we

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.100
have a Healthy
Neighborhoods initiative

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.430
that is extraordinary
that you can take part in.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:11.790
You can go and help give
vegetables or sell vegetables

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:17.280
to those in need, and there's
others volunteer opportunities

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.180
at City Harvest.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.540
And then at Hot Bread Kitchen,
which is a training program,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.150
there aren't necessarily
actions that you

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.490
can take, like go make bread
with these amazing immigrant,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.030
mostly women, but in
supporting their work

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.150
is extraordinary because
it helps change lives.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.140
So it's not only
feeding people, but it's

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.885
helping train them to
have a better life.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.202
I just recently relocated from
San Francisco to New York.

00:29:49.202 --> 00:29:50.535
I had to downsize significantly.

00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:53.360
I live in West Village in
a shoebox, essentially.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.600
You guys spoke about
home cooks experimenting.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.180
That's something I'd love
to you as an avid cooker,

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.320
but I don't really have the
space to have a lot of tools

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.520
to experiment with.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.324
So if I have an oven
and a drawer of storage,

00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:07.740
what would you guys say are
the essentials that every home

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.190
cook should have
in their kitchen

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.640
if they are really limited
on space so they can still

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.820
experiment with food?

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.220
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I
love that question.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.080
Mary Sue Milliken
and Susan Feniger

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.170
had a restaurant in
LA many years ago,

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.060
I think 25, 30
years ago, and they

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:28.600
had a hot plate and a toaster
oven, and that was it.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.470
DANA COWIN: I had one of
the magnificent failures.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.380
I was cooking for my mentors,
the people who had given me

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.645
my start in magazines, so
two really big editors,

00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:43.020
and I was making
dinner for them.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.240
I took really good care of
the design of the table,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.480
and I had chalkboards,
and it was cute,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.934
but my stove wasn't
working because I

00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:54.350
didn't plug it in
because I really

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.720
liked style more than design.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.850
It was a '50s stove
that I had taken out

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.424
of a friend of mine's
grandmother's apartment.

00:31:00.424 --> 00:31:01.090
It looked great.

00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:10.817
I had a microwave, and I
tried to microwave poussin.

00:31:10.817 --> 00:31:11.900
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Bad idea.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.520
DANA COWIN: That was bad.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.990
I also had two hot plates,
and so I made pasta,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.850
just going on the fly.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.410
But you're going to tell
her she means a saute pan

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.540
and she needs a chef's knife.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.810
JONATHAN WAXMAN: The thing
is you need one pan to saute,

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:34.180
you need one pot, you need
a little paring knife,

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.640
you need an eight inch
or ten inch chef's knife,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.242
and you need what we call
a French fish spatula.

00:31:41.242 --> 00:31:42.700
DANA COWIN: How
about a microplane?

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.450
JONATHAN WAXMAN: That
will save your life.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.900
I do love microplanes
although I've

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.290
shaved my finger so many
times on those stupid things.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.446
But the most
important thing is--

00:31:52.446 --> 00:31:54.320
and I really believe
this-- that you actually

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:54.750
have a refrigerator.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.775
Do you have a refrigerator?

00:31:55.775 --> 00:31:57.000
AUDIENCE: I have a refrigerator.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.860
JONATHAN WAXMAN: And is it cold?

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.370
AUDIENCE: It's very cold.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.924
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
Then you're all set.

00:32:00.924 --> 00:32:01.674
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:32:01.674 --> 00:32:02.890
Thank you.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.500
AUDIENCE: Question for Jonathan.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.990
You mentioned that one
of your famous chickens,

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.990
that you baste but there's
a lot of other things

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.930
that you don't do that
are just unnecessary,

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.970
like you don't tent, you
don't brine and stuff.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.170
Did you determine all of that
experimentally over many years?

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.160
How would one know,
as far as other dishes

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.710
go, that basting is the thing
to do but the other ones are

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.825
worthless?

00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:24.200
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
Unfortunately, I

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.949
think there's going
to be a dead chicken's

00:32:25.949 --> 00:32:28.830
head on my gravestone.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.830
I feel sadly for
all those chickens

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.890
that I've cooked over the years.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.940
But I think that what was
the most important thing

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.050
was I was talking with someone
about-- this sounds weird,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.770
but subcutaneous fat.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:43.610
What is that?

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.970
It's the fat underneath
the skin of the chicken.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.390
So when you go to
the supermarket,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.540
some of the chickens
look really pretty

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.180
but you've got to check out
what their fat content is,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.190
and you look right around
the bottom of the chicken.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.990
If they have good
fat content and you

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.690
see that beautiful fat content--
but it's hard these days

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.481
because they're in
plastic bags, but if you

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:04.480
go to a real butcher,
they'll show it to you.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.720
Not all chickens are equal.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.950
That's number one.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.790
Number two is that
because I've grilled them,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.630
I've roasted them, I've sauteed
them, I've poached them.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.460
They're all great
ways of doing it,

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.700
but I found that-- this is
a little crazy-- at Barbuto,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.230
we grill them and
then roast them.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.182
DANA COWIN: See?

00:33:24.182 --> 00:33:26.140
JONATHAN WAXMAN: But the
only reason we do that

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.681
is because we don't
have enough space

00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:29.160
to do them all in the oven.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.050
My restaurant
Adele's in Nashville,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.450
we just roast them because
I have this beautiful wood

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.300
burning oven.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.590
But it's really the basting.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.750
I have a guy that's worked
for me for 15 years,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.920
and he's the only one
that gets it perfectly.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.370
I say, I want to do a video
and show-- his name is Luis.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.850
He used to be a
dishwasher for me,

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.570
and now he's a
magician at the grill.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.330
But when he does those
chickens, you watch him baste,

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.660
your mouth just drops open.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.420
He does it three times.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.300
He bastes it three
times and that's it.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.060
DANA COWIN: But were
you asking in general?

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.790
Do you consider yourself an
experimentalist in cooking?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.331
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
Oh, experimentalist.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.210
I go back to the
improvisation thing.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.889
My wife and I have a routine.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:22.670
She goes to the farmer's
market and she shops.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.110
I don't tell her what to buy.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.670
She just buys
whatever she wants.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.690
Then she leaves the kitchen.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.730
And we have all the stuff
out, and then I make a mess

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.170
and she won't let me
clean up, and then

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.159
we sit down and
have a family meal.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.449
And I love when I've got
everything around me,

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.960
looking at stuff, and
then you start thinking

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.750
about how to do things.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.929
I make mistakes all the time.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.320
I'll roast something off
and I'll taste it and I say,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.787
this is terrible.

00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:50.870
And then I have to figure
out either how to fix it

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.650
or you know where it goes.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:59.190
And you have to have the ego to
tell yourself, this isn't good.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.430
I remember when Alice Waters
went up to me and she said,

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.075
honey, did you
actually taste that?

00:35:04.075 --> 00:35:05.230
I said, yeah, I did, Alice.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.700
She says, did you
taste it every time?

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.320
No.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.480
And she goes, that's your job.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.620
Anyway, a long answer
to your question

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.890
is that I think I
do improvise, but I

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:23.890
don't think I go out of the
box like David Chang does.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:26.850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.620
Thanks for being here.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.780
I had a question to you both.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.660
Jonathan, you raised
a great point.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.760
Home cooks tend
to get into ruts.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.800
We don't experiment.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.464
I definitely do that.

00:35:38.464 --> 00:35:40.380
But one thing my husband
and I have been doing

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.730
is we've been using Blue Apron,
an ingredient delivery service,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.910
and there's been definitely
a rise in the number

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.320
of those services.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.040
I wondered what's your
perspective on them

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.530
as a magazine editor, and it's
all about providing people

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.931
with recipes, and a chef.

00:35:58.931 --> 00:36:00.680
Do you think it's
cutting corners too much

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.810
or are you all about getting
people cooking any way

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.850
that we can?

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:10.030
DANA COWIN: I think Blue Apron
is a really, really great idea

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.030
because, indeed, you
get the ingredients,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.200
you get the recipes,
and you can cook.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.445
I'd rather have people
cooking than getting takeout,

00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:24.820
and I think what would happen
is after enough Blue Apron,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.620
you're like, actually,
I don't need them.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.870
I'm going to go get a few
of these ingredients myself.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.810
I feel emboldened,
I feel empowered,

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:34.110
and I feel joy when I cook
as opposed to fear or anxiety

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.310
or bored.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.210
So I think you can
get so many ideas

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.300
and then you'll
take it on yourself,

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.322
and then if you don't
take it that far

00:36:41.322 --> 00:36:43.780
and you're just doing Blue
Apron for the rest of your life,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.930
that's really great, too.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.080
I think it's good.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.621
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I think it's
a good stepping stone because I

00:36:48.621 --> 00:36:51.490
think what you'll find is
that at one point you go,

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.740
this stuff's good but
if I did it myself,

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.800
I would do a better job.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.760
And I think that's
the process that

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.360
happens because at one point,
you will be dissatisfied

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.300
with what you're getting.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.127
It's good enough
for awhile, but you

00:37:05.127 --> 00:37:07.760
know you'd rather go and pick
out your own little string

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.155
beans, the crazy
ones and the not so--

00:37:11.155 --> 00:37:12.030
DANA COWIN: The bend.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.560
JONATHAN WAXMAN: The bent ones
and the not so crazy ones.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.050
DANA COWIN: And hit by hail.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.810
JONATHAN WAXMAN: But I
think shopping is a joy.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.660
We all love to shop.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.870
And I think going to any food
place and taking the time,

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.335
it changes your life.

00:37:27.335 --> 00:37:31.580
It gets you out of all
your craziness at work.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.760
You go into whether it's Whole
Foods or the little bodega

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.770
on the corner,
your mood changes.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.220
You have fun when you shop.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.040
And I think whether you're
shopping for shoes or food,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.380
it's a way to really change
our lives a little bit.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.819
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:50.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.450
By the way, I've cooked
from Dana's cookbook.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.449
Everyone needs to try the
Nutella bread pudding.

00:37:54.449 --> 00:37:56.620
It is a revelation
and quite easy.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.220
It involves ice cream.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.850
But I have a question.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.280
You mentioned before
that you had two sets

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.380
so you could start
all over again,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.240
and in a lot of instances, we
buy just enough for the recipe.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.090
And inevitably, I've actually
cooked from your cookbook,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.870
so I have made many mistakes
like burning pine nuts.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.700
I didn't know how to
quarter something.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.900
There was a lot of Googling.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.330
So what do you do when
you've made a mistake?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.250
Can you fix it, and
the recipe is not

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.510
going to tell you because
you can't anticipate it.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.780
How often do you fix it?

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.280
I can't start all over again.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.280
I've bought enough
ingredients from Fresh Direct

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.640
to get this one recipe done.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.384
What you do to fix
versus start over?

00:38:42.384 --> 00:38:44.550
DANA COWIN: I mean, it
depends how bad the fail was.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.320
Those pine nuts, you
could just leave them out,

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.800
so I think some of that
you have to do on the fly.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.680
As I said, for my lifetime of
making mistakes and cooking

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.660
and feeding people,
because I really only

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:04.610
cook for eight or more,
so most of the time,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.080
people don't notice
the mistakes.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.550
If you left out the pine nuts,
nobody's going to notice.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.960
If burned a corner
of the chicken,

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.335
no one's going to
notice, and it's OK.

00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:15.960
I think that that
was one of the things

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.480
that the chefs said to me.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.020
I might be a little
over sensitive.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.480
And then some things
are beyond redemption,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.118
and then there's pasta.

00:39:26.118 --> 00:39:27.118
AUDIENCE: There's pasta.

00:39:28.702 --> 00:39:30.910
JONATHAN WAXMAN: One other
thing to think about, too,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.580
is if you have your friends
come and taste for you

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.090
because you get too nervous.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.050
You think you've failed
and you probably haven't.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.140
You've probably just
made some silly mistakes

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.310
that are easily rectified.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:49.590
And remember, putting everything
in one pot works all the time.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.520
You know what?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.710
Leftovers are the greatest
thing in the world.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.070
You throw everything in the same
pot, you put it in a low oven,

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.525
and you go have a glass of wine
and come back and it's perfect.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.290
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:09.320
I recently read an
article about that

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.590
the food labeling that indicates
the origin of where the meat

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:17.290
or fish came from is being
fought tooth and nail

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.230
by basically lobbying groups
that represent packagers

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.250
and all these things.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.710
Unfortunately, we can't
go to the farm every time.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.700
I try to go to the fish
market, but sometimes I

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.630
do have to buy at
the supermarket,

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.840
and personally,
I do want to know

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.270
where this produce came from.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.950
What's your opinion on this?

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.444
Do you think that the food
should be clearly labeled

00:40:38.444 --> 00:40:39.110
with the origin?

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.130
DANA COWIN: I think
the food should

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.780
be labeled where
it's from and what is

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.910
in it so we're not surprised.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.330
Yes.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.413
JONATHAN WAXMAN: You know,
I have this thing where

00:40:52.413 --> 00:40:55.680
I do some mentoring of
elementary schools in New York,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.530
and I went in and saw what
they were feeding my children.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.000
I looked at the box, and
on the bottom of the box,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.430
it was said made in China.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.980
And I said, this is really bad.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.400
This is not good.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.580
But at least I knew
where it came from,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.944
so I think labeling
this important.

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.860
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
simplicity in cooking,

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.810
and I like simplicity
in cooking too.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.220
So what's your
favorite food or recipe

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.100
with the least
amount of ingredients

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.460
where taking any of
those ingredients

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.880
away would completely
change the dish?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.550
Well I do this
pasta dish, and it's

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.720
the dumbest thing in
the world, but it's

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.930
people's favorite thing to eat.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.140
It's spaghetti,
but good spaghetti

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.440
that you spend a
lot of money on,

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.750
butter, a tiny bit of cream
and Parmesan cheese, that's it.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.230
And there's nothing
better than it.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.896
If you took one of
the ingredients away,

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:56.590
it wouldn't be the
same, but it's really

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.881
about the technique in cooking.

00:41:57.881 --> 00:42:01.260
You've got to cook the pasta
perfectly, and you overcook it,

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.194
it's not so bad because
you just bake it.

00:42:04.194 --> 00:42:05.610
You take the pasta
and you toss it

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.270
with the butter and the
cream and the Parmesan cheese

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.510
and you put it down.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.560
If somebody were
blindfolded, that's

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.690
all they'd want to eat
the rest of their life.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.420
DANA COWIN: I actually
just made lamb chops

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:23.750
that you pound so that
they're thin, salt, pepper,

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.190
hot, hot grill, two
minutes, two minutes.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.860
It's three ingredients and
it's a ridiculous revelation.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.830
You can't believe just
the pounding of it,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.790
and then that high
heat so it's crusty,

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.439
and then it's a perfect
texture and it's a little salty

00:42:40.439 --> 00:42:41.105
and you're done.

00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:41.907
It's good.

00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:46.270
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming, guys.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:50.010
So you guys talked about
David Chang a minute before.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.332
I love going to a
David Chang restaurant.

00:42:52.332 --> 00:42:54.290
It's a great experience
you get to taste things

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.630
you never got to taste before.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.410
And yet, as someone
that loves cooking,

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.730
I inevitably prefer
going to Barbuto

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.760
because it inspires
me to do something

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.280
that I feel like I can do at
home because it seems more

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.180
simple, I guess, to use a word
that you guys have used before.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.580
Dana, as an author,
as a magazine editor,

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.110
what's your opinion on
that in terms of how

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.180
you're talking to your readers?

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.930
DANA COWIN: I spend a
lot of time thinking

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.500
about what the threshold
is for our readers, what

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.560
is simple but interesting,
because we never

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:33.390
want to do something that is
so simple that it doesn't teach

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.440
you something new.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.640
But the amazing thing is that,
both from the David Chang

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.460
side and the Jonathan Waxman
side, you can learn something.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.830
So Dave, for
example, in my book,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.830
we did kimchi pickles,
which are super simple.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:53.630
It's like a gateway to Dave
but it's not the full on Dave.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.360
And with Jonathan, the
ingredients are simple,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.310
the technique is simple,
but you learn something

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.210
because you learn about basting.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.990
As someone was saying, that's
the thing that turns it.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.370
So we're always trying to give
the readers something that they

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:18.192
will want to do,
never to do recipes

00:44:18.192 --> 00:44:19.400
that are way too complicated.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.150
If something is going
to be very complicated,

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.000
we'll show a picture
that's inspiring

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.580
and then we'll maybe
pull out one part of it,

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.540
like a sauce or a
garnish or something

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.330
that you can do so you can get
that sense of a chef's identity

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.950
on your plate, but then you
serve it with a roast chicken

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:39.960
or something like that.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.501
JONATHAN WAXMAN:
Remember the journey

00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:44.310
hasn't been that long
for Americans and food.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.580
It's really a new
journey for everybody.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.104
When I started 40 years ago,
no one talked about food.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:51.520
We only talked
about other things.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.910
I think the journey is
just really beginning.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:02.580
So I think David, on
the evolutionary track

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.670
of what you could do at
home, you just keep at it.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.780
At one point, you go, I get it.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.120
That's not that hard.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.890
And really, it's a
little bit like you

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.440
want to go work on your car
and you go try to fix your car.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.310
I did that once and it
was a complete disaster.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.380
But I'd like to go back and
figure out how to do it,

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.850
and I think it's the same thing.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:25.300
You've got to start simple
and you work your way

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.699
up the food chain.

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:28.490
AUDIENCE: I don't think
it's the same thing

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.900
but I get your point.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.520
DANA COWIN: But also
someone like Dave.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.120
He works all along
the continuum,

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.680
all the way from something
super, super simple.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.870
He has a concept
that he's working

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.560
on that's between two
buns, and then he has Ko.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.200
So I think a lot of chefs
work along the continuum,

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.240
and you can tap
into their thinking

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.030
anywhere along the
continuum, not just

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.300
at the really complicated end.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.550
AUDIENCE: Building on that
question around David Chang

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.050
and the evolution of food, I'm
curious to hear your opinions

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.210
as to what you think are the
most interesting trends in food

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.430
today and who's
leading that revolution

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.117
and leading those changes.

00:46:07.117 --> 00:46:09.200
DANA COWIN: Well, since
my obsession at the moment

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.590
is-- and it will be ongoing, it
won't be fleeting-- food waste,

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.810
to Dan Barber from Blue Hill
Stone Barns, if you know him,

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.430
and he also has Blue
Hill in Manhattan.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:26.390
This month, he's doing a pop
up called Waste Ed-- wasted--

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:32.090
but it's about educating
people about food waste,

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.760
and I think chefs all
around the country

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.730
and all around the world
are tackling this idea.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.070
So Dan has chefs
coming literally

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.120
from all over the world
to cook with ingredients

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.920
that we would have thrown
out, and I think that there's

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.210
a very interesting
movement with chefs taking

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.720
on these really big topics.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.010
At the same time, as
I'm sure you all know,

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:59.660
the notion of vegan has
gone from "eew" to "ah,"

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.050
and that's been
a beautiful thing

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.490
to watch as so many
chefs experiment

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.680
and come up with dishes that
are really delicious that

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.880
use whole foods.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.399
Whole grains is
a gigantic trend.

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:17.440
It used to be that you
thought if you were eating

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.160
whole wheat you were
doing a good thing,

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.080
and now Marco Canora
has a fantastic new book

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.930
on whole grains and
whole grain cooking,

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:32.020
partly in response to
the gluten free movement.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.500
So I think there's
a lot of interest,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.390
if you bucketed it together,
in experimenting with new ways

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:44.580
to eat for health, where
the flavor is delicious.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.520
Fermentation.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.140
I mean, Jonathan's
a great old hippie.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.060
Everything that the hippies
did, it's totally new again.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.650
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I actually
wasn't a hippie, but that's OK.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.691
DANA COWIN: Are you sure?

00:47:54.691 --> 00:47:56.860
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.150
But continuing, I think it's so
important what Dana just said.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.390
I think that doctors were
completely oblivious to what

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:08.300
nutrition was about
and now doctors

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.710
are waking up to
what can cure us

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:17.000
and how food can really
replace the drugs

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.560
that they shoved down our
throats because the drugs we

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.270
take are just panaceas.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.230
They're just there
to placate us.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:28.010
And this whole thing
about Alzheimer's.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.650
Why is there so much
Alzheimer's happening?

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.435
Why is there so much
gluten allergies?

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.550
It's just expanding
exponentially,

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.160
and I think what doctors
really need to understand

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.490
is food as a core subject.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.190
You look at different cultures,
and cultures that are healthy

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.126
versus cultures that are not
healthy, and what do they eat?

00:48:52.126 --> 00:48:52.950
How do they eat?

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.050
What are their diets like?

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.230
Who knew that kale
and collard greens

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.754
were the best things you could
possibly eat in your life?

00:48:59.754 --> 00:49:01.170
And then we said,
well, you're not

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.253
supposed to eat fat because
of all the cholesterol

00:49:03.253 --> 00:49:04.290
and everything else.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:09.640
Well, your brain is 75%
fat, so maybe there's

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.060
a correlation between
what our brain is made of

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.250
and what we eat, and now doctors
are waking up to that fact.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:21.230
The more research they do, and
the more correlation, the more

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.590
they talk about the
stuff and they figure out

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:27.760
that what we cooked at
home from the field,

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.120
and how we cooked it, and
we didn't use GMO products.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.460
We just got basic stuff from
the farm and we cooked it well,

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.910
and we lived
healthy lives, maybe

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.460
there's something to all that.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.900
I think that really is the
most fascinating thing for me.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.532
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:44.532 --> 00:49:46.740
AUDIENCE: My question is,
how do you pick up a knife?

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.600
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Well,
that's a really funny thing.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.380
I was a trombone player, and
how you pick up a trombone?

00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.040
There's a wrong way
and a right way.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.040
It goes back to
if I gave a knife

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.630
to Dana, how do
I hand it to her?

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.390
Do I stick the
knife towards her?

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:09.442
That's bad.

00:50:09.442 --> 00:50:10.900
AUDIENCE: How much
do you like her?

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.580
JONATHAN WAXMAN: Do I turn
the knife around and hand her

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.370
the handle?

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.780
I'm going to hold the handle.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.560
There's a proper way to do that
and we learned it in school.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.520
So you put your three fingers
under the bottom of the handle,

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.000
you take your thumb.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.270
There's the bolster
that's on every blade.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.890
Put your thumb one side of the
bolster and your index finger

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.352
on the other side of the
bolster and you turn.

00:50:31.352 --> 00:50:32.800
Here you go.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.680
There you go, Dana.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.460
There you go.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.570
And she grabs it the
same way, and that's

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.170
how you hold a knife.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:41.341
FEMALE SPEAKER: Shall we say
this is our last question?

00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:42.290
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.950
Hi.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:43.700
Thanks for coming.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.040
I have two quick
ones, hopefully.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.480
Maybe they're related.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.440
So one is around
portion control.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.010
I'm wondering if you have
any quick tips or advice

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.930
for when you have guests
over and when you're serving,

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:57.770
and also just when
you're eating yourself.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:01.110
Do you eat certain things
first so that you get more full

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:04.354
in the beginning, or what looks
good in portions on plates?

00:51:04.354 --> 00:51:05.520
I'm just curious about that.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.960
And then lastly, secondly, I
tend to travel a lot for work,

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.760
and I'm curious.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.300
We're really privileged to be
in New York and other areas

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.910
that I tend to travel that
are very foodie towns,

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.900
and I can benefit from
that when I'm traveling,

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.440
but some places I go are not.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.154
Most of the country is not.

00:51:24.154 --> 00:51:25.570
And so do you have
recommendations

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:27.440
for folks who are
on the road and all

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.800
you get is the room
service in the hotel

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.640
or around the town,
which is really far

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.359
from optimal and ideal?

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.900
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I was talking
to Phil Lesh from the Grateful

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.390
Dead last year,
and his wife used

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:46.257
to bring a saute pan and
go to the market and make

00:51:46.257 --> 00:51:48.340
scrambled eggs for him at
2 o'clock in the morning

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.620
because he couldn't find a place
to eat, so I know your trouble,

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.034
but you've got Google.

00:51:55.034 --> 00:51:57.200
I'm sorry, but it's the
greatest thing in the world,

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.750
the greatest tool.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.244
If I'm in a foreign
city and I don't

00:52:01.244 --> 00:52:02.910
want to have room
service because I know

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.052
they're going to burn
one half of the club

00:52:06.052 --> 00:52:08.010
sandwich and the other
part's going to be cold,

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.550
and I don't want to have that
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.860
So I just Google where I'm at.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.280
And all these rating things
now, if you look at them all

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.525
and then you use your
power of intuition,

00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:24.125
you go, that place looks really
cool, or you do barbecue.

00:52:24.125 --> 00:52:25.860
I want to eat barbecue tonight.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.090
I think the world is very
changed in that respect.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.840
And you've got to be
willing to take the risk.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.500
And it could be
bad, but why not?

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.880
Why not try it?

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.200
I think that we're getting more
bold with our choices of places

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.880
to eat.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.060
DANA COWIN: I have a fear,
which is a ridiculous, unfounded

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:48.820
fear, of being in a
place and not having food

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.770
that I want to eat, and so my
bag-- today, I have an apple

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.080
even though I'm coming
here and there's

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.373
nothing but food in this entire
building, from what I can tell,

00:52:58.373 --> 00:53:00.080
but it's free.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.270
I had to have an apple
and I had to have

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.510
a healthy granola rather than
an overly sweetened granola,

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.800
so I pack.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.530
I went to Asia and I
brought food with me.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:14.020
I like having some
control and I don't

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.400
want to be starving and then
eat something disgusting, which

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.450
is the greatest thing
I like to avoid.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:24.430
Sometimes I'll go into a market
and buy healthy, whole foods

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.820
that would make me happy
through a day, which

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:31.290
would be dried
fruits, nuts, things

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.980
that are filling and
sustaining, good for your brain.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.430
And then I tend, in
situations that you're in,

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:44.550
to go for something
that I know is real.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.270
So usually, you can
get an egg, and I

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:50.400
feel like an egg
is usually real,

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.742
except sometimes they come in
the-- what are those things?

00:53:53.742 --> 00:53:54.450
Egg replacements.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.026
They come in big vats,
pre-scrambled eggs.

00:53:58.026 --> 00:54:00.120
Anyway, you wouldn't know.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.510
But a fried egg in the
morning, it's very reliable.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.900
And then I try to stay
away from the things that

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.330
are going to be very empty
calories because they're just

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.413
going to make me feel bad.

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:13.422
So I try to stay away from
the pastas and the breads

00:54:13.422 --> 00:54:15.630
and the bagels, which are
all very readily available,

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.350
but they're not going to
make me feel very good.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.120
Portion control.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.630
I also have a little
paranoia around portions

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:29.730
because when I entertain,
I do eight different bowls

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:32.400
of things, all room
temperature so that I

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.970
have to prep them
early in the day

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:36.530
so that if I make a
mistake, I can fix it.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:40.160
One thing is grains, one
that's a leafy vegetable, one

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.900
that's a roasted vegetable.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:49.970
So I always allow people to
choose the food for themselves

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.820
because that way,
they can figure out

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:55.540
how much they want to take,
and I always make way too much,

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.044
but then there's leftovers
and I'm good with that.

00:54:58.044 --> 00:54:59.960
JONATHAN WAXMAN: I was
very privileged to know

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.859
Danny Kaye when I was
at Michael's restaurant,

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:04.150
and he invited me to his house.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:09.761
He was a famous cook,
and he just loved life.

00:55:09.761 --> 00:55:10.760
I walked into his house.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.240
He says, Jonathan, it's
all about the preparation.

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.050
He showed me in
front of his wok,

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.700
because cooked
lots of Asian food,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.130
all these little bowls
perfectly portioned out.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:22.430
He never portioned them.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.950
He has five people in the
back doing all the chipping

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:25.940
and chopping.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.500
But it was such a revelation
to see everything ready to go

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.350
and you relax and you can cook.

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:34.310
So if you can do those
things in advance,

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.760
and you can do it a day in
advance or two days in advance.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.310
Nothing goes really
that bad, trust me,

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:44.210
especially if the refrigerator
is cold-- 39 degrees,

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:46.290
by the way.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:47.612
You've got to be 39 degrees.

00:55:47.612 --> 00:55:48.820
That's a whole other subject.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:52.850
Anyway, if you have all
those things portioned out

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.630
and you start cooking, you
can have a glass of wine

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:58.626
and have fun.

00:55:58.626 --> 00:56:00.250
AUDIENCE: Seems like
a recurring theme.

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:02.210
DANA COWIN: Is it the
glass of wine or the fun?

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.670
AUDIENCE: The food, I
guess, also is a topic.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:05.770
Thank you.

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.310
JONATHAN WAXMAN: You're welcome.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:07.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:09.490
Well, that was a great
round of questions.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:11.230
Thank you both
for your insights,

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:14.310
and I want everybody
to join me in thanking

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:17.040
Dana Cowin and Jonathan Waxman
for joining us at Google today.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.090
