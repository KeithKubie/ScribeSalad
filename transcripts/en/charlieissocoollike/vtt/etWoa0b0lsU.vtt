00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello. Nice to see you again. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.770
Sorry it's been a little while. 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.490
I am currently hiking in Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.340
This particular hike is called Booth's Rock Trail. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.810
It's a pretty lovely one. It's very pretty. 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.580
Lots of history around here. 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.900
Lots of mud and mosquitos, just what you'd expect from the Canadian wilderness. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.760
However, please do not be fooled into thinking this video is more exciting than it actually is. 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.940
I'm just here to tell you what I'm going to do at VidCon this year. 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.730
But if you can make it through, then I promise you'll get a nice view of Canada at the end, 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.100
so there's your incentive. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.750
So the first thing is my new short film, 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.410
which I'm hoping will be finished in time to screen at VidCon, 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.870
and we're already at the view. So that's good.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.010
This isn't the main view? 
EMILY: No. 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.510
CHARLIE: Okay, so I can just not show it to them. Good. 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.600
CHARLIE: It looks like a beautiful painting.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.840
And you're missing out. Sorry. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.660
So yeah, if you would like to see my new short film

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.180
"Strangers in a Bed" in its hopefully finished form,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.960
I think we'll be screening that on Saturday. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.680
We are actually here at the view now, aren't we? 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.150
You go enjoy it, I'll update them, 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.070
and then I'll come join you. 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.080
Emily and I have also organized our own panel this year called INTERMIX. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.970
The basic concept is that we wanted to try and bring together filmmakers 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.210
from a more traditional background who are releasing their films online

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.200
and filmmakers like myself who started doing stuff online 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.770
and now are getting into filmmaking. 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.920
So that's going to be a screening of lots of short films online

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.080
and then I'm going to bring out some of the filmmakers, 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.160
have a chat with then. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.380
So, hopefully that will be entertaining for you as well 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.430
if you would like to come along to that. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.860
That is also on the Saturday, again not sure what time. 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.920
And then as per normal, I'm also going to try and meet as many people

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.950
who want to meet me as I possibly can, 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.680
so on Thursday and Friday, I'm doing a mix of taking pictures with people 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.160
and signing things for people 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.800
Can't remember which one's on which day. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.370
Again, just very, very good at this whole update thing. 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.320
I'm on a couple of panels as well that I haven't organized 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.480
which are also filmmakey related. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.930
Can't remember what those are called at all, so that's useful.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.520
Tell you what I'll do is I'll write a blog post with correct information in it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.140
so you can look at that. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.110
I'll put it in the description. 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.830
And that's it. My arm hurts now. 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.710
I want to go look at the view, so hopefully I will see you at VidCon. 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.490
Okay. Here is the view. 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.940
Good Lord, that's pretty.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.800
Holy... 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.090
Holy hell.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.080
Holy mackerel.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.760
Do you like it?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390
CHARLIE: Yeah. Let's have lunch. The end.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.550
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.660
which makes you, like, cool.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.640
CHARLIE: Okay, I shouldn't try and film this bit.  Oh, God. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.650
CHARLIE: Good start, good start.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.950
Alright, that's closed enough. EMILY: You did it!
