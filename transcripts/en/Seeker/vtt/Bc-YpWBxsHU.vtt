Here's how this
video feels to a fly.

00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:08.815
(SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY)
Welcome to D News.

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:14.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.224
And you know I'm all about
how animals see the world.

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:18.890
In a previous video,
we talked about how

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.770
they see colors
and magnetic fields

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.370
and all kinds of insane stuff.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.500
But now a new study in animal
behavior shows some of them

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.510
also see things in matrix
bullet time-- whoa.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.189
The team measured a whole bunch
of animals and their reaction

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.250
times based on something
called critical flicker fusion

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.730
frequency, basically
how their body responds

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.490
to things like flashing lights.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.230
And it turns out, the
processing of information

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.400
is tied to an animal's
size and metabolic rate.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.340
You know how hard
it is to swat a fly?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
That's because they
take in seven times more

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.600
visual and audio information
per second than we do.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.870
The same goes for
insects and small birds.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.940
Dogs take in information
at twice the speed we do.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.200
That's why you can't get your
dog into TV or a Skype video.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.430
It's just seeing this
weirdly flickering screen.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.100
Reaction time is the difference
between life and death

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.910
in the wild, especially
for small animals

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.050
that are prey for
just about everything.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.830
So their ability to take
in information quickly

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680
is essential for their survival.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.260
And you know how humans process
information is interesting.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.440
We can only take in so much at
a time, but we can change it,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.030
or rather, our bodies
can, situationally.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780
If you ever felt like
time's slowed down

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.830
before a car accident
or a particularly

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.980
dangerous situation,
that's your body

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.750
flipping your brain
into overdrive,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.730
so you have more
ability to react.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.470
Our ability to
process information

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.090
can also be changed
by age and training.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.120
Athletes have a tendency
to be able to take

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.930
in more information while
playing their particular sport,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.880
meaning time seems just
a tiny bit slower to them

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.810
during a game.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.190
And as we get older, our
ability to process and take

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.430
in information
slows down, meaning

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.930
time seems like it's slightly
faster than we were younger.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.990
In case you're
wondering, besides flies,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.970
squirrels and
pigeons seem to take

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.530
in the most information at once.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.700
The slowest animals were the
European eel, the leatherback

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.350
turtle, and the
black nose shark.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.700
And interestingly,
only one animal's speed

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.700
doesn't match its perception.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.740
The tiger beetle runs too fast
to keep up with its own vision.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.160
It has to stop, wait a
second, and then run again.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.050
It is like living in a
permanently buffering YouTube

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.966
video.

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:26.840
We've all been there.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.330
Am I right?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.455
If you want to know more
about animal vision or any

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:31.160
of their other
crazy abilities, we

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.320
have tons of videos about
them in the links below.
