AMRIT SANJEEV: Hello, I'm Amrit
Sanjeev for The Developer Show.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.110
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.870
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.110
DevFest 2018 is the largest
annual community event

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.600
series for the Google
Developer Groups program

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.052
and will run from
August to November.

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:20.010
Head over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.450
below for more information
or to find an event near you.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.690
The Google AI
Quantum Team recently

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.270
announced the public
alpha of Cirq,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.640
an open-source framework
for Noisy Intermediate-Scale

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.380
Quantum, or NISQ, computers.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.960
Cirq is focused on
near-term questions

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.050
and helping you understand
whether NISQ quantum computers

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.660
are capable of solving
computational problems

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.640
of practical importance.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.800
It's licensed into
Apache 2 and is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.400
free to be modified or
embedded in any commercial or

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.930
open-source package.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
You can find the GitHub
link on the post.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.750
Production-ready
commercial Kubernetes apps

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.270
are now available right
from our marketplace,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.000
bringing you simplified
deployment, billing,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.879
and third-party licensing.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.500
Now you can find the solution
you need in Google Cloud

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900
Platform marketplace
and deploy quickly

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.503
on Kubernetes clusters
running on Google Cloud

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:16.020
Platform, Kubernetes
Engine, on prem, or even

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.550
other public clouds.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.540
Link to the marketplace
and apps are on the post.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.970
You can now import
and export data

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.310
easily in Cloud Spanner console.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.280
This includes exporting
any Cloud Spanner database

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.470
into a Google Cloud
Storage packet

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.780
and importing files
from a GCS bucket

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.270
into a new Cloud
Spanner database.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.190
For more details and
links to the docs,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.440
head over to the post.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.770
Google Compute Engine Ultramem
memory-optimized machine types

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.910
are now generally available.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.250
This means you can now provision
Ultramem VMs with up to 160

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.100
VCPUs and nearly 4TB of memory.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.530
That's the most VCPUs you
can provision on-demand

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.770
in any public cloud.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.590

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:07.350
Thanks for watching.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.437
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.020
I'm trying to save
my breath, I think,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.680
for the long [INAUDIBLE].
