Hi, I'm Hannah Dickinson and
this is "Cheers To You" where

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.510
I'm kicking off my first round
of the weekend by cheersing

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.639
to all the people and stories
that encourage me to drink.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.851
Cheers to you Buffalo Wild Wings
on your new pumpkin spice wings.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.436
Now, basic white girls can eat

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.688
and not have to force
themselves to throw up.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.399
Can't wait.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.319
Cheers to you Tara Reid for
getting booted off an airplane.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.113
Sucks that you're going to be
late to literally nothing.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.660
Cheers to you Nicole Kidman
for revealing that your marriage

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.371
to Tom Cruise saved you
from sexual harassment.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.706
That's the beauty
of sleeping with gay men.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.709
No matter how much I drink,
I never wake up sore.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.961
Cheers to you Post Malone

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.838
for going undercover
for a charity stunt

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.882
literally fooling no one.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.301
A real transformation
would require a shower.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.306
He looks stinky.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.184
Cheers to you Ariana Grande
for dumping Pete Davidson,

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.645
but keeping the pig that
doesn't make jokes about you

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.563
on Saturday Night Live.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.399
I'm very sorry
about the whole thing though

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.733
and I love
Saturday Night Live,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.610
and if you guys
would read my packet

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.196
it would really do
a lot for my career,

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.740
and I love you, Pete,
and I hope you're doing okay.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.871
Cheers to you FDA on banning
Viagra spiked vape juice.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.874
Not because it's dangerous,
but because it's pointless.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.584
Please go back to the crÃ¨me
brulee flavor

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.919
and your mother's basement.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.047
Cheers to you people
at Six Flags who made $300

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.675
for lying in a coffin
for 30 hours.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.094
That's the first time
anyone at Six Flags

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.804
has ever made $10 an hour.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.435
Cheers to you

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.980
A$AP Rocky for being bullied
at 13 during an orgy.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.399
I was also bullied
during an orgy.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.443
A woman stopped me
from taking off my clothes

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.528
and said,
"Ma'am this is an Olive Garden".

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.448
They have unlimited breadsticks

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.366
and it's a lot
of white trash people,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.243
so I feel at home.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.830
Cheers.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.333
Wow. That was a great
addition of "Cheers

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.792
To You" with Hannah Dickinson.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.670
You can watch our regular show
Every Damn Day,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.840
full episodes of it on the
Comedy Central YouTube page.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.092
This week we talk about stuff
like the best episode

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:17.387
of Key and Peele of all time,
South Park sneak peeks,

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.056
and we even did a break
down of the hottest

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.307
Halloween trends.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.933
Are you (bleep) joking?

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.226
No, we did it all.
We did all that.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.519
You're going to sit there
the whole time.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.937
You didn't laugh at one thing.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.647
I live here on the set.
