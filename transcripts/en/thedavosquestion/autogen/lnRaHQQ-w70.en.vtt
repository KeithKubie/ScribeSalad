in providing agriculture solutions the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
in providing agriculture solutions the
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.209
in providing agriculture solutions the
question here is what's the you know how

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
question here is what's the you know how
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.890
question here is what's the you know how
do you tackle the food security how do

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
do you tackle the food security how do
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.859
do you tackle the food security how do
you enter full security going forward in

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
you enter full security going forward in
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380
you enter full security going forward in
India for the world and when you think

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
India for the world and when you think
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.759
India for the world and when you think
about food security one should also

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
about food security one should also
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650
about food security one should also
think about water security because food

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
think about water security because food
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019
think about water security because food
is created out of water and when you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
is created out of water and when you
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939
is created out of water and when you
look at agriculture agriculture loses

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
look at agriculture agriculture loses
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620
look at agriculture agriculture loses
almost eighty four percent of freshwater

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
almost eighty four percent of freshwater
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080
almost eighty four percent of freshwater
resources in India and almost two-thirds

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
resources in India and almost two-thirds
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630
resources in India and almost two-thirds
of water resources around the world and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
of water resources around the world and
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.670
of water resources around the world and
if you can save water in agriculture and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
if you can save water in agriculture and
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350
if you can save water in agriculture and
the way agriculture is done by using

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
the way agriculture is done by using
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299
the way agriculture is done by using
efficient irrigation drip irrigation

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
efficient irrigation drip irrigation
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010
efficient irrigation drip irrigation
sprinkler irrigation all those things

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
sprinkler irrigation all those things
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170
sprinkler irrigation all those things
then you can get much higher

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
then you can get much higher
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119
then you can get much higher
productivity from the same unity of land

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
productivity from the same unity of land
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.310
productivity from the same unity of land
so what really you are trying to do is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
so what really you are trying to do is
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770
so what really you are trying to do is
you're going to create more crop for a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
you're going to create more crop for a
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.130
you're going to create more crop for a
drop and not only that that while you're

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
drop and not only that that while you're
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560
drop and not only that that while you're
creating more drop you have to also

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
creating more drop you have to also
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.389
creating more drop you have to also
ensure that it becomes sustainable so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
ensure that it becomes sustainable so
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639
ensure that it becomes sustainable so
you should use less resources you should

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
you should use less resources you should
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619
you should use less resources you should
you lesser fertilize the list of water

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
you lesser fertilize the list of water
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.899
you lesser fertilize the list of water
less of energy so that it becomes more

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
less of energy so that it becomes more
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090
less of energy so that it becomes more
sustainable and you also maintain the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
sustainable and you also maintain the
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190
sustainable and you also maintain the
land quality will remain good because

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
land quality will remain good because
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140
land quality will remain good because
the future about the growth in about the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
the future about the growth in about the
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.289
the future about the growth in about the
food security is not just about

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299
food security is not just about
 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.789
food security is not just about
achieving this quantitative growth but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
achieving this quantitative growth but
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560
achieving this quantitative growth but
also qualitative growth and when a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
also qualitative growth and when a
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899
also qualitative growth and when a
farmer uses less impulse and produces

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
farmer uses less impulse and produces
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.300
farmer uses less impulse and produces
more output not only it will ensure food

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
more output not only it will ensure food
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460
more output not only it will ensure food
security as well as water security which

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
security as well as water security which
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770
security as well as water security which
are very critical and create sustainable

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
are very critical and create sustainable
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319
are very critical and create sustainable
environment but most important if you he

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
environment but most important if you he
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240
environment but most important if you he
follows this business model what it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
follows this business model what it
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950
follows this business model what it
creates is also income security for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
creates is also income security for
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.080
creates is also income security for
himself so that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090
himself so that
 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.149
himself so that
value creation and when you create that

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159
value creation and when you create that
 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.830
value creation and when you create that
kind of value creation for the small

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
kind of value creation for the small
 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.169
kind of value creation for the small
farmers especially who are one acre one

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179
farmers especially who are one acre one
 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.819
farmers especially who are one acre one
hectare type of all day then you are

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829
hectare type of all day then you are
 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.249
hectare type of all day then you are
creating a new ecosystem which is based

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
creating a new ecosystem which is based
 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.099
creating a new ecosystem which is based
on concept of that you create more from

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109
on concept of that you create more from
 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.080
on concept of that you create more from
less or more and that is a way to ensure

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090
less or more and that is a way to ensure
 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.350
less or more and that is a way to ensure
food security for the world
