00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.220
PROFESSOR: The binomial
theorem extends

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.980
to a thing called the
multinomial theorem,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.060
whereas instead of taking a
product of a sum of two things,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.170
you'd take the product
of a sum of k things

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.870
to get the multinomial theorem.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.430
And what underlies it
is a rule that we're

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.660
going to call the bookkeeper
rule, and here's why.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.420
So, the bookkeeper rule
is about the question of,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.750
look at the word bookkeeper
and ask how many different ways

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.500
are there to scramble the
letters in this word that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
actually are distinguishable?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.880
The point being that the two
o's are indistinguishable,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.460
so the order in which they
appear doesn't matter.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.350
Likewise, the three
e's and the two k's.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170
Well, how do we
answer this question?

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.660
The simple way to
do it to begin with

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.402
is to label all of
the indistinguishable

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.610
letters with subscripts to
make them distinguishable.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.810
So, I'm going to put subscripts
1 and 2 on the o's, 1 and 2

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.230
on the k's, and 1,
2, and 3 on the e's.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.120
Now, all the 10 letters
are distinguishable.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.280
And if I ask how
many ways are there

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.660
to permute these 10
letters, the answer,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.010
we know by the
generalized product

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.840
rule is simply 10 factorial.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.060
Now, my strategy is going
to be to use the division

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.634
rule to count the number
of patterns of the letters

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:17.925
in the word with no subscripts.

00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.490
And the way I'm
going to do that is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.560
take one of these subscripted
words and erase the subscripts.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.460
So, I'm going to map it to the
same permutation of letters

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.990
with no subscripts.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.970
I've just done that.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.950
Here I've taken an
arbitrary permutation

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.540
of the subscripted word, and
then I've erased the subscripts

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.920
and consolidated the letters.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.020
And I wind up with
this permutation.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.040
Now, if I want to
count the number

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.070
of unsubscripted
permutations, then I simply

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.590
figure out that this
mapping is K to 1,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.480
and I'm going to then divide by
K. Well, how many to 1 is it?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.480
Well, how many subscripted
words map to this given pattern?

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.070
The answer is the subscripts
on the o's don't matter,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.220
so there's two possible orders
in which those subscripts might

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.070
appear.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.680
Subscripts on the
k's don't matter.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.330
There's two possible
orders in which

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.889
those subscripts might appear.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.380
Subscripts on the
e's don't matter.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.830
Three possible orders, or 3
factorial possible orders that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.810
the subscripts might
occur in the e's.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.070
The net result is that with
two o's, two k's, and three

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.640
e's, the mapping is 2
factorial by 2 factorial

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.900
by 3 factorial to 1.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
And that instantly gives
us, by the division rule,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.920
that the total number
of permutations

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.010
of the letters in
the word bookkeeper

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.130
is 10 factorial over 2 factorial
times 2 factorial times 3

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.950
factorial.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.560
More generally by
the same reasoning

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.770
if, I look at a sequence of
n letters, of which n1 are

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.660
a's and n2 are b's up
through nk are z's, then

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.790
the number of permutations
of those letters

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.640
with the repeated
a's, b's, and Z's is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.420
n factorial divided
by n1 factorial times

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.390
n2 factorial through
nk factorial.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.510
And this formula occurs so
often that it has a name.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.150
It's called a
multinomial coeff--

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.540
there's a name for it
written in this format,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.170
n over n1, n2 through nk.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.260
You could start to say n
choose n1 choose n2 choose nk,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.280
if you're thinking
about how we pronounce

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.440
the binomial coefficients.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.720
The convention is that the
sum of the ni's is supposed

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.770
to be equal to the numerator n.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.250
This is called a
multinomial coefficient.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.490
So, n factorial divided by
this product of factorials

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.900
is written in somewhat
shorter notation

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.142
without the factorials as
a multinomial coefficient.

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:46.350
Binomial coefficient, by
the way, are a special case.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.890
When we write n choose
k, if we wrote it

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.420
as a multinomial
coefficient, you'd

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.310
have to write it as n choose
k and then choose n minus k.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.840
So, we can apply this to think
about words and coefficients

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.320
and expanding things that
are more than binomials.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.867
So, let's look at expanding
a quintomial, a sum of five

00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:15.960
things, E, M, S, T,
and Y. And I raise that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.415
to the seventh power.

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:21.440
So, that means in these products
of seven of these terms,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.650
I'm looking at words
of length seven

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.090
whose components are the
letters E, M, S, T, and Y.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.070
And So, if I multiply this out,
applying the distributive law,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.750
I would wind up with
5 to the 7th terms,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.070
each of them consisting of
a permutation of the letters

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.400
E, M, S, T, and Y.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.580
And if I ask what's the
coefficient in that expansion

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.230
of the term E, M,
S cubed, T, Y, it's

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.550
exactly the number of ways
of permuting these five

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.360
letters, a word of length seven
made out of these five letters

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.400
with three occurrences
of S. In other words,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.630
the coefficient of E, M, S
cubed, T, Y in this product

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.030
is the number of ways of
rearranging the letters

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.320
in this sequence of seven.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.060
It's the word
systems, which is why

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.750
we chose it to be rememberable.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.250
How many ways are
there to rearrange

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.130
the letters in the word
systems by the bookkeeper rule?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.280
There are seven.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.590
Choose 1, 1, 3, 1, 1.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.900
Let's do another example.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.950
What's the coefficient
of BA cubed

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.270
N squared if I expand
this trinomial, B plus A

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.680
plus N to the sixth power?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.510
Well, now again I have
3 to the 6th terms.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.460
How many of them involve
a B, three A's, and two

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.710
N's by the bookkeeper rule?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.480
It's the number of
ways-- well, it's

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.910
the number of ways
of rearranging

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.790
the letters in the word banana.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.400
And by the bookkeeper
rule, that's

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.540
six with subscripts 1, 3, and 2.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.360
More generally, this is what
the multinomial theorem says.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.960
If I look at the
coefficient of the term--

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.020
a product of Xi to the
ri's in an expansion

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.250
of a k-nomial, a sum of k
distinct variables raised

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.170
to the n-th power, now
I've got if I expanded this

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.870
out using the distributive
law without collecting terms,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.970
I'd have k to the n
terms, each of which

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:31.460
was a permutation of the X1's
through Xk's, with repeats.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.830
And then if I ask, how
many of those products,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.330
if any of these k variables
have this many X1's, this many

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.430
X2's, through this many rk's--
this many Xk's, I'm asking

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.020
again a bookkeeper question.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.580
And the answer is n
choose r1, r2 through rk.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.680
So, now we're ready
for the record

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.490
to state the general
multinomial formula.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.420
If I take a sum of k terms,
a k-nomial to the nth power,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.940
then expressing it
in concise notation,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.390
it's the sum over r1 through rk
summing to n of the multinomial

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:17.080
coefficient n r1 through rk
times this product of Xi's.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.610
I'm not putting a
highlighted box around it,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.330
because this is not a
formula which is particularly

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.460
important to memorize.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.220
And it's clearly all
clogged up with subscripts.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.710
But nevertheless, it's good to
have sometimes for the record.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.420
And next week, we will
continue with this theme

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.990
about the connection between
counting and algebra.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.380
And in particular, not
only ordinary polynomials

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.740
as we've been looking at
here with a product of sums,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.545
but in fact, infinite
polynomials or infinite series

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:51.350
when we pick up generating
functions next week.
