00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As always, it's a good idea to look into equilibria, to understand what's happening.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Most probably the time constant that governs the burning of wood

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is much higher than the time constant that's responsible for the heat loss.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Heat loss will be quicker than burning.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can safely assume that the density of the wood is almost constant

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
on the time scale on which the temperature develops, and now we can draw this nice diagram

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that shows how the rate of change of the temperature depends on temperature.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If we are below ignition, we only have heat loss. That's the linear function with negative slope.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And when the temperature equals the ambient temperature, the rate of change will be zero.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So that's this part of the curve.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
A linear function with negative slope and that function is zero at the ambient temperature,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the second regime, when there is combustion, we have to add this constant.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And as we assume that the density of the wood stays almost constant,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the burn rate is almost constant.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What we get is simply a shift upwards.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The same linear function as before but shifted upward like this.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now, here's a question for you--how many stable equilibria do you see here. Enter that number.
