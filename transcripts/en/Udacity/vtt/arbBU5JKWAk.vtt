00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Congratulations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You've answered a question that was vitally important for centuries.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How can we locate our ships at sea?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You've seen that even though finding latitude is relatively easy,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
finding your longitude can be incredibly difficult.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
With a reliable time-keeping mechanism, which we can create by taking advantage

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of simple harmonic motion, we can find our longitude by comparing the time on our ship

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to the time at some known location.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In the next unit, we're going to visit the 18th century

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
when buildings were frequently struck by lightening.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In the next unit, we're going to answer the question how can we prevent

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
buildings from being struck by lightening. See you then.
