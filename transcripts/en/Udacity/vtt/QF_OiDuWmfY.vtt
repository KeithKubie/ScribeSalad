00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.240
The Internet and the World Wide Web and intimately tied to everyday lives. It

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.410
has put information that we seek at

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.790
our finger tips. Remedies for the common cold,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.990
dinner recipes, sports updates, developments in the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.330
Middle East, you name it. You will find

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.630
it on the internet. We know that the creation of such content happens from the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.200
basement of individuals like you and me, as well as businesses such as CNN,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.700
BBC, and NBC who's work it is to create such content. How is the content in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.530
the internet stored and distributed? In the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.160
first two lessons of this module, we looked

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.230
at the server end of the giant

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.640
scale services. How's a computational resources organized in

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.760
the data center? How is the data

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.310
organized internally in the computational. Nodes of

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.540
the cluster. And what is the programming

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.890
model for dealing with the big data associated

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.830
with giant scale services and for exploiting

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.760
all the computational resources that are available in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.180
the server forms and data centers. In

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.520
this lesson, we'll look at content distribution networks.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.220
That is How is information organized, located, and distributed

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.670
when we're looking for them? Once again, the issue is dealing with

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.180
the scale of the problem. The content is generated worldwide

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.800
and users are trying to access the content worldwide as well.
