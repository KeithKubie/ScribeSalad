00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.850
A zoo has 15
emperor penguins who

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.280
make up 30% of the total
number of penguins at the zoo.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.020
How many penguins
live at the zoo?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.570
So let's let x equal the
total number of penguins

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.020
who live at the zoo.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.590
So they're telling
us that 30% of that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.800
are the emperor
penguins, which are 15.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.360
So they're saying if we
take 30%, so 30% of x

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.480
is equal to 15.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.270
Or another way of saying
this is we could say,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840
Instead of writing 30%, we
could write that as a decimal,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.180
as 0.30 of x.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.900
So it's 0.30 times
x is equal to 15.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.270
And now to solve this, we
just have to divide both sides

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.845
by 0.30.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:00:59.670
So let's do that.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:11.430
0.30, 0.30, we get x is
equal to 15 divided by 0.30.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.680
We're going to have to do a
little arithmetic to solve

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.180
this one.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.100
So if we take 0-- it's
15 divided by 0.30.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.660
So just as a refresher
of dividing decimals,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.000
we could essentially multiply
both of these by 100.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.870
And when you multiply
both of them by 100,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.369
you can't just
multiply one of them.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.360
Then you would get
a different answer.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.140
But if you multiply
both of them by 100,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
you move this decimal point over
two spots, so it becomes a 30.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.760
And you move this decimal over
two spots, so it becomes 1,500.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.500
So it really boils down
to how many times--

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.580
the same number of times that
30 goes into 1,500 is the number

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.590
of times that 0.30
will go into 15.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.910
So let's think about this.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.690
Let me rewrite it here,
just so it's neat.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.760
30 goes into 1,500, all we did
is we moved both decimals over

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.582
to the right twice.

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:02.040
Or you could say
we just multiplied

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.460
the numerator and
the denominator

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.280
here by 100, which
wouldn't change

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.910
the value of the fraction.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.063
So 30 goes into-- let's
see, it doesn't go into 1.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:10.979
It doesn't go into 15.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.690
It does go into 150.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.830
It goes into 150 five times.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.990
5 times 30 is 150.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.000
Subtract, you get 0.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.040
And then 30 goes
into 0 zero times.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.000
So this 30 goes into
1,500 fifty times.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.070
So this right over
here is equal to 50.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.260
And you can verify it.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.160
Multiply 0.3 times 50,
and you will get 15.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.870
Now, there is another
way of doing it.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.900
You could say the fraction
of emperor penguins

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.590
over the total number
of penguins at the zoo.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.090
So you could say 15.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.030
You could say 15 over the
total number of penguins

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.580
at the zoo is equal to 30%.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.760
Percent literally
means 30 hundreds.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.510
So it's equal to
30 for every 100.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.270
It's equal to 30 for every 100.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.690
And then you could solve
for this right over here.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.090
And a really simple way
of doing this is you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.540
say, look, to go
from 30 to 15, you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.900
have to divide by 2 if
you're going from the right

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.620
to the left.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.110
So let's divide by
2 right over here.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.930
So x would be equal to 50.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.600
15/50 is the same
thing as 30/100.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.805
So the total number
of penguins are 50.
