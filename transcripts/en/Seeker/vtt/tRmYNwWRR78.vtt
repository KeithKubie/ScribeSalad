00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.440
This episode of DNews is proudly brought to
you by Subaru.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.519
Sometimes, science has to ask the hard questions,
like, "How do you cure a legless person of

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.849
a foot cramp?"

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.020
Howdy everyone, Trace here for DNews -- Amputations
are more common than you think, mostly from

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.500
diabetes, trauma, birth defects and tumors.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.410
Some estimates reach over 150,000 annually.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.290
Aside from the pain and rehabilitation of
the healing process,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.760
amputees have to deal with their own brain's
confusion over the loss of a limb.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.870
Phantom Limb Pain is when a person feels pain
in a limb that they don't have.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.550
There's literally nothing there, but the brain
still "feels" the missing limb.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.039
Their toes might be moving, or fist might
be clenched tightly, they could even feel

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.879
like it's spontaneously getting shorter!

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.399
It's all in their head, but it feels real
to them.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.710
It sounds terrible.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.269
At the moment, treatments include relaxation
techniques, and mental exercises, but a new

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.739
technology from Sweden could really help people
who suffer from phantom limb pain.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.140
A research group is using augmented reality
in combination with electronic sensing equipment

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.280
to give people their limbs back in virtual
reality!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.820
The technology uses sensors and asks the amputee
to complete a computer game which "uses" their

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.820
limb.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.330
It senses the nerve input from their brain
and responds as if they were using the missing

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.330
piece.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.510
Once they've trained themselves to recognize
their virtual limb, therapists can help with

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.830
their rehabilitation.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.730
A clenched fist can be relaxed, and the patient
can LITERALLY SEE the fist attached to their

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.390
arm relaxing too.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.060
Augmented Reality Therapy works because our
brains are easily fooled into believing the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
virtual arm is our own.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.890
This is a new technique using an old trick.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.880
The premotor cortex uses the information gathered
by your senses to keep an awareness of our

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
own bodies.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.230
It uses this to determine if the hand in front
of it is YOUR hand or someone elses.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.850
Scientists have known for a long time, given
absence of feeling or weight, the premotor

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.030
cortex favors visual information.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.450
Thus, in the past, a simple mirror has been
used to accomplish what they're now doing

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.680
with virtual reality!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.560
A mirror would be set up to mimic the missing
limb, and doctors found Mirror Therapy to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.170
be even more effective than drugs in treating
Phantom Limb Pain.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.660
This is yet another example of technology
being generally awesome.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.720
Virtual reality is being used by therapists
to help cure people with phobias in a safe

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.050
environment, and help reduce fear, anxiety
and avoidance in PTSD patients.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.280
It's even been used to treat burn victims
by helping them explore a snowy paradise to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
cool down.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.090
The brain is easily fooled, and we can use
that power for good.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:52.250
But back to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.840
augmented reality - what would you use it
for?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.099
What if I could play as Goro from frickin'
Mortal Kombat.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.620
Moving my FOUR ARMS using my brain.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.620
Frickin' cool.
