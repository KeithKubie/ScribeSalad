00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.125
“All the world’s a stage”

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.706
from As You Like It

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:10.716
by William Shakespeare

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.829
All the world’s a stage,

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.089
And all the men and women merely players;

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.909
They have their exits and their entrances;

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.079
And one man in his time plays many parts,

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.759
His acts being seven ages.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.473
At first the infant,

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:36.253
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:39.743
And then the whining school-boy, 
with his satchel

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:42.943
And shining morning face, creeping like 
snail

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.803
Unwillingly to school.

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:48.943
And then the lover,

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:51.963
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:55.663
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow.

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:57.037
Then a soldier,

00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:00.737
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like 
the pard,

00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:03.807
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick 
in quarrel,

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:06.647
Seeking the bubble reputation

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:11.397
Even in the cannon’s mouth.

00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:14.995
And then the justice,

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:18.379
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.079
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.031
Full of wise saws and modern instances;

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.621
And so he plays his part.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.245
The sixth age shifts

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:37.245
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:40.498
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:43.950
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world 
too wide

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.950
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly 
voice,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.390
Turning again toward childish treble, 
pipes

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.990
And whistles in his sound.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.760
Last scene of all,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.810
That ends this strange eventful history,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.320
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:19.885
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, 
sans everything.
