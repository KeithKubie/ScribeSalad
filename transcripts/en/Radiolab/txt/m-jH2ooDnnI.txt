Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. C. E. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. I am not Jan [inaudible]. What you see who you are. Okay. That's the oddest thing to do.

Speaker 2:          00:18          I'm a new summer Odie. I host another podcast at w and YC studios. Note to self.

Speaker 1:          00:24          You also are on Irish show video lab. I'll know very, very frequently. Well, not very frequently but frequently enough. Frequently enough. Brilliantly enough. Thank you sir. We are,

Speaker 2:          00:33          yes, and I am here. Pinch hitting for Jad for a little bit to spread the word that this is an important time for Radiolab, Robert.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Well, it's the end of the year. The giving time is the end of the year. What we're about to do I think will be kind of wonderful because we who make the show and you who listened to the show don't often have a chance to get together. So in the next bit of time what we're going to do is we're going to pal up. We've invited some of the people who normally listened to come on the show and people who love Emily make the show come and listen and we're mixing it up a little bit. It's a strange menagerie of humans and we want to just go to the zoo of us. So that is coming right up. But if you'd like to hit pause just for a second and make a contribution right away, like right now, you can enjoy the episode knowing that you've already done the thing that you were supposed to do, that we're going to be on our knees begging you to do what you've already done it like, yeah, that's already, you've already solved the problem. Yes. Do you want me to take over here? Right here. Okay. Yeah. Slip in and then I'll think of something to say on the, okay, very good.

Speaker 2:          01:34          So, um, what Robert is beating around the bush is that radio lab relies on the support of listener contributions. Listeners like you, yes. Who make all the stories that we produce possible. So it's time that we extend a hand to you, our podcast listeners, and invite you to make a financial contribution so that radio lab can keep these episodes coming your way. It is super easy to do. We ask you to go to radiolab.org/donate to give or even easier if you live in the u s open up your phone, probably what you're listening on. Anyway, open up the messaging app. Type the word radio lab to the number six nine eight six six that'll get you started. Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:16          but suppose you live in Montevideo, Uruguay, or in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, a country which no longer exists, then you can't. What do you have to do then? Just go to radiolab.org/donate that's what I always do whenever I am in central Europe, South Asia or South America. Again, it's really easy, so don't be intimidated by it. Now as we promised, it is time for you to meet some people whom you hear on our show, but have never really met Arianne wack producers a part of our show. She's never met them either. So this was her chance to find out about them, our chance to find out what Kerryann found out.

Speaker 3:          02:50          Hello. Is this Terri? Did I lose you? Did I lose you? Hey. Hi. Hi. How are I'm good. How are

Speaker 4:          03:00          you?

Speaker 5:          03:00          I was so touched. It was your email.

Speaker 4:          03:03          Well, I do want to hear emails. All right. So I decided to call up this woman that I have just been desperately curious about, uh, for years now since I've worked here. What's on your mind? What can I do for ya? Um, the reason, well, I've been wanting to reach out to you, um, for a while because part of my job here is to listen to all of the spots that come in for our underwriting and I like choose the reads and produce them and put them into the episodes I need to go in. Oh, um, cool. Well, thank you for what you do tobacco for a second. We have our listeners submit underwriting reeds via the app and we put them into the brakes of our shows. If you've listened to the show with any regularity, you've probably heard this. And Hey, this is Terry Babcock. Lou Mitch support for NPR comes from NPR station. Terry Babcock. Lou mish does every single one of them. This is Terry Babcock. Lou Is Terry Babcock. Lou Ms. Henry Babcock is Terry baths. Terry back documentary. Babcock was married. Terry Babcock more than 300 times. And I know that if in a pinch I need a spot quick. I know that there's going to be a read from Terry Henry Babcock, the Cochlea Mesh.

Speaker 5:          04:12          Are you tired of hearing my voice or this way?

Speaker 4:          04:14          Yeah, no, that's why I wanted to call you guys because there's three of you that leave. I'm I to read almost every single piece of copy I put up. And so especially, you know, I, I think you've probably been doing it the longest out of any of them. So I remember like when you move that cochlear mish from cold spring, New York from like cold springs, no hottest is Terry Babcock. Lou Mission, Honolulu, Hawaii down to Honolulu. And like, I know like when your husband is around, hi, this is Brian Babcock, Lou mish and this is Terry. Listen occasionally like hip hop in. Yup. Yeah. And so I just, I feel like I kind of know you. Um, well, I mean it is all based on like evidence that I've, you know, gathered from your phone calls and the background noises and whatnot. But my gosh, seriously, this is really fun. What's your hypothesis? My hypothesis will you lived in a cold spring for a while and I was like, she doesn't, she sounds too young to be like a, like a snowbird. So I didn't think that you guys had moved for the weather. Like somebody must have gotten a job down there.

Speaker 5:          05:26          Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:27          Uh, and then you have grandkids. And I was surprised. I had heard them a couple of times, or at least they sound like little kids to me. Maybe they're not going to have kids. Uh Huh.

Speaker 5:          05:38          Anything because technically I don't think we're even old enough to have grandkids.

Speaker 4:          05:42          Okay, good. Yeah, so I've got conflicting narratives here. That's still pretty good. Okay. You want the real story? Yeah, I would love the real story.

Speaker 5:          05:50          So my background is government. I was the White House economist and First Clinton administration. Oh my God. There is no reason why I should have gotten up with an army guy. Um, fell madly in love. So he's active duty military. Okay.

Speaker 6:          06:03          So we move every two or three years with it.

Speaker 5:          06:06          Army assignment,

Speaker 6:          06:08          summer 2014 I, we got assignment to Hawaii and that's where we lived. Or sorry, that's the short version.

Speaker 4:          06:14          That's great. I love having the background actually that makes me so happy. Yeah. Have you ever heard yourself, um, when you, like you've listened to radio lab, have you ever heard one of your reads?

Speaker 5:          06:24          So I haven't, you know,

Speaker 6:          06:27          right on a regular basis I'll get an email from a former student or a friend or whoever it might be saying that they heard me on radio lab and it's always so nice to go hear from someone that I feel so detached from or we're just far away from. But no, I've never,

Speaker 4:          06:44          yeah. On do you have a favorite episode?

Speaker 6:          06:47          I don't know, but I think one of the things that I love is that you take things that are very complex and you make ideas, whether it's, you know, CRISPR Cas, nine or infectious diseases or black holes or things. I don't even know that I'm going to be interested in you make them not just interesting but accessible and exciting. And then I remember it and then I wonder,

Speaker 5:          07:09          talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. So let me ask, do you have a favorite?

Speaker 4:          07:12          Well, um, I mean there's frequently 30 different drafts of an episode, so it's hard to like hear the finished product as just a listener again and not being like, oh, I didn't Depop that p there, you know, like other room tone there. I could have smoothed that out or something, you know? And I miss, I miss that a little bit.

Speaker 6:          07:33          Yeah, it sends out of it that way. I'm so, yeah, I need to do it, but I really do.

Speaker 5:          07:37          No, it's totally fine. It's fine. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker 4:          07:42          I guess, I mean, I, I want to know like why you do it? Like, why, why you're so committed to like giving to us in this particular way.

Speaker 6:          07:51          So I feel like what you've asked of us is so little. And so whether it's public radio asking for a check or it's me writing some credits, it's something I can do. Thankfully it was fun.

Speaker 4:          08:04          Okay.

Speaker 6:          08:05          And it's interesting and you know, wherever we've lived, I've wanted to, you know, even if the case on pledge drive, you know, to be involved with public radio, I think, you know, it really is the soundtrack of my life and I could be wrong, but I feel like for plenty of people, they're concerned that they can't get as a big check that they sign Gibbs and I, I'm often very quick to challenge that assumption. Um, you know, I think about the people who are busy or for people who can't write a big check, you know, eating just a little tiny, what would the be present of your coffee? I think people, yeah. Like that's not enough. But those copies that up and I don't think we should underestimate our collective power with our coffee. Yeah. Um, and so in New York, if I can take you for a cup of coffee. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          08:54          Oh, I'd be happy to because I really am.

Speaker 4:          08:57          Yeah, no, that would be great. Thank you so much. This was a, I really enjoyed this conversation

Speaker 5:          09:02          so by, it's been such a pleasure and I have to admit I was very surprised by your call. I didn't know if you were telling me like Sandown like retired.

Speaker 4:          09:11          No, really. All right. Thanks so much Terry.

Speaker 5:          09:19          Bye Bye.

Speaker 7:          09:21          Minutia. Here's the thing about Terry is that she's one of a lot of folks who tuna Sian and then kind of join in. Like we have a, we have a very unusual audience.

Speaker 2:          09:33          Yeah. You have an awesome audience. Radiolab listeners are the best.

Speaker 7:          09:37          Yeah. But in very particular ways, like, like when you meet them, they don't come and say, Yo, I really, whatever that thing you do, they don't do that. They have like very specific sort of either compliments or arguments, but if their listeners, meaning they've listened.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Robert, I think what you're saying is the listeners, you listeners, not only do you give your time, you give your brain, yes, the brain, the brain. Let's also remember you give contributions is what keeps radio lab on the air and in order for 2017 to knock it out of the park, like 2016 did we need you to keep doing that? Yeah. Yeah. If you were just sitting here just sitting there and about like maybe, okay, maybe now what would you do right now if you wanted to, you would go online to radiolab.org/donate to give it is Radiolab spelled it's two words or one? No, it's just one. That's right. Or even easier. Just text that one word, Radiolab to the number six, nine, eight, six, six to get started. That's if you're in the u s you can do that in any case though, you can get it handled in a matter of seconds and we thank you for it. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          10:49          they really do. Now, and introduction to one of our listeners who I recently met, the three things that I say I love about this country. Uh, first of all, um, you know, drinking water coming out of your faucet, it's insane. You're, you're, you're thirsty in the middle of a shower. You just open your mouth and you're done. It's incredible. So this is my uncle Mishra. He's a graduate student in ecology at Princeton University. Then there's a bike lanes, which are fantastic but clean. Yeah. Because you should try riding a bike, uh, in Calcutta. Delhi. It's uh, it's, it'll definitely get you closer to God. That's right. Yeah. God does exist in India. Yeah. So my young started out as a civil rights lawyer in India, often defending people whom he thought had been jailed without cause. He left for the United States in part because he had sued the man who was suddenly became the prime minister of India. And he thought, well, maybe I should, uh, you know, go somewhere else. Uh, and the third thing I love about this country was into that. I mean, just really great internet where I could listen to things all the time. And often I heard radio lab when I first started listening to podcasts,

Speaker 8:          12:03          I first met my young after giving a lecture up at Princeton University. He came up afterwards and he said, oh, I want to tell you about the first time I heard radio that was okay. He said that he was on a road trip with some of his fellow students.

Speaker 7:          12:15          So I was supposed to be navigating, I was just graduating from my master's in public administration from Princeton. We were done with school, but we were still getting to know each other because you don't, now that we were done with it, we knew each other, but we didn't quite know where everyone came from. And we were going to beach house. The entire class was going there to sort of see farewell and you know, spend a few days together. And I was supposed to be navigating and I got everything wrong and we went miles away and I started talking about, um, how I had to deal with the loss of my father. And then my grandfather, both a Michael just friends and um, and you also having to deal with the fact that we were going to leave this place behind and leave this community behind that we had formed over the past two years. The first one I had in the u s someone said, you know, there's this incredibly greed episode by radio lab on life after life. I think it was,

Speaker 8:          13:15          that was our afterlife episode. It was a series of meditations on death

Speaker 9:          13:20          on this hour. We ask that question a dead, what happens at the very moment when you slip from life to the other side and what happens after?

Speaker 7:          13:32          And we started seeing it. It was just done silence through the entire thing. And one of the, one of the things that always stuck with me is that, um, I remember you were talking about a group and it said that what happens when the group disperses and people go their separate weaves. Does the group die or do they carry it with them?

Speaker 8:          13:53          This was a short fiction piece by the neurologist David Eagleman, which was read on our show by the actor Jeffrey tambor. When soldiers part ways at war's end, the breakup of the platoon triggers the same emotion as the w. Well, the death of a person, participants amble away feeling that they were just part of something larger than themselves, something they intuit had a life, even though they can't quite put a finger on it in this way, death is not only for humans, but for everything that existed. And it turns out that anything that enjoys life enjoys an afterlife.

Speaker 7:          14:31          And then there was something about when you pass away, uh, what happens to the, to the things that make you up when you die, you're aggrieved by all the atoms of which you were composed.

Speaker 8:          14:43          They hung together for years, whether in sheets of skin or communities as spleen, but with your death, they don't die. Instead they, they part ways moving off in their separate directions. Mourning the loss of a special time. They shared together actually haunted by the feeling that everyone's playing parts in something larger than themselves. Something that had its own life, something. Um, wow. They can hardly put a finger on

Speaker 9:          15:19          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          15:19          Yeah. And I think, I don't know, I had not told about things that we, um, I'd had never told about where life begins and where it ends.

Speaker 8:          15:27          And my uncle mentioned another Eagleman piece that caught is a year from the same show.

Speaker 7:          15:31          There was this one thing that you said, which was that one way of looking at death is when the last person speaks your name. Yeah. That's when you're gone.

Speaker 8:          15:42          There are three depths now. The first is when the body ceases to function of course. And the second is when the body is consigned or you know, put in the grave. The third is that moment sometime in the future when your name is spoken or the last time,

Speaker 7:          16:07          oh, with my father and my grandfather, you know, the DV, forget them, the d, You know, we've stopped passing on their stories and no one remembers them. That's when that's when they are gone. That's when they are actually gone. So you're listening to this, right? And the other few people listening in, there's this kind of deep quiet in the car. Yeah. And then what happened? So that happened and then that was my introduction to listening to podcasts and then I started listening to Radiolab more. And what would you do? Have a lot of time on your head. What was going on after school? What happened to you? So what happened was, even in school, I had been a lawyer and I had reached this point where I taught, um, you know, I was done with human beings. I was done with human rights. I was done with all of that stuff because I felt like, no, we were just too far beyond saving.

Speaker 7:          17:01          Um, and I feel like I'm clearly, this is not where I should be because there's a bigger world that I clearly have some affinity to. But what did you, what did you decide to do? Like what was the nude? I wanted to go back to school and I wanted to study ecology and, um, I attended a class on ecology and completely blew my mind and I decided that, you know, clearly I'm not on the right part and maybe this is the part I should be on. I remember we were living in Brooklyn right across from the botanic gardens and even through the winter I'd go there and I'd be listening to radio lab and, uh, I, you know, every time I think of radio lab, I think of, um, smiles and tears sort of streaming down my face because there's all of so much that sort of backed into it.

Speaker 7:          17:50          And I'd be sitting there in the cold, in the snow, in the botanic gardens, no one else around with a small notebook, ah, listening to radio lab. And every time something would come into my head, I had jotted down. So sitting there in the botanic gardens listening to us, like, what, what did that do for you? So open me up and held me together. Did both things right. Um, opened me up to this new world of, of ideas and thoughts. And a community of people who also have similar thoughts, who also want to find out more about what's going on. Um, and also held me together because I was sort of by myself. Um, um, I, I'm very, very fortunate to have my wife with me and she was, um, I mean she's been a huge pillar of support, but we have both sort of stepped out of our comfort zones and I've thought about all of these things, um, to some extent because of Radiolab. You know, every time I hear the opening credits or radio lab, it feels like I've just stepped back home from the cold or something. It's just you don't shake off the snow from your jacket and settle in you. You feel like you sort of, um, solve something. I hope not. I hope not, but I certainly feel very happy about where I am. Um,

Speaker 1:          19:14          it's interesting because if you'll, if you listen to the show we do, we never solve anything. That's right. Yeah. I never do.

Speaker 7:          19:21          So you know what I, this was, this was something I've been thinking about a lot recently and I was speaking to a very close friend about this as well. And I was thinking about what is the role of scientists? And I found that more recently that there, there, there have been things that make me wonder what the scientific community is looking out for. Sometimes I think sometimes we're sort of caught up in our credibility and the fact that we must maintain this credibility and we shouldn't break rank. Um, but no one becomes a scientist because they read a really credible scientific paper. They read the, they become scientists because they're inspired by this world around them and they're just really curious about what's going on. And you inspired me to, to be more curious, right? Uh, to recognize that we don't have answers and sometimes just looking for questions is really enjoyable. It's a lot of fun, uh, right. And to do together to, to, to be looking for things together to go on this treasure hunt around life together. That's home.

Speaker 1:          20:35          Robert, I think I might be in love with my encore. Yeah. Well, I already am. I beat you there when we shook hands. I remember like holding onto his hand like for an extra beat because when you do this for a living, you don't do anything much more than tell a story. But if you can, if you can help somebody get out of a hole or climb a mountain or change, you know, change your life, then like that's cherry on top, super duper cherry on top. And that happens oddly not an often on this show. So that's really cool. And uh,

Speaker 2:          21:11          should I just say like if you listeners, if Radiolab has touched your life at some point in this past year, it doesn't mean that you had to have a career maker like my own. Maybe it was just like it made you smile or it made you think about something a little bit differently, right? We ask you to remember, are you part of a community? And this community, uh, is held together with listener contributions. It really is what keeps Radiolab going.

Speaker 1:          21:39          So let's suppose you were in the mood to give Radiolab something. How would you go about that? It's quite easy, Robert. Okay. Let me just take me through it slowly instead of,

Speaker 2:          21:49          well these are podcast listeners. Do they kind of get this whole digital thing fast? Yeah. So radiolab.org/donate place to go, or if you're listening on your phone, it's really easy opening up your messaging app that you've got there. Yeah, sure. I've got one of those mess app I call it. Yeah, that's very good. I liked the contract text. The word radio lab's spelled fully out to the number six nine eight six six that's six nine eight six six now what? Oh, now, oh yeah. We have another story to tell.

Speaker 1:          22:20          And this next one comes from our producer Annie Mcewen, who was um, who wanted to meet somebody who's, well, we all wanted to meet her. So here we go.

Speaker 10:         22:29          Okay. So a few months back we did a story called AlphaGo. Okay. Is your mic on? Yeah, I'm getting this. Making me nervous. And the star of that show was a woman named Amy Pearl. Maybe I should get my epi pen. Are you allergic to radio greatness? That I know of. I haven't been really exposed to it yet.

Speaker 1:          22:50          Yeah,

Speaker 10:         22:52          I'm Robert Krulwich. This, the story was about Amy pro's allergy to red meat and how she got that allergy to red meat. So I'm not gonna tell you any more. You should go listen to the story. Go listen right now. But the reaction we got from the audience on Twitter and in comments on our website, which is insane. Usually we get kind of like, you know, the odd comment here or there, love the show, hey the show, where's the science? Stuff like that. But this time I was just like this huge outpouring of deep, deep love for Amy Pearl. Like you know, get that girl her own show. She's incredible. She changed my life. Amy Pearl for president was one of the tweets and I felt the same love for her that everyone else did. And my job by the show is, you know, a lot of cutting tape and sound design and music and stuff like that. So I never actually like met her before, but I met her through her voice and I also thought, oh, she's very wise in ways that I feel like I really need in my life right now. And so this is one way to get, you know, bring more Amy Pearl back into our lives again, which feels good.

Speaker 5:          23:49          Hello. Hi.

Speaker 10:         23:51          Also, it was sort of an opportunity for me to ask a question. I wanted to kind of like, I recently moved here from a really small town in Canada and I'm trying to figure out how to like be a human being in this city and uh, just like, you know, not let it, yeah.

Speaker 5:          24:08          Well, I mean it's like, I mean, did you ever hear there's a famous saying, did you ever hear it? If you can make it here, you can pay kids anywhere. That rings a bell for sure. It's up to you. No, no. But it's really true. Everything is hard in the city. I mean, forget it. It's like, I'm like, oh, I have to renew my driver's license chapter. Your driver's side. Good. You're a big trouble. Oh my God. Everybody take the week off. It's not going to work out for you, Amy. I Dunno. Let's start a support group. It's just like everything is hard and like all you have to do is go for a minute. Like where my mom lives in Connecticut and I go up there and she's like, oh, I'm going to return something. Costco. I'm like, what? What are you kidding me? I'm only up here for two days.

Speaker 5:          24:54          You have to have it as, and she was like, oh, it'll be easy. You like drive up, drive into a parking spot, get out of the car. Walk one second. Let me help you. You're all set. Thanks so much. Bye. Get back in the car. Driving to your driveway. Park in the garage. I don't know why the city so hard. It's so hard. What do you do? Like what? What do I do? I mean, well for sure a good thing being in the city is if you know, if you wanted do good, you can. You can like, I'm sure between now and the time you get home tonight, you can like pick up someone's pen. Yeah. Like Fremont. Like tell somebody they have, they have like toilet paper on their shoe, helps someone and seems lost or like smile at someone that seems down or be like, oh my God, I love that book. That's like you have every opportunity to make someone else's day better, which you could just be like, I'm a superhero. If something happens, I'm going to rush over there and something might happen any second. I'm in a city. It's like, you know, and it's like when you're walking around the city, I always find treasures. Like if you look in the gutter, you just like pick up the foot of a Barbie and it just seems like so great and like, I don't know. Can you tell me,

Speaker 10:         26:11          uh, what's your, what's it like the last time you really saw the city as beautiful?

Speaker 5:          26:15          Oh my God. I think the last time I saw the city has beautiful probably last night.

Speaker 11:         26:23          Oh,

Speaker 6:          26:27          that was very dark. And I got my dog and we went out like on the block that I walk on all the time.

Speaker 11:         26:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          26:34          but somebody had swept all the leaves and there was a pile of oak leaf on the side and the

Speaker 5:          26:44          light from the house flicked on and every oak leaf was like silhouetted and that's such a pretty shape. And I was like, oh my God, these are just being thrown out by the tree, these even like of youth. And then I was like, wow, every single here at grows a brand new leaf and then drops it off and the girls, another one drops it off and girls another one drops it off at a month. Live for like 200 years. I'm like, imagine how many leaves the tree drops off. I'm like, where does it all go? And like what is all that energy coming from and why are they doing it? And it smells good and it's pretty

Speaker 12:         27:28          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          27:29          I mean it's probably covered in dog this, but I didn't get that close and I thought it was really beautiful and it was like, it was a good moment.

Speaker 2:          27:40          Oh Amy [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          27:43          Yeah, she's the best. You know like she was. So when you hear Amy Pearl Talk About Anything Dopey Dog pee is fine because Amy brill is what is what you would call a an n. S. T. What's that? A natural storyteller. Yes, there is no way. Yes, there's no way. She can't make everything interesting. And she, so when this tape came in, when we heard it, we went, oh my God, get her on the air and don't take her off. We could just live on Amy.

Speaker 2:          28:15          Now listen though Robert, there's a reason why we were able to get Amy Pearl on the show.

Speaker 1:          28:21          It's because of the pearls that our listeners who are, who feel precious but don't always do the thing that precious things have to do in order to keep other precious things alive and well,

Speaker 2:          28:32          I don't know what that means, but I think it was an attempt to say in a poetic way that people who love the podcast and give just a few dollars make this work possible. And exactly what was that? It? Okay. And I want to add something. We actually have some really great radio labs swag. There is. Yeah. There's a [inaudible]. Don't pretend you're not wearing the hoodie all the time. Well, it's a very warm hood. And if that's not your bag, there's a bag. Actually there's a knit winter cap, there's a t shirt, there's lots of swag and it, you know what it is. I feel like listeners, when you wear the radio lab's swag, I see you on the street and I am sure of it. When we look at each other, we give a little wink. Yeah. But you can't get the swag without making just a little donation. And we ask you to do that. Oh, funny you ask Robert, let me just tell you, radiolab.org/donate or even easier if you're in the u s text the word radio lab to the number if you're on your phone. Six, nine, eight, six, six to get started.

Speaker 1:          29:37          Next up. A story about a boy, his mom and Latif Nasser,

Speaker 13:         29:42          lots of his, our producer, he um, he missed out when we broadcast this, but he wanted to get into the game as it were. And here's what happened next. Yeah. And I actually chose [inaudible] our football episode, American football. It was actually the first episode I was on staff for I, I fact checked it and it had all kinds of things. It had a story about the history of football and the forward pass and the Carlisle Indian team, but it also had kind of what, what is the big question now? Uh, what's the future of the game? And that question was perfectly encapsulated by this interview with this woman. I'm Monet Bartell you could add something like if you want, I'm Monae Bartelle. I'm a Libra. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I'm just joking. So this story came to us from our senior editor, Soren Wheeler, who you just heard back there.

Speaker 13:         30:38          And basically the story goes like this. So Monet Bartelle is from a family that lives and breathes and believes football. Her Dad, Mel Pharr, the superstar was a star running back for the Detroit lions. He was a two time pro bowler. Both her brothers were professional football players. And so for Monet, when she had her first son Parker, as soon as the doctor saw his third thumb, like, dude, we're going to the NFL baby. Yes. And then Parker's 10,001 ounce. He's the biggest thing. He walked out the wound, I'm still going with third until Monet. She signed Parker up to play in a league when he was four years old and they immediately, they named him the tank. The moment he gets on the field, he is just plowing through kids getting touchdown after touchdown tay. But this is where things get complicated because while Parker is on the field just dominating, Mooney has a relative who played football for a very long time and was experiencing symptoms of CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is what comes from like concussion question after concussion symptoms include memory loss, sometimes bouts of anger. In this case it was depression, it was suicidal thoughts. It was,

Speaker 14:         32:07          it was getting phone calls like, Hey, I need you to come get him because he's having dangerous thoughts. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         32:16          And Monet told us that eventually her father started experiencing symptoms of CTE as well. And that put Monae in a very difficult position because on the one hand she believed that children should not play football. But then at the exact same time she believed children should play football. That it's a great sport and ask for Parker. When I asked Parker how did he, the season, his favorite things were the trophy and the pizza party at the end. He had no desire. You want to play again next season? No, there's no or favorite moment of this whole story and a lot of listeners too was when come sit with me, I need to sit on your lap. Parker comes home from school and sits down with Soren and Monet and Soren asks him, look, if you don't like football anymore, do you like other sports or do you really care about that evening? I really want to do synchronized swimming. Is that true? Is that true? Wow. I'm mostly, because when I saw something about it, it looked kind of cool. Like um, people are doing a lot of cool swimming tricks. So I kind of thought it was something for me. You playing me synchronized swimming where this guy's gonna come talk to me about football and I'm going to tell him that I want to do thicker nights. Right? No, you like it this way and so, hello? Hello? Hey Man. Hey, how you doing?

Speaker 6:          33:56          Hey, I'm good with you. How are you?

Speaker 13:         33:58          You called Monet because at like every time now that I see football in the headlines, I think of her and I wanted to see how she was doing. All right. Also like, like that tiny interview with your son? Just uh, like I, I think about it all the time. He's kind of my hero.

Speaker 6:          34:15          It has grown legs. I swear because of that interview I was contacted about a month ago from ESPN.

Speaker 13:         34:24          Really

Speaker 6:          34:25          reached out to me and they came out here and spent three days interviewing Parker, following him around. Oh, you can't tell Parker anything now he thinks he's hot. S. H. I. T he has now. You said in the interview with ESPN and you know, I know they were waiting for him to say he was going to be a synchronized swimmer. Now he switched it up. Now he wants to play dodge ball.

Speaker 13:         34:49          Hey, good sport. Although there's a lot of, there's a lot of like unlike synchronized swimming, dodge ball, it's kind of a

Speaker 6:          34:55          contact sport. Yeah. He's not gonna he, I don't even think he plays bad fall in gym. I just think this kid live some embarrass, embarrassed the crap out of me. But, um, the, the series is about the level of football and you know, they said, aside from Parkers, you know, let's

Speaker 13:         35:14          okay.

Speaker 6:          35:16          Residents in, in a fell, in my immediate family, it was the thing of that oxymoron. The fact that I love football so much and that football is still extremely, you know, dangerous. You know, my father passed away last,

Speaker 13:         35:31          oh my God, I'm so sorry. Oh yeah, yes.

Speaker 6:          35:34          The way in August of last year, which I'm through with all for a loop. My Dad was like the healthiest person that we know and he, he, he dropped dead. I talked to him that morning. Uh, it was a Monday and by 7:00 PM that evening, he, he just, he just, he just kind of slipped away. Um, and we got his results back. Um, you know, we did send his brain and spinal cord and my dad was at stage three of four with CTE.

Speaker 13:         36:05          Oh Wow. And that's the kind of thing you can only find out after someone's dead. Right, exactly. And was that, were you sort of expecting that? Not at all. Oh really?

Speaker 6:          36:14          My father suffered from CTE. Bad jokingly would say my having a conversation with my dad towards the end of his life, yeah. Would be like a 51st dates because my dad will tell him, he'll, he'll talk to you like, Hey, you remember such and such and such? And I'm like, yeah, Dad, I remember, hey, you remember such and such said my breath,

Speaker 13:         36:36          but

Speaker 6:          36:37          you don't really, you know, you don't think about it. And then getting the results of that from my father, I'm like, God, you know, stays for CTE is Mike Webster.

Speaker 13:         36:48          Uh, just to jump in here, Mike Webster was a former professional player who was suffering from Amnesia, dementia, depression. He died at the age of 50.

Speaker 6:          36:56          Dave for CTE. It's junior say out

Speaker 13:         37:00          junior. Say Al was another former professional player, shot himself in the chest at 43 years old.

Speaker 6:          37:06          Very four is something that these families are suffering because they're watching their loved ones who can't take it anymore. So they think that taking their lives is the easiest way to go. That's the only way to calm whatever it is that's going on in their mind because they can't even explain what's going on. I'm thankful I didn't have to do that. I cried when I watched junior, say I was mom in the press conference. I cry when I watch that because I can't imagine as a mother, um, as a sister, as a wife, as a daughter, I can't imagine watching my dad or my brothers or my uncle or my cousin go through life like that because both of my brothers are exhibiting size now. That's all I can really think about is now what about them?

Speaker 13:         37:58          Yeah. So is there, what can you do? What can they do?

Speaker 6:          38:00          That's the crazy thing. You can't prepare for it. You can't, you can't stop it. There's absolutely nothing you can do and fill with that. Mine were at football every Friday night cause my nephew plays.

Speaker 13:         38:18          He just got pumped up. You know,

Speaker 6:          38:23          I'm happy now that I can laugh and I can smile because I was completely, I, I turned into like a vampire when just out of nowhere. When you're just okay, talk to you later. Yeah. And then there never is a later. Yeah. That, that's a tough one.

Speaker 13:         38:44          Did, did your dad, uh, before he died, did, how did your dad feel about football? How did he feel about CTE? How did he feel about all of this stuff?

Speaker 6:          38:54          If you asked my father, he would tell you I would not have changed a thing. If you look at when my dad was growing up, you know, my dad was in an air where it was separate but not equal. He didn't have indoor plumbing. He had to drink from a colored only water fountain. My Dad would tell you, he said, man, I ain't never had a drink cold. Once I got to la, he didn't even know what that feels like. What is this going down my throat? So cool know. So being, being smart and black wasn't enough. If he would have been black and didn't play football, even as smart as my father was, where would that have gotten him? You know, wouldn't have gotten him to two dinners at the White House. Would it have gotten him, the private jet would have gotten him the, you know, the, the house and us, these private school educations and all that would being a smart black guy in the early forties in the forties, would that have, what would that have done?

Speaker 6:          39:51          He was able to build a life playing for the Detroit lions who is owned by the Ford plant family. And then being able to go and intern at Ford, you know, in the off season and then opening up a Ford dealership. And then from there branching off to what, 14 new car franchises. But she, he left with, with all of us, um, to be able to carry on that legacy so it won't be in, in vain. Um, we have started a foundation where we're building on it little by little, just trying to figure out where and what avenues we want to go in. We know education is huge and you know, that would just want to bring awareness, especially to mothers who put their young children in football as I did. Just to be aware of what the dangers are. Are you willing to sign up for that? So now I'm going to, I'm really thinking of tricking Parker and it becoming like

Speaker 13:         40:52          kicker [inaudible] a kicker.

Speaker 6:          40:59          It's tricky but however he is his middle school math.

Speaker 13:         41:02          Oh really? Well I was, I was the mascot of my high school. What is here was I was Griffy the Griffin.

Speaker 6:          41:10          Yeah, Parker is the alligator. I forgot the alligator's name

Speaker 13:         41:14          definitely. But he's the alligators. How does he like being the alligator? He loves it and he has like a costume that he wears. He wears an entire furry head and everything like eating up into some kid. Who is this kid? He, he, he starts Babin and like he's this other kid. And so my husband, the first thing my husband says is

Speaker 6:          41:40          he's like the mascot cause they still get a ring, right?

Speaker 13:         41:46          No

Speaker 6:          41:47          now I'm like we're going to keep you in mascot tourism, whatever it's called because there's scholarships. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         41:52          And a lot of them will be their mascot scholarship. Yeah. Our mascot scholarship. No.

Speaker 6:          41:57          Yes. I know I'm thinking way ahead of time. He's only in the fifth grade.

Speaker 13:         42:00          So is he like, he's developing like dance moves or like are there signature merits?

Speaker 6:          42:04          He gets it on Fridays. He greets the kids in the morning. He's got to get there early, you know, put on his costume and he's out there in the Carpool lane greeting kids as they come to school. He does the special events at the school. Like he did the fall festival and the trunk or treat

Speaker 13:         42:20          a man.

Speaker 6:          42:21          One of his teachers won teacher of the year award so he got to go to the teacher of the year award ceremony.

Speaker 13:         42:26          Well as a mascot, like he's just living it up. I hope he, he wins all the mascot scholarships and everywhere and makes it pro, you know, is it is it's probably cut throat to go pro for mascots. Yeah. I don't know how that goes. I don't even know how that goes. I have no idea.

Speaker 6:          42:45          Even when we get there and how much do they get paid, you know, all these other, but Parker off, let's be an engineer.

Speaker 13:         42:50          Okay. I'm sure he could do both. He could do both. Absolutely. Thinking about what you said about your dad, I hope for Parker that he will be able to get that engineering, you know, that being smart will be enough. Or, or if he wants to be a mascot, he can get all the scholarships, go to whatever school he wants. He does not have to put his body in harm's way if he doesn't want to.

Speaker 6:          43:12          Right. He doesn't have to. My oldest nephew, um, Trey, he until recently had the title as the smartest kid in the family.

Speaker 13:         43:21          He,

Speaker 6:          43:21          he played football, but he made a plan, hey, I don't want to go pro. I'm going to play in college, but I'm gonna go to a college that's going to give me a head start. So she went to Brown. Wow, great at Brown, won a ring, did well, and now he's off doing his brown thing in San Francisco, making great money as a young black guy because he was smart, not because of football. So what? I love to see my son in a football jersey. Sure. But am I thrilled to see him in the alligator outfit?

Speaker 13:         43:51          Absolutely.

Speaker 15:         44:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:02          So we can't offer you listeners a mascot scholarship that is really beyond our reach and we, and then you'd have to choose your animal and we'd have to make the uniform. Yes. So we can't, it's comp. It's a hard, it's fun, but it's a hard world. So we're going to streamline when, when we think about you, instead of thinking about animals or Griffons, it's about those guys. We're going to just think of you as I'm generous and now minutiae. Yes. If I wanted to be generous, yes. What would I choose to do? You would go to radiolab.org/donate or even easier. You could text the word Radiolab to the number six nine eight six six to get started. A little form pops up, Robert, and you can donate in a matter of seconds and then you can go back to thinking how awesome radio labs first spin off was two more perfect.

Speaker 1:          45:02          More of that's going to be coming up in 2017 you mentioned that because a lot of the people who've been listening to us to this past year noticed and or join, okay. A whole lot of people that we never heard from before became listeners to something we call more perfect. It just show about the Supreme Court of the United States. We thought of it because we thought the supreme court was going to be interesting. And now of course with 2017 yeah, we were right in spades because what's going to happen next year is gotta be, is this mean what will be near the center of a lot of conversations for a lot of people in 2017 so this more perfect Joe is coming back in the spring of 2017 more episodes. And so people who want to hear it again, it's coming. But listen, here's the thing. Listener support is a critical component of more perfect.

Speaker 1:          45:52          It's a critical component of radio lab. Any amount that you can give, just make a gift any amount, make a gift, and show that you understand that this is the, the time to get a year end tax deductible. It's also the time for us to be talking about things that matter in a year where these will matter a lot. So, so yeah, we'd like you to join us both because you want to and just because we think you should right now, if you know what I mean. Forget my drift next Robert. A story that captures that spirit of doing for others in a way that few can. Hi, my name is Tracy

Speaker 16:         46:26          hunt. I'm a reporter here at radio lab and I wanted to talk to someone who has a very different relationship with giving. Oh, Sarah. Hello. Sarah Gray. Oh, hi. There you are. How are you? I'm good. I'm so good. Thank you. Sarah was the star of a show that we did a little while back called grace donation.

Speaker 3:          46:42          I guess I'm like a little bit in your nerd famous now,

Speaker 16:         46:45          your nurse Venus. What is the weight? What does that mean?

Speaker 3:          46:49          Um, well just nerds know who I am. You know nerds who listen to radio lab.

Speaker 16:         46:53          Just a quick recap. Sara told us a story about how she was pregnant with twins, Thomas and Callum, and something was wrong with Thomas. Doctors told her that he had NSF Lilly being born and he said he could see that because one of the twins had around skull and the other one had a bumpy skull. She ended up giving birth to both of them and Thomas died six days later. And then right then we called the Washington regional transplant community and they sent a van over to our house and they picked up his body and took him to d c children's medical center.

Speaker 16:         47:32          So the story was about how Sarah ended up going on this journey, trying to find out what happened to all the bits and pieces of Thomas that were donated. So she talked about, for example, going to Duke University where they were using cord blood from her twins and they were actually researching the disease that killed Thomas Aniceph Lee and going to university of Pennsylvania and talking to women there who was studying this eye cancer that mostly affects children and called retinoblastoma. Eventually Sarah and Ross visited a as lab. She gave them a tour and she sewed them Thomas's retina. She still has samples of it in her freezer. Tiny little, I don't know, tiny little vials, maybe a third the size of your pinky filled with frozen liquid liquified retina already. It didn't look like much, but it was amazing to think of how many people were involved getting these samples.

Speaker 16:         48:23          They're like, we had to approve it. We had to fill out this paperwork, then the doctor had to come and remove the highs. The NYSE had to be processed, and then I'd have to be shipped up there. Then they have to do whatever DNA process they do and just how, I don't know, valuable, maybe even priceless. The sample is, since the show came out, she's released a book called an everlasting life. And I just really wanted to get on the phone with her and just talk about what the impact of the show has been and what's going on with her life. And one of the first things I found out was that she had a new baby.

Speaker 3:          48:56          Yes. We have a baby girl that she was just born in June.

Speaker 16:         48:59          Oh, congratulations. Thank you. And how's Callum doing?

Speaker 3:          49:03          He's doing great.

Speaker 16:         49:04          This is Thomas his brother.

Speaker 3:          49:06          He can now read a little bit because in first grade, um, and he's liking his sister. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         49:12          What, what have you told him about Thomas?

Speaker 3:          49:14          So he knows that he had a brother who was a twin who had a very, very, very bad booboo on his head. Yeah. And that's why he died. Um, and we just explained, you know, um, sometimes kids die. That's just part of life. People, you know, they get diseases just like grown up and it's okay to die.

Speaker 16:         49:33          Does he ask you questions about Thomas?

Speaker 3:          49:36          Yeah, we visited the grave maybe one or two times a year. And um, when he was younger he asked, um, is Tom Scared under the stone? So, and he was probably maybe two or three questions like that were hard because I, you know, I don't know how to explain the afterlife. I don't understand it myself. Yeah. So I just told him no, he's not scared. Um, you know, he thinks of Thomas as being in heaven, but he also asked me, you know, can you tell me what does it like in heaven? And I said, um, you know, I was really like sort of wringing my hands. Like, oh, what do I say? I said, um, well, you know, some people think it's a place you go when you die and some people think it's got clouds and, and Callum just goes, um, no, look it up on your phone

Speaker 5:          50:20          like you wanted the pictures. Yeah. Well, look, I just looked up on my phone, I'm like, you know, just be real. Be Real. But this is what people think. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          50:28          Can you show me a picture of God?

Speaker 16:         50:32          You don't?

Speaker 3:          50:33          Yeah. Sometimes it's hard and then sometimes it's easy. It's kind of a mixture.

Speaker 16:         50:37          Yeah, that's it. And also since the show, um, Sarah has kept on donating. In fact, when her daughter Jocelyn was born,

Speaker 3:          50:44          um, I was inspired to donate the placenta and the umbilical cord was turned into four different skin grafts that are going to be used in surgeries and for burn survivors and also the umbilical cord blood went to research,

Speaker 16:         50:59          but also she's been inspired to track down the people who have donated things to her.

Speaker 3:          51:04          As I was writing my book, I got this idea for checking down the blood donors

Speaker 16:         51:08          when she was in the hospital with the twins. She actually had a traumatic delivery. She lost half of her blood and she ended up getting a transfusion from 11 different blood donors.

Speaker 3:          51:19          So I emailed the blood bank and I've met with them and they have sent out a thank you letter from me to those 11 people.

Speaker 16:         51:26          And when Sarah was in the hospital with Jocelyn, Jocelyn actually got some donated breast milk

Speaker 3:          51:30          and I ended up saving the bottle, actually framed it. I keep it in my office because just tears me up to think of strangers donating things to each other. But I emailed the breast milk place and I said, this is my donor id for the breast milk. Can you tell me who? Who are the people that donated the smell? Can I send them a thank you? And this is all kind of like, I know I sound like a donation Weirdo, but uh, you know, it's like you receive and you give. And I just think it's neat to make the connection and find out how that really work.

Speaker 16:         51:57          Since we recorded the episode with you, have you heard any like anything new come out of the research using your son's tissues?

Speaker 3:          52:04          So there a study that came out on tissue that could be my son's cornea,

Speaker 16:         52:09          this lab in Boston. They've been studying corneal blindness because when your corneas are damaged, those cells,

Speaker 3:          52:16          once you lose them, they're never coming back.

Speaker 16:         52:18          They don't regenerate. They're just dead.

Speaker 3:          52:20          That's what people have corneal blindness.

Speaker 16:         52:22          And so they're trying to figure out ways to regenerate them. So

Speaker 3:          52:25          they took corneal cells and they wounded them

Speaker 16:         52:28          and then added umbilical cord blood to those cells

Speaker 3:          52:32          and they found some early stage steps to show that these corneal cells might be able to regenerate with stem cells, which I believe is kind of what they're getting at as a possible stem cell. Eyedrops to get your vision back.

Speaker 16:         52:45          Oh Wow.

Speaker 3:          52:46          So this is like way, way, way in the future, but at the beginning of, you know, what if situation that, what if we could make eyedrops like this?

Speaker 16:         52:54          You check like the, the research often. How often do you,

Speaker 3:          52:58          whenever I feel like it,

Speaker 16:         52:59          does it feel like you're kind of like kind of continuing your relationship with Thomas in some way by checking on these things?

Speaker 3:          53:09          I don't, I don't know what you call it. I feel like Thomas, um, you know, he lived and he died and he made this contribution and I'm like a spectator kind of watching how his contribution effecting other people. Yeah. And I'm, I'm more like learning from him then having a relationship with him, but I know, yeah,

Speaker 16:         53:35          yeah, yeah. I, yeah, I'm not sure if that relationship is the right word. I was just trying to like, it's almost, I dunno, I don't want to say like, it's like he's still there and nothing like that. I just, you know, like he's like, he's still very much a part of your life in some way.

Speaker 3:          53:51          Yeah. He's still relevant. Yeah. His life did not just affect my family, his life affected many other people.

Speaker 16:         53:59          And in fact, Sarah told me that eight months after the show came out, she heard from this couple in Cali,

Speaker 3:          54:06          husband and wife in California, they had twins and unfortunately one of them died unexpectedly and I believe they asked could they donate on the group said you cannot donate for transplant because your child is too small. And I said, well, we heard radio lab, can we donate to research? And they said yes. And their daughter was able to donate eight different tissues to eight different studies.

Speaker 16:         54:30          Oh my goodness.

Speaker 3:          54:31          Yeah. And in fact the retinas

Speaker 16:         54:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          54:34          we went to the same um, lab and the same researcher that received my son's retinas.

Speaker 16:         54:40          Oh Wow.

Speaker 5:          54:41          I know. Oh. And the other weird thing is that they're twins were born on the exact same day as my twins

Speaker 17:         54:47          pets. Oh my goodness. That's so, that's so powerful. I don't know. I'm really, I'm really kind of speechless at that. No, that happened.

Speaker 5:          54:55          It did for me at least bring back. So, you know, when my child, I, you feel like you have no control, but being able to donate gave me a sense of control back that, you know, at least this is, this is one thing I can control.

Speaker 17:         55:08          Right.

Speaker 5:          55:09          So I was glad that it had that impression. It had that effect on them.

Speaker 16:         55:16          Sarah talking to me about trying to regain a sense of control and the face of unimaginable grief reminded me of something else she said at the end of grace donation. I used to think like the universe treated people the way it should. And now I don't really believe that, but, um, I do believe that there are, um, really amazing kind people in the world and science and medicine has something to do with that. I started feeling that these were Thomas' colleagues in his coworkers and that he was a valuable partner in this important research that was being done. And I felt even more fundamental shifts, almost like I had felt like I was a boat on an ocean that was like rocky and choppy with waves. And I had this feeling that I am not the boat. I'm the ocean. Like the decisions that I make are changing other people as opposed to just, I'm about getting slapped with waves all the time. [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         56:25          it has made me feel powerful. [inaudible].
