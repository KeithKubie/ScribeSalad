00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.200
Seatbelts and airbags in cars save passengers
lives.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.480
Parachutes save people who, for a variety
of reasons, exit a plane in mid-flight.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.220
So why aren’t parachutes provided to passengers
on commercial airline flights, in case of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220
emergencies?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.480
Because they almost certainly would not save
anyone’s life.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.650
Parachuting Basics

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.120
When your average daredevil skydives for fun,
the plane is typically travelling at between

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.140
80 and 110 mph when the skydiver jumps.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.149
Tandem and accelerated free fall (AFF) jumps
occur between 10,000 and 13,000 feet, while

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.170
static jumps can be as low as 3,500 feet.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.390
Student divers choosing the easiest, tandem
jump, where the newbie is physically and securely

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.050
attached to an experienced instructor, are
still required to undergo “a half hour of

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.050
basic ground instruction.”

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.350
Braver neophytes who wish to fly untethered
will have to endure:

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.710
Four to five hours of intense ground instruction,
including learning body flight maneuvers and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.549
hand signals that instructors use to coach
the student as they fly alongside.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.960
For an AFF jump, although not harnessed together,
freshman flyers are accompanied by two instructors

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.230
who “hold onto the student’s harness until”
it’s deployed.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.670
Those who choose a static line jump also have
to take four + hours of training prior to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.430
the jump, although the parachute is deployed
as the rookie flyer leaves the aircraft.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.960
When skydivers leave a plane, they do it alone
or in small groups.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.290
When successive groups will be jumping, they
try to keep separated by anywhere between

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.670
500 and 1500 feet; this is often accomplished
by waiting until the preceding group is “back

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.670
under the tail to 45 degrees behind the airplane”
or several seconds in between groups.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.000
Experienced skydivers can make even riskier
jumps, although when descents begin at higher

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.939
than 15,000 feet, “the risk of hypoxia and
being significantly affected by altitude”

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.479
increases dramatically and divers are less
able “to make effective safe decisions at

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.479
critical times.”

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.640
Therefore, divers who jump from 15,000 feet
or higher carry supplemental oxygen.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.570
Further, each parachute weighs around 40 pounds
and the equipment is expensive.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.330
To be fully outfitted with “rig, main, reserve,
ADD, altimeter, jumpsuit, helmet [and] goggles”

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.980
can run between $5,900 and $9,000.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.359
Commercial Airplane Basics

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.730
Perhaps the most popular commercial jetliner
is the Boeing 737 family.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.539
Its 737-800 can carry nearly 200 people (including
the crew).

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:49.070
Although speeds can vary slightly, the 737-800
travels at approximately 600 mph when at its

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.090
cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.190
Cruising altitudes are assigned by air traffic
controllers and are usually up to 39,000 feet,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
except for longer flights that may fly higher.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.170
Individual Parachutes Won’t Improve Passenger
Safety

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.590
Doing the math . . .

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.730
Passenger Training

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.900
Since four hours of training just to board
a plane is unrealistic, passengers would have

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.250
to read and execute detailed skydiving instructions
including how to properly strap the chute

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.930
on in order to benefit from the parachute.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.720
Not everyone is good at following detailed,
technical instructions even when time and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.180
stress aren’t a factor.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.180
In a situation where the plane is going down
and one has only a moment to get the parachute

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.549
properly strapped on (likely while keeping
an oxygen mask firmly attached and perhaps

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.190
also needing to keep the seat belt on to keep
from being thrown about in the cabin), it’s

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.490
unlikely most would be able to even get this
far.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.699
Every Man for Himself

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:50.261
Unless passengers wanted to fly suited up
and tethered for a static jump, parachuting

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:55.280
from a commercial airplane will be an AFF
jump; however, unlike the conditions that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.300
students get – training and trained instructors
to assist, commercial passengers will just

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.850
have to learn as they go.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.810
In addition, they will have to keep calm and
proceed in an orderly fashion, which will

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.280
require most to patiently wait their turn
to exit.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.980
This is not likely to happen.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.940
Parachuting Equipment is Bulky

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.510
Adding just parachutes (not counting helmets,
altimeters, etc.) for each passenger would

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.810
add another 8,000 pounds or so to the flight’s
weight.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.550
In addition, that equipment would take up
space, that is already at a premium.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.660
Parachuting Only Makes Sense if Something
Happens in Mid-Flight

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.420
The only feasible time for people to jump
from the plane is while it’s cruising.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.600
However, most fatal airline accidents occur
on airplanes during takeoff and landing.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.020
Consider that between 2003 and 2012, only
9% of all fatal accidents on commercial flights,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.050
seven total, occurred while the plane was
cruising; moreover, at least one of those

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.340
accidents happened as a result of wind shear
or thunderstorm.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.760
This is a situation where parachuting is extremely
dangerous even if you’re an expert.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.940
So even if parachuting were feasible from
a jetliner, the conditions in which parachutes

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.500
could theoretically save lives are almost
never apparent in fatal commercial accidents.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.300
But even if they were, it still wouldn’t
be a good idea.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.620
Jetliners Cruise Very High and Very Fast

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.320
At 35,000 feet (three times higher than a
typical jump) every passenger would need high

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.500
altitude equipment (HALO) that includes an
oxygen tank, mask and regulator, flight suit,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.350
ballistic helmet and altimeter just to manage
the thin air.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.220
Or they could just pass out from hypoxia and
wake up later, hopefully when the parachute

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.170
automatically deployed at under 15,000-20,000
feet.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.150
Of course, none of this would matter since
the plane is moving so fast (600 mph), and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.950
it is so large, that many passengers would
almost certainly smash into it and suffer

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.840
debilitating if not fatal injuries.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.930
Whole Plane Parachutes May Save Lives

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.120
There is hope, however.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.250
Over the past few years, many small planes
have been equipped with whole-plane parachutes

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.210
that slow the craft’s descent.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.380
As of late 2013, the largest planes equipped
with these safety devices carry five people,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.240
but plans are in the works for putting them
on larger crafts.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.970
As one manufacturer said, “There is no doubt
that big commercial airlines of the future

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.030
will be equipped with some kind of parachute
recovery system.”
