00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.360
Unless a director’s number one priority
is performance, actors are lucky to get a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.139
couple rehearsals before going to camera for
a role.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.760
If an actor is given the luxury of time to
prepare and makes use of that time, there’s

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.260
a much better chance they’ll produce something
memorable.&nbsp;

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.730
Here are 10 Shocking Ways Actors Prepared
For Famous Roles&nbsp;

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.750
Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight
What some actors may have approached as a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.259
classic comic book villain, Heath Ledger saw
as an opportunity to create something more.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.790
To prepare for his role of the Joker in The
Dark Knight, Ledger secluded himself in a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.390
hotel room for about six weeks to develop
the psychology and mannerisms of the maniacal

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.390
clown.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.910
With a lot of prescription drugs and very
little sleep, he invented a deeply disturbing

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.660
yet mesmerizing character that silenced all
the naysayers.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.809
It was a process that left a permanent mark
on the actor and on film history.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:56.809
&nbsp;
2.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.039
Cast of Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;
All eight actors playing the soldiers chosen

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.269
to save Private Ryan had to attend an intensive
boot camp training that included a military

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.320
physical regiment and camping in soaking wet
conditions.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.999
When they all voted to quit, their votes were
overruled by Tom Hanks, who played their commanding

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.999
officer.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.450
As Private Ryan, Matt Damon didn’t have
to attend boot camp.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.670
Spielberg hoped this would make the rest of
cast of resent him, and the cameras would

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.600
catch them hating Private Ryan.&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
3.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.359
Mickey Rourke in Iron Man 2
Serious preparation can be a risky business,

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.960
and that risk doesn’t necessarily pay off
every time.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.649
Mickey Rourke was very hands on with the development
of Iron Man 2’s Ivan Vanko.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.859
Adopting a Slovakian accent, he learned most
of his lines in Russian, visited a prison

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.569
in Moscow, and paid for the character’s
gold tooth and pet bird out of his own pocket.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.569
All interesting choices, but unfortunately
Rourke’s eccentric Whiplash didn’t gel

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.759
with Marvel’s more straightforward tone.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.649
4.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.429
Cast of One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest
The actors became patients and the patients

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.549
became actors when filming 1975’s One Flew
Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.759
To create a believable film about life in
a psychiatric hospital, director Milos Foreman

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.120
had the cast live in the Oregon State Hospital
and interact with actual patients who became

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.150
extras in the film.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.879
Today it’s easy to recognize Danny Devito
and Christopher Lloyd, but apart from Jack

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.019
Nicholson the cast was all unknown at the
time, making it even harder to tell the performers

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.110
from the patients.&nbsp;

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.290
5.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.799
Christian Bale in The Machinest&nbsp;
We’ve all heard of actors gaining or dropping

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.660
a few pounds for a role, but Christian Bale
took it to the extreme in 2004 when he dropped

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.420
63 pounds to play an insomniac losing his
mind in The Machinist.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.920
To achieve this stickily figure, Bale had
a daily diet of a can of tuna, an apple, and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920
lots of cigarettes to curb his appetite.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.829
This is the most weight anyone has ever lost
for a role, and if Bale had his way he would

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.959
have gone even further, but the producers
feared for his health.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.660
As soon as filming wrapped, Bale was carbo
loading and helping his body bounce back for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.879
his first outing as Batman the following year.&nbsp;

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.150
6.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.480
Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot&nbsp;
No list of actors who went to to extremes

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.349
for their role would be complete without the
king of method, Daniel Day Lewis.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.390
The film that first gained him this reputation
was My Left Foot, where he played a character

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.109
suffering from cerebral palsy.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.189
Lewis reportedly broke two ribs during filming
to help maintain his hunched over position.

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.519
He also refused to leave his wheelchair between
takes and required help for every day activities

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.329
like eating and dressing himself, just like
his character would.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.609
It clearly worked as the role would win Daniel
Day Lewis his first Oscar.&nbsp;

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.400
7.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.249
Harrison Ford in The Fugitive&nbsp;
It’s been rumoured that Harrison Ford prepared

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.620
for his role as surgeon Richard Kimble in
The Fugitive by assisting in actual open heart

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.620
surgery.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.049
Whether or not that’s true, Ford could have
used surgery himself when he damaged a ligament

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.400
in his leg while shooting.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.099
Instead he opted to postpone treatment and
incorporate the limp into his performance.&nbsp;

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.099
8.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.709
Halle Berry in Jungle Fever&nbsp;
Halle Berry’s first film role was not an

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.709
easy one.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.239
Audiences were introduced to Berry as a crack
addict opposite Samuel L. Jackson in Spike

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.389
Lee’s Jungle Fever.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.090
Lee originally thought Berry was too attractive
for people believe her in the role, so to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.459
demonstrate her dedication, she didn’t shower
or bathe for the duration of her 10 days on

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.459
set.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.769
Feeling dirty and uncomfortable helped Berry
get into character, but she had to apologize

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.159
to anyone who caught a whiff on those final
days of shooting.&nbsp;

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.450
9.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.410
Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver
After being cast in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.090
Driver, Robert De Niro got a cab license and
spent a month working 15 hour days as a cabbie

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.400
in New York City.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.810
Even though he’d recently won an Oscar for
his work in The Godfather II, he was only

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.940
recognized once.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.800
He also studied mental illness and PTSD suffered
by many Vietnam veterans at the time, helping

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.030
Travis Bickle emerge as a fully formed character
who would become one of cinema’s most iconic.&nbsp;

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.780
10&nbsp; Jared Leto in Suicide Squad
With Heather Ledger’s posthumous Oscar winning

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.030
performance still fresh in everyone’s memory,
Jared Leto had to work extra hard to create

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.240
his own version of the Joker and separate
it from Ledger and Nicholson’s beloved interpretations.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.419
On top of working on his lean and mean physique,
Leto was heavily involved in choosing the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.680
look of the Joker and creeped other actors
out on set by never breaking character and

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.080
sending strange gifts inspired by their roles.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.840
The jury is still out the results of Leto’s
process, but what we’ve seen so far has

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.050
made for a pretty sinister Clown Prince of
Crime.&nbsp;

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.020
Aspiring actors take note: it never hurts
to go that extra mile if you can.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.710
There are endless ways to approach any role,
and the more creative you get, the more likely

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.110
you’ll deliver something special.&nbsp;

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.210
Did we miss any?
