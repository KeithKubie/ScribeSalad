00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.879
Hello, and welcome to the kitchen. I wanted
to invite you here today because last week

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.269
we started off in my bathroom and kinda feel
bad about that. And also because

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
as I'm making lunch today I wanted to sort
of use it as a lab. During this time in my

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.320
kitchen I'm going to talk to you about three
different things:

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.350
1) the three most important molecules on the
Earth

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.430
2) possibly the grossest sandwich I'm ever
going to eat

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.430
3) an obscure scientist who taught us almost
everything we know about urine.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.350
So far we've talked about carbon and we've
talked about water, and now we're going

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.659
to talk about the molecules that make up every
living thing

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.359
and every living thing in every living thing.
I don't care if you're a bacterium or

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.730
a blue whale or if you're Lady Gaga, of if
you're a mite living on the Queen of England's eyelashes.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.339
They're called biological molecules. These
aren't just building blocks, these are the

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.429
molecules necessary for every living thing
on Earth to survive. They are essential sources

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.300
of energy. They are the means of storing that
energy. They are also the instructions that

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.210
all organisms use to be born and grow and
to ultimately pass those same instructions

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.430
on to their future generations.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.050
They are the ingredients for life.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.000
And we call them: the carbohydrates, the lipids,
the proteins, and the nucleic acids.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
Today we're going to be talking about the
first three. It's no coincidence that we

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.640
classify them in the same way that we classify
food, because they're food. [Hank so smart!]

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670
And for this classification, we have to thank
a little-known English physician who hundreds

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.330
of years ago dedicated his life to the study
of human pee.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.260
Oh, my goodness... I'm back in the-

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.260
That must mean that it's time for the most
awkwardly named segment here on crash course:

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.260
Biolo-graphy.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.170
His name was William Prout. In the early 1800s,
he became fascinated with human digestion

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.470
especially our urine. That's because
he thought the best way to understand the

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.619
human body was through chemistry, and the
best way to understand body's chemistry was

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.670
to understand what it does with food. By day
he was a practicing physician, but every morning

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.159
before breakfast he did research in his home
laboratory in London. And there he did many

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.420
great things. Like, being the first to discover
that our stomachs contained hydrochloric acid.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.689
And writing a breakthrough book about kidney
stones called

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.569
An Inquiry Into the Nature and Treatment of
Gravel, Calculus, and Other Diseases Connected

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.950
with a Deranged Operation of the Urinary Organs.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.480
And he was, of course, the first person to
discover the chemical composition of pure

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.569
urea, the main component of urine.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.239
For the record, here it is: CO(NH2)2. And
in the presence of water, urea gives off ammonia,

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.639
which is why your pee smells.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.879
Through his years of studying urine, Prout
came to the conclusion that all "foodstuffs"

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.510
fell into three categories: the saccharinous
(carbohydrates), oleaginous (fats), and albuminous

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.709
(proteins). Indeed, he went so far as to say
that in order to be healthy, you needed to

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.379
eat all three of these things and not just
sheep kidneys and gin, which is what most

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.049
of London was living on at the time.

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.420
But like many great minds, Prout was overlooked
in his own lifetime, because while he was

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.439
studying actual science, everyone else was
walking around believing that the color of

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.680
your urine was determined by your personality.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.950
This guy looks like a total jerk to me!

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.849
And if you can tell that much by color I wonder
what you could tell by taste.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.450
Now he isn't understand that there were biological
molecules

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.480
He didn't understand what these things were,
but he did understand that there were three

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.769
ingredients necessary for life. And it turns
out that all organisms either need to synthesize

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.730
or ingest those ingredients in order to live.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.969
We're going to start out with the most basic
of these ingredients for life: Carbohydrates.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.290
You've no doubt heard of them. You may,
in fact, be avoiding them like the plague.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.209
But fact is that nothing, and no one, can
avoid carbohydrates, because they are the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.579
source of all energy that we have available
to us.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.169
Carbohydrates are made up of sugars, and the
simplest of them are monosaccharides. Mono

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.939
for one, and saccharides for the actual root
of the word sugar. The star of the show here

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.349
is glucose, because it's truly fundamental,
by which I mean like Number One on the global

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.799
food chain. Because it comes from the sun.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.860
All biological energy is originally captured
from the sun by plants as glucose through

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.150
photosynthesis. And every cell that needs
energy uses glucose to get that energy through

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.000
a process called respiration.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.060
In addition to glucose there are other monosaccharides,
like fructose, which has the same molecular

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.599
formula (C6H12O6), but arranged differently.
These subtle chemical difference do matter.

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.379
Fructose, for example, is significantly sweeter
than glucose. It's also processed by our bodies

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.460
in different ways.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.139
And then there are disaccharides which -- like
the name says -- are just two monosaccharides

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.550
put together. The most famous of these is
sucrose, which is simply a glucose molecule

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.389
and a fructose molecule joined by a covalent
bond.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.780
Mono- and disaccharides are pretty much little
niblets of energy that are really easy for

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.569
our body to process, but when these carbohydrates
start to form into longer and longer chains,

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.139
their function and their roles change as well.
Instead of being sources for instant energy,

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.440
they become storehouses of energy or structural
compounds.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.629
These are the polysaccharides. Instead of
being just two or three monosaccharides put

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.720
together, polysaccharides can contain thousands
of simple sugar units.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.270
And because they're so big and burly, they're
great for building with. In plants, cellulose

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.409
is the most common structural compound. It's
just a bunch of glucose molecules bound together

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.759
and it is the most common organic compound
on the planet.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.240
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to digest.
Cows can do it, but humans certainly cannot,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.300
which is why you don't enjoy eating grass.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.150
Polysaccharides are also really good for storing
energy and not just structurally but just

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.860
as an energy store. And that's where we get
bread. Now, really interesting thing here:

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.490
Bread is made up of starch, the most simple
of which is called amylose. Amylose and cellulose

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.650
looks almost exactly identical, but one is
grass and the other is bread.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.470
Like, chemistry! [Well said.]

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.449
Plants store glucose in the form of starch,
and it comes in lots and lots of different

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.689
forms, from roots and tubers to the sweet
flesh of fruits, to the starchy seeds of the

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.939
wheat plant that end up being milled into
flour.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.789
Ground-up grain is the main ingredient in
the bread, of course, most of the calories,

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.240
or energy content, comes from carbohydrates.
When I eat this -- and I am going to eat the

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.639
hell out of it -- I'm going to be eating
all of the chemical energy that this wheat

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.530
plant got from the sun in order to feed it's
next generation of seeds that we then stole

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.569
for our own use.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.680
Now we, as human beings, can't grow fruits
or tubers, so we have to store our energy

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.120
in a couple of different ways. The way that
we tend to store carbohydrate energy is in

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.539
glycogen, which is very similar to amylose
or starch, but has more branches and is more

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.590
complicated. It's basically made up of the
glucose we have left over after we eat and

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.509
it sits in our muscles where it's ready to
be used and it's also stored in our livers.

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.259
It's generally a pretty short term store.
If we don't eat for a day pretty much all

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.919
of our glycogen gets depleted.

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.259
But over the longer term, the way we store
energy is through

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.689
Fat! All of our mom's worst enemies: the fat.
Which turn out to be really important and

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.169
are the most familiar sort of a very important
biological molecule: lipids.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.689
Lipids are smaller and simpler than complex
carbohydrates, and they're grouped together

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.960
because they share an inability to dissolve
in water. This is because their chemical bonds

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.909
are mostly nonpolar, and since water, as we
learned in the previous episode despises non

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.009
polar molecules, the two do not mix. It's
like oil and water.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.370
In fact, it's EXACTLY like oil and water!

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.919
And if you've ever read a nutrition label
or seen this thing called the television,

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:45.069
you're probably pretty conversant in the
way we classify fats. But then 99% of us have

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.249
no idea what those classifications actually
mean.

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.689
Fats are made up mainly of two chemical ingredients:
glycerol, which is a kind of alcohol, and

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:57.030
fatty acids, which are long carbon-hydrogen
chains that end in a carboxyl group.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.590
When you get three fatty acid molecules together
and connect them to a glycerol, that's a

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.650
triglyceride -- they feature prominently in
things like butter, peanut butter, oils, and

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.050
the white parts of meat.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.849
These triglycerides can either be saturated
or unsaturated. And I know that when we put

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:14.409
the word "fat" and "saturated" &nbsp;into
the same sentence it sounds like an evening

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:17.849
at KFC, but here we're talking about being
saturated with hydrogen.

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:21.999
As you hopefully remember from our first lesson:
Carbon is very nimble in how it uses its four

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:25.780
electrons. It can form single, double or triple
bonds.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.319
This means that if the carbon atoms in a fatty
acid are connected to each other with single

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:34.060
bonds, all of the carbon atoms end up connected
to at least 2 hydrogen atoms. And of them

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.110
even picks up a third. So the fatty acid is
saturated with hydrogen.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.200
But when some of the carbons atoms are connected
to each other with double bonds all of those

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.490
carbons' electrons are spoken for, so they're
not able to pick up those hydrogen atoms.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.839
This means that they're not saturated with
hydrogen and they are unsaturated fatty acids.

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:54.660
To demonstrate, may I direct your attention
to this jar of peanut butter?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.550
Here you can kind of see both kinds of fats.
The liquid stuff you see at the top here:

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.519
that is the unsaturated fat, which we generally
think of as oils. The pasty stuff down here

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:08.940
also contains lots of unsaturated fat but
also contains saturated fat, which doesn't

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.940
have any double bonds and so it can pack more
tightly and form solids at room temperature.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.240
And there are also other fat classifications
that you've heard of.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.170
Trans fats, which everyone tells you NEVER
to eat. They're right, don't eat them! They

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.899
don't exist in nature and are basically unsaturated
fatty acids that instead of kinking go straight

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:28.320
across and so they're super bad for you. Don't
eat them.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.250
Omega-3 fatty acids are unsaturated at the
3 position, which is like, right there [where?].

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.750
And that's the only difference, but the reason
that these are important is because we can't

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.980
synthesize them ourselves. They're essential
fatty acids meaning that we need to eat them

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.980
in order to get them.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.360
All this is starting to make me pretty hungry,
but before we get to more food stuff there

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.490
are some unappetizing sort of lipids that
we also need to talk about.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.430
So remember that triglycerides are three fatty
acid chains connected to a glycerol? Swap

00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:00.089
one of those fatty acids for a phosphate group
and you have a phospholipid. These make up

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:05.540
cell membrane walls. Since that phosphate
group gives that end polarity, it's attracted

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.779
to water. And the other end is nonpolar and
it avoids water. So if you were to scatter

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:13.529
a bunch of phospholipids into some water,
they would automatically arrange themselves

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:18.320
like this with hydrophobic ends facing each
other, and hydrophilic ends sticking out to

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.120
face the water. Every cell in your body uses
this natural structure to form its cell membrane

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.029
in order to keep the bad stuff out and the
good stuff in.

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:31.769
Another class of lipids is the steroids. Steroids
have a backbone of four interconnected carbon

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:36.060
rings, which can be used to form hundreds
of variations. The most fundamental of them

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.600
is cholesterol, which binds with phospholipids
to help form cell walls. But they can also

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.139
be activated to turn into different lipid
hormones.

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:50.959
And so now we approach the most complicated,
powerful, polymorphously awesome chemicals

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.690
in our body: the protein.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:59.339
And by complicated I mean that they are probably
the most complicated chemical compounds on

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:03.070
the planet. In fact, they are so amazing that
we're going to so a separate episode on them,

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:08.209
and how they're created by DNA. But right
now, in you, there are tens of thousands of

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.829
proteins doing everything they can to keep
you alive.

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:16.579
There are enzymes regulating chemical processes,
helping you digest food. There are antibodies

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:20.190
connecting themselves to invaders like bacterium
and viruses so that your immune system can

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.690
get them. There are protein endorphins that
mess around with your brain and make you feel

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.899
emotions [Gross!]

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:27.220
But they're everywhere, they do EVERYTHING!

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.829
And proteins do all of this stuff using only
20 different ingredients. And these are the

00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:33.839
amino acids.

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.940
Just like fatty acids, amino acids have a
carboxyl group on one end. On the other end

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.459
they have an amino group. Amino acid!

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:44.589
Now hey, I don't know if you've noticed
this, but this is the first time nitrogen

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:49.389
has shown up in our food. This is super important,
because despite the fact that nitrogen is

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.910
everywhere -- it's like 80% of the air -- we
can't just pull it out of the air and put

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.610
it into our bodies. We have to get nitrogen
from food. And so we have to eat foods that

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.269
are high in protein like this egg, which by
it's very virtue, because all the white part

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.230
is protein, it contains a goodly amount of
nitrogen.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.740
Now in the middle of the amino and the acid
group is a carbon. It shares one of its electrons

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.440
with good ol' hydrogen, and the other electron
is free to be shared with "R"

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.329
Which is just a kind of fill in the blank.
We call it "The R group"

00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:21.160
It can also be called a side chain, and there
are 20 different kinds of side chains. Whatever

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.600
fits in that blank will determine the shape,
and the function, of that amino acid.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.389
So if you put this in there, you get valine,
an amino acid that does a lot of stuff, like

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:33.000
protecting and building muscle tissue. If
you put this in there, you get tryptophan,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.709
which may be best known for its role in helping
you regulate mood and energy levels.

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:42.350
Amino acids form long chains called polypeptides.
Proteins are formed when these polypeptides

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:48.339
not only connect but elaborate and frankly
really elegant structures. They fold. They

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:53.620
coil. They twist. If they were sculptures,
I would go the museum every day just to look at them.

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:56.720
And I'd walk straight past the nudes without
even looking.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.110
But protein synthesis is only possible if
you have all of the amino acids necessary,

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.870
and there are nine of them, that we can't
make ourselves.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.120
Histidine, isoleucine, leucine

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.370
Lysine, methionine, phenylalanine

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.839
Threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:15.620
By eating foods that are high in protein,
we can digest them down into their base particles

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:20.329
and then use these essential amino acids in
building up our own protein.

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:25.199
Some foods, especially ones that contain animal
protein, have all of the essential amino acids

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:26.920
including this egg

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.540
And that concludes this triple-decker sandwich
of biological awesomeness, which is all we

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.250
need to be happy, healthy people.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.790
And I'm sure, because of that, it's going
to be delicious.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.790
Nope.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:47.019
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course. I will be discussing something else

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.630
very interesting next week. I don't even know
what it is.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.480
Don't forget. Go back and reinforce what you've
learned today by going back and watching bits

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.740
that you feel like you may not have got completely.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.920
We'll also, of course, be available on Facebook
and twitter if you would like to ask us questions

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.480
or give us suggestions there.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.740
