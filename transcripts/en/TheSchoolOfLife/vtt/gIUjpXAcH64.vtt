00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.760
It can seem a highly trivial subject to get
so upset about – being rightly no more significant

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.059
than who should open the door first, or open
a new jam jar first. And yet, judging from

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.660
the heartache it tends to generate, it appears
to matter very much indeed. It’s at the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.130
root of many affairs, it is the catalyst for
vicious arguments and bitterness, the long-term

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.820
future of small children can be decided by
it – and couples routinely end up in therapy

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.790
or (more often) the divorce courts because
of it. At the heart of the drama are all the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.510
complexities involved when, late at night,
in the darkness, one person’s hand moves

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.820
over to tentatively touch the other’s body
in a way that signals a desire to initiate

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.160
either sex or a cuddle – and nothing much
happens in return. This move ends up being

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.940
so much more fraught than one might imagine
because it has so little to do with making

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.170
love: it’s about knowing that we are wanted.
The willingness to initiate sex can appear

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.860
like the litmus test of whether one is appreciated
within the relationship as a whole – and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.130
therefore whether a couple remains a going
concern or not. For one person never to initiate,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.060
or else merely to respond half-heartedly to
caresses, is tantamount to declaring that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.160
they cannot possibly love the person they
are with.

In truth, a lack of initiation or response

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.760
can mean many things. It may, at points, simply
be a sign of exhaustion after a long day of

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:49.030
childcare or office work. Sometimes an untouched
hand is just an untouched hand. The real problem

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.670
in the ambiguous darkness of the bedroom is
not a lack of reciprocation per se, it is

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.790
the way that that ambiguity is interpreted:
the way that assumptions are formed without

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.540
discussion – and grave offence is taken
without the topic having first been aired.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.540
Beneath this lies a more pernicious problem
still: shame. Unreciprocated touch becomes

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.069
properly dangerous when it comes into contact
with a high degree of self-suspicion or self-hatred

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.060
on the part of the person who has dared to
slide their hand across. What might merely

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.150
have been judged an innocent or temporary
lack of enthusiasm comes to be taken – silently

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.780
and automatically – as evidence of something
far more catastrophic: proof that the other

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.010
person finds one disgusting. Ideally, if we
all loved ourselves enough, we would know

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.300
better what to do when we moved a hand across
and we did not get much in return: we would

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.450
address the matter within the couple through
calm and kindly discussion and tried to determine

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.800
what was at stake. If the evidence pointed
squarely to a profound lack of interest or

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.879
emotional capacity, we would leave. After
all, there is nothing wrong with ending up

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.400
sharing a bed with an emotionally or physically
withholding partner; there is something very

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.420
wrong, or at least very unfortunate, with
sticking around once one knows this is the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.500
case.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.769
But these are not options open to us when
we feel overly ashamed. Our unresponsive partners

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.530
reinforce pre-existing feelings of unacceptability
that render us bitter, mute and fragile. A

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.000
history of not knowing how to value ourselves
makes it extremely difficult for us to complain

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.100
effectively about unfortunate treatment – let
alone leave in order to seek warmer lovers

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.080
elsewhere. As self-hating lovers, we cannot
say, with the requisite calm and strategic

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.800
patience, that we feel rejected, need to be
understood and are looking for change. We

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.129
will either say nothing at all and might have
an affair – or else explode into a rage

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.709
that guarantees our message won’t be heard.
We won’t have the courage to interrogate

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.310
the signs and adroitly change the course of
the relationship in response. In the tensions

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.809
around unreciprocated touch, we catch sight
of a more general problem in love: the difficulties

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:24.919
created when we aren’t able to ask for what
we want in a relationship, when we suffer

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.509
from a sense that we don’t deserve to be
content and cannot handle frustration or respond

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:37.889
to our misery adequately. We should not leave
the untouched hand for too long in the darkness.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.160
We should dare to switch on the light, express
our pain and consider our options without

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:55.800
shame.
