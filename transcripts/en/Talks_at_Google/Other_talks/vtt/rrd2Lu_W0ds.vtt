MATTHEW BERNARDO: So I'm
Matthew Bernardo.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.330
I'm the Chief Development
Officer for Housing Works.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.980
And today, we're going to talk
a little bit about Housing

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
Works and our journey through
social enterprise.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.640
And really how it affected our
culture, and really how it

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.890
shaped the organization.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.160
So our mission is simple.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.530
It's to fight and to end
AIDS and homelessness.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.230
And we do this through
relentless advocacy.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470
We do this through
entrepreneurial services.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.920
And we do it through providing
lifesaving services.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.010
So a lot of people know about
our stores, and a lot of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
people might know about
our Bookstore Cafe.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.530
There might be some that know
about our advocacy.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.510
We have sort of a fierce
advocacy that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.290
comes out of ACT UP.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.310
Many politicians may know about
it because we're always

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.250
out on the streets
protesting them.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.760
There's a third part of our
business that is actually our

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.520
largest part, and that's
our health services.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.490
And they're really services that
wrap around our client.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.400
They're mental health, they're
dental, they're primary care,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.990
they're adult health
care centers.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.080
And really, the purpose of this
is a lot of our clients

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.000
come to us with multiple
problems.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.640
HIV/AIDS actually could be down
on the list for many.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
There's homelessness, there's
mental illness, there's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.570
substance abuse.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.110
And the idea is that our clients
come and they meet all

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.010
this sort of love and holding
environment, in which Housing

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.860
Works Services provide.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530
Housing Works is actually
the largest AIDS service

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.380
organization in New
York state.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.330
And this is probably the least
known of our business, but

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.000
it's one of the most
important.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.170
So to tell the story about
Housing Works, we have to go

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.770
back to 1990.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.370
That's when the AIDS crisis
was really full throttle.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.550
People were dying at
an alarming rate.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.860
There was really no hope in
sight for treatment or a cure.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.140
And when you got an AIDS
diagnosis in 1990, you had

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.910
about six months to live.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.500
So this was the environment in
which we were working at.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380
And to tell the story about
AIDS, you really have to tell

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.740
a story about ACT UP.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.960
ACT UP was really the first
reaction that was very

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.560
visceral to demanding services
and funding and a way forward

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.670
for the HIV/AIDS crisis.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.110
Housing Works actually started
out of ACT UP.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.700
It started as a housing
committee of ACT UP.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.530
And we were particularly
interested in people that were

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.560
actually dying on the streets
because they were homeless.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.210
So if you were homeless and
you had AIDS, you had two

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.070
things either happen.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.840
You either were discriminated
against because they weren't

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.800
giving housing to people
with HIV and AIDS.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.590
And if you were lucky to get
into one of the city shelters

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.850
or one of the city housing,
you basically had rules.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.600
So you had six months to live,
but you had a rule that you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.760
had to be sober for
four months.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.030
So if you think of it, what kind
of motivation for someone

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.000
that was struggling with
substance abuse that had AIDS,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.080
that they had to get sober for
four months so they could die

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.070
in their house for
the last two?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.190
So it really was something that
Housing Works set out and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.320
was determined to house
these people.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.670
So on the right, you can
actually see this painting.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.220
And this hangs in one of our
first housing units.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.460
And it really is about the
chaotic nature of the shelter

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.140
system in New York City.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.710
And what we were trying to do
at Housing Works was to

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.330
migrate away from that and
really come up with housing

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.130
with dignity, housing that was
independent, and housing that

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.150
had the services right
there, so people

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.960
could survive and thrive.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.440
So we started getting our
community together of people

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.950
we wanted to house,
and we started

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.410
incorporating ourselves.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.450
And the idea was--

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.800
I think it was $500.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.060
We raised our first $500 to get
the Housing Works name.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.195
And we also had a theory.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:27.210
And our theory was that if
you have stable housing,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.720
the rest will come.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.220
But you can't do anything
if you're not housed.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.910
So if you think about people
that you want to keep them on

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.680
drug regiments, or you want
them to be in a substance

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.080
abuse program, they're not going
to do it if they don't

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.830
have a place to lay their head
or get up in the morning.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.750
So that's basically been the
theory that Housing Works

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.000
really set out to solve
and to prove.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
And we've been proving
it with much success

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.890
for the next 20 years.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.940
So back to the '90s.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.050
So everyone was coming
out of ACT UP.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.400
Lots of AIDS service
organizations

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.540
came out of ACT UP.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.490
And there was a really
scramble for funding.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.000
So at that time, you had
God's Love We Deliver.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.350
You had Gay Men's
Health Crisis.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.540
You had amfAR.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.610
And there was a tremendous
amount of competitiveness for

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.840
AIDS funding.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.630
And Housing Works wasn't doing
so well in the traditional

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.840
fundraising realm.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.770
We actually didn't have the
natural circles of people and

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.370
networks that were really
deep pockets, that we

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.790
could really look for.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:42.150
So what happened-- one day, we
actually met a really unique

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.360
angel investor.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.040
And she came to us because her
husband actually was mandated

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.790
into community service for
some tax problems.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.180
And she was committed to
doing a million-dollar

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.630
fundraiser for us.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.830
And she actually came with some
credibility, because she

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.820
actually had raised $1 million
for a racetrack, where she had

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.140
this thing where she auctioned
off horse sperm from a very

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.040
famous horse, and she
raised $1 million.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.270
So we're like, OK, go for it.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.290
And she came back several months
later, and she says, I

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.200
don't think that the fundraiser
for $1 million is

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.510
going to work, but I have an
idea for you that's going to

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.800
make you much more than that.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.080
And Charles, our founder,
basically looked and said, OK,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.870
what is it?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.860
And she says, I want you to open
a thrift store for people

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.870
like me and my friends.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.460
Now Charles thought this was
a little counterintuitive.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.970
This was a very well-heeled lady
from the Upper East Side.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.250
And it didn't really
make sense to him.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.710
But she was committed.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.360
She says, I will stake the
first thrift store.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.070
And she put up $150,000.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.920
And Charles, not looking
a gift horse in the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.790
mouth, said, let's go.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.240
So we opened our first thrift
store in 1992 on 18th Street.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.760
We had a short-term lease,
because the landlord didn't

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.530
think it was a very
good idea either.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.830
We did a break-even analysis
that said if in the first

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.520
three months, we made $24,000,
we would break even.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.450
So the first two weeks, we
actually exceeded our $24,000.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.300
And really, social enterprise
in Housing

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.010
Works was off and running.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.370
So in the '90s we added a couple
more thrift stores.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.070
In 1996, we actually added
a catering company.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.930
In 1998, we added the
Bookstore Cafe.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.440
We continued to add stores.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.490
In 2004, we actually added
events that were shopping

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.280
events and related
to shopping.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.280
And just this last year, we
opened our first outlet store

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.730
called Buy the Bag.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.480
So all of this sort of totals
that we are now providing $25

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.750
million of funding to Housing
Works Services.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.670
And this is about 44% of the
total revenue for the

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.266
organization.

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:11.790
So to really look at social
enterprise and what it really

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.300
meant to Housing Works, you kind
of look at some pivotal

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.230
moments in Housing
Works' histories.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.070
So there were some threats that
sort of made us realize

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.670
how important social enterprise
was to us.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.650
So the first threat was in
the form of this man.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.560
Mayor Giuliani, in 1997, didn't
particularly like our

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.789
fierce brand of advocacy.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.600
He didn't like that we were
protesting him and following

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.990
him around and demanding more
services and funding for

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.120
people living with
HIV and AIDS.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.090
And he was very much determined
to put Housing

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.420
Works out of business.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.920
At that time, we actually had
about 500 units of at city

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.170
housing contracts.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.440
So we were housing 500 people
living with HIV and AIDS,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.520
being funded by the city.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.070
Mr. Giuliani, he sort
of turned his city

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.370
apparatus on us.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.030
He went out and ordered audits,
and ultimately said we

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.110
were misappropriating funds and
took our contracts away.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.720
So this actually almost
devastated Housing Works.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.010
We were almost out
of business.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.460
We had other services that
we were having a

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.470
tough time to pay for.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.330
And if it weren't for the
businesses, we would not have

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.230
been able to survive.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.690
Subsequently, we were able to
file a lawsuit against the

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.770
city and Mayor Giuliani.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.090
And we won and we were awarded a
$5.9 million settlement with

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.500
the acknowledgement that the
contracts were taken back

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.640
without cause.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.910
So we were on our way
and rebuilding.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.060
And one thing that it really
made us double down on-- we

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.450
were always committed advocacy,
but now, we were

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.960
making sure that because of
the social enterprises, we

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.830
could really have an
independent voice.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.010
We could speak truth to
power, and we were not

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.220
going to turn back.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.970
So really, that was the first
point where social enterprise

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.360
really kept Housing Works
afloat, and it really made us

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.120
double down on the advocacy.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.480
The second threat was
in 2008, when we

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.850
went through the recession.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:26.390
So at that time, a lot of big
donors were either taking a

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:32.280
donor holiday, or they were
pulling back, or not funding

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.550
charities at all.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.170
Many charities were actually
struggling.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.020
Some had to close their doors.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.940
Housing Works actually
weathered the

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.470
storm pretty well.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.110
And we had an interesting
reaction.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.780
We actually opened stores.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.180
So in 2009, we opened three new
stores, and we decided to

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.940
grow our way out of this.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.910
And so because of that, right
now we total about 80% of our

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.210
income is earned income.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.610
So it's either from billing
Medicaid for health services

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.360
or from our businesses.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:10.100
And that really makes it really
strong and powerful,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.570
for Housing Works to have that
kind of self-sufficiency.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.070
It's very much like
a submarine.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.640
Submarines can go underwater and
they can power themselves

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.030
for months at a time.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.070
And so sort of like a submarine,
Housing Works is

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.180
able to get through tough times
because we have this

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.610
reserve and immediate
cash flow.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.100
There were times that we would
go right to the register, and

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.050
it would go right into the
services the very same day.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:43.444
So it really is an immediacy
that was very valuable to us.

00:11:43.444 --> 00:11:45.910
The next threat is really
going on now.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.870
It's that the AIDS
crisis is over.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:53.120
That there's awareness that's
sort of not there anymore.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.430
Media is covering it
less and less.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:04.380
And really, if HIV and AIDS is
getting to a manageable place,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.120
the underpinnings of what makes
HIV and AIDS such a

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.930
devastating disease
is always there.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.020
And that's homophobia, that's
racism, that's poverty.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.270
So there will be another
opportunistic virus that will

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:21.140
take its place soon, once
HIV/AIDS is over, just like

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:26.260
there was always these things
present in our clients' lives.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.450
So one of the things that our
businesses has done for us is

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.110
it's really created awareness.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.530
So we were able to tap
into celebrity.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:39.220
We're able to tap into a unique
group of people that

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.890
were in design and fashion, that
were hit hard because of

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.700
HIV and AIDS.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.110
And we were able to sort of
keep the message going.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.320
And because of our businesses,
we can draw attention to

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.180
issues that our clients
care about.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.790
One of the things that the
social enterprise has really

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.050
done for the organization is
it's sort of been a little bit

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.150
of a culture clash.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.950
So I want you to meet
our senior staff.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.120
So our senior staff is obviously
not a cowboy and an

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.830
Indian, but they are chefs, they
are retail executives,

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.680
they are doctors,
they are social

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.810
service, social workers.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.410
And because of this, there's
an incredible exchange of

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.470
ideas, an exchange
of cultures.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.470
And undoubtedly, you're going
to influence each other.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.100
So the social services are going
to influence the social

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.040
enterprise, and vice versa.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.310
Two examples of how
this happened--

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.120
one is, our services really took
the brand of the ideas,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.010
like, we built an
upscale thrift.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:51.810
The idea was that we wanted to
create sort of a disruptive

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.230
image of what thrift-store
shopping was.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.270
All of a sudden you think of it
is as sort of disorganized,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.640
and a bunch of things that
no one else wanted.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.410
And we really took it as
retailing, that this is

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.410
something that you want
to go in and it's an

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.920
exciting place to shop.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.290
Very much so that we
carried that brand

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.840
over into or our services.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.090
You see up on the right
is one of our

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.370
housing projects in Harlem.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.200
And it is filled with Herman
Miller and Knoll Furniture.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.440
The idea is that you can make
deals with those vendors.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.950
They're much better quality.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.190
They will last longer,
instead of a

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.060
replacement of cheap furniture.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.130
And our clients will respond so
much better to it, and they

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.810
will find that they will take
care of things because you're

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.840
surrounding them with
beautiful things.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.090
And why should low-income
housing look

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.380
like low-income housing?

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.850
Same thing with our
health centers.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.110
Many health centers are dark
and dim, and they're not

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.670
lighting, and they're
not infused with

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.900
great customer service.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.020
So because we were doing retail
business that we had to

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.400
be so competitive, we actually
were able to bring some of

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.540
those sensibilities
into our services.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.610
And another way, the opposite,
that the social services, how

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.190
that affected our social
enterprise, was sort of back

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.680
to the '90s.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.560
People were starting to get
drugs in themselves, and they

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.300
were starting to feel
like life extended.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.350
And they wanted to get
back into life.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.060
There was a future for
people living with

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.520
HIV and AIDS again.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.590
And they wanted employment.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.380
At that time, Housing Works
would have sort of

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.340
peer jobs for them.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.890
They would be a messenger,
or they would clean up

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.510
afterwards.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.620
But they weren't really
sustainable, and they were

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.360
very part-time.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.940
So they actually, in the spirit
of Housing Works, they

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.610
actually did a sit-in in our
CEO's office, and they

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.720
demanded employment services.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.710
So out of that, our job training
program started.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.030
It was one of the first job
training programs for people

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.770
living with HIV and AIDS
in the country.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.740
It was unique in the fact that
after a nine-month period

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.970
where you were getting your GED
and on-the-job training,

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.960
you were actually guaranteed
a job in Housing Works.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.650
So 15% of our employees
are former clients.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:26.590
This has a huge impact on how
we view the businesses, how

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.010
all this works together.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.250
The walls came down between
clients and staff.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.960
Clients were able to sort of
mentor and empower themselves,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.390
as well as give back
to future clients.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.360
And staff and managers were able
to really look at, this

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.180
is what we're fighting for and
this is who we're serving,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.060
right alongside each other.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.900
So that was really a very
powerful thing that, from the

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.240
other side, social services
really impacted social

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.760
enterprise.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.810
You don't usually run businesses
like that, and

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.530
that's what makes Housing
Works unique.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:06.310
So some of our learnings of
how we got into social

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.200
enterprise, it wasn't something
that we sought out.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.520
It was something that sort
of fell into our lap.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.460
It's not necessarily for
every organization.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.990
People think it's just sort
of free, easy money.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.890
It really takes a lot to do, and
there's a lot of conflicts

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.690
and waves along the way.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.109
One of the first ones is
actually the tension between

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.800
the social services and
social enterprises.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.550
There's always a tension
for resources.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.410
Non-profits are not
traditionally funded well.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.860
So when you do have resources,
there's always sort

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.160
of a fight for them.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.210
Social services, they need
the resources right

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.800
now to provide services.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.320
Social enterprise needs
resources to invest so they

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.535
can get more profit down the
line, and to keep it going and

00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:57.410
to keep innovating.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.380
And it's also the idea of--

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.410
this idea of where you earn your
money is very different

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.340
than where you're spending
your money.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:09.190
So when you look at how you have
to reorient your whole

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.640
organization, about how you
recruit, how you brand

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.950
yourself, it's really about what
kind of culture that you

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.240
make out of this.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.900
So that was really our first
learning, is that tension that

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.160
you have to make sure that, if
you're going into social

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.770
enterprise, you do.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.160
The second thing is that social
enterprise, you don't

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.150
make money off of the mission.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.610
That's not why people
are shopping for us.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.380
It might be a little bit why
they donate to us, but they

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.910
certainly shop because we
have a good product.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.340
Our prices are well.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.850
They're clean stores, they're
entertaining.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.490
We always have something new.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.950
That's why people are
shopping, not

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.070
because of the mission.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.170
This is not like the other areas
of the organization, our

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.400
social justice part,
with advocacy,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.940
or our social services.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.120
That's really where your brand,
you're leading with

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.900
your mission.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.140
So it a little bit differently,
and you really

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.100
have to understand that you're
being competitive in the most

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.540
competitive city in the
world in retail.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.790
And if you can survive that,
you have to play by those

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.260
rules, not by the rules that you
would like people to shop

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.670
for you because they
like your mission.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.850
Another learning--

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.040
this could be a negative--

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.890
is that social enterprise can

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.400
overshadow your social services.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.140
If you google our Housing Works,
you're going to have to

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.870
get many pages in before you
get anything significant on

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.390
our social services.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:45.030
So this can be a problem for
sort of getting the word out

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.420
about what else you do, because
you're so popular in

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.300
social enterprise.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.810
We did about 500 million media
impressions last year, just on

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.740
our social enterprises.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.720
So that was just something that
sort of can overwhelm it.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:07.380
And even internal to the AIDS
industry, this can be true.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.760
We were at an event, and our
CEO introduced our chief

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.060
medical officer to the then
doctor at St. Vincent's.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.940
And he looked a little confused
about, why would you

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.050
have a doctor at
a thrift store?

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.860
So he obviously didn't even see
that beyond the Housing

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.090
Works, you had all these
different services that made

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.730
us the largest AIDS service
provider in New York state.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.800
So it's something that
you have to balance.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.320
And sometimes media awareness
doesn't always go the way you

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.560
want it to.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.010
And then perseverance.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.820
I think that one of the great
stories of Housing Works and

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.500
social enterprise is
our Bookstore Cafe.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.810
So we did open a bookstore
cafe in 1998.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.600
We did this because we
were full of books.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.810
We had three thrift stores and
they were sort of clogging up

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.420
all of our storage space.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.850
So we decided we were going
to open a bookstore cafe.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.190
And we invested a couple hundred
thousand dollars in

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.630
it, and it's a beautiful
space.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.150
If you haven't been there, it's
really one of the gems of

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.920
New York City.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.980
And the only problem with it is
for the next six years, it

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.590
didn't make money.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.120
It actually was losing money.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.660
And so here, something that was
supposed to bring money to

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.640
the mission is actually drawing
from the mission.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.720
So that's a huge problem.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.020
But we stayed with it.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.860
We knew there was potential
in the business.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.620
And 2003, we acquired a software
and we started

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.230
selling books online.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.730
And now we sell more books
online than we do in the

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.060
stores, and we started
becoming profitable.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.030
And then there was one more
piece to the story, is that

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.900
our space was really
beautiful.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.490
And we did concerts and
cultural events.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.190
But we really thought there
was a way that we could

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.090
exploit the space
and make money.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.230
At the same time, we had our
other business, which was our

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.290
catering company.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.110
It was hanging around.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.600
It was plodding along, it was
doing well, it was profitable.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:10.740
But we decided that if we take
our catering and we take our

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.330
event space, and why don't
we market weddings?

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:19.370
So we started to market weddings
starting in 2009, and

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.180
we started getting all
this response.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.740
You get a unique wedding
that's really still

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.900
inexpensive for New York City
in the heart of Soho.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.260
And just this year,
we booked and

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.240
produced about 70 weddings.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.780
So that's just another way
to just be adaptable.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.420
You have to find it.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.850
If you're going to be in social
enterprise, it's not

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.560
always easy.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.280
There's times that
you lose money.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.310
There's time that you
have to adapt.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.440
There's times that you have
to show patience.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.010
So these were sort of what they
meant to Housing Works.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.500
And this is our journey
of Housing Works.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.430
In fact, it was a mission
that was not--

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.520
we didn't start out as a
mission, but in 2009, we

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.220
actually added social enterprise
to our official

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.210
mission statement.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.940
So now it's relentless advocacy,
the provision of

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.740
lifesaving services, and
entrepreneurial businesses

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.140
that sustain our efforts.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.460
So this was our journey with
social enterprise.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.060
And that's it.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.650
MATTHEW BERNARDO: So is that
20 minutes or a half hour?

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.396
So do you have any questions?

00:23:27.396 --> 00:23:31.735
AUDIENCE: I was wondering-- so
is there an average cost that

00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:35.172
you can share with us for the
average wedding, any of the 70

00:23:35.172 --> 00:23:35.660
that happened there?

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.330
MATTHEW BERNARDO: It's
about $20,000.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.950
So the space is $750
an hour, sometimes.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.340
So in the end, that's
about $5,000.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:53.090
And then about $15,000 for food
and staff and rentals.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.580
So--

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.452
AUDIENCE: We're getting married,
so that's a very

00:23:55.452 --> 00:23:56.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:56.880
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Oh, is it?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.950
OK.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.350
Yeah.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.000
I mean for a New York City
wedding, it's still very,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.300
very, very reasonable.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.740
So yeah.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.690
AUDIENCE: And you [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.590
MATTHEW BERNARDO:
It seats 150.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.930
It gets 350 for buffet style.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.070
So it's a really interesting
thing, especially--

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.070
all the other stuff is cleared
out, and the books are sort of

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.355
the wallpaper, which really
makes it beautiful.

00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:25.510
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if you already

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.600
mentioned this, so apologies.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.760
But how many treatment
centers do you have

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.640
versus retail stores?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.540
MATTHEW BERNARDO: We have
13 retail stores,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.970
including Buy the Bag.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.550
And then we have a
Bookstore Cafe.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.690
So that's 14 in all.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.450
And we have a four
health centers.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.700
Obviously, the health centers
are much, much larger.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.510
And they're mostly in Manhattan
and Brooklyn.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.460
And then we have
housing units.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.640
We have 151 units of independent
housing.

00:25:02.878 --> 00:25:04.340
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.352
One, your early anecdote about
your first angel investor, you

00:25:09.352 --> 00:25:13.810
said she told you she wanted you
to start a thrift shop for

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.310
people like her?

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.310
Did you ever find out exactly
what she meant?

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.470
MATTHEW BERNARDO: She
meant that it was an

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.420
upscale thrift store.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.920
That the idea was that she
actually had the model.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.510
That the model of the thrift
store is that we actually go

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.030
in and we go into very expensive
neighborhoods,

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.460
because we get donations
from that neighborhood.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.510
And we then sell it to the same
people that are in that

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.000
neighborhood.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.870
So everything in retail
is about the product.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.340
So if we start out with a good
product and actually have the

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.180
donations that are high-end,
you're going to be able to

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.710
have a lot easier time
than selling it.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.390
So that's what she meant.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.940
She actually was right on.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.530
AUDIENCE: You didn't show those
pictures of the upscale

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.237
thrift store.

00:25:58.237 --> 00:26:00.190
Those didn't come later
in your presentation.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.570
Was the very first thrift store,
did it have that same

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.015
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:04.350
Was it in an upscale
neighborhood?

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.790
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Yeah, it was
on 18th Street and 7th Avenue.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:13.430
And then that lasted about six
months, and then we moved into

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.800
17th Street, which is
our flagship store.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.270
And it's on 17th between
Sixth and Seventh.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.470
And the idea was that we had a
couple things going for us.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.970
One is that we were able to
beautifully merchandise it.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.940
So we believed in merchandising
products.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.300
So our product were always had
these elaborate displays and

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.110
sort of a quirkiness.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.580
Each of our stores is sort of a
mirror to the neighborhood.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.970
So our Upper East Side store
and Chelsea are going to be

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.410
merchandised differently.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.540
So we had that.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.580
And remember, at the time, there
were many people that

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.300
were dying of HIV and AIDS.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.940
And we might not have been
getting the currency of their

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.440
cash, but we were certainly
getting their estates and all

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.890
of the furniture and clothing
that they were bequeathing us.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:03.170
So that really was able to
sort of seed a very good

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.410
product base for us.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.850
And then it sort of caught fire,
and we were able to go,

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.520
we ended up going online through
our auctions, and

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.356
growing from there.

00:27:14.356 --> 00:27:17.132
AUDIENCE: I have a second
question, if that's OK.

00:27:17.132 --> 00:27:20.356
When you were talking about the
bookstore, you said it was

00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:22.958
unprofitable for the first few
years, and then you took off

00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.750
when you started selling
stuff online.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.958
So my question is, at that
point, from a business point

00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:28.985
of view, how do you justify
the bookstore's continued

00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:31.940
existence, once you find out
that at least at that point,

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.470
the real money's in
online sales?

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.670
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Well, because
of the bookstore, we

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.990
were doing the online sales in
the basement, so it was part

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.870
of the whole rent.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.370
The bookstore was producing
revenue.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.170
It's just it wasn't
necessarily--

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.910
it was right around break-even
or losing money.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.010
And the bookstore brought
a lot of extra

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.650
things into the bookstore.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.970
Like we had authors
that we'd get.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.270
It would garner a lot
of media attention.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.580
We had concerts.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.620
We have John Mellencamp, John
Cougar Mellencamp that played

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.610
there, and Bjork DJed there.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.950
So there's a lot of things that
we could rationalize that

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:17.870
we were getting the awareness
out through it.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.170
And we were just sort of not
making it as a great business

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:22.830
proposition.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.820
Certainly, the time and energy
we were sinking into it wasn't

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.620
paying off in the first
couple years.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.155
But we believed in it.

00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:34.790
We believed as part of the
social enterprise, that there

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.320
was a way to make money, and
we would try a lot of

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:38.810
different things.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.580
Now we have a cafe that's
growing, and we have the

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.610
online that's growing,
and we have the

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.670
events that are growing.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.460
So it's sort of like,
sometimes you have

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.390
to figure it out.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.020
And sometimes just dumping it
costs more money there anyway.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:59.195
Because you have rents and
leases and so forth.

00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:01.640
AUDIENCE: So you kind of
discussed how the financial

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.041
crisis in 2008 kind of, in
a way, I wouldn't say

00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:09.464
vindicated, but supported the
social enterprise model, which

00:29:09.464 --> 00:29:10.442
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:10.442 --> 00:29:15.150
Like in large part also saving
financially while maintaining

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.940
your mission and goal.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.850
Do you think that that message
still resonates today?

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.040
Or do you think because of the
recovery, NGOs are kind of

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.880
going back to donor focus
and development?

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.120
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Well, I think
there's two things.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.160
One is that it's not completely
proven to the

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.730
letter of the theory.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.430
But the theory is that
secondhand stores can be a

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.650
little bit counter-cyclical
with the recession.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.960
So as people are sort of
looking for options to

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.600
exercise their shopping muscle,
they're looking at

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.050
other places that are
a better value.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:08.320
So with it, for example, 15% of
the people decided to shop

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.190
secondhand stores for
the first time.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.020
So people started being
introduced to

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.730
this in some ways.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.880
And so we do do slightly better
than regular mainline

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.770
retail on that.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.330
The second thing, as far as
traditional fundraising, we

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.530
really didn't have a traditional
development

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.770
department until like 2004.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.260
And what we learned is very much
similar to how we merged

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.950
the bookstore and the catering
to make it work.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.600
The businesses are really the
front door to our development

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.020
department.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.350
Now we are doing traditional
development at a better clip.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.240
We're getting individual
donors.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.390
We started a membership program
that actually is in

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.780
all the stores.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.040
So that was the first way that
people were actually giving

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.960
cash instead of just
giving product.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.530
Our events brings a really
well-heeled community into the

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.610
events, and we start
working them and

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.430
bringing them out to lunches.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:16.760
And we're starting to get some
multiple-figure donations, in

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.390
terms of the estates.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.380
Last year, we were able
to get an anonymous

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.346
donation for $750,000.

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:26.410
That was the first time we've
ever had something that large.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.430
So really, the businesses were
our front door to development.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.960
So we're taking advantage
of it wherever

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.950
they're coming in from.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.100
So we're getting much more
sophisticated about our

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.630
development now, so.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.582
AUDIENCE: You had a graph
that showed [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.570
Why do you think that is?

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:55.590
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Well, it was
that you were dying faster,

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.610
and that the circumstances of
being really vulnerable

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.080
allowed you to have
entree into this

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.340
opportunistic disease.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.060
So again, it goes back to sort
of, if you are not housed,

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.950
then you are living
a chaotic life.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.240
When you're living a chaotic
life, you're more likely to

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.220
get into situations that
you're finding

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.530
opportunistic disease.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.060
The story of HIV and
AIDS cannot be

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.340
told without poverty.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.230
It cannot be told
without racism.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.000
And it cannot be told
without homophobia.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.540
If you look at where it sort of
spread from, it started in

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:40.970
the gay community, and now it's
mostly in the people of

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:44.760
color and that's where it's
sort of transferred to.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.820
So you start seeing
a lot of these

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.906
underpinnings with the disease.

00:32:51.906 --> 00:32:54.351
AUDIENCE: How long ago did
Housing Works implement the

00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:56.310
auctions that they have
[INAUDIBLE] storefronts?

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.670
MATTHEW BERNARDO: We always
had auctions.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.050
We did it as paper auctions.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.210
So there was a time when people
would, we would always

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.260
do these windows, and people
would go in and they write

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.050
down the auction, and there was
a time that it would end,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:15.110
and everyone would crowd around
for the winning bid.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.200
And literally, people were at
the register, putting their

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.150
last bid, and then that's
how it was.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.090
So we then decided, well, that's
really only good for

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.050
individual stores,
and we're only

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.480
drawing from that community.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.220
So we decided to put
them online, and

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.330
we did online auctions.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.720
And we have
shophousingworks.com, which

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.540
does about $1 and 1/2 million
a year through our auctions.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.030
And it opened up the base.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.650
Now we have people all over the
country that actually buy

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.250
from it, and we ship
to most places.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.230
We have people in other
countries that

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.910
are buying from us.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:59.500
And also, the auctions were a
great way to sort of be a

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.410
check on that we're getting
the right price.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.180
Because it really is
an open market.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.190
So we had an example--

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:10.340
once we had this piece of art
that we were going to price.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.430
We priced it at $25.

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:12.929
We threw it in the auction.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.989
We figured it'll go
where it goes.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.570
$17,000 later, we realized that
this was a piece of art

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:19.530
that was worth it.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.110
I'm sure we've had something
slip through our fingers, and

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.409
that's part of thrifting.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.739
That's part of the game.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.290
That's part of the hunt, that
people want to find these

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.210
great things.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:34.179
But the online auctions have
really helped us put things

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:40.050
that we're not sure about on a
bigger market that we can get

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.489
the most for.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.763
AUDIENCE: That's a great
way of putting it.

00:34:42.763 --> 00:34:44.357
Like things that you're
not quite sure about.

00:34:44.357 --> 00:34:44.835
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Yeah.

00:34:44.835 --> 00:34:46.906
AUDIENCE: Because yeah, you
walk by, and you get that

00:34:46.906 --> 00:34:48.979
impression that there have got
to be some things that are

00:34:48.979 --> 00:34:50.035
true [INAUDIBLE], really.

00:34:50.035 --> 00:34:52.720
Oh, maybe I could have found
it in Housing Works in the

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.870
not-auction area.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.060
I've had a few wins there.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.929
MATTHEW BERNARDO: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:56.949
That's good, that's good.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.930
But generally, the rule is
anything signed, we try to put

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:06.450
in window so we can do that.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:07.910
MATTHEW BERNARDO: All right.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.260
Well, thank you very
much for your time.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.160
I appreciate it.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.527
[APPLAUSE]
