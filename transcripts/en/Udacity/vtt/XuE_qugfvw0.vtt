00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.540
So let's actually apply this to our real

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.440
example that we've been talking about in this

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.080
lesson, blood type and the ABO enzyme. So this is the ABO gene here and it's

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.310
transcribed into the ABO mRNA that you see

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.010
here. Now obviously you'll notice that the mRNA

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.190
copy is much shorter than the ABO gene

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.810
itself. And you'll also notice that exons and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.930
introns can come in all different shapes and sizes.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.290
They can be really big or really short. And they

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.370
don't have to be the same size even within a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.860
gene. So without me making it explicit and telling you

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.280
exactly where all the introns and exons are. I want

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.110
you to tell me, what do you think is most

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.930
likely an intron in this image? Do you think its

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.910
this big orange segment here? This smaller purple segment here?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.690
This dash black region out here, or this bigger purple section here?

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.360
Go ahead and select the answer that you think represents most likely an intron.
