00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.840
Airplanes are made of aluminum.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.089
Aluminum foil is made of aluminum.Why don’t
planes crumple and why don’t my aluminum

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.330
foil airplanes work?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.510
Hi flyers, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.750
Flying scares the bejeezus out of some people
but it’s actually one of the safest ways

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.750
to travel.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.190
That’s because along with the regular aircraft
inspections, strict regulations, and thousands

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.980
of hours of training pilots undergo, the aircrafts
themselves are made to withstand some pretty

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.840
incredible challenges.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.230
The wings of the Boeing 787, for example,
are engineered to withstand one and a half

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.440
times the most extreme forces it would ever
meet in flight.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.770
There are a lot of things that go into making
the wing that strong, like its design and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.770
construction.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.050
But the most important factor is the materials
used.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.389
Materials are where everything starts and
they determine how easy a part is to machine

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:51.460
or weld, how strong it is, how flexible it
is, how it behaves at different temperatures,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.030
how it stands up to corrosion, and how much
it weighs.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.339
These are all factors aeronautical engineers
have to consider when they’re designing

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.159
different components of an aircraft.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.430
And for decades, aluminum was the go-to material.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.770
Forty years ago, aluminum could make up as
much as 70% of an aircraft.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.850
Aluminum, though half as strong as titanium,
is lighter and, more importantly, much cheaper.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.439
It gets stronger at colder temperature but
stays ductile, and has it’s own anti-corrosion

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.439
mechanism.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.080
Today’s jets are only 20% pure aluminum,
but the metal is still present in abundance,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.549
it’s just mixed with other metals to form
alloys.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.510
Aluminum has so many alloys it’s hard to
keep track of all of them even though they’re

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.510
numbered.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.119
The most common one used for airplanes is
7075, which uses a little zinc, magnesium,

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.189
and copper as well as trace amounts of manganese,
silicon, iron, titanium, and other metals.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.299
The result is an alloy that’s as strong
as steel, but isn’t too difficult to shape,

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.299
drill, or weld.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.299
Techniques and technology for machining metals
is improving - making other alloys available,

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.299
that were previously too hard to work with.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.299
New alloys like titanium aluminide are replacing
older nickel based alloys that were twice

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.299
as heavy but just as heat resistant.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.299
In some parts of the engine metals are being
replaced altogether by parts that use ceramics

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.299
reinforced with silicon-carbides.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.299
The benefit of these lightweight parts is
that engines can operate at higher temperatures

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.299
and run more efficiently.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.299
Reducing weight anywhere in the aircraft is
always a goal because it means the jet has

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.299
to use less power to move - saving fuel.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.299
In the last decade, aircraft makers have gotten
even more clever with their materials in the

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.299
pursuit of lightness.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.299
Composite materials were first used for light
structural or cabin components, but more recently,

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.049
they’ve taken over metal for some serious
structural parts too.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.350
Composites are incredibly light and strong,
and can be molded into complex shapes.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.010
This reduces the need for heavy fasteners
or joints, which are potential failure points.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.610
Boeing’s 787 dreamliner was the first commercial
aircraft to use composites extensively.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.360
It has kevlar honeycombs in the wings to make
them light, flexible, and strong.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.160
The 787 also used carbon fiber to strengthen
the fuselage.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.550
This saves weight, and as a bonus, the cabin
can be pressurized more than previous aircraft,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.970
and composites can tolerate higher humidities
without corroding… making the ride more

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.120
comfortable.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.600
Carbon fiber was also used in the engine housing
to trap sound and make aircraft quieter.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.780
But engineers are never satisfied.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.820
They’re are constantly coming up with new
alloys, designs, and construction techniques

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.570
to make aircrafter harder, better, faster,
stronger.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.520
HRL laboratories, in a joint venture with
Boeing, recently developed the lightest metal

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
ever.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.370
The metal is arranged in a microlattice structure
which means it’s about 99.99% air.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.530
A light flexible material like this could
be used inside the cabin and save even more

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.930
weight on future aircraft.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.580
So that’s the technology making modern aircraft
awesome.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.500
But what about future spacecraft?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.180
What do we need to develop before we can rule
the galaxy?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.290
Julian talks about that here.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:28.070
Now that you know what planes are made of,
does that make you more confident in flying,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.720
or do you still get the shakes?
