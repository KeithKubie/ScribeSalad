00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.660
What I was thinking we could do is just kind
of look at the unique qualities of your first

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.470
layer and kind of think about how you want
to work with those qualities and decide on

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.500
a composition.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.180
So you’re playing artist now.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.570
Think about the composition that’s already
there and how you might be able to work with

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.340
it by adding black in some way.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.760
Does anybody remember what kind of medium
this paint was in?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.280
Oil?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.040
What?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240
It’s like an oily grey?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.220
It’s similar.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.649
It’s an alkyd resin, so it’s soluble in
the same materials that oil is

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.540
but this is a kind of paint that was first
sold as like a household paint, and was then

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.220
marketed to artists later on starting in like
the ’70s

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.581
so Rothko was more likely using something
that he picked up in the hardware store

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:08.740
or something like that.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.360
I’m going to give you just a little bit.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.709
Before you start painting

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:23.689
take a closer look at the little photos of
the Rothko

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.499
and I want you to just kind of absorb the
qualities.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.130
Like we did in the very beginning, we’re
going to really clean off the brush

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.490
like just pick up a tiny bit and just slowly
build it up.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.359
Do you see how at the edge of his shapes it’s
sort of feathered out?

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:47.709
So you can see sort of like a brushy edge
to it where it gets even more transparent?

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.840
This is a slow buildup of paint.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.800
And this stuff doesn’t come out of clothes,
right?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.820
I would try not to get it on your clothes…

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.320
Okay.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.820
Great.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.420
Does anybody remember what kind of layer I
put on for you this week?

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.980
Rosin…rosin I think?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.560
That layer?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.000
It was similar to rosin.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.920
It was a damar resin.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.900
Is that what Rothko did?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.200
Yeah.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.520
Yeah, so all of these materials we’re using
are based on his original materials.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.400
Did Rothko ever make anything other than like
his iconic paintings?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.020
Yeah.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.220
His early paintings are almost unrecognizable
from these.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.440
Really?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.960
Yeah.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.050
Were they still like abstract?

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130
Um, the ones I’m familiar with are kind
of abstract.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.060
They’re sort of dreamlike abstractions.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.600
A little like Miró almost.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.700
I feel like if Rothko were to come here

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.560
he’d be like, “No, you’re doing it wrong,”
and then like…

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.700
Well he was very, very secretive about his
technique actually

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.440
so he would probably be furious that we’re
doing this at all…

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440
So…

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.180
[laughter]
