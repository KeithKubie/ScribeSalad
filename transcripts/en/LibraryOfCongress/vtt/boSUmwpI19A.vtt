00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.740
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Good afternoon and
welcome to the Library of Congress

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.080
and to our Books and
Beyond presentation.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.040
My name is John Cole, I'm the
director of the Center for the Book

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.960
in the Library of Congress,
which is the reading

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.650
and literacy promotion arm.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.990
It was created way back
in 1977 by Daniel Boorstin

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.290
when he was librarian of
Congress who thought the Library

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.560
of Congress should be doing more
to promote books and reading.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.240
And this was before even the word
literacy was well-known or used.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.190
And of course, when literacy became
a need in our society and something

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.750
to be promoted it was
natural that the Center

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.250
for the Book take that on.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.960
Today, we are the administrators
of the Library

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.480
of Congress Literacy Awards
Project and we're also involved

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.630
with other things at
a national level,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.730
in particular the National
Book Festival.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.030
And I hope that many of you know
about the National Book Festival.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.020
I brought this program from last
year's festival to remind me

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.650
to give it a plug and also to
say that with the author program

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.790
of the National Book Festival,
which has been the responsibility

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.250
of the Center for the Book, along
with a pavilion of the states

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.330
which has people coming
from all over the country

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.370
to talk about books and reading.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.110
It was through the Book Festival

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.530
that we've started getting more
interested in graphic novels.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.050 position:56%
And last year we really had quite --

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.550
well last two years we've
really had quite a program.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.440
We do have a network of state
centers across the country

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.470
in every state that
help promote books,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.100
reading, literacy and libraries.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.910
And we also work with
nonprofit organizations.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.240
Here at the Library of Congress
we feature talks such as this one

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.100
at our noontime Books and Beyond
which feature new books by authors

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.020 position:56%
who are connected one way or another
with the Library of Congress,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.060
often working as is this case with
today's speaker with our Prints

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.890
and Photographs Division
quite closely.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.470
Our talks are all filmed
for later viewing

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.970
on the Library of Congress website.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.340
So I'm asking you to please
turn off all things electronic.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.120 position:56%
I want to remind you of a couple of
handouts that are on the back table.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
We have a schedule of
future talks in this series.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.840
We also have the latest
issue of the Library

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.270
of Congress magazine
imaginatively called LCM,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.210
which features the activities
of the Center for the Book.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.790
And we also have a form we'd
appreciate that you would fill

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.970 position:56%
out telling us how you first learned
about this program to help us keep

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.220
up the momentum of having from 12
to 20 of these talks each year.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.870
However, today to introduce --
the plan would be for our speaker

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.730
to give a presentation, to make
a brief pause for any questions

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.680
and answers and then there
will be a book signing

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.880
at the conclusion right
here in this room.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.230
So welcome again and I would
like to welcome Martha Kennedy,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.820
a curator from the Prints
and Photographs Division,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.260
to introduce our program.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.120
And I'm also going to try to find
out from Martha what she is curator

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.490
of since I never seem
to get it right.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.710
Would you like to include that
in your self-introduction Martha?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.510
Thank you.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.030
[ Applause ]

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.230
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Thank
you very much John.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.290
Good afternoon, welcome.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.030
My name is Martha Kennedy
and I'm a curator of popular

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.360
and applied graphic art
here at the library.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.640
And we -- that means I have
the great privilege of working

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.830
with original cartoon and comic art

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.120
and illustration art,
among other materials.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.060
We are very thrilled in the
Prints and Photographs Division

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.890
to be cosponsoring this program
with the Center for the Book today.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.370
And it's an honor for me to
introduce our speaker, Peter Kuper,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.060
the author, artist of
the graphic novel Ruins.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.400 position:56%
Peter is an award-winning cartoonist
and illustrator and editor,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.290
art director and arts educator.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.390
He is a very versatile
and prolific artist.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.110
He creates not only cartoons
and comics, graphic novels,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.350 position:56%
but also illustrations and cover art
for major magazines and newspapers.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.210
Currently he is all a visiting
professor at Harvard University.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.150
Peter was born in Summit, New
Jersey, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.120 position:56%
attended Kent State University, then
came to New York City and studied

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.840
at the Art Students League
and the Pratt Institute.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.900
Oh dear, I messed something up.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.660
He and his friend and
fellow cartoonist,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.500 position:56%
Seth Tobocman cofounded the Politics
Graphics magazine World War 3

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.970
illustrated in 1979 and
it is still going strong.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.210
Peter is well-known for writing
and drawing Mad Magazine Spy

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.190
Versus Spy also for
more than 18 years now.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.970
He's created more than
a dozen graphic novels,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.120
including The System,
Sticks and Stones,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.300
Adaptation to Franz Kafka's The
Metamorphosis and Give It Up,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.860
and a wonderful
semi-autobiographical graphic novel

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.250
called Stop Forgetting to Remember.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.240
Peter received a journalism
award from the Society

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.130
of Newspaper Designers in 2001,
two gold medals and a silver medal

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.290
from the Society of
Illustrators in New York City.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.960
His work has been published
and exhibited internationally

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.060
and the library is fortunate
to hold examples of his strong

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.660
and vivid drawings and prints in
Prints and Photographs Division.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.070
He remains remarkably modest in
light of his many accomplishments

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.250
about which more could be said,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.510
but for the moment please help me
welcome Peter Kuper, thank you.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.340
&gt;&gt; Peter Kuper: I followed
that fight up to the part

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.390
where you said delightfully
modest and I thought

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.130
that doesn't sound familiar.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.980
So thank you so much for coming
and thank you to the library

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.930
for having me, it's
really an honor to be here.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.330 position:56%
And we first connected back in 2001,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.320
after 9/11 when there was an art
show in New York that had a number

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.640
of pieces that were about 9/11
and I was really grateful to make

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.650
that connection and stay in
touch throughout the years.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.190
So I'm going to give you
a little bit of history

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.700
and I hope you'll follow along with
me and I won't bore you to death.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.420
So some of my history or
maybe all of our history.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:56.600
I grew up in the 60's and
was sort of at the tail end

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.080
of experiencing the Vietnam
War and the hippie movement

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.230
and all these things that I
really felt like I missed out on

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.800
and not the war so much
as the hippie movement.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.800 position:56%
But there's this history that we all
seem to have that I get to capture

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.830
in every issue of Mad
Magazine with Spy Versus Spy,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.860
our tendency towards
some form of destruction.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.710
And we've been capturing our
history in art and in fact,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.610
it's one of the few
things that remains

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.790
to indicate where we came from.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.340
There's no music left unfortunately
from those days, those early days.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.570
And there has been a tendency --
there's our early shopping habits

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:48.000
and that's actually Banksy he
put that up at the British Museum

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.500
and it stayed up for a couple weeks
before anybody realized it wasn't

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.240
part of the exhibit.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.180
Got to love Banksy.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.080
So one of the things that
has seemed to happen also is

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.080
that artists are drawn to
talk about real life events.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.890
And somebody like Goya who to
his detriment did this series

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.810
of etchings, Disasters of War,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.300
and paintings talking
about what was going on.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.810
And he was, you know, sort of the
court painter and he didn't have

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.470
to be doing this and it
didn't help his career along.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.190
The same with Daumier who
his portrait of the King

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.970
in France got him a
six-month jail time.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.340 position:56%
So there has been this aspect of art
that has always wanted to reach out

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.670
and comment on the
pillars of society

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.800
like Boss Tweed, this
is Thomas Nast.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.630
And famously his drawing

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:53.420
of Boss Tweed helped
the customs identify him

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.590
when Boss Tweed fled the country
having pretty much ransacked the

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:05.330
treasury of New York and he ended
up dying penniless in jail, woohoo.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.100
Thomas Nast also developed
the elephant and the donkey

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.310
as our Democratic and
Republican symbols.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.400
He also did the first
image of Santa Claus,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.460
but some very wise people felt that
a little more color would be nice

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.500
and so the Coca-Cola Company,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.650
figuring that would be perfect
to work with their logo.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.730
That's why we have a red
and white Santa Claus.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.880
The English tried to change it
to green and white more recently

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.670
and nobody was buying it,
Coke is just too popular.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.730
So there were magazines also
that were giving a forum

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.090
to political artists like the
Masses and they too were shut

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.390
down when Woodrow Wilson had
promised us not to go into war

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.610
and then did and there was a whole
movement against work like this.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.980
This is the perfect
soldier by Robert Miner.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.590
And Simplicissimus in Germany
which gave a voice to artists

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.190
like Kathe Kollwitz
and John Hartfield.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.280
And, you know, it threatened
their lives

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.690
to do images like this in the 30's.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.660
George Gross, many of them, in
fact probably all them had to flee

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.750
in order to avoid concentration
camps.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.810
Picasso got into the act too
with Guernica about the bombing

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:32.570
of a Spanish town in Spain,
Spanish town in Spain.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.500
And Diego Rivera's a mural
Man at the Crossroads,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.560
which he curiously was hired
by Rockefeller to do it

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.860
at the Rockefeller Center.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.160
And I don't know if
you know this story,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.950
but he put in this little
image of Lenin under the wing

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.460
and Rockefeller said, you've
got to take out, you know,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.400
the biggest communist
is in the lobby

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.470
of the biggest capitalist
you've got to take that out.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.230
And Diego, who is getting a
hard time from his friends

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:02.620 position:56%
for having taken on this commission
said, no and so Rockefeller paid him

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.220
and chiseled it off the wall.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.520
There he is working on
one mural or another.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.530 position:56%
So you know art is used in many
directions, it's not always antiwar.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.070
The government can use
it to direct people

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.710
into war and/or to support the war.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.210
And, but then again there's
always some lefty popping

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:31.200
up with their little
commentary on even that.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.580
So in the 50's there were war
comics that were being produced.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.720
Harvey Kurtzman was out one
of the editors who did this

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.990
and he was really trying to do
comics that were for adults,

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.990
for soldiers in fact
talking about war as it was.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.340
He was very concerned with being
accurate with all the armaments

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.930
that no one could call him
out and say that, you know,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.260
it's a comic and, you know, it's
just sort of glossing over things.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.180
This was also coming
from a company EC

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.330
that was doing pretty much a
whole series of amazing comics.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.610
But this was in the 50's
around the time of McCarthyism

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.320
and there was a lot of scare
about well just everything,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.060
including the fear that comics
would lead to delinquency.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.280
And so there was a move by a guy
named Frederick Wertham he wrote an

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.750
article that caused a big uproar,
the seduction of the innocent.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.120
And people decided that
comics were bad for children

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.060
that violent comics
would lead to violence.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.000
We've heard this about
Dungeons and Dragons too,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.780
this is an ongoing story.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.430
And that led the industry to
say okay we'll self-censor,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.920
please don't kill us
we'll self-censor.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.290
And in that self-censoring with
the Comics Code they also agreed

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:52.040 position:56%
to not have titles that included
words like weird and crypt and well,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.890
you know, pretty much
everything that EC published.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.290 position:56%
And that knocked that line of comics

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.810
that was heading towards a whole
new possibility in the form

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.790
of more adult comics, it
knocked it out and it ushered

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.810
in superheroes in a big way.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:13.640
The only one standing from the
EC Company was oddly enough Mad

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.830
Magazine, the most
subversive comic ever

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.860
which shows you what happens
when you censor things.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.600
And Mad was a huge influence
on me, I grew up reading it

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.720
and the idea that, you know,
you could say these things

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.160
about the pillars of society
and make jokes and all.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.790
But I was a little put off
when they made fun of hippies

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.120 position:56%
because I thought wait a minute like
where do they stand on these issues.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.120
I thought that they were left-wing
and then they were every wing.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.230
Around the same time
Jules Feiffer who's got --

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.970
I believe his archives
are with the collection,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.130
brilliant cartoonist who's
done pretty much everything.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:59.030
Started to do a comic
strip in the Village Voice,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.620
along with having been drafted
in the Korean War he came

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.770
up with the story of a boy
who's accidentally drafted,

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.260
which is how he felt, a
four-year-old is drafted.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.390
And this made into an animated
film that won the Academy Award.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.590
Along comes Underground Comics
which is basically the children

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.730
of Mad Magazine, Robert Crumb and
a number of people were coming

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.920
out with comics that really, really
didn't have the Comics Code on them

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.330
in any way, shape or form.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.970
But one of the things I noted
from these comics was also

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.660
that they had a political sentiment
and the first things I heard

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.490
about environmental movement
and a number of antiwar things

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.500
in comics was coming
out of Underground.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.260
So this was a kind of poster
that you'd see on a lot

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.330
of college walls in the late 60's.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.970
And I love the idea that
art could have this impact

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.330
that people would put this out and
it was sort of like a rallying cry.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.870
And I grew up in the 70's
and it was, you know,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.290
I was hoping to do art and I
wished that I could do something

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.690
that had a happier face on it.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.540
But somehow or another growing

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.490
up through the Vietnam
War it was very difficult

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.230
to ignore what was going
on behind that smile.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.200
And when I was in art school Ronald
Reagan was just coming into office.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.790
If you don't happen to
remember Ronald Reagan,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.230
it's okay he may not
have recalled either.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:23.930
But he promises a less
bureaucratic shadow government.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.310
That's The Onion, love The Onion.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:34.670 position:56%
So with Ronald Reagan coming into
office, the Cold War in full effect,

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.250 position:56%
the Iranian hostage crisis going on,

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.700
it looked like we were
headed towards war.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.060
And, therefore, the title World War
3 illustrated seemed appropriate

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.790
for the magazine that my
friend, Seth, and I started.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.650
We started this because the
Underground Comics scene had

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.540
collapsed and that we were
doing politically minded comics

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.220
and we saw political art around in
New York City where we were going

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.130
to school and we wanted
to capture it.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.000
Because it felt like this wasn't
showing up in mainstream media

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.890
and it was being washed away at the
first rain when the posters fell

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.790
down or the spray painted
washed off the wall.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.810
And this is at the same exact
time that Francoise Mouly

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.780
and Art Spiegelman started Raw,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.180
in fact we shared staplers
on our first issue.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.190
And inside of Raw was this
little booklet called Maus,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.190
which certainly comic people
like myself noted and loved

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.740
in its chapter by chapter
development.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:37.510 position:56%
So World War 3 started talking about
world war, you know, like world war

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.050
and the fear of World War 3.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.320
And we realized pretty quickly
though that what was going

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.610
on in the streets of New York
was something that we could talk

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.550
about that was based
on personal experience.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.320
And, therefore, you know, you
could argue with the details of it,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.250
but it was based on something that
we experienced firsthand as opposed

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.170
to something that we might have
read in the paper or in a book.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.330
And year after year more and
more people came to the magazine

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.800 position:56%
and seemed to be inclined to join us

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.000
and there were more editors
involved, so it wasn't just two

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.070
of us putting it together and
trying to kill each other.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.780
And one of the secrets of
our success I've concluded

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.630
over the years is that our
success was our failure,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.180
which is that we've
never made any money.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.680 position:56%
Everybody that works on the magazine
does so for free and that --

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.170
but what it has provided
is a payment of form

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.610
which is an opportunity to
talk about urgent issues

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:39.850
that we're desperate to get down on
paper and to identify the history

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.490
that may be an unspoken
or unwritten history.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.380
And this is expanded
out into other projects

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.430
that we've done art shows, murals.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.210
This was a big show
that we had at Exit Art.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.640
I first connected with the Library
of Congress when they saw a show

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.830
that was at the same
gallery on 9/11.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:08.760
And this is all part of -- this
was our 30th anniversary art show

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.420
and this is our 35th
anniversary anthology.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.860
We've actually had three
anthologies already along

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.650
with the regular issues and we're
still publishing to this day.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.600
I'm working on the new issue
and I coedited the last one.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.630
One of the other wonderful things

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.040
that has happened is this has
created an environment for artists

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.960
to be able to do their
work and get published.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.820
And has led a number of
the people involved to do,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.070 position:56%
collectively do other graphic novels

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.440
like Studs Terkel Working
which we adapted.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.680
One of the people who had their
work published here did Seven Miles

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.980
a Second.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.960 position:56%
And this is just a series of graphic
novels that came out of the pages

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.540
of World War 3 originally
by cartoonists and editors

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.510
who were involved in the magazine.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.830
And it's given us -- again,
this proving ground because it's

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.940
so hard sometimes to
get the sense of self,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.040
an idea that you can do comics.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.650
And especially with
people in some cases

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.640
who were doing their very
first comics like Sabrina Jones

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.820 position:56%
in World War 3 and developed
herself in the pages of the magazine

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.880
with our associative
editing and all.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.080
I always felt kind
of ripped off growing

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.720
up like oh my generation
arrives just, you know,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.230
we get to the beach just in
time for waves to wash up

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.810
and we missed the beat generation,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.470
we missed the hippie
movement, summer of love.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.410
But actually what we concluded
is, you know, these are things

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.850
that they were developed
by some group of people

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.830
and we too are a group
of people and so we sort

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.100
of developed our own
little of sorts.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.430
And that's my coeditor one of his
books and his most recent book.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.270
Eric Drucker, who also
I believe is in library.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.550
Flood I believe is
here and Blood Song,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.070 position:56%
these are incredible graphic novels,
I recommend all of them to you.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.370
I know a lot is going by.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.370
So before I get into my own work
I'll just give you a quick rundown

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.460
on the secrets of the
graphic novelist.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.940
This is the boy's club
version because I'm a boy.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.650
So it's very important
when you're growing

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:24.790
up to have some dedicated time
to read comics and look at them.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.240
This seems to be a consistency

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.440
between cartoonists is the
missing the sports gene,

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.500
that's the fifth quarter
they're playing by the way.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.500
Of course, life experiences
to draw upon

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.640
in your work are very important.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.060
You must believe in yourself.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.630
That would be young Chris
Ware probably or fill

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.200
in the blank, a famous cartoonist.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.440
Some spiritual connection
I think is important.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:10.260
And ultimately, being excited
about a career in the arts.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.000 position:56%
So one of my earliest graphic novels
was an adaptation of the jungle.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.200
And I did this in stencils
and spray paint

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.880
which was a very odd
form for comics.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.570
And I also tried to apply some
of the art influences I had,

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.580
a little Russian constructivism
and German expressionism to do some

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.730
of the imagery which I thought that
could fit very much into comics.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.100
Another big influence
on me has been travel,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.740 position:56%
getting to see many parts the world
has given me a connection with a lot

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.730
of the subject matter
that I want to talk about.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:53.540
I was in New Guinea and it's helped
me develop a lot of ways of drawing

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.020
that I wouldn't have
otherwise maybe gone

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.510
down if I had just
worked consistently

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.780
where you're being told you have
to have a style and you have

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.210
to have a certain look and a
certain way of doing things

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.550
and I just did whatever I
wanted in my sketchbook.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:15.820
And that has served me very well
in many different ways and has led

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.840
down a lot of different paths.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.140
Although, even when I'm sitting
on a beach in some beautiful place

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.480
in Mexico or Thailand or
Indonesia I seem to always return

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.330
to my concerns about world events.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.630
This is a book I did crazily for DC
Vertigo, which is the same people

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.100
who did Batman and Superman.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:41.410 position:56%
An editor came there and asked me if
I had any ideas and I had this idea

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.930
about sort of the connective
tissue between all of us.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.070
And I thought I would
do it is a wordless book

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.390
because among other
things, even stylistically,

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.160
I wanted to confound
people who felt the comics,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.030
they understood what comics
were and had dismissed them.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.650
So comics have word balloons

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:00.830
and comics have this
certain kind of muscly style.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.030
And so I took those things away

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.490
and the subject matter I
tried to make more adult.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.560
And really when, you know, comics
are a very interactive medium.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.470
In fact, I think there's a
high level of visual literacy

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.650
that is asked of the
reader and that's part

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.320
of why they're often dismissed.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.390
You know, people say if
they look at fine art

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.600 position:56%
and they don't understand they think
they're stupid, but if they look

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.090
at comics don't understand they
think the artist is stupid.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:32.580
And it seems to quote
Chris Ware I believe.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.380
And anyway, this is a
little bit of my approach.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.970
So actually I cut stencils for my
pencils and there's holes in papers

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.950
which are they sprayed with
red paint and black paint

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.580
from cans not airbrush
and then watercolor

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.040
and a little color pencil.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.390
Here's another one.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.930
And I got to utilize the
information I got from traveling

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.330
to these distant places
where I went to rain forests

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.060 position:56%
where it wasn't raining necessarily.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.030
The people at Mad saw what I
was doing with wordless comics

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.830
and asked me if I wanted to
try out for Spy Versus Spy

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.980
and my reaction was almost an
immediate no because I'm an idiot.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.300 position:56%
And they recognized the idiocy in me

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.230
and thought you'd be a
perfect member of the gang.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:25.240 position:56%
And so I did a sample and I realized
when I did this how much the creator

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.140
of Spy Versus Spy, Antonio Prohias,
a Cuban artist, had influenced me.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.400
And I remember looking
at those spies and trying

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.260
to decipher the puzzle and
it was just and it ended

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.650
up being part of my
DNA a little bit.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.590
So when I did my tryout I
thought I would do something

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.890
that would confound them.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.430
I wasn't going to try and look like
Prohias, so I did it in stencils

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.130
and spray paint and it turned out
that's what they were looking for

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:55.410
and I'm now in my nearly, coming
into two decades of doing it.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.490
I also really enjoy exploring all
the things you can do with comics

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:04.630
and one of them is adaptations
and autobiography and journalism.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:09.560
And a friend of mine used to war
Kafka stories while over beers

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.740
and we would have a good laugh
over the dark humor in his work.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.090
And I did one collection and
then later thought, you know,

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.890
the Metamorphosis, that's the
cover of the original Metamorphosis

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.520
from 1915 and I thought
I would give that a go.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.390 position:56%
But before I did that I actually had
the opportunity to do a treehouse

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.380
of horror for the Simpsons.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.570
And I thought what if.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:39.940
Oh, but it was all
a dream or was it.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.840
D'oh with echo and of
course, Lisa suggesting

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.220
that he read Charlotte's Web.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.050 position:56%
So before I started the
Metamorphosis I decided to look back

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.510
at what comics were being
produced at that time

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:57.410
and there's a brilliant
cartoonist, Windsor Winsor McCay,

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:04.870
did Little Nemo in Slumberland
actually predating what Kafka did.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.500
Especially a strip on
Dream of the Rarebit Fiend

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:14.930
which had this remarkable
surreal quality to it.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.150
And though he always
allowed people to wake

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.490
up at the end, this is from 1913.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.590 position:56%
It says Silas on there that was his
pen name because he was so prolific,

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.490
he was working for multiple
papers and so he took a pen name.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:38.840
But the period quality mixed with
the tone of the work it was --

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.280
perhaps this was just the zeitgeist
of the world, but I always wondered

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.490
if Kafka had seen these comics.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.330 position:56%
So that's my cover of Metamorphosis.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.950
Now Kafka did say, whatever you
do don't put the bug on the cover,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.550
but he also told the executor of
his estate [inaudible] to burn all

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.560
of his unpublished
manuscripts and I figured

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.120
if his friend could ignore him
I might do a little of the same.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.950
So I decided to do it in
something called scratchboard

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.180
which would approximate something
like woodcut though it allowed me

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.140
to have the much more
complicated work

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.190
that I needed to do
with pen and ink.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.390 position:56%
And I wanted to get the feeling of
that time period and I generally try

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.750
to serve the story, whatever that
may be with the style and not worry

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.090
about I'm going to do
the style that I do

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.670
and then it's going
to fit around me.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.220
But rather it's nice that my
style happens to fit with Kafka

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.570
and that's probably
why I was drawn to it.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.020
So the events from back
then are still happening

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.470
and I've been given the opportunity

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.490
to illustrate them
in many publications.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.320
And I seem to be the go to
guy for stress and concern.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.630
It's something I can, I
don't know there's a lot

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.600
of oomph I can get behind this kind
of imagery that I never was able

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.960
to do when I was doing
something that was lighter.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.910
So when George Bush came
into office around that time

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:19.900
and that pretty quickly led to a
point in time with September 11th.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.300
This is an image that actually the
library has in their collection.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.180
And it was really a time when
I understood the importance

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.170 position:56%
of alternative media because it was
next to impossible to do any imagery

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.070
that was counter to the
general voice of government,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.330
which was we need to go and
kill more people elsewhere

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:45.220
in order to address the attack.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.710
And, you know, I understood
the sentiment,

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:53.280
but the sort of aimless
sense of where we had to go.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.390
And this is also a time when people
like Art Spiegelman who did Maus,

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.860
won a Pulitzer Prize, and
had trouble getting his work

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.720 position:56%
in mainstream media, he couldn't get
his work published in the New Yorker

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.450
where he had been an editor in fact

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.170
because it was really a distinct
shutdown on what was being said.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.280
This is the cover of
the issue of World War 3

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.460
that we did before we went into
Iraq where it was extremely clear

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.780
to a large number of us in
fact, millions that the war

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.560
in Iraq was a terrible idea.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.140
That we were going to deeply
regret and yes it was very much

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.400
like Vietnam, contrary to what
was being suggested in the media.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.710
And thanks to people like Janet
Malcolm who helped us believe

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.120
that there were weapons of mass
destruction that, you know,

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.610
the next smoking gun
would be the form

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.470
of a nuclear weapon headed our way.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.560
And so we sent a whole lot
of people into harm's way

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.620
and we've pretty much
outstripped the number of people

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.320
that were killed, Americans that
is that were killed in 9/11,

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.990
let alone the hundreds of
thousands of people who were killed

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:59.460
in various other countries.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.010
This is one of my responses.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.390
Oddly enough, one of my first
jobs is an inker on Richie Rich

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:10.520
and I knew it would
come in handy one day.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.130
Oh sorry, cha-ching.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.010
So these were the kind of
images that we were doing.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.830 position:56%
Yes, they were -- we felt the strain
of our constitution under attack.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.180
This is actually something
I did for Time Magazine.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.160
There was a moment in time there

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.890
where mainstream publications
were actually running articles

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.510
that were discussing these things.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.990 position:56%
The message that was seeming to come

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.650
from government was,
you know, get duct tape.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.200
And I don't know if you
remember this symbol

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.800
for the Total Information
Awareness Office.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.560
It was run by John Poindexter and
the name seemed vaguely familiar.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.530
I remembered it was from
the Iran-Contra hearings

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:57.600
where he was caught up in that
scandal and he was making a return,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.360
but this symbol scared
people too much

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.330
and they took it away
pretty quickly.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:07.450
Although perhaps what was put in
motion is still with us today.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.530
You may also recall libraries
were under surveillance

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.030
and librarians were told they had a
gag rule that they could not speak

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.930
about what -- that
individuals were taking

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.090
out books were being
under surveillance.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.600
And if you took out a book
that had the word bomb in it

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:27.260
like I got bombed last weekend
say, but I had a mild hangover

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.820
and I'm okay that that
was being tracked.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:35.380
And it seemed to be what
is a lot of our privacy.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.490 position:56%
Though curiously a recent study said
that about 90% of the fake bombs

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.840
and other weaponry
that they tried to put

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.100
through to test whether our TSA
was functioning got through.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.390
So apparently [inaudible],
sorry for all the sounds,

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:55.720
I forgot about all my sound
effects I'll lower them a little.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.980
But maybe we should all jump
in our seats when we think

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:03.270
about gun control in this
country and what exactly leads it.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.030 position:56%
And the lack of healthcare or, you
know, there's been a lot of attempts

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.830
to get healthcare, but there
seems to be a lot of roadblocks

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.980
on that basic idea and
education and other things.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.780
We want less government
apparently, but we want more debt.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.790
And perpetually hoping
there's a plan.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.770
I know I am, I know there's a lot
of people that are really hoping

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.470
that there's a plan for
these various incursions.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.670
Makes you kind of wish for
the good old days instead

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:40.270
of things being blown up they were
just well I won't even go there.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.810
So there was that moment in
time that lasted quite a while.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.040
This was the image that I put
forward to the New York Times

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.150
for an article on Abu Ghraib
about four days after the event.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.940
They said you know that that is
such an overused symbol and it's

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.610
like it's just become a
symbol how can it be overused.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.850
This is what I did get through,
which isn't like a total, you know,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.240
like missed the boat
completely, but it was talking

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.820
about these connections that
I wanted to put in the work.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.250
So censorship doesn't
necessarily come in the form

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.170
of an absolutely you can't do it,

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.190
it's more like well
that's not really working

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.790
or they killed the article
that I did for Time Magazine.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.480
I illustrated a piece by Garrison
Keillor before we went into Iraq

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.330
where he was saying
this is a terrible idea

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.260
and they just killed
the article and my art.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.150
Einstein was quoted as saying

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.010
that he doesn't know how
we'll fight World War 3,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.650
but World War 4 will be
fought with sticks and stones.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.120
And this inspired the
title of this book.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.190
The notion that I got kind of
tired of drawing political figures

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.750
that I knew were going
to turn to dust

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.930
and people wouldn't even
necessarily remember who they were.

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:53.120
And so I decided to do something
that was more of an allegory.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.220
Because I did wonder where
do we get leaders like this,

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.580
where do they come from and I
thought maybe they just get spit

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.670
out of a volcano somewhere
and they self-actualize.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:11.700
And for some crazy reason we give
them power which they are more

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:17.670
than happy to take very
often to our detriment.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:26.360 position:56%
So in these next elections, thank
you Diebold, Diebold, it was a point

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.160
in time where I had been foaming
at the mouth for a good while

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.580
and I decided -- my wife and I had
talked about taking a sabbatical

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.720
for a year, we wanted our
daughter to get a second language

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.790
and I had lived in Israel when I
was 10, my father had a sabbatical.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.820
And it was huge, both traumatic

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.410
and incredibly expanding experience
being thrown into a school

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.710
where I didn't speak the language

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.960
and I thought we should
do this for our daughter.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:57.450
And we very randomly picked this
small town in Mexico Oaxaca.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:03.150
I barely knew how to say the
name O-A-X-A-C-A Oaxaca really.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:07.630
So there's my daughter at
nine, daughter there awe.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.580
She's now in college
gulp that happened fast.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.450 position:56%
I thought it would be a great chance
to see other art and really kind

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.420
of get out of my head with all the
political work I've been doing.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.040
This is a radish festival
every year, they carve radishes

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.300
into creches and things like that.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.140
And I did get the opportunity
to spend a lot of time drawing

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.990
in my sketchbook and
beautiful scenery

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.390
and it became very mural like.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.550
It was funny I didn't, I think
I understood where somebody

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.020
like Diego Rivera came from not
so much I was looking at his art

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.890
as I was looking at Mexico and
it seemed to be this synergy

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:53.900 position:56%
and synthesis and simultaneity there
between the past and the present.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.370
There goes my clicker again.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:37:00.170
So we arrived in 2006 and
I noticed there was a lot

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:07.080 position:56%
of as we made our way towards the
airport and we barely spoke Spanish.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.890 position:56%
And I asked the taxi driver who that
was and he's oh it's the governor

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.630
and apparently had
stolen the election.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.500 position:56%
And well I could read that actually.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.870
Truth be told, we never word
offered anything but kindness

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.910
in our two years down there.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.400
But it just happened that there
was a teacher strike going on

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.050
and this was an annual event that
had been going on for 25 years,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.450
but the new governor
had decided instead

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:37.120
of giving them their normal pay
raise which was pretty meager

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.910 position:56%
that he would try to just expel them
from the zocalo, the town square.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:46.640
And he sent in police in the
middle of the night and instead

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.040
of expelling them it made
the strike much larger.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:58.240
Other different unions joined
in and people poured into Oaxaca

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.270
and that eventually
people were getting shot

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.810
and federal troops arrived

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:10.710
when a single American
journalist was killed.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.390
And written on their
shields is murderers,

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.920
two women I saw they
wrote that on the shields.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.140
And I kept waiting for the
guys to rearrange the shield,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.710
so it said have a nice
day or something

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.420
like that, but it never happened.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.630
And amazingly, they let them
do this without attacking them.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:30.460
So we ran away from, at least
somebody was happy you know.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.620
I asked, I asked, she was okay.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.040
But one of the things
I noticed when we were

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.180
down there was how much art
played a role in daily life

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.450
and this is during day of the dead.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.620
And people would open up the
cemeteries and these places

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.580
that I always considered to be
a black and white sad experience

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.880
that everybody was crying,

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:55.530
it was always raining was this
happy music infested place.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.080
And people did commentary about
the events and it just seemed

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.560
like everybody was an artist and
there was just art everywhere.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.800
And it really felt like
it was part of society

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.090
and not something you
saw only in a museum.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.930
And you could feel the spirit
of the past artist like Posada

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.570
who died penniless, did
all this political art,

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.290
but he did it in woodblock form and
it got reproduced again and again

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:25.900
and he's among the most
famous artists of Mexico now.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.100
And here you see the
reflection of that kind of work.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.880
Or Diego Rivera's murals which are
being replicated in ways like this

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.990
that was in the zocalo where they
were doing these hand done murals

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.670
that were describing what was
going on during their time.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.840
But it might be more
appropriate to say that one

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.320
of the bigger influences on
the strike was Frida Kahlo

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.520
because women were the main force
behind the teacher strike and many

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.720
of the plans and the actions
were implemented by women.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.130
And I found myself starting
to draw these things

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.090
and I realized I wasn't
trying to escape

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:06.530 position:56%
from drawing political things I just
wanted a different political subject

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:13.190 position:56%
matter to draw that had a little
more maybe light in it I'm not sure.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.580
My version of light at least.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.210 position:56%
I love the backdrops, I'd be sitting
at a cafe and that would be my view.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.870
There was a strike, there was
a march that happened one day

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.910
and my wife and I went down there
we were having a date and she --

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.660
my version of the date was we'd
go down there and I'll draw

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.050
and she was like okay honey.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.240
And so we left and five minutes

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.990 position:56%
after we departed the troops
attacked and we missed being rounded

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.110
up by a very small margin.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.800
And I finished the drawing, I did
the bottom part of the drawing

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.510
down there and then I finished
the drawing with what I saw

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.510
on the internet when we got home.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.870
And I was able to put
this into World War 3.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.100
Again, I got 11 pages to
talk about what was going on

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.890
and nobody was interested
in doing that big of a story

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.620
in the mainstream publications.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:07.030 position:56%
I did end up in Mexican newspapers
as a result of the work I was doing.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.070
And again, it was so
important to have outlets

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.360
like this, this alternative media.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.700
And this turned into a book that
I did when I got back from Mexico

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.990 position:56%
that included all of my sketch work.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:23.530 position:56%
So we arrived back in New York after
two years just in time for the crash

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:28.040
and for my career to take a
downward turn as magazines folded

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.280
and my illustration
career went thud.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.580
And Obama was just coming into
office with a whole new set

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.870
of things being handed to him.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:44.410 position:56%
And unfortunately, yes we can't
which we made me over the years want

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:50.340
to return to Mexico and have a
little of some form of escape yet.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.510
And it came in the form of this
graphic novel idea that percolated

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.550
for many, many years and I wanted

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.190
to capture the experience
that we had down there.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.740
But I decided to do it in a
fictional account where I was able

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.480
to talk about the circumstances
and place my characters right

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.770
in the middle of things rather
than where we were at somewhat

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:16.230
of the periphery and this
way I wasn't tied to so many

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.750
of the specifics and I could
do things that I wanted.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:24.330
And these characters
visited the various ruins

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.400
and have their experiences.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.350
And I could talk about the
inner lives of various Mexicans

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:37.880
that we encountered and the events
that took place on those days only

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.330
with the characters being
dead in the middle of them.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.770
Another aspect of it
is that while we were

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.900
down I'm a closet entomologist.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.960
Before I got interested in comics
I wanted to, I was a bug fan.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.440
And while we were down there it
was like a return to my childhood

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.840
because there were so many
insects in Mexico that my sense

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.180
that that's all disappearing

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.140
that environmentally it's changing
it seemed on hold in Mexico.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.020
And one of the ways that
we connected with that was

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.460
with the monarch butterfly
where we raised monarchs

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.650
down there my daughter and I
and then we visited Michoacan

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.110
where they come down
by the millions.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:21.090
At one point it was about in the
last 10 years a billion monarchs

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.720
made their way to this
forest and passed

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.480
through our world to get there.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.690
Science does not actually know
how they know to get down there.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.040
They've done all sorts
of different studies,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.930
they figure that they're
sort of GPSing off the sun

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.450
and the electromagnetic
pulse of the earth.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:50.970 position:56%
People who tag monarchs, it was only
in 1975 that they first discovered

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.460
where they even went and
they found these tags,

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.930
these little stickers they put
on them down in this one area.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.600
Of course the people down
there knew they were there,

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.320 position:56%
but they were sort of a quiet thing.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.020
But in one sanctuary
and there's five

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:09.170
of them 11 million
monarchs show up on

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.670
and it's a long road to get there.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.970
So in the last 10 years.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.550
The billion has actually
whittled down to 30 million.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.870
And as is my want I had them pass
over, this particular monarch pass

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.260
over many a thing that
had double meaning.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.220
New Orleans the ninth ward.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:48.260
Easier for monarchs to cross
borders and sometimes towns

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.760
that were violent and
sometimes towns

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.270
that were just plain beautiful.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.360
And the natural ways that
monarchs are also threatened.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:06.180
But fortunately for monarchs
they are attracted to milkweed

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:10.630
and milkweed has a
poison that they survive,

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.830
but birds have learned to avoid.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:19.090
There's even evolutionarily a
butterfly called the viceroy

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.940
that mimics the look of monarchs
even though it's very tasty

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.820
and it survived as a result.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.500
So, you know, trying to imagine
what's going on in the mind

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:34.930
of the monarch in order to make
its way to 2,000 or 3,000 miles

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:40.210
and weighs a gram, travels
12 miles a day perhaps.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:45.800
It's just a, you know, you have to
be in awe of life and our world.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.570
And it even will go so far as
to go all the way down to Mexico

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:53.470
and then start to see it
continue on back and get as first

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.010
as Texas in one generation.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:01.230 position:56%
Also weirdly it manages to
initially the first generation lives

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.400
for a couple of weeks, the
second-generation maybe seven weeks

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.780
and then the third
lives for six months.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:14.560
And how that even happens still
like wow entomologists discuss.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:25.490
So seeing this world of ours has
made me consider our position in it

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:32.000
and the big questions of whether
hegemony is more important

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.060
than what may happen to
us as a result of that.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:46.160
And whether our water supply
is secondary to our gas supply

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:52.610
and whether our forests
are necessary even.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:58.630
And whether what happens in the
Arctic will happen on Wall Street.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.540
And whether we can
formulate new ideas

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.300
to address these very,
very urgent issues.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.650
Here's little weather report.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.340
But for those of you that are

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:31.940
in New York never fear alternate
side parking will remain in effect.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.240
So this idea that what
happens in one place happens

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:48.120
in another makes me want to roll
back the clock and return it

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.650
to things that once were.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:48:01.220
And yes me worry, I do scream
and not just for the Beatles.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.490
And as we come up on
this next election

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:10.520
and they're passing the torch
all these issues about who's red

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.380
and who's green, who's
red and who's blue.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.610
The things that separate us
and the things that we talk

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.970
about that are our divisions are

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:22.900
so much less important
than what connects us.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.410
Because we're really all on the
same path and where we started

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.840
and where we're going
is exactly the same.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.600
There may be some people that
don't believe that, but it is so.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:41.280
And so we can effect a change

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:46.030
that can cause catastrophic
things or repair.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:51.300
We share this world with all these
other creatures and they don't have

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.750
that advantage, they just have

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.730
to live here they don't
get to make the changes.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.310
And the clock is ticking
on that in a very big way.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.440
But ultimately the thought I
would like to leave you with is

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:12.390 position:56%
as we struggle together in this very
important job of survival be kind.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.510
Thank you.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.600
Yeah if there's any questions I'd
be happy to answer them and if not,

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.900
I'd be happy to sign books.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.660
Oh it's the first comics
course that they've ever had,

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.180
it's with the visual
environmental studies program.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.510
And I don't know I just got pulled

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.320
out of a hat much to
my happy surprise.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.860
I've taught at the School of Visual
Arts in New York for 25 plus years,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.160
so I guess somebody heard that.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.920
But the students caused
this to happen

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.360
because there was pressure
developing to have classes

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.190
so some people wanted to do
their dissertations in comics.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:10.510
And there was just this
percolating interest in the form.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.190
And I always feel I'm incredibly
lucky that I seem like I'm

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:18.870
at the door a lot for book
festivals and situations like that

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:22.800
where the first interesting comics
it finally breaks through and I get

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.150
to go talk at a book festival

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:28.910
or in this case teach
students graphic novels.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.150
And it's -- I happen to do a
single page comic every week.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.800
One of my students said it was
the hardest class that he had

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.660
in all his time at Harvard
and I was like sorry,

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.960
it's the same class I teach at the
School of Visual Arts you know.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.230
But it is so brilliant, the
students are so great to teach

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.390
that the five hour commute
each way once a week

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.190
from New York is totally
worth it to me.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.570
I'm giddy about going up there

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:59.980
and my class is four hours
long and I run out of time.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:03.030
It's, you know, I can't
explain it completely.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.340
I used to have a much shorter
class and I ran out of things

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.160
in the first half hour, but the
students just provide a lot.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.540
I have 12 students in the class
and I actually have to select them,

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.990
which is another tremendous boon.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.880
So up to 40 students will apply for
the class and then I interview all

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:26.090
of them and then pick 12 and 12 is
the right number for four hours.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.510
And I have them do assignments
that are things like based

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.970
on a dream that they had.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.960
Interview somebody, so
there's comics journalism.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:44.180
Autobiography and social
content and I keep shifting it.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.410
There was a long time where
in my class I had them say

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:50.100
where were you 9/11 and
I watch progressively.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.060
Let's see my mommy brought me
some cookies and I don't remember

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.860
and like okay, time to
drop that one what's next.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:02.260
So it's an evolving thing in that
way which is exciting for me too.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.570
Yes.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.910
The question was is the class
a mixture of students from art

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.000
and other disciplines and yes,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.160
this year it's the
smallest number from art.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.180
And I have computer
scientists, economists,

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.480
medieval studies students,
English majors.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.070
I remember my very first class,
I'm in my third year there

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.300
and my first class, the very
first assignment somebody brought

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.900
in with a title in Latin and
I just thought I'm so screwed.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.140 position:56%
And one of the students said I
don't speak Latin what the hell does

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.680
that say and I was like saved.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.710
So yeah I went from
feeling quite daunted by --

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.920
the other thing I was told
by the person who hired me.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.980 position:56%
Oh by the way, they're not a race of
super intelligent aliens, you know,

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.250
and I was like oh right, right
they're humans yeah, okay got it.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.580
And it turns out yes they are,

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:09.470
they are hard workers
that's the notable thing.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.270
They don't tend to miss class and
they tend to do all the assignments

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.720
which doesn't happen as often

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.710
in my other classes,
but generally speaking.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:21.570
And it's really the future
of comics to me are people

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.760
who are coming from
other disciplines.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.710
It's one of the things that's
happened with World War 3 is

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.670
that we've gotten a lot more
women [inaudible] my class

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:32.290
of 12 has 2 guys and it is so great

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.540
because the women will
lead the charge

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.480
into what's happening in the form.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.820
And people from various
backgrounds not just a bunch

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.750
of nerdy white guys.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:49.390 position:56%
I've been going to comic conventions
my whole life since I was 11.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:55.680
It used to be literally all guys
and pretty much all white guys

00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:01.230
and that going to comic conventions
now the dynamic has changed

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:06.960
dramatically and as a result the
material that's being made has

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.260
changed dramatically.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.920
And if you're not a comic reader,

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.320
just with a little searching you
can find something that will touch

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.610
on something that interests
you that from all areas.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:25.380
There's civil rights
movement done in comics,

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:30.700 position:56%
a lot of gay lesbian subject matter.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.850
In fact, that seems to be
a huge arc I'm noticing

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:37.050
from the last alternative
convention I went to,

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.320
more gay superheroes
and things like that.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.670
But really pretty much everything.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.330
There's tremendous journalism
being done in comics.

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:51.060
Joe Sacco is an artist he's
tackled the Palestinian situation

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:57.630
and Sarajevo and India
and you name it.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.980
And then you have, you know,
these pillars like Maus

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.990
that tackled the Holocaust, which
was obviously a huge breakthrough.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:10.240
But there's subsequently been
a lot of other work by people

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.760
with a wide range of backgrounds.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:18.520
And so if read at all you can
find something that will touch

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.560
on something that you will be
probably very interested in.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.640
Fun Homes is a fairly recent
autobiography that was made

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.010
into a play I saw recently.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:32.820
It was a brilliant, it won the Tony
award best play with good reason.

You're looking at a very digital
piece right there and the coloring

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.900
on the monarch butterfly
section was digital.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.160
I keep a huge component
of paper art in my work,

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.800
the same way I'm very big on print.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.760
I love print and I
don't want to miss that.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.020
But I would miss it if, you
know, I'm hoping it's kind

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.000
of like vinyl it's coming back.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.530
But yeah, you know, I'm interested
in all those different tools.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.400
I try to discourage it to some
extent in class because I want them

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.420
to at least start with hand-drawn
things and then they can find

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.870
out how it can be augmented
digitally.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:19.280 position:56%
Because I see a lot of not very good
drawing that's being masked by that

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.680
and I think there's a
lot of steps in between.

We've learned the secrets
of a graphic novelist.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:48.510
We slowly crept up on Peter's own
work and career and saw how it fit,

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.450
but also kind of where it's going.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.820
