00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.680
Today,
of course I'm going to talk about the known world,
um,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.010
the second to last of our novels,
um,

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.160
in the two lectures that I have planned.
Um,

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.210
I'm going to take up fairly abstract questions because I think this novel for

5
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:22.671
all its wealth of detail calls for an address to these couple of questions and

6
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:28.680
I'll tell you about those in a minute.
But before I pursue that line of argument,

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.710
which today we'll take a somewhat narrow scope and on Wednesday we'll take in

8
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.120
the whole of the novel.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.790
I just want to hear from you a little bit about what reading this novel was like

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
just in a simple way.
How did you respond to it?
Um,

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
how did it make you feel as a reader?
What was the experience like?

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.330
What did you notice?
So who can tell me what they noticed?
Yes,
yes.

13
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.260
<v 1>Oh,
I guess I found it a little disorienting because of all the names introduce</v>

14
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.290
quickly at the beginning and jumping around and also the referencing the dead

15
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.540
people notice being alive.
So that was really using it as the way I do.

16
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:11.610
But I also really liked it mostly because of the descriptive language that we

17
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.444
use to use,

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
particularly when referring to nature felt like captured through the environment

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
really well.
So I enjoy it.

20
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.480
<v 0>So was the,
was the natural description of kind of grounding in that context of</v>

21
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.240
disorientation that that's very,
that's a very,

22
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:32.440
I think I'm perceptive take on what he's doing in the novel.
Yeah.
What else?

23
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:34.720
What else did you notice?
Yes.

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.630
<v 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.630
the lack of a strong central plot made it difficult for me to come back to the

26
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:45.960
boat once I put it down.
I thought that it was beautifully written,

27
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:48.540
which meant that when I was sitting there reading it,

28
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.660
I had no trouble staying engaged with the book.
But when I put it down,

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.970
sort of forgot about it and have no interest in picking it up again until I did

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.813
because I have to.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.680
<v 0>It's terrible,
isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.</v>

32
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.510
It has an interesting effect that way.
It's like a,
as I was saying,

33
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.960
I think a tear friend,
uh,
in office hours,
um,

34
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.320
that it's totally committed to plot,

35
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.550
but on the tiniest scale in the local sense that there are so many tiny

36
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560
narratives within this novel that there isn't one or it's hard to detect the one

37
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
that will hold you for the whole novel.
And I'll definitely,

38
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:35.930
I'll talk about that in my second lecture.
Yeah,
absolutely.

39
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.930
So that's something we have to account for.
Yes.

40
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.030
<v 1>Your thought was really interesting was how suddenly think the narrative would</v>

41
00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:47.080
jump into the future or the past.
So a lot of things about one character.

42
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.760
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.
Totally fluid,
chronological sense in the novel.</v>

43
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.260
So we have to make sense of that.
We have to know what to say about that.
Um,

44
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.960
one thing I think we say is to put it in context,

45
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.213
um,

46
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.310
is that he's doing something quite different from Toni Morrison.

47
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:14.461
Just to take a point of context that is totally apparent.

48
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.730
I think that he's writing in the same vein as Toni Morrison.

49
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.940
He's writing and historical novel about slavery and after beloved in the mid

50
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.370
eighties,
you cannot do that without being in the realm of Toni Morrison.

51
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.270
But what's interesting about the contrast in time travel between Morrison and

52
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:41.461
Jones is that with Jones at works proleptic Lhi into the future with Toni

53
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.340
Morrison,
beloved develops the concept of what she calls rememory.

54
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.600
Any of you who have read the novel or a thought about it in a classroom probably

55
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.601
have thought about this re memory is that way for the characters that the

56
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.500
memories of slavery exists independent of persons.

57
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
So that the daughter of a slave who is living in freedom,

58
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.630
if she goes back to the south,
is imagined to,
uh,

59
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
be capable of walking into a memory of slavery even though slavery is in that

60
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:16.870
moment gone.

61
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.590
So it's as if there is a free contact between the present and the past,

62
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.430
but there is not this free contact between the present and the future,

63
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.310
the way that you see in Jones.

64
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:34.210
So we want to ask ourselves in what sense is see innovating on the aims of the

65
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:39.211
historical novel as Toni Morrison wrote it 20 years or so earlier.

66
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.340
What else did you notice?

67
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.150
What other feelings did you have about the reading experience?

68
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.960
Is it like anything else?
We've read this term and if so,
what

69
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.440
is it like anything else?

70
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.610
<v 1>Yes.
Hi.</v>

71
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.680
This is kind of a weird comparison to make because it morality issues,

72
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:14.000
but it reminded me of blood meridian incentives though if quality of lots of

73
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.920
different thoughts and events.

74
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.620
<v 0>Yeah,
that's an interesting parallel.</v>

75
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.770
So it has a detailed attention to to the particular which ends up leeching

76
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.330
significance out of a particular,
yes,

77
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.560
both novels do that and it does call into question.
I think for both novels,

78
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.830
how we're to read it's morality because both are deliberately take up subjects

79
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.510
that evoke in us moral responses.
So Jones is choice.
You know,

80
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.770
if you think about a Nebach off setting himself up with a problem,

81
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.930
how can you make us a love,
a pdf file?

82
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.370
Jones,

83
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.370
his problem chest problem is what do you do with a black slave owner?

84
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.400
How are we to understand the phenomenon of black slave ownership?

85
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.520
So that's the moral question he brings up and we will have to see whether

86
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.300
ambivalence finally gives away to critique,

87
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.130
whether there is a strong moral critique of the situations that he sets up.

88
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.850
Um,
let me begin then.
I,
I,

89
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.400
I have some sense of how you're receiving the book,
so that's helpful.
I,

90
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.070
I thank you for that.
Um,

91
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.050
let me begin then with my abstract question and it really comes from,

92
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.200
from the title of the book,
the known world.

93
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.150
It raises in that title immediately the question of knowledge.

94
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.040
How do you know anything that is a central question for this book?

95
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.000
How do you know anything?

96
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.870
The abstract question I'm going to ask on Wednesday is how does anything exist?

97
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.480
Another extremely abstract question,
how can anything exist?

98
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.850
So those are my two sort of governing questions.

99
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.470
It will become much fuller and more detailed and concrete as I,

100
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.240
uh,
as I lecture.
How do you know anything?
A related question is,

101
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.920
who is the knower?
The known world known by whom?

102
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.980
So the question of the subject of knowing the person who knows is immediately

103
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.610
also at issue.
Who is that person?

104
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.640
Is that person accessible to us?
Can we know that person

105
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.720
history poses in the contemporary period?

106
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.960
All those problems of knowledge,

107
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.640
and I think this is one reason why this is a historical novel and it's one

108
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:57.641
reason why fiction turns to the historical in this period because the practice

109
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.551
of history at this time in the second half of the 20th century begins to change.

110
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.070
So it used to be that historians felt that they could know the past when they

111
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.800
had gained a certain distance from it,
it would become knowable,

112
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.530
that objective distance.

113
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.850
And so any historian worth his salt would probably be loath to write about

114
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:31.070
something to recent because that wasn't what history was all about.

115
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.680
History was about getting perspective,

116
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.060
the perspective and objectivity that time provides.

117
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.390
Well,
in the mid 20th century,

118
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:45.560
this vision of history began to change and I'm going to mention a couple of

119
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:48.710
figures here that are especially relevant to literary studies.

120
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.270
One is Michel Foucault,
a French historian and philosopher,

121
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.020
who in the 19 began to argue that history was best understood as the evolution

122
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.770
of discursive systems,
systems,

123
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:09.210
essentially of language married to institutional power,

124
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.530
and that those systems were properly understood as shaping what we could know

125
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.300
and the social identities one could inhabit at any given time.

126
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.350
So in the early sixties he writes about the history of insanity.

127
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.200
He writes about the history of sexuality.

128
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.680
He writes about the history of prisons and discipline,

129
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.250
and he argues that institutions like the asylum and the prison

130
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.080
form modern subjectivities form how it is that we think we can be people and

131
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.700
know things.

132
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:49.550
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.800
<v 0>So the argument goes something like,</v>

134
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.190
you can't be a modern madman without the asylum.

135
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.230
It's not like madness existed.

136
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.170
And then asylums got built to take care of it.

137
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.033
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.200
<v 0>He sees the rise of the asylum and the euro and the rise of clinical insanity as</v>

139
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.360
requiring one another.
You can't have one without the other.

140
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.570
So it's the rise of the defining institution that maps directly onto the rise of

141
00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:28.420
any condition like that.
Similarly,

142
00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:31.720
sexuality laws that govern deviance,

143
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.970
norms of behavior that stabilized gender.

144
00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:41.971
There are some wonderful stories from medieval French literature for example,

145
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:45.930
that Fuko talks about,
um,
that feature,
uh,

146
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.720
girls who jump over ditches and suddenly become boys.

147
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:56.190
<v 0>There's this sense of instability of gender that he brings out of some</v>

149
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.690
historical material.

150
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.200
And then he talks about how we came to believe that gender was stable and what

151
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.620
discursive systems were required,
what laws,

152
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.720
what kinds of etiquette,

153
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.140
what kinds of education we're required to make us believe that gender was stable

154
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.070
among other things.

155
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.630
So this kind of history suggests a couple of things to those of us who study

156
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:28.671
literature and it did so very powerfully in the 1980s and that is that discourse

157
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.950
language is extremely powerful.

158
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.850
It affects how we can know anything.

159
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.750
It's not just the medium in which we can describe what we know.

160
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.520
It's that very foundation through which we know anything.

161
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.810
And I think some of the revisionist history that you see taking place in fiction

162
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.720
and here all have recourse again to beloved,
um,

163
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.490
demonstrates the belief in languages power to make history.

164
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.440
Toni Morrison is in beloved looking towards fiction to do something else too.

165
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.230
And that's to replace lost history.

166
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.640
Another development out of [inaudible] working and the work of others is an

167
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:21.580
interrogation of the archive.
What's in the archive,

168
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.800
what kind of archive do we use?

169
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.890
If you're interested in the history of institutions,

170
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.750
that's a very different looking historical archive than it would be if you just

171
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.330
think that great men make history.

172
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.930
So then you go and you look at the lives of the great men over time who have

173
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:38.830
made history.

174
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.580
That's a very different looking archive or if you think the history is made by

175
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:46.540
governments.
So there's a whole movement,
um,

176
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.580
in the eighties and nineties,

177
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.700
the new social history that takes the archive to be much broader than it was

178
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.230
before,

179
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.520
to include all kinds of things that common people experienced.

180
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.480
So the letters of factory workers,

181
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.280
the popular magazines and so on,
all kinds of Ephemera,

182
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.390
what historians would call a Femora came to be important in a new way.

183
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.690
Morrison uses that to imagine a history that can't be told because there is no

184
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.050
archive for it.
And in the case of beloved,

185
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.230
it's the history of the illiterate slave woman.

186
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.430
She finds a newspaper cutting about a woman who killed her children,

187
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.391
uh,

188
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:36.391
rather than have them return to slavery and she lets fiction do the work that

189
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:40.000
history cannot do,
which is tell that woman's story.

190
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.460
So it's a kind of recovery that the new social history and the developments

191
00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:47.610
coming out of Fuckos work,
uh,

192
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.220
are making happen in the discipline of history here.

193
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.280
It's happening in literature and having its effects in literature.

194
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.100
So what other historian I want to mention,
that's Hayden White.

195
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:02.370
Hayden White was a historian who argued that our notions of how history should

196
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:07.870
be written are deeply informed by our understandings of how narrative work.

197
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.530
So this is part of the overthrow of what you might call teleological history.

198
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.650
The idea that history has a trajectory,

199
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.600
that it has a goal.
And this would be related to,
uh,
you know,

200
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:27.601
history is about either the inevitable rise of certain kinds of humanist thought

201
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.280
in the West or about the decline of civilizations over time.

202
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.520
Both of those versions of history are teleological.

203
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.540
They suggest that history has a point.
Hayden White,

204
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.150
red history like literature.

205
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.750
He argued that historical accounts were in plotted,

206
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.740
that they were shaped in their argument by the very set up by literary works.

207
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.830
So we expect stories to go a certain way.
And so that's how history gets written.

208
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:00.570
Uh,

209
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:05.570
I think that Jones is somewhat more interested in this second version of the new

210
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:09.104
history,

211
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.530
a history that's very aware of it's plotting and it's this question of the grand

212
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.370
narrative of history.
That's very much an issue.

213
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.420
How do you know where history is tending?

214
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.090
This is certainly a question for Jones.

215
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.740
And I'm going to now just say one small thing and I'm going to come back to the

216
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:36.650
quote this question in the,
in the course of this lecture about postmodernism.

217
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.460
So one feature of what is called postmodernism is this decline of the grand

218
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.924
narrative.

219
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.310
So John Francois Leotard wrote something called the postmodern condition.

220
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.760
He argued that we could have no overarching cultural narratives,

221
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.180
religious narratives,
historical narratives,
social narratives,

222
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.840
moral narratives in the postmodern age.

223
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.110
Because in the postmodern age,
everything is fragmented.

224
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.740
Fragmentation is the hallmark of the postmodern.
For him,

225
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.620
it has to do with the rise of global capitalism.

226
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.550
And this is an argument that is related to Frederick Jamison's argument about

227
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:19.700
postmodernism.

228
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:26.650
And Jamison and leotard are a parallel in their analysis.

229
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.060
They give different value to this tradition,
to this condition.
Sorry,

230
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.660
the are tarred celebrates it.
It's a kind of freedom for him.

231
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.540
The freedom from the grand narrative.

232
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.700
Jamison is much more skeptical about its,
uh,

233
00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:47.060
its qualities and sees it,
uh,
largely as,

234
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.710
as damaging to persons.

235
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.280
So one question we want to ask is if there are any grand narratives in Jones,

236
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.220
are they seen as consolatory?

237
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.990
Did they provide any compensation for the sufferings of the present?

238
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.030
So this is one question I want you to sort of hold in your mind.

239
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:17.040
What is this novels attitude toward narrative as such,

240
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.330
both on the small level and on the ground level.
On the small level,

241
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:25.350
it's a little more apparent.
It's clear.
The novel values,

242
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.030
the tiny version of narrative.
Does it value the large version?

243
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.650
So with all those sort of abstract questions in mind,

244
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.700
I want to turn to the novel and look at how knowledge,

245
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.420
uh,
especially knowledge of history,

246
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.930
knowledge of the past is generated in the first example I want to turn to is

247
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:48.954
that of

248
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.670
telling cal Donya the story of Henry's building the plantation.

249
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.430
This is on page two oh nine.

250
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.723
<v 2>Okay.</v>

251
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.370
<v 0>So this is after Henry's death and Caledonia Calls Moses in.</v>

252
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.940
And as a way of comforting her,

253
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.120
Moses begins to tell this story.

254
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.800
Moses took his eyes from his lap and began to invent some early days when they

255
00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:28.310
were building the house and there was not much on the land except what God had

256
00:18:28.311 --> 00:18:32.480
put there.
Caledonia was at the edge of the city in her morning dress.

257
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.030
Now Master Henry always knows node what kind of house he would want it to build.

258
00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:41.540
Mistress,
I don't even think he knows about you that particular time,

259
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:45.260
but he must've had some idea that you was out there somewhere waiting in your

260
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:49.730
own kind of way.
Cause he set up about building a house that you would want.

261
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.930
He built it up from nothing.
I was there,
but I wasn't there like he was there.

262
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.580
He said to me that first day,
he said,
Moses,
we going to start with the kitchen.

263
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.430
A wife needs a place to fix her meals for her family.

264
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.440
That is where we go start and he bent down and master drove in that first nail.

265
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.670
Bam.
That was a Monday mistress cause mass to Henry didn't believe in starting

266
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:14.150
something on a Sunday.
God's Day Caledonia,

267
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.290
her hands clasped in her lap,
leaned back and closed her eyes.

268
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.700
The story about the first nail came a little more than a month after Henry had

269
00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:23.660
been in his grave.

270
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.760
It was gospel among slaves that one of the quickest ways to hell was to tell

271
00:19:28.761 --> 00:19:32.210
lies about dead people.
But Moses did not think about that.

272
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.950
As he spoke of the first nail,

273
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.580
did not think about the dead needing the truth to be told about them.

274
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.030
He did not think about it until that day.
Odin peoples,

275
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.070
the Cherokee patroller said to the men around him about Moses have to up here.

276
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.380
I'll take him in.
He ain't gone bleed for long.

277
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

278
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:56.260
<v 0>There are all kinds of cues in this little tiny passage to the production of</v>

279
00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:01.520
knowledge.
So first of all,

280
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:06.030
let me point out a literary resonance,

281
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.690
and that's to Faulkner's Absalom,
Absalom,

282
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.100
which is the story of Henry Suck pen,
another Henry.

283
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.790
And the way he built a plantation out of nothing.

284
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

285
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.700
<v 0>And what's remarkable about Sud pen,
his overarching,
uh,</v>

286
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:28.590
and overwhelming characteristic is that he had a plan,

287
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.990
a plan that reached all the way down through his heirs.

288
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.600
<v 0>And part of that plan was the unblemished whiteness of the line he was</v>

290
00:20:40.601 --> 00:20:41.434
establishing.

291
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:48.220
<v 0>So this story about another Henry,
another master,</v>

293
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:53.221
Henry pulling a plantation out of the wilderness with his bare hands,

294
00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.070
echoes those literary stories that we have in our minds.

295
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.360
Now,
of course,

296
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.430
we aren't to believe that Moses has red Absalom,
Absalom long.

297
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
It's not that Moses is taking that story in particular,

298
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.880
but just that for Moses,

299
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
the story of a masterful creator was already in his vocabulary.

300
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.510
And for Jones that he wants to have us think about stories like that.

301
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.230
So this is what it calls to mind on two levels.

302
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:35.970
<v 2>He</v>

303
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.860
<v 0>deliberately casts it.</v>

304
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:42.210
Moses does as a godlike creation,

305
00:21:42.211 --> 00:21:47.211
having him start on a Monday as if it were the first day of God's seven days of

306
00:21:47.581 --> 00:21:50.010
creation in the book of Genesis.

307
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.010
Now then you get warnings.

308
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.380
The quickest way to hell was to tell lies about dead people.

309
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.650
That knowledge suggests a whole body of oral tradition among the slaves.

310
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.780
So it is folk wisdom.
It is a folk warning.

311
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.010
<v 2>Okay?</v>

312
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:21.010
<v 0>What Moses does then is stand up against folk wisdom and he takes on for himself</v>

313
00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:27.470
the power of a masterful creator.

314
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:33.170
So he does himself what he assigns to Henry,

315
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:38.060
he becomes a creator here in language.

316
00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:45.550
The warning from the collective wisdom stands at odd with his individuality.

317
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.970
At that moment it's at odds with his,

318
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.143
<v 2>uh,</v>

319
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.550
<v 0>his seizing that power for himself.</v>

320
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.660
And we will see as the novel goes on the repercussions of his having done that

321
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.180
for the slaves in the slave quarters,

322
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.780
it will have serious repercussions,
some good,
some bad.

323
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.740
And here we're told that there is something in the future for him too.

324
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:22.190
That is a repercussion that involves blood and his disabling.

325
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.500
This kind of knowledge is that old familiar friend foreshadowing of course.

326
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.440
So this is yet another kind of knowledge that Jones puts in front of us.

327
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.200
It's the proleptic knowledge,

328
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:45.230
the knowledge looking ahead to the future that the author of a narrative is in

329
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:51.791
the sole position of given it's the prerogative of the maker to tell us what's

330
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:57.560
coming next because it's only the maker who knows what the whole is looking
like,

331
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:03.130
what the whole will look like because it's the maker's intention that will

332
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.390
determine everything that happens.

333
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.590
And so there's yet this other layer of knowledge and a voice.

334
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.660
There is a narrator in the mix here who is not Moses,

335
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.430
who is Jones or the writer of this novel,
whoever.

336
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:26.210
We want to imagine that to be a,
we'll call him Jones,

337
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.280
who knows something that Moses doesn't,

338
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.040
we are put in the position of being on the same plane as that creator.

339
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:43.510
So it puts Moses in the tragic position of not knowing his fate.

340
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.130
He's a little like Oedipus in this way,

341
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.520
that the gods all know what the facts are about his life and the life of the

342
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.950
world.
But he doesn't,
he blunders along.

343
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.480
There's that ironic distance between the knowledge of the audience and the

344
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.020
knowledge of the character in the dramatic situations.

345
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:07.640
So Moses is in that position here.
Now.

346
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.360
What is exactly he lying about?
Well,

347
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:13.430
we get other versions

348
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:20.230
of Henry's beginning on one 22.

349
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.460
We see a slightly different story,

350
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.110
and I'm not gonna read too much out of here,
but if you turn there,
you'll recall

351
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.240
that early in the building of the plantation,

352
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.380
Moses and Henry are tussling in the dirt when William Robbins rides up.

353
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:51.380
And Robbins makes a point of scolding Henry for thinking that he is,

354
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.380
uh,
somehow not different from his slave.

355
00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.160
And he advises him that he must make that a bright and in during line between

356
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:02.334
them.

357
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:08.210
So this plantation is founded on the white man's policing,

358
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.400
the divide between master and slave.

359
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.590
Even after his slave,
Henry has bought his freedom.

360
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

361
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.520
<v 0>So it's perpetuated between Robbins and Henry that Signorile power and Henry</v>

362
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:34.421
acquiesces and disciplines Moses in an arbitrary way.

363
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.470
Moses when he comes,
when,
uh,

364
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:43.070
Henry comes back from speaking with William Robbins,
wants to continue working,

365
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.130
loves to work.
He loves the completion of work.

366
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.590
He is a very fine builder.

367
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:54.210
We learn in the steam that he can build in the dark just by feel and by the

368
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.860
sense of the place of things.

369
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.890
And so Moses is told not to work.

370
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.870
Henry slaps him and Moses then keeps on working.

371
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.380
Uh,
anyway,
after Henry leaves.

372
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.390
So in that story,
Moses is the maker,

373
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.220
not so much Henry.

374
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.360
And if there is an origin before that scene of Moses building in the dark,

375
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.690
it's a scene of the two of them tussling on the ground.

376
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.130
So William Robbins is right there is a blurring of the distinction between

377
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:34.890
master and slave.
It's that,

378
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.700
and it's sundering that is the origin of the plantation.

379
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.800
And were told also in this chapter that he hadn't even thought he,

380
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:46.620
Henry hadn't even thought about Caledonia yet.

381
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.160
Equally,
we learn in passing on page 59,

382
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.280
that very,
uh,

383
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.720
soon before that scene of him and Moses

384
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.700
that Henry was already dreaming of his plantation.

385
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.510
This is at the very bottom of the page.

386
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.810
Moses made to go down the lane of cabins,

387
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.820
eight on one side of the lane and eight on the other side laid out just the way

388
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:25.821
Henry Townsend had seen them in a dream when he was 21 years old and without a

389
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.750
slave to his name.

390
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.440
It's not a kitchen for a future wife,

391
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.950
but a line of slave cabins for his future slaves that Henry has in mind.

392
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.790
That's the origin that Moses is lying about.

393
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.990
So there are two layers of lies here.
One

394
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:52.610
is the lie about the plantation being built on a vision of slavery and two is

395
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:59.010
the lie on it's being built by Henry alone.

396
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.610
So Moses in telling his story,

397
00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:07.220
asserting his authority to tell history,

398
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.730
he faces himself from that history.

399
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.330
And also he faces the line of difference between slave and not slave.

400
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:19.560
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

401
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.560
<v 0>he doesn't say it was built on that distinction and that serves his purposes of</v>

402
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:26.634
course,

403
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.520
because his stories to Caledonia we'll have as their final dream,

404
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.910
the effacement of the line between him and Caledonia.

405
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.830
His dream is that she will see him as the next Mr.

406
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.660
And we'll see by the end of the novel what happens to that dream.

407
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.830
So how do you know about the past?

408
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.720
Caledonia can only know about that passed through Moses and we've seen that it's

409
00:29:55.721 --> 00:30:00.721
an incredibly complex view backward with all these layerings and once again were

410
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:06.721
asked to stand in the position of knowing more even than Moses does.

411
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.310
We know about Henry's dream of the line of slave cabins.

412
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.650
Moses doesn't know that piece.

413
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:20.130
So there's that difference cropping up on page 75 you have another version of

414
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.910
telling those stories.
When Augustus and Mildred,

415
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.511
uh,

416
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:33.511
Henry's parents lay down and held each other after a Henry's death,

417
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.440
one of them started talking.

418
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.940
They would not remember which one it was all about Henry from his birth to his

419
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:40.630
death,

420
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.630
starting a week's long project of recalling all that they could about their son.

421
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.940
If they had known how to read and write,

422
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.600
they could have put it all in a book of 2000 pages.

423
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.480
This is a very different kind of telling.
If there's a literary model here,

424
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:00.430
it's that of a dcs and Penelope,

425
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.560
I don't know if any of you have read the Odyssey.

426
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:07.561
There's this beautiful scene at the end when a DC is finally reaches Ithaca and

427
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:12.310
he and Penelope stay up all night telling each other stories.

428
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.600
They talk all night.

429
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.560
And so that's the vision you have here.

430
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.650
It's a private exchange of history and we're not told all the things that occur

431
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.580
in their conversation.

432
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.830
That is a kind of storytelling that is compensation for loss.

433
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.540
It's history as compensation and this is much more in the realm of what Toni

434
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.880
Morrison is,
is doing in her fiction

435
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.090
fiction as filling in the gaps of loss as best fiction can.

436
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.430
Now,
there's no fantasy about how complete that could ever be.
Um,

437
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.810
but there is the effort and the effort honors what's been lost.
And here,

438
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:57.280
Augustus and Mildred honor,
they're ambivalent love for their son.

439
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.650
They completely disagree with what he has done
in his life.

440
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.710
And yet they honor that loss,

441
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:10.830
telling stories to one another and they blend together as people,

442
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.120
as separate people in that act

443
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
on to 39 we can see yet a third version of how history and the world makes sense

444
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.650
and this is when council skiffington rides into Texas after his plantation burns

445
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:37.360
down.
How do you know anything?
Well,

446
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:42.510
as he meets the sort of Motley crews of people that he meets on the road,

447
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.060
he continually thinks back to the burned library at his plantation,

448
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.000
and this is in the middle of the page.

449
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:54.110
He had seen a dark old man driving the wagon,
not really a Negro,

450
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:59.111
not really from any race that was recorded in any of the books in his destroyed

451
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.200
library.

452
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.850
And then a little further down when he turned from the wagon with the pregnant

453
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:08.570
woman,
women,
a boy smiling with perfect teeth was facing him.

454
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.590
He knew the origins of this one from another of the destroyed books.

455
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:14.060
Someone from the Orient.

456
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

457
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.390
<v 0>Council brings with him from the destroyed library.</v>

458
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:25.510
The categories of knowledge that he hopes will make the world make sense.

459
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

460
00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.070
<v 0>It fails him often</v>

461
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.440
as in the brown man.

462
00:33:34.441 --> 00:33:36.810
He can't quite categorize from the books.

463
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:42.420
It gives him satisfactions on those occasions when it's categories do apply.

464
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.410
So council is a model for that person who takes the discursive knowledge of his

465
00:33:48.841 --> 00:33:51.360
culture and tries to fit the world.

466
00:33:51.361 --> 00:33:55.800
He encounters into it and he's troubled when it doesn't work.

467
00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.320
So this is a mode of knowledge that fits quite nicely with what I've been

468
00:34:01.321 --> 00:34:02.580
telling you.
Uh,

469
00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:07.581
in a sort of simplified way about Fuckos understanding of how history works.

470
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.750
And so here you have a version of that right in the,

471
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.790
in the character of council.

472
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:16.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

473
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:25.090
<v 0>So some of the problems that these scenes point up are how can the knower no</v>

474
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:31.151
anything when the knower himself or herself is a fragmented person.

475
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:35.990
And I think the fragmenting of knowledge across layers,
what do we know?

476
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.870
What does Moses know?
What does Caledonia know?

477
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.730
What does the narrator seem to know?

478
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:46.330
That fragmentation makes it impossible to imagine a subjectivity for any of

479
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:52.241
these characters that can truly encompass a stable worldview.

480
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

481
00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:59.710
<v 0>So that fragmentation of self is another layer of the problem of knowledge.</v>

482
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.630
How can you know anything when you're not a stable knower yourself?

483
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

484
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:11.330
<v 0>And I just want to look back to some of the other readings on our syllabus to</v>

485
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:14.630
think about how these problems have been addressed.

486
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.920
So how do you know about the past and Robinson for Maryland?

487
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:23.830
Robinson for her writing is the transcription of,

488
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.480
of consciousness of human consciousness.

489
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.840
There's an endless present to her work.

490
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.570
And when she talks about writers from the 19th century,
for example,

491
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.210
Hawthorne Dickinson Amerson thorough,

492
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.690
she calls them aunts and uncles.
I think it's very telling.

493
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.380
It's as if they were part of her family,
part of her present.

494
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.590
And I think that's indicative of how she thinks of writing.

495
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.940
And it's access to the past because writing is,

496
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.840
is continuous with consciousness.

497
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.560
You can simply know the past by reading it.

498
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:06.120
If you read her essays on history that's fully born out in the assumptions that

499
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:11.010
she makes.
Um,
if you think about Cormac Mccarthy,

500
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.590
how can you know the past?
Well,

501
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:18.591
his trans historical vision suggests that to know the past is simply to know

502
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:25.140
human nature or to know human nature is to know the past.

503
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.600
So remember those epigraphs about the ancient evidence of scalping.

504
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.800
It suggest that the human tendency towards violence has no origin,

505
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.060
has no end.

506
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.950
It's a different kind of eternal present from Robinson's.

507
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.520
And yet it is still one that gives him a seamless access to the past so he can

508
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:53.820
make modern,
uh,
us,

509
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:58.760
Mexico border look very much like,
uh,

510
00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.461
for example,

511
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:03.450
the u s Mexico border in the 1840 [inaudible] and this is later in his border

512
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:07.620
trilogy.
When you see the,
um,
nuclear tests in the same,

513
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.150
uh,
in the same landscape that we've seen all the action of blood Meridian.

514
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.020
So he makes those two look very similar in that landscape fill abroad.

515
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.980
How do you know the past?
Well,

516
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:23.730
this is a major theme of my lecture on Wednesday of last week.

517
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.040
How does Nathan know any of Pullman's past?

518
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:33.060
He has to rely on other narrators.

519
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.430
We have to rely on him.

520
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.200
I was questioning his credibility as a narrator,

521
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.660
as someone who could tell us about the past.

522
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.860
So there's that level of problem raised in that novel.

523
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.160
At the same time,
like McCarthy,

524
00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:55.080
he has a trans historical understanding of what access to the past would be

525
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.260
through the trans historical theme of Desire.

526
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:03.300
So desire is the same now as it was in Hawthorne's time.

527
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:08.630
The desire to purify the American Libido in the Monica Lewinsky trial

528
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:17.150
is not different for Roth from the spasm of purification that Hawthorne writes

529
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:20.310
about in the scarlet letter.

530
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.760
So that is a different vision of what it means to be trans historical.

531
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.480
And I think it allows for Roth,
uh,

532
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.620
that fearless setting of the,

533
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.490
he doesn't look to a historical setting that's distant from himself.

534
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.480
He sees the present as history.
And if you believe in the Trans historical,

535
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:50.590
you can make that move because you don't need the distance from history to get

536
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.330
objective purchase on it.
It's all sort of part of the same story.

537
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.110
And then if you think about the woman warrior,

538
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:04.830
how do you get a usable past out of the layers and layers of secrecy,

539
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.240
partial narration,

540
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:12.241
fragmentation that you get from parents telling you stories about your past and

541
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:17.080
about their past while you have to stitch it together.

542
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:24.780
So her argument is that the past is what you make it.

543
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.280
A usable for

544
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.940
the past becomes its use for you.

545
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.200
She builds a self out of that past

546
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.580
in the face of these difficulties.

547
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.590
Empathy and sentiment come to be much more powerful.

548
00:39:48.591 --> 00:39:52.070
And I think the writers in this part of the syllabus,

549
00:39:52.071 --> 00:39:56.900
this last part of the syllabus depend a lot on sentiment.
And because of that,

550
00:39:56.901 --> 00:40:00.140
they look back to the 19th century.
Edward P.

551
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.190
Jones is very busy using the tools of the 19th century narrative.

552
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:09.610
The omniscient narrator is very much characteristic of 19th century novels.

553
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.440
So if you read Harriet Beecher Stowe,
for example,

554
00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:16.720
if any of you have taken English one 27 a and have read that novel,
uh,

555
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:20.030
you'll remember all the very,
uh,

556
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:25.390
broad addresses to the reader about what's going on.

557
00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:30.980
There's that omniscient sense that the narrator has all the pieces under her

558
00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:31.814
control.

559
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.340
Joan's looks back to that tradition and borrows from it.
Uh,

560
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:44.270
also fearlessly.
This has been since modernism,
quite a,
a,

561
00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:48.920
um,
uh,
less distinguished mode of narration.

562
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:55.070
So he's trading modernist limitation of knowledge.

563
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.260
If any of you read Henry James,

564
00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.640
my favorite example is this novel called what Maisie new,

565
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:07.090
which is told in free indirect discourse through the consciousness of a child,

566
00:41:07.701 --> 00:41:11.630
Maisie,
who is the child of an aristocratic family,

567
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.930
the parents of whom are always having extra marital affairs.

568
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:19.250
It's a very confusing family,
uh,
to be living in for this young girl.

569
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:24.170
And the narrative is extremely confusing.
Well,

570
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.380
Jones will have nothing to do with that kind of partiality,

571
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.600
that kind of limit on perception.

572
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.650
So he has left behind those experiments with transcribing the very limits of

573
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:42.161
human consciousness and he is up in the God consciousness of the 19th century.

574
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:50.020
Is that God consciousness?
Any consolation?
Well,

575
00:41:50.021 --> 00:41:54.790
if we look at page 51,
this is just one tiny example.
They're all over the place.

576
00:41:55.870 --> 00:42:00.870
This is one of those tiny interpolated stories about the woman who opens the box

577
00:42:01.121 --> 00:42:04.090
of walking sticks and Rita is hiding and side.

578
00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.430
She's escaped from Robbins plantation.

579
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:09.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

580
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.990
<v 0>So this is her little story.
The bottom paragraph.
Mary O'Donnell,</v>

581
00:42:13.991 --> 00:42:16.960
Conland would never live comp comfortably in America.

582
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.830
She comes over from Ireland.
Long before the HMS,

583
00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:24.550
Tim's had even seen the American shore America,

584
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.900
the land of promise and hope had reached out across the sea and taken her

585
00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:32.170
husband,
a man who had taken her heart and kept it.

586
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:37.530
And America had taken her baby too innocent beings in the vastness of a world

587
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.660
with all kinds of things that could have been taken first.

588
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.010
She held nothing against God.
God was simply being God,

589
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:50.190
but she could not forgive America and saw it as the cause of all her misery.

590
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.880
So God is seen in this little tiny snippet to be totally arbitrary.

591
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.220
And I think that's the sense you get in most of these passages about the divine,

592
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:11.370
that God allows violent actions to occur without seeming cause,

593
00:43:13.571 --> 00:43:14.650
without reason.

594
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.980
And it's up to the human beings to try to stitch stories together that can make

595
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:21.910
sense of them.

596
00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.180
And Mary in this passage chooses to be angry at America instead chooses America

597
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.150
as the story that will unify these,
uh,

598
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.690
deaths even in a negative way.

599
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.540
It doesn't offer constellation exactly,

600
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:40.240
but at least it offers a target for her anger.

601
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:47.230
And now I just want to see a on one 76 to look at this with you.

602
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:50.700
<v 2>Okay?</v>

603
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.360
<v 0>In addition to these tiny thematic</v>

604
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.490
visits to some of these questions throughout the novel,

605
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.210
the question of stitching together,

606
00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:08.211
can you stitch together the events of the world according to some larger

607
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.590
consciousness?
This becomes a question,
um,

608
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.340
with formal implications.

609
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.220
This is in the middle of one 76.
If you remember,

610
00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:24.300
this is about the trial John Broussard who has killed his partner.

611
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.350
He is the original,
uh,

612
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.700
person who brought Moses into Manchester County.

613
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:31.930
<v 2>Okay?</v>

614
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.880
<v 0>And this is what we learn.</v>

615
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:39.670
We've just at the top of page one 76 heard about what happened to Broussard's

616
00:44:39.671 --> 00:44:41.110
family in France.

617
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:45.430
If all Morgenson this is the partner,

618
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:50.590
the murdered man had any heirs.
No one knew about them.
Now listen,

619
00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:54.100
as we go on the records of the Joan Broussard trial,

620
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.760
along with most of the judicial records of the 19th of 19th century,

621
00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:02.020
Manchester County were destroyed and in 1912 fire that killed 10 people

622
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:06.040
including the Negro caretaker of the building where the records were kept and

623
00:45:06.041 --> 00:45:07.390
five dogs and two horses.

624
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:12.130
The Broussard trial took one day actually part of the day,
the trial itself,

625
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.930
all that morning and the jury deliberations,
a portion of the summer afternoon,

626
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.950
one of the jurors was a man who had studied the law at the College of William

627
00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:23.650
and Mary where his father and grandfather had gone.

628
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.190
When that man Arthur brindle returned from college and can't,

629
00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.140
I'm not going to go into Brendel story quite yet.

630
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.210
Notice how sentence by sentence we get from the ratio of the past.

631
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:39.240
There are no records for a whole century because of this fire.

632
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.150
<v 0>Two historical detail that makes us make us ask,</v>

634
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.750
um,
where the details come from.

635
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.500
Destroyed in 1912 fire that killed 10 people,

636
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.530
including the Negro caretaker of the building.

637
00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:01.480
It gets more and more specific where the records were kept and five dogs and two

638
00:46:01.481 --> 00:46:06.040
horses,
animals who you'd think maybe wouldn't be part of the public record.

639
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:08.680
Their loss wouldn't necessarily be recorded.

640
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:15.030
We're told even in the absence of the trial papers that it took one day and then

641
00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:19.300
it gets even more specific,
actually part of the day and more specific still,

642
00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.760
which part of it was in the morning,

643
00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.770
the regular trial jury deliberation in the afternoon.

644
00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:28.150
It was a summer afternoon.

645
00:46:28.151 --> 00:46:31.120
We know more and more and more as we go from sentence to sentence,

646
00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:34.810
how do we know all that?
How does this narrator,
no,
all that.

647
00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.820
Where does this knowledge come from?

648
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:44.290
The knowledge becomes more and more intimate as this passage goes on as we learn

649
00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:49.340
about Arthur brindle,
his insomnia,

650
00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.700
the way he liked to talk to his wife as a mode of relaxing himself before trying

651
00:46:55.221 --> 00:46:56.054
to sleep.

652
00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:02.230
And then we get his reflection finally on the trial and why Broussard was

653
00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:08.990
convicted.
And this is on one 77
says it wasn't,

654
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.453
uh,

655
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:15.710
it was not the insistence on his American citizenship.
That was the problem.

656
00:47:15.711 --> 00:47:19.110
It wasn't the fact that his partner,
uh,

657
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:23.450
wasn't an American citizen.
That was the problem.
It was the accent.

658
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.530
The accent gave him quote,
the stench of a dissembler.

659
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.100
You want to know where that quotation comes from?

660
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:35.190
It feels like we're hearing Broussard's voice who is there with them in bed to

661
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.310
tell us this.

662
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.870
Everything Broussard said came out warped because of the accent.

663
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:43.870
Even when he spoke his own name,
the jurors,

664
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:47.560
the merchant told his wife would have been able to accept why the partner was

665
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:52.090
killed if Broussard had sat on the stand and told his whole story without an

666
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:54.520
accent.
Well,

667
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:59.521
what's interesting here is that Jones and Bruce and a brindle do tell the story

668
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:02.050
without an accent.

669
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.370
<v 2>Brendel okay.</v>

670
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.210
<v 0>Is Convinced of the Mans,</v>

671
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.320
<v 2>uh,
yes,</v>

672
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.500
<v 0>not innocence,
but the way he should not be convicted.</v>

673
00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:20.780
And yet he votes with the others to convict him.
He tells the wife,
uh,

674
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:24.470
this,
we hear the case without accent,

675
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.550
but when we do hear the accent,
it's very telling where we hear it.

676
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.240
If you look back on one 71 and sort of flip through this when we feel most

677
00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:39.800
Broussard's alienness of voice,
it's when he calls slaves,
slaves,

678
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:44.750
humans.
This is on a one 71.

679
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.310
Um,
see,
see miss your bill.
He's,
look,

680
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.760
he's talking to Robbins finest humans,

681
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.070
good humans,
the finer of the slaves.
Broussard said,
but miss your bill.

682
00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:02.960
They are finer human beings
and so on.

683
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.960
It's in those moments that he speaks something closest to the truth,

684
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.350
right?
That we can hear him speaking to us,

685
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:18.290
the truth of slavery and to his interlocutors,
the truth of slavery.

686
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.350
It's the accent that actually reveals the truth.

687
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.870
So when we hear the accent,

688
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.280
even though we're hearing it through the narrator that doesn't speak with an

689
00:49:28.281 --> 00:49:29.000
accent,

690
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.440
we hear the critique of slavery shining through that.

691
00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:36.130
The people in the situation living,
uh,

692
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:38.900
living there and listening to his accent cannot hear.

693
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.180
But why?
Remember that little sentence?
I read the beginning.

694
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:49.960
If own your Gunston the murdered man had any errors.

695
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.800
No one knew about them.
What an odd cafe hot.

696
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.400
If this narrator knows all this,

697
00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:02.290
why doesn't he know about [inaudible] heirs,

698
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.390
his family?
So what accounts for the lapses in knowledge?

699
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:12.010
How do we know where this knower is situated?

700
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:19.370
So I'm going to stop there,
but before you pack up,

701
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:25.090
what I'd like you to think about for next time is what it means to make

702
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.790
something so that it exists.

703
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.510
And think about that in relation to the novel.

704
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.950
If knowledge is this complicated to produce,

705
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.500
what is the status of those things that are made with care and intention and

706
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:49.880
made as whole objects?
So think about the art forms,

707
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:52.160
the different art forms in the novel,
and,

708
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.270
and think about those individual small stories and the whole novel itself.
