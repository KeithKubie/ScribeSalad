00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.040
There is a kind of argument that begins with
one partner deliberately – and for no immediately

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.800
obvious reason – attempting to spoil the
good mood and high spirits of the other. The

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.039
cheerful partner may be cooking a cake for
their visiting nephew or whistling a tune

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.880
while they rearrange the kitchen. They may
be making plans for the weekend or discussing

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.110
what fun it will be to see an old school friend
again soon. Or they may be expressing unusual

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.940
optimism about their professional future and
financial prospects. Despite our love for

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.990
them, something about the situation may suddenly
grate with us. Within a short time, we may

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.019
find ourselves saying something unusually
harsh or critical: we may point out a flaw

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.149
with their school friend (they tell very boring
anecdotes, they can be pretty snobbish); we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.860
may take exception to the arrangement of the
cupboards; we find fault with the cake; we

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.420
bring up an aspect of their work that we know
our partner finds dispiriting; we complain

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.960
that they haven’t properly considered the
roadworks when planning the weekend. We do

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.950
everything to try to induce a mood of anxiety,
friction and misery. On the surface it looks

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.890
as if we’re simply monsters. But if we dig
a little deeper, a more understandable (though

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.200
no less regrettable) picture may emerge. We
are acting in this way because our partner’s

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.640
buoyant and breezy mood can come across as
a forbidding barrier to communication. We

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.640
fear that their current happiness could prevent
them from knowing the shame or melancholy,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.000
worry or loneliness that presently possess
us. We are trying to shatter their spirits

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.969
because we are afraid of being lonely. We
don’t make this argument explicitly to ourselves

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.200
but a dark instinct in our minds experiences
their upbeat mood as a warning that the uncheery

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.759
parts of ourselves must now be unwelcome.
And so we make a crude, wholly immature but

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.470
psychologically comprehensible assumption
that we will never be properly known and loved

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.890
until our partner can feel as sad and frustrated
as we do, a recalibration of mood that we

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.300
put into motion with malicious determination.
But of course, the truth is quite the contrary.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.459
We may succeed in making our partner upset
but we almost certainly won’t thereby secure

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.540
the imagined benefits of their gloom: they
won’t – once their mood has been spoilt

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.690
– emerge with any greater appetite for listening
to our messages of distress or for cradling

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.610
us indulgently in their consoling arms. They
will just be furious. The better move – if

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.470
only we could manage it – would be to confess
to, rather than act out, our impulses. We

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.730
would learn to get to know the mechanisms
of our immaturity with unfrightened curiosity

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.599
while making every effort to protect others
from its effects. We would admit to our partner

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.300
that we had been seized by an ugly fear about
the consequences of their happiness, would

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.600
laughingly reveal how much we would ideally
love to cause a stink, and would firmly pledge

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.110
that we naturally aren’t about to. We would
all the while remind ourselves that every

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.120
cheerful person has been sad and that the
buoyant among us have by far the best chances

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.680
of keeping afloat those who remain emotionally
at sea. The spoiling argument is a wholly

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.650
paradoxical plea for love that leaves one
party ever further from the tenderness and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.340
shared insight they crave. Knowing to spot
the phenomenon should lead us – when we

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.840
are the ones baking or whistling a tune – to
remember that the person attempting to ruin

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.549
our mood isn’t perhaps just a monster (though
they are a bit of that too); they are, childishly

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.060
but sincerely, worried that our happiness
may come at their expense and are, through

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.440
their remorseless negativity, in a garbled
and maddening way, begging us for reassurance.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.120
