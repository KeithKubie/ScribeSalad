00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.020
- I'm Jeff Dodds, I'm
a Math Content Creator

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.030
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.590
I had a fixed mindset
for a really long time.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.030
I was convinced that I was a math person,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.890
and I was smart, and I
was just good at math.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.180
And so I remember the first
time I really struggled

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.990
was I was taking a linear algebra course,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.120
and the homework was not
required, it was optional.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.560
The grade just came
from quizzes every week,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.720
and a midterm and a final.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.900
And I thought that if the
lectures were making sense

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.220
then I must understand it.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.090
And so I was really frustrated
with my initially low scores,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.170
and my brain started
like switching into this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.570
really fixed mindset where
I would blame the teacher

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.485
because they must not be
preparing us well for the quizzes.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.970
But then I started to
suspect, like oh gosh,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.270
maybe I'm just not that smart.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.870
Maybe I'm not good at math after all,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.840
and I was just wrong all along.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.800
But I took to like joining study groups

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.050
for students in the class who
were doing better than me,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.630
and I thought just by
like being around them

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.810
that I could somehow like
soak up their smartness

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.090
and figure out the trick
that they had discovered.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.090
And I was kind of surprised
that their key to success

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.540
was just getting together, and doing

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660
the optional practice
problems, and talking them out,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.030
and people were vulnerable
and asking questions

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.140
and saying I don't understand this,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.790
can someone help me out with this?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.480
And it was the first time
where it kinda clicked for me

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.080
that oh, optional practice,
I don't have to do it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.740
just because it's for a grade,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.580
I can do it to learn and grow,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.670
and I have to give up
the idea that I'm smart

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.680
and understand this on my own,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.666
and work with other people
to ask them questions

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.270
when I was getting stuck with something.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.080
Or to help someone when they needed it.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.020
To help myself grow and the grades would

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.350
take care of themselves from there.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.820
I had to give up that
sense of, oh I'm smart

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.428
and I can get this all on my own.

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:48.172
It really changed the way
I approached my coursework,

00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:50.750
not just in math, but
in everything past that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.290
where I kind of realized
the importance of practice

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.500
and asking questions, and
being vulnerable enough to say,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.550
I don't understand this,
and I need some help.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.580
Being able to admit that to
myself and to other people

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.040
that I do not understand this,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.960
and you understand a lot better than me,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.940
so I would like your help please.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.773
That was really big for me,

00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:11.940
and that's still really important.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.680
When I was a teacher, or in my job today

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.990
where I think, you know
maybe there's a better way

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.320
to teach this concept, and I
can reach out to other people

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.570
and look at what they do.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.045
It's okay to not be the master

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:28.500
because we're all students,
we're all still growing,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.060
and everyone has room for
improvement in some way.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.560
And if everyone just kind of
quietly works on their own,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.170
then that's not gonna
produce the best outcomes

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.510
we can possibly get because
there's usually some area

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.010
we need help with, and
there's someone out there

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.610
who's happy to help you so why not?

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.463
Why not go take advantage of that?
