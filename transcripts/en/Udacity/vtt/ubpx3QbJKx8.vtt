00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The implementation is almost of a verbatim copy of the equation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We just introduced one little changed

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because the temperature of the old compartment is used twice.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we introduced an auxillary variable to store it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The diagram starts with the initial distribution of the temperature.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You see the action of the flame and then the heat starts to spread out further and further.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And, of course, as the total amount of energy has to stay constant,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we're not heating anymore--the peak has to go down.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We didn't treat the endpoints in our simulation.

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So after this final step, we should be careful about what's going to happen.
