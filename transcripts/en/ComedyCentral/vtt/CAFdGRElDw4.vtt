DEBATE WAS LAST NIGHT.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.106 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, YOU
GUY, THE QUEST TO DE-NEGROFY THE

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.345 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.314 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY SO LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE OR

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:19.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS I LIKE TO CALL IT THE SEARCH
FOR HILLARY'S RUNNING MATE,

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:25.725 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, IT WAS INTERESTING THAT
CNN WAS TREATING IT MORE LIKE IT

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.794 line:85%
WAS MAYWEATHER VERSUS PACQUIAO.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN THE HEART OF LAS VEGAS A
CAMPAIGN OF HEAD-TO-HEAD

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.401 line:91%
RIVALS THAT HAVE NEVER GONE
HEAD-TO-HEAD BEFORE.  HILLARY

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:39.105 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CLINTON, THE FRONTRUNNER,
BERNIE SANDERS THE SURPRISE

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.941 align:start position:0% line:91%
THREAT, THREE OTHER POLITICAL
VETERANS ARE IN THE MIX.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:44.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
THREE OTHER POLITICAL
VETERANS.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:45.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN THE MIX?

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.682 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SAY THEIR
NAMES, CNN?

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:54.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
[BLEEP] ACTUALLY, TO BE FAIR,
NOBODY CAN REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.589 align:start position:0% line:91%
SERIOUSLY, I INTERVIEWED ONE OF
THOSE GUYS.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:59.192 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:08.167 line:91%
AND DAN-- WAS IT DAN, LINCOLN
CHAFEE, YEAH, NOW LINCOLN IS A

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.535 line:85%
REALLY NICE PERSON, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.238 line:85%
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE FUN OF HIM.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.576 line:91%
BUT COME ON GUYS, HE'S MAKING IT
WAY TOO EASY WITH THAT OVERSIZED

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.777 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUIT.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.646 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR THE TIE HE CLEARLY CUT OUT OF
HIS MOTEL CURTAINS THE HOUR

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.184 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEFORE THE DEBATE, SURELY, I'M
JUST SAYING.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:29.789 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T-- I DON'T WANT TO DO
THAT.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT WAS THE SMALL TRAIN
WRECK.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BIG TRAIN WRECK CAME WHEN HE
STARTED TALKING.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.262 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MY FIRST VOTE, I JUST
ARRIVED, MY DAD HAD DIED.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.897 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY DAD HAD DIED.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.303 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE FIRST VOTE, MAYOR
OF MY CITY, MY DAD HAD DIED

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:50.109 line:91%
REALLY, TRYING TO CAPTURE THE
YOUTH WITH THAT ONE. NOTHING

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:56.482 line:91%
GETS PEOPLE TO THE POLLS LIKE
THE GRIM SPECTER OF DAD DEATH.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.853 align:start position:0% line:91%
LINCOLN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN
THIS, MOVE ON TO JIM WEBB.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.221 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.858 line:91%
GUYS, I DO NOT LIKE TO FOCUS ON
PEOPLE'S LOOKS BUT I JUST CAN'T

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:11.364 line:91%
GET PAST THE FACT THAT HE LOOKS
LIKE A MIDDLE TOE, HE DOES, I

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:11.798 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAN'T.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.765 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S IN MY MIND.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.600 line:85%
I CAN'T GET THAT OUT OF MY HEAD.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:15.834 align:start position:0% line:85%
I CAN'T.

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.471 line:91%
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:21.774 line:85%
I'M SORRY, JIM WEBB, MIDDLE TOE.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:26.245 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS
WEIRD, I WILL GIVE AN

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:29.048 line:91%
EXAMPLE.  THE CANDIDATES WERE
GIVEN THE QUESTION BLACK LIVES

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.950 size:84% position:42% line:85%
MATTER OR ALL LIVES MATTER.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.452 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW WE'RE AT THE DEMOCRATIC
DEBATE.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.088 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLACK LIVES MATTER, MOVE ON,
RIGHT.

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:40.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I THINK JIM GOT CAUGHT IN
HIS OWN WEB.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVERY LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY
MATTERS.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:49.602 line:91%
I HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF
WORKING WITH THE SITUATION OF

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:50.937 align:start position:0% line:85%
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.040 line:85%
 SITUATION?OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS?

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.446 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A
GROUP OF US?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:08.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE A SCHOOL OF FISH, OR YOU
KNOW, GAGGLE OF GEESE, YOU KNOW,

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.490 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A SITUATION OF
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:14.560 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THE SAME-- IT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start position:0% line:85%
A SITUATION.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.562 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:20.866 line:91%
YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
EVERY TIME COPS SEE A GROUP OF

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:24.003 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLACK PEOPLE THEY GO LIEUTENANT,
WE'VE GOT A SITUATION ON OUR

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
HANDS.

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.573 size:84% position:42% line:91%
IT MAKES SENSE IT DOES MAKE
SENSE, IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:28.241 size:84% position:42% line:85%
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.475 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN O'MALLEY.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:32.812 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU HEARD INSTEAD ON
THIS STAGE TONIGHT WAS AN HONEST

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:38.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEARCH FOR THE ANSWERS THAT WILL
MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:42.788 line:85%
Larry: OKAY.TOTAL DREAM BOAT.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.927 align:start position:0% line:91%
I ONLY WISH BERNIE SANDERS
IDEAS WERE COMING FROM THAT FACE

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM AT
THE BEACH?

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:54.767 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO-- I'M GOING TO CALL
HIM SECOND AMENDMENT BECAUSE

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.405 line:85%
HE'S GOT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:01.274 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE).

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:06.679 align:start position:0% line:91%
OVERALL,THE DEBATE FOR PRESIDENT
IS REALLY BETWEEN HILLARY AND

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.482 align:start position:0% line:91%
BERNIE, RIGHT, WHICH CULMINATED
IN THIS EPIC MOMENT.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.752 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE SECRETARY IS
RIGHT.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.856 line:91%
AND THAT IS THAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.495 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEARING ABOUT YOUR DAMN
E-MAILS.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:33.973 size:84% position:42% line:91%
NOTE TO SELF: NEVER LOSE MY
FRISBEE IN THAT OLD MAN'S

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.107 align:start position:0% line:85%
BACKYARD.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.044 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BUT WHAT A GALLANT MOVE THAT
WAS.  I GIVE BERNIE A LOT OF

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
CREDIT.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.847 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE IS DEFENDING THE LADY'S HONOR
AT HIS POSSIBLE POLITICAL

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.915 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXPENSE.

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:46.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS SOME SWEET ASS FROM
MAPLE SYRUP SOCIALIZING

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:47.386 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOCIALISM RIGHT THERE

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.793 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HOW DID HILLARY REACT TO THAT
ONE?

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.661 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE).

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:58.831 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOW. I MEAN WHAT AN ADULT
RESPONSE.

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.934 align:start position:0% line:91%
TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN AN INTENSE
COMPETITION FOR THE MOST

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.303 align:start position:0% line:91%
POWERFUL JOB IN THE WORLD BUT
TREATING EACH OTHER LIKE

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.539 size:75% position:38% line:85%
REASONABLE HUMAN BEINGS.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.740 align:start position:0% line:85%
HMMMM.

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.643 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT NICE, MOMENTS LIKE THAT,
THEY DON'T STACK UPRATINGS WISE.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:14.180 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS DEBATE WAS DOWN 42%
COMPARED TO THE LAST REPUBLICAN

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEBATE. I GUESS PEOPLE PREFER
THEIR

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:25.691 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEBATE HAND INTERACTIONS TO BE A
BIT MORE SPAZZY

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:29.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
I COULD WATCH THAT [BLEEP] ALL
DAY, GUYS.

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:34.233 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT YOU KNOW, I GET IT,   LAST
NIGHT'S DEBATE WAS TOO

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:36.369 align:start position:0% line:91%
FRIENDLY AND FRIENDLY EQUALS
BORING.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW TO BE HONEST, THAT MADE ME
LONG FOR SOME OF THIS.

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:43.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WATCH A FULLY-FORMED FETUS
ON THE TABLE

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.712 line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIP UP THEIR BODY PARTS AND
SELL THEM LIKE THEY ARE PARTS TO

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:47.713 align:start position:0% line:85%
A BUICK.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:50.282 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO KEEP IT ALIVE TO
HARVEST ITS BRAIN.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM A BIG
HUG AGAIN, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RAND PAUL SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
ON THIS STAGE.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:58.224 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HARVEST ITS BRAIN.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.961 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU INTERRUPTED EVERYBODY
ELSE, YOU CAN'T INTERRUPT ME.

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:05.631 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HARVEST ITS BRAIN.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:06.732 align:start position:0% line:85%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:11.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT
REPUBLICANS HAVE BETTER IDEAS.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.407 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M JUST SAYING THEY HAVE HAVE
BETTER INSULTS.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BRAIN HARVESTING TALK ALWAYS
MAKES BETTER TELEVISION, YOU

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:19.177 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUYS.

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:22.681 line:91%
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK CARLY
BABY BRAIN HARVESTING FIORINA

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:25.785 align:start position:0% line:91%
WON THAT DEBATE AND PEOPLE SAY
HILLARY WON THIS DEBATE.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.488 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SO GO ON, LADIES, GO ON!

00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:32.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT AND IT'S FUNNY THAT THE

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:37.663 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOCK AGAINST HILLARY IS THAT
SHE'S TOO SMART, RIGHT.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.331 line:85%
SHE'S TOO COMPETENT, YOU KNOW.

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:40.399 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHE'S UNRELATABLE.

00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:41.967 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SHE NEEDS TO BE MORE HUMAN.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.304 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.173 line:85%
WELL, CAN SHE ACCOMPLISH THIS.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:49.809 line:91%
WELL, FOR ME, THERE IS ONE
MOMENT THAT TOTALLY HUMANIZED

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:50.510 align:start position:0% line:85%

WHICH I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE.

00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:57.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
A LONG STORY.

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.418 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S CONTINUE, WE.

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:01.086 line:85%

THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN
TO.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:28.214 line:91%
MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING
MOMENTS CAME DURING A COMMERCIAL

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:01.280 line:85%
COME ON, RIGHTWING AD PEOPLE,

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.883
CAN'T A BROTHER ENJOY ENDLESS
SHRIMP?

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:07.052 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, LINCOLN CHAFFEE CHEER
ME UP.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:11.457 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MY DAD HAD DIED.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
Larry: OKAY.ALL RIGHT.

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:16.629 line:91%
SO IN THE ENDS, WAS THE DEBATE
BORING? YEAH. DID IT HAVE ALL

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:21.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FIREWORKS AND TALK ABOUT
DEAD BABY PARTS AND OVERT RACISM

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND FULL-BLOWN HOMOPHOBIA OF THE
OTHER DEBATE?

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:25.204 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO. DID I SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:30.509 align:start position:0% line:91%
WATCH THE DODGERS GAME, YES,
YES, I ACTUALLY DID.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:31.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S A REAL PHOTO.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:35.414 line:91%
BUT THE POINT IS WE HAVE THESE
DEBATES TO DETERMINE WHO IS THE

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:37.516 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEST PERSON TO LEAD THE FREE
WORLD.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:46.625 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT TO FIND THE BEST ENTERTAINER
IN CHIEF.

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:49.328 line:91%
BECAUSE, BECAUSE IF THAT WERE
THE CASE, I WOULD VOTE FOR

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:50.361 align:start position:0% line:85%
CEDRIC THE.
