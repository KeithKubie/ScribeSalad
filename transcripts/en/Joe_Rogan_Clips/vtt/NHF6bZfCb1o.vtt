The Joe Rogan experience.
The worst is if you try to valet a stick shift.
I tried,

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.930
I tried to give a valley my keys to my bronco and he didn't know what to do.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.510
I go,
you don't know how to drive a stick shift.
He goes,
no.
I go,

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.320
what the fuck are you doing here man?
How can you have this job?
Yeah.
Yeah.

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:21.240
That should be a part of the resume.
I can't drive all cars.
It's crazy.

6
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.160
Yeah.
I don't think most people know how to,

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.720
you know they do what an under 30 can drive a stick?
I don't think so.
No,

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.080
it's going gone.
Yeah.
Porsche doesn't make them any more.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
The only American muscle cars are one of the last holdouts like corvette and

10
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.900
Camaro.
I haven't driven a stick and a long time mustangs.
You know,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.390
you want to try today.
Actually,
the last time I did,

12
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.830
I was in Costa Rica and I rented,
I rented a car and I'm like,

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.850
I just assume all cars now and when you rent them are automatics.
You know,

14
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.100
you get to know the country.
It's,
it's will it ever,

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.110
and so I'm pulling out of the a lot and it's like,

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.730
oh shit,
it's been a minute.
It's pretty embarrassing.

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.570
I got this.
Yeah.
When you're in Italy,
they all drive stick shifts.

18
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.440
Even like minivans.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Everything's a stick shift over there.

19
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.830
I'm not sure why.
I don't know.
What,
what's the advantages and disadvantages?

20
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.610
I mean,
what do you prefer?
Well,
if I was in where I was in Italy,

21
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.690
it was in Ravello,
which is a very small little roads.

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.840
It's very tiny and it's like crazy congestion because of tourism.
Yeah.
And uh,

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810
the guy was always on the clutch back and forth,
back and forth.
I was like,
yeah,

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.600
this is,
you gotta be annoying as fuck.
You want an automatic and it,
it's like La,

25
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.340
right?
Like if you're in,
if you're commuting to la bumper to bumper every day,

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
you're going to want an automatic,
that's what happened.
Right?

27
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.760
I think you're right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just more comfortable flipped,

28
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.520
flipped the car,
did the work.
But if you're on a mountain road,

29
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.610
like the angel's crest highway and you want to share,

30
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.570
there's something cool about being in command of the vehicle and you're telling

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.340
it when it's,
you know,
manly.
Yeah,
it is.

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.020
And if he got a dick in your hand and if it's a woman,
you got to go,
Ooh,

33
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.710
don't get too close to this one.
Yeah,
it's,
yes.
Driving's tick shifts like,
well,

34
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.770
she's a rebel.
She might be a problem.
Right?

35
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.590
She might be able to be great in bed though,
maybe.
Yeah.
For a little while.

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.380
And then didn't bigger house Adams.

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.180
She gets mad at you for email for 12 years ago.
I didn't even know you that.

38
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.080
What the fuck?
I can't go back and find this.

39
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.080
Where's that phone come from?
That's a flip phone once.
That's my Suki sidekick.

40
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.530
We were looking at that thing from ces at Jamie pulled up.

41
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.300
What does that goofy thing called?
These are good,
right?

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.810
I don't feel like I'm drinking a nonalcoholic beer.
Tastes like a regular beer.
