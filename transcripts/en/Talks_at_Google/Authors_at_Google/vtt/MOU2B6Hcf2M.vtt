JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
Thanks everyone

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.870
who's joining us on
live stream and who

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.090
is able to come in person.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm Joel Kalmanowicz.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.210
I'm the host, and I'm looking
up at the camera there.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.950
I'm a Googler.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.040
I'm a product manager, and
I'm an aspiring parent.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.800
That means that maybe
sometime next year,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.758
if everything goes well,
I'd like to have kids.

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:21.430
And I start early when
I prepare for anything.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.340
So my wife and I
went to this talk

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.730
that she found by
these characters

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.610
I'm about to introduce, and they
did this talk at [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.410
High School, and it was
all about parenting,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.536
which is not surprising.

00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:33.410
It's the whole point.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.010
But it was also
about psychology,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.940
and it was also about
technology-- three

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.505
of my favorite things.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.090
And I find one thing that
they usually have in common

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.380
is that to the either
uninitiated, unformed,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.830
or just to the aspiring, they
can all be kind of scary.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.700
But what I really liked
was that this is not

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.950
a fear-based message.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.420
This is all about
hope and prevention

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.990
and looking forward
as to how can

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.720
we not only avoid the
pitfalls but, in fact,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.990
raise our kids
higher in the future.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.620
So a quick introduction then.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
These are the co-founders
of My Digital Tattoo.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.589
They have some pretty
awesome chops already.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:08.630
They've talked to a lot
of different people here.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.690
I even had to take
notes on these numbers.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.630
It's been over 14,000 students,
5,000 parents, 400 educators,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.450
and 100 schools in the Bay
Area as well as 800 health care

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.180
providers-- all in the
last four years alone.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.710
So they provide education
training in four key sectors

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.850
from all of thoss-- schools,
families, corporations

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.070
and health care.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.890
They also just presented at
the annual RSA conference,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.890
where captains of industry
were asking questions

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.190
about how to deal with their
kids' privacy and security

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.900
worries online--
kind of interesting.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.370
So without too much further
ado, Gloria Moskowitz-Sweet,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.520
who's been a social worker,
educator, program developer,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000
and university
lecturer since '81,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.240
and Erica Pelavin, who's been a
family psychologist for over 20

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.740
years.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.073
Please welcome them, and I'm
going pass it over to them.

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:54.200
Thank you very much.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.949
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ SWEET:
Thank you so much.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.630
Joel, thank you for inviting us
here, and thank you for coming.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.397
And we recognize you and
felt you in the audience

00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:02.980
because your hand
was up an awful lot,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.896
and there was a tremendous
amount of interest.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.820
So we're delighted to be here.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.520
We have had the privilege now
of working with 14,000-plus

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.432
students from all
over California,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.390
and it's their story we
want to share with you.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.860
It's their voices.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.270
There are no textbooks.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.820
Anything that anybody
writes is dated immediately.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.590
It's their voices that have
continued to school us,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.060
and as we have kind of
taken this journey with them

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.800
over the past five years,
we have learned so much.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.930
And our goal today is to
teach you and take you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.350
into what we've learned.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.540
So we, as Joel said, we are not
fear-based we really believe

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390
in the power of technology.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.520
We see it being used incredibly,
beautifully, and strongly

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.030
and in empowering ways.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.280
So we understand the power.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.960
We watch kids learn.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.210
We watch kids collaborate
with each other.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.220
We watch them feel empowered
in this incredible world,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.880
and we have watched
them do amazing things

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.080
around creating a kinder world.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.160
They actually call
it the "kinder net."

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.012
But we also recognize
the challenges,

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:02.220
and the challenges are a big.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.805
And we're going to
talk about both,

00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.930
and we're going to talk
about them without judgment

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.700
because it really [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.804
The tool is here to stay.

00:03:08.804 --> 00:03:10.220
It's what we do
with it and how we

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.840
choose to support our kids in
using it ethically and kindly.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.060
So Erica is going to
do the first half,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.560
and I'm going to
do the second half.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.976
And we'll have
time for questions.

00:03:23.034 --> 00:03:24.450
ERICA PELAVIN: I
don't know if I'm

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.360
standing in the right place.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.990
Hi, everybody.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.720
I'm Erica, and I'm the mom of
two boys-- one in high school

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.140
and one in college.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.680
They are huge gamers.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.000
So I've started
learning about this way

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.820
long ago when they started
entering the world of gaming.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.020
But what I've learned from
being a mom the last 20

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.570
years of their life, is that all
the skills that I have offline,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.970
being a good parent and
thinking about things, really

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.370
translate into
their online world.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.970
And that, oftentimes, we get
fearful and frozen about what

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.200
they're doing online, and if
we step back and actually just

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200
think about how we
parent or how we

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.120
liked what our
parents did to us,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.940
there's some beautiful
translations.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.450
So we're going to talk
a lot about that today.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.900
I thought I'd start with a
story that can help ground us

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.930
in the importance of
what it is to parent

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.040
in the age of social
media or parent

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.050
in the age of technology.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.640
When my son was in
the fifth grade,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.380
I decided to have a pool party.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.570
I was really excited.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.710
It was back in the time when
I felt like I was the manager.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.430
I got to pick all the
friends that came.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.000
Oh, sorry.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.830
I got to pick all the friends
that came to the party.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.326
I got to decide
what the theme was,

00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:37.830
what parents I
wanted to be around.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.530
And I hired a lifeguard, and I
hired a lifeguard particularly

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.830
to stay in the deep
end of the pool

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.986
because my fifth grader is a
risk taker, and I thought, OK,

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.360
something's going to happen
in that deep end of the pool.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.832
So I hired a lifeguard right
in that spot, in the deep end.

00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:56.750
In the middle of the
party, I walked in,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.060
and there was a child
drowning in the shallow end

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.530
of the pool, right in that
space I think we've all been,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.090
where we can't feel
our feet anymore.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.070
And all of a sudden, we
get that panicked feeling.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.760
And he's slipped
under, and I had

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.520
to jump in and save
him and take him out.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.750
And he was OK.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.850
The kids were really
upset about watching.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.880
But when the mom came, I
think I had a real attitude.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.620
I'm sure I did.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.840
I'm like, uh, excuse me, does
your kid know how to swim?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.090
You left them here
with no supervision.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.370
And she said, no, but
my kid is so good.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.860
He never leaves the step.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.280
He never goes anywhere.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.650
He just stays in
that shallow area.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.920
So when she left, Gloria and
I started to talk about it

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.690
and process this.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.040
And we realized that
it's similar to life

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.370
in the digital age-- that
most of the time, our kids

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.790
are in the shallow end
doing beautiful things

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.030
and making safe
and good choices.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.190
But every once in a
while, and I think

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.340
it's sort of their
job to get curious

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.540
and to go a little
deeper or to get pulled

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.380
into what's happening in
the deep end of the pool,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.050
and that sometimes they slip
under without even knowing it.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.680
And really what we need
is to be their guides,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.550
to be their teachers, and to
get in the pool with them.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.090
Now I know that I never liked
getting in a bathing suit

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.490
or getting into the pool.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.187
But I knew that it
was really important

00:06:14.187 --> 00:06:16.770
that I got in there, because you
can't just throw your kid out

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.580
there without
learning how to swim.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.230
We're going to have
to hold on to them,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.355
teach them the rules of
the road when they actually

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.760
don't mind having us
help them, when they're

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.370
interested in being with us.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.680
And then, in my opinion, now,
with high schoolers and kids

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.000
in college, is to move away and
become that consultant-- help

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.826
them self-regulate and
advocate for themselves.

00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:38.200
So when they go
out in the world,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.530
they can do that
without our assistance.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.360
But if we freak them out
so much in the beginning,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.910
we've seen that kids are less
likely to come to their parents

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.810
when they feel like
they've made a mistake.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.610
And I think Gloria and
I are real believers

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.360
that we want our kids to
make mistakes on our watch,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.960
because then we can help them.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.520
We don't want to have
everything so perfect for them--

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.850
snow plow the way
for them-- that they

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.120
don't make any mistakes.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.290
It's their job.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.100
So I just want to
put that out there,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.730
that it's a good metaphor to
think about that we want you

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.540
there in the pool with them.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.110
No matter what age
they are, the kids

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.670
we've talked to
tell us that they

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.310
want their parents to
hear what they're saying

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.120
and to supervise them.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.180
But we're going to talk a lot
about strategies we've heard

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.730
over the last couple years.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.520
Some of them may stick with you.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.870
Others might not be things
that work with your kids.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.840
We kind of want you to think
of it like a big colander,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.657
and we're going to
throw a lot at you.

00:07:31.657 --> 00:07:33.240
And some things will
stick, and you'll

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.614
say, yeah, I'm
going to try that,

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:36.020
or that might work with my kid.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.270
And other things may not have
anything to do with your kid.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.680
But I think what's
important for Gloria and I

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.546
to convey to you is that you
are the expert of your kid.

00:07:45.546 --> 00:07:47.170
I always kind of say
find the book that

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.240
says what you want it
to say and follow it,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.500
because you know your kid.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.540
You are the expert.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.690
If you see that things are going
poorly, you step in offline.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.370
And what we want
to remind you is

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.360
that the same is true online.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.930
So

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.290
Kids don't really see an
on- and an offline life.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.450
They just see it as an "is."

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.530
They're rarely leaving
their phones behind.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.460
They're usually
attached to them.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.250
And so what we find is that
if your kid is experiencing

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.600
trouble offline-- gender
identity, depression,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.460
friendships, sitting
alone at school--

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.110
any of those things that
are happening offline,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.400
you can be pretty sure that
it's going to follow them

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.220
into their online life.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.131
Now, that's not
necessarily terrible,

00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:31.380
because sometimes they're
going into their online life

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.640
to look for support or to
help diagnose themselves

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.020
or to find something that's
going to make them feel better.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.760
But for us to keep in mind that
if we're worried about our kids

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.750
offline, to check
out what that looks

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.650
like in their digital space.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.180
The same is true for their
passions and interests.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.950
I've watched my kids
just expand in things

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.250
that they're interested in.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.440
They become world experts.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.130
Alex had figured out a way
to apply to all the schools

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.380
that had a scholarship
for e-sport gaming.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.110
That certainly
didn't come to me.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.830
He went out there, and
he founded himself.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.250
So our kids are really
taking what they're good at

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.120
and getting better on it online.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.970
So I think that's
important to remember.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.550
Gloria and I often get
asked, are our kids

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.380
addicted to technology?

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.190
And I think kind of
I'm trying to answer

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.520
that question for myself.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.740
Am I addicted to technology?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.070
I'm finding it harder and harder
to leave my device behind.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.630
Because we're here
for an hour, I'm

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.130
going to give you
our general guiding

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:35.170
principle about whether your
kid is addicted to technology.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.420
And for us, it's the
simple question of,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.380
is it opening up their world,
or is it shutting it down?

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.740
So I have one very shy kid,
and it opened up his world.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.760
He tried on behaviors that he
would never have tried offline

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.400
and then was able to
practice leadership roles

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.320
and take it offline.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.260
He met friends with
similar interests,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.520
and he has virtual
playdates, where

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.060
he feels loved and respected.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.890
But we've also seen it where it
can close down people's worlds,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.140
where they get so invested
in finding the next "like"

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.230
or feeling relevant, that it
can close down their world

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.590
and make things uncomfortable.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.140
So pay attention to that.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.660
Pay attention to
how you're seeing

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.970
them use it, because not all
screen time is the same for us.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.740
It really depends on
what they're doing

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.300
and how they're using
it and balancing it.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.905
But I do want to remind us--
I think this is so important,

00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:31.550
and it seems so simple.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.490
But every time I come back to
this, it's a good reminder.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.270
When we talk with the
kids we work with,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.830
but also with my
own kids, that kids

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.060
are kids-- that really
nothing's changed in terms

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.340
of teen development,
that they're actually

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.070
doing exactly what
they're supposed

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:51.080
to be doing to be these
incredible curious beings when

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.700
they start to grow up.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.210
So I want to remind
you that teens

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.320
are using social media to do
all the things that they're

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.220
supposed to do.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.440
They're socializing with
their peers, like we did.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.820
My mom used to ask me, like, how
come you come back from school

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.390
and you're immediately
on the phone?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.250
You know, I had a
cord back then but.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.250
I immediately went to the phone.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.860
And they're doing exactly
what they should be doing.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.390
Most of the kids we
work with actually

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.160
tell us that the reason they're
socializing online so much

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.660
is because they're so
over-scheduled, that they

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.120
need these little bits of time
to connect with their friends.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.330
And I find that so fascinating
because they're telling us,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.820
we need our community.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.980
We need to stay connected, and
we're finding ways to do that.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.190
So they're also trying
on incredible identities.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.530
And Gloria, Mia, and I
just got this Bitmoji app.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.080
Anybody familiar
with it, where you

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.340
can make an avatar of yourself?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.370
One of the kids suggested to us.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.850
And you put all
these outfits on.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.070
Have you seen it?

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.400
And it can be really
silly and fun.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.730
I think our kids are doing
that, kind of like how

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.610
I used to play dress
up or try on new ideas

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.100
when I went out to parties.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.870
So our kids are really trying
on new identities as well.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.090
But most of all, what
our kids are doing

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.430
is trying to establish
independence.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.140
And part of what I think happens
in this new paradigm, where

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.800
we don't know exactly what
the roadmap is to parent,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.590
is we start pulling back and
trying to hover over them.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.740
And their job is to keep
moving away from us.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.060
So if we can do that in a
way where we can stay curious

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.510
and they can start to take those
risks and gain independence

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.530
and we're not
hovering over them,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.750
I think we're really
giving them the greatest

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.900
gift, which is to start
being critical thinkers.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.230
And I will tell you that
when we're in the classroom,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.790
our kids, from ages
fifth grade up,

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.340
are going to be the ones that
come up with the solutions.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.070
When we ask them for solutions
about how to manage group texts

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.110
or how to manage
their sleep, they

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.450
come up with incredible ideas.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.545
So we really need to use
them and harness their power.

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:02.670
But for the most part, I
want to say they're really

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.010
using them in incredible ways.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.140
They're using them to
connect, to support.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.460
We've even seen
kids doing causes

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.500
for other kids in their school.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.150
They're using it
for school work.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.110
They're collaborating.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.770
They're creating YouTube videos.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.970
I mean, I can't
tell you how excited

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.982
a group of fifth graders gets
when we come in to talk to them

00:13:21.982 --> 00:13:23.690
and are curious about
what they're doing,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.470
because they're doing
such amazing things.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.540
But at sometimes,
our kids are slipping

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.370
under, like in my pool scenario,
and making those mistakes.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.020
And sometimes, as
a parent-- and I'm

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.680
sure this was true
for our parents

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.530
too-- we keep saying, well,
we told you that already.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.620
Or, come on, I have
to say that again?

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.372
We already talked about this.

00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:47.830
And they're slipping
under, and I'm

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.940
wondering if anybody knows
why they're slipping under?

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.560
Why are our kids slipping under?

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.650
Why do we have to tell
them so many times?

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.170
They're actually
missing something

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.780
in this area that
makes it really hard.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.050
We've given them this incredible
tool with incredible power,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.820
both to take care of themselves
and their reputation,

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.720
but also to hurt and
harm other people's

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.730
reputations and feelings.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.950
And they're kind of
missing something, which

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.470
is that their frontal
lobe, which helps them

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.360
with that long-term
planning consequences,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.336
isn't fully developed.

00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:25.640
And for me, that's a
huge takeaway, that we're

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.700
asking them to do something
without literally having what

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.290
they need to do it.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.792
So for us, sometimes
we need to talk

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:35.000
with the kids we're talking
about-- what's this going

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.390
to affect you like tomorrow?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.780
Or how is this going to
affect you this afternoon?

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.940
Because telling a
kid, oh, you know,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.680
if you put that out there,
and 10 years from now,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.440
when you have an
employer looking at it,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.180
they're not going to
like it, is really

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.180
kind of hard for someone
whose lobe isn't developed.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.180
And, of course,
with our teenagers,

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.330
our middle schoolers,
and our high schoolers,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.770
their emotions are so high.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.430
And those of you that have
kids will know, or go back

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.570
to when you were
that age, that you

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.520
can be happy and sad and
silly and mad and anxious

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.970
and left out in a whole day.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.120
And so when you have a powerful
tool and a bunch of feelings,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.190
we have to really be lending
them our frontal lobe

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.940
about how to deal with it.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.110
And that all those feelings are
normal, and they make sense,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.060
and they're easy for us to look
at and say, like, oh, come on,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.650
get over it.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.910
There's no problem.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.890
But to them, they
feel really real.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.590
They change rapidly.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.360
And I always say, if we can
name it, we can tame it.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.740
So instead of just
shutting off the device,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.600
if we can start helping our
kids to say, I felt left out,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.020
or I don't feel
like I measure up,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.940
or my body doesn't
look right, then

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.020
we're giving them this
huge service to talk

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.505
about what they're experiencing.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.200
I want to talk a little bit
about this evolving landscape.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.640
And Gloria I used to just
call it the digital landscape.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.430
And we realized that
working with kids every day,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.350
that really it evolves as
soon as we know about it,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.700
something new is coming up.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.900
And I think that's probably
why we like this work so much,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.840
because it's constantly
changing, and areas of interest

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.640
keep moving.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.450
But I wanted to tell you a
little bit about what we're

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.540
seeing in the last
six months or so,

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.840
about what's happening
on this digital landscape

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.580
for our tweens and teens.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.030
And I think this actually
even relates to us,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.630
as I think about
how I'm starting

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.680
to use media more and more.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.450
The first thing we're
seeing is that kids

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.080
are trying to stay relevant.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.610
And many of our
kids will tell us

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.680
that they're trying
to curate their life,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.060
to make it look a certain
way to their friends

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.740
and the people around them.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.030
And I just want to take a minute
to think about how exhausting

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.920
that is to have to lead a
curated life-- to have to think

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.390
that there are strategic times
that you need to post in order

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.830
to stay relevant
or not forgotten.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.290
And that that newsfeed
happens so quickly,

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.530
or those texts
come so frequently,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.012
that if you miss
that opportunity,

00:16:57.012 --> 00:16:58.720
you're not going to
be noticed and you're

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.280
going to be left behind.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.150
Now, this is not true
for all of our kids.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.840
But many of our
kids will tell us

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.109
that they will put
a post up, and if it

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.910
doesn't get enough likes,
they'll take it down.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.980
They will tell us that they
know their prime posting time--

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.280
that I get my most
likes at 8 o'clock.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.140
Or that they feel
upset that they

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.400
spent the whole weekend trying
to make it look like they had

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.220
a life, and no one
noticed-- so just really

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.579
sinking into that
idea that our kids are

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.480
having to search
to stay relevant

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.520
and how difficult that must be.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.480
So a perfect conversation
with our nieces, our nephews,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.430
our kids, our friends
is to talk about how

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.910
we don't want to
define ourselves

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.860
based on the number
of likes that we get,

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.970
and really going to do
what our parents did,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.610
which is searching underneath
to see what's important

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.820
and what we like about our
self, without people needing

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.600
to give us the praise for that.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.740
The one on the top is my
son, and I put it up there

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.170
because he is a virtual gamer.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.200
And he spends lots of
his time in his room

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.490
in multiplayer environments
with people all over the world.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.770
He's joined teams
all over the world.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.814
He has friends all
over the world.

00:18:09.814 --> 00:18:11.980
And I don't know if any of
you have this experience,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.690
but if you're on what's
called a virtual hangout-- you

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.800
can't say play date once
they leave elementary school.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.020
But when you're on
this virtual hangout,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.110
it's pretty incredible.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.350
It feels like
everybody's in the room.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.310
I think when I started,
I used to think

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.920
they're just in parallel play.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.040
How can this be any
kind of interaction?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.890
They're just on their devices.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.760
Now I'm seeing that they're
interacting as a team,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.100
and they're doing
what I see is engaging

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.220
in some pro-social games, where
they're learning some pretty

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.210
incredible skills about
community guidelines,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.330
about friendships, about how
to stick up for somebody,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.670
about how it feels when someone
trolls or being mean to you,

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.640
and that they're actually
doing a lot of the pre-learning

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.510
as early as fourth grade
in games like Minecraft.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.840
But most of all--
and that corner right

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.020
is our advisory board, which we
go to a lot to look for advice

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.780
and to run things by them.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.420
They are socializing
with their friends.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.390
And I think most people
would look at that

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.850
and they would say,
they're not socializing.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.510
They're all on their devices.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.740
And they will tell us,
if they looked at it,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.380
that they're all talking to each
other or sharing or having fun.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.370
So a reminder that
our experience

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.660
might not be how
they're experiencing,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.400
and to talk about that.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.370
Does anybody remember
this Whack-a-Mole game?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.360
So the thing that--
I can't believe I

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.350
kept going back to
Whack-a-Mole as if I

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.140
was going to figure it out.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.954
And I always wanted
to get a higher score,

00:19:38.954 --> 00:19:40.620
and the thing would
come up and go down,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.550
and we would get frustrated.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.790
And Gloria and I just thought
this was a perfect image

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.680
to talk about how it
feels to stay up-to-date

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.640
in our kids' lives with
what they're doing online.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.990
And I think as soon
as we figure it out,

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.210
they've gone somewhere else.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.220
I mean, that's sort
of what they're

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.430
supposed to be doing, right?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.444
If we're at the party,
they're going to leave.

00:19:59.444 --> 00:20:00.610
I mean, that's embarrassing.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.990
So I don't think
our job is really

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.370
to have to know exactly what
they're doing it all times.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.330
But our job is to
be curious about it,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.990
to see trends that are going
on, and to ask them about what

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.680
goes on in each of these sites.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.860
And I put the word
down "code switching"

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.000
there because for those
of you, you might even

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.880
be doing it yourself,
Because I certainly do.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.310
But most of our
kids will tell us

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:27.180
that they actually have
a whole circle of ways

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.810
that they go and
check their media.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.130
Like, they have
their Instagram open.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.546
Then they'll check
their Snapchat.

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:32.880
Then they'll look at reddit.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.150
Then they might do a little
Pinterest board or Wishbone

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.830
game, and that they do
this kind of in an order,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.820
and that each one
of those platforms

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.840
has their own way of being.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.560
And so that they have
an amazing ability

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.050
to code switch
between each of those.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.570
I just want to talk about
the importance of opening up

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.670
the dialogue.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.610
And for me, I always say,
be curious, not furious.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.729
Because I think it's so easy
for me to say to my husband,

00:20:57.729 --> 00:20:59.270
to my kids, like,
what are you doing?

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.311
You're wasting your time.

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:02.347
We should be out and
going and doing something.

00:21:02.347 --> 00:21:03.930
Well, that doesn't
really set the tone

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.380
for somebody wanting to tell
you about what they're doing.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.777
It sets the tone for you
telling them to go outside,

00:21:08.777 --> 00:21:10.360
and then they take
their device and go

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.690
with their device outside.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.570
So I'm curious to encourage
you to ask your kids, what are

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.320
the apps that people are using?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.410
What do you like about them.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.910
To try it on yourself--
today I tried on a new app.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.332
It was called--

00:21:27.332 --> 00:21:28.790
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ
SWEET: musical.ly?

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.415
ERICA PELAVIN: No it
wasn't musical.ly.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.910
But musical.ly's another good
example, where we can get on,

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.550
and we can do karaoke, and
we can be playful and fun

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.620
and really feel what
it feels like to want

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.812
to do 10 videos,
instead of just one

00:21:40.812 --> 00:21:42.270
and to have a hard
time not wanting

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.000
to fix it and make it better.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.441
So the more we
enter their world,

00:21:45.441 --> 00:21:47.690
the more I think we get a
sense of what they're doing,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.610
rather than being mad.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.460
So let's take a look at the
apps that we're paying attention

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:53.960
to now.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.180
Our kids have moved
away from Facebook.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.369
Any idea why they moved
away from Facebook?

00:21:59.369 --> 00:22:00.160
We're on it, right?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.470
Our grandmas are taking selfies.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.420
Our kids will tell us, though,
that because you're on it,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.130
they'd like to ask
you a favor, which

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.810
is to stop posting pictures of
them without their permission.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.410
And I think that's
important because it becomes

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.680
part of their digital tattoo.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.060
But we're also asking them to
do that with their friends,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.472
so that the digital
drama decreases.

00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:20.930
So kids will tell
us like, I really

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.480
don't want that picture of
me in the bath tub nudity

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.590
when I'm 12, and it says like,
where have the years gone?

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.190
That they really want
you to model and ask them

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.010
for permission.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.410
I'm just thinking that
all of these apps,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.380
for me, have good intention.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.520
I don't think any apps are
created to be mean or bad.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.070
What we know is when teens go
anywhere in a large number,

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.070
that things get sexual and
that they pushed the envelope.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.720
And so, I guess, I wanted
to talk just briefly

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.900
about each of these,
maybe just not

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.200
all of them, but about what kids
are finding amazing about them.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.920
But also some of
the things you might

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.370
want to start talking about
or thinking about when you're

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.190
talking about these apps.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.870
So they are moving away
from Facebook, like we said.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.160
They check birthdays
there, maybe

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.720
communication with relatives.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.040
But it's not the space that
they're hanging out in.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.460
I wondered if anybody knew--
let's just pick one of these

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.440
up here.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.849
Anybody know Kick?

00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:23.390
Yeah, so what do
you know about Kick?

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.859
AUDIENCE: It's a messaging app.

00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:27.400
ERICA PELAVIN: Yeah, so we love
it that it's a messaging app.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.240
We love it that it's free and
that kids can get to use it.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.520
And what we also
know is that when

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.280
you take your kid's phone away
and you think that they're not

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.988
going to be texting
anymore, that they're

00:23:36.988 --> 00:23:41.950
getting the free Kick app, and
then they're able to use that.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.200
I'm also going to point-- I
got the five minute sign--

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.410
that the right is
called Followers+.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.680
What I think is
interesting about that

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.260
is that it takes
analytics of how you're

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.565
doing with your postings.

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:55.440
I want you to think
about that with your kids

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.620
to see did someone
unfriend, did they

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.330
not, what's my top
post-- really to talk

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.500
about that's really important.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.970
ooVoo is that group chat, where
our kids get to be together

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.260
in a group formation.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.070
Any time we're in
a big group, we

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.400
run the risk of mean
behavior happening.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.090
Periscope and some of
the other live apps

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.560
are a place where we're
seeing a lot of problems

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.510
because kids aren't
really thinking

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.180
with their frontal lobe, and so
they're exposing things quickly

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.540
in the moment and not pulling
back to think about it.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.760
And the only thing I wanted
to say about Instagram

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.290
and Snapchat is that
Instagram-- your kids

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.120
have two Instagram accounts.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.990
We're pretty sure of it now,
that one is there curated one

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.810
for their family, and
one is their real one

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.290
that they share
with their friends.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.960
So talk about it.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.930
Same thing about Snapchat-- it's
fun, exciting, really playful.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.240
They don't have to
be picture perfect.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.780
But there's lots
of room for people

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.120
to feel left out of
situations, to feel

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.190
like things are
happening in live time,

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.810
and they're not included.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.700
We've also had this amazing
shift from real name

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.150
to anonymous culture.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.050
And it's like our kids
are listening to us.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.260
We asked them to be careful when
you put your name out there.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.510
So they went underground.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.050
So the three that
have come into play--

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.180
love you to ask
your kids or nephews

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.070
or nieces if they
know them, and how

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.220
you see them being
effected-- is the

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.820
After School app,
ASKfm and the Burnbook.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.370
So really talking about the
power of anonymous apps,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.110
how we can be a little meaner
behind a screen, how much more

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.420
we have to focus on stepping
in someone else's shoes

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.620
to be able to really feel
that when we don't see them

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.560
on the other side of the screen.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.590
I want to tell you about
this incredible thing

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.630
that we keep hearing
about with kids, which

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.930
is how much these gurus and
Viners are their friends, how

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.040
much they look up to
them, how much they wait

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.700
for the next video
to be released,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.240
and how much information
they can give us

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.830
to how are kids
doing, to kind of get

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.830
a psychological
hold on how they're

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.560
doing in the world-- what
they're gravitating to,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.380
what they're interested in.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.760
So I love just asking kids,
who are your favorite YouTubers

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.330
or Viners and why?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.930
And you get incredible answers.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.010
The middle one is PewDiePie.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.690
The top is-- I call him the
Mr. Rogers of Minecraft.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.280
His name is Stampylongnose.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.350
There's Jenna Marbles
at the bottom,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.640
and Miranda Sings at the
bottom, and Jenna Marbles

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.400
in the middle.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.120
But I want you to
think the same way

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.670
you did about asking your
kids about their friends

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.656
in elementary school.

00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:32.030
I want you to ask them about
the people they're watching.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.330
How did you get
introduced to them?

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.230
What's interesting about them?

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.480
Hey, let me take a look at it.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.979
Instead of saying oh, I don't
like them, or they're no good,

00:26:39.979 --> 00:26:43.570
we actually just talk about what
they're interested in and why,

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.280
and sit down.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.330
And we can learn
so much about them.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.170
Our kids tell us that they
want us to supervise them, not

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.850
"snoopervise" them--
that they don't

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.859
want you to take their
phone away at night

00:26:54.859 --> 00:26:56.150
and look at what they're doing.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.816
They want you to go
through it with them

00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:01.000
because they're-- creates a
feeling of anxiety if they know

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.720
that you're always kind
of overlooking them.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.390
We want to tell you that
we rarely see predators,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.370
and we know parents worry
a lot about predators.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.680
And if your kid is
struggling with issues,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.670
then you may see that.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.160
But for the most
part, the drama's

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.570
happening with their friends.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.720
Ask your kids, what's
the digital drama

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.100
happening right now in
your squad of friends?

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.350
We want to look for openings
for connection and discussion.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.110
So in my life, I
send my kid-- I used

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.060
to send him a note to
his lunchbox, I love you.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.530
Now I sent a note to his
inbox or [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.401
And give them an out
of hard situations.

00:27:36.401 --> 00:27:38.110
So I'm going to
end with this one

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.970
and then hand it over to Gloria.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.070
But I think this feels like
my most important slide, which

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.300
is-- and I think Gloria
started with this, which

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.890
is I think that the
tool is here to stay

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.820
and has incredible power.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.680
But just taking it away,
without having a conversation,

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.110
leaves them just wanting
to go underground.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.860
So, for example, in
my house I don't like

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.494
single-person shooter games.

00:27:59.494 --> 00:28:01.410
And I can say, I don't
like it because I think

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.782
it desensitizes you to
violence, or you can say,

00:28:05.782 --> 00:28:06.990
I'm worried about your sleep.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.850
Or you can say, I feel like
in those musical.ly videos

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.630
you're sexualizing
yourself to get attention.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.160
And so instead of
taking away the app

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.100
or taking away the
device, I'm going

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.360
to encourage you to
have a conversation,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.120
to be curious, to
enter their world,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.360
to hear what they have to say.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.370
And to kind of think
back on our parents

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.070
and when they were
open to knowing

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.340
what we were doing
without shutting us down,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.390
it was the time we made
the best connections.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.925
And then we can send our kids
out being self advocates.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.390
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET: It has
been such an incredible gift

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.430
for me to work with
Erica and to really look

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.240
at what intrigues us so much.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.210
As a psychologist, as a
clinical social worker,

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.290
we are really intrigued by
the psychology of technology.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.270
And we want to take
you into this place

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.400
that we have been in
for the past five years.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.460
But to do that, I'm
going to ask you all

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.170
to go back to middle school.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.290
And I'm just curious
how many of you

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.460
would go back to middle
school if you could?

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.770
Not a single hand
is going up here.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.790
Very rarely do we
see hands go up here.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.870
Can anyone tell me why
they wouldn't go back?

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.870
Like why would you not
go back to middle school?

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.390
Puberty, yeah.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.950
Self-consciousness--
like the light is on you,

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.580
and everybody's
watching-- absolutely.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.700
So let's go into this right now.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.250
Actually, as you go back, I
want you to remember when.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.487
And in doing that, even if
you're not a parent yet--

00:29:34.487 --> 00:29:36.070
I mean, Joel when
you talked about it,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.710
you were thinking about what
it would mean to be a parent.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.880
So the best way to do this is
to think back at this time.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.842
So let's remember one.

00:29:42.842 --> 00:29:45.300
How many of you remember doing
a note that looked something

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.200
like this?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.480
So we all had a version
of something like this,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.180
and this was very
important to us

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.890
as we were defining ourselves.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.240
And the most important
thing was to be liked.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.590
We all wanted to be like.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.880
We wanted everyone
to approve of us.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.010
And it's really no
different, is it?

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.040
It is still, do you like me?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.840
And as Erica mentioned, our
kids are complete-- well,

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.970
not completely off Facebook,
but getting off of Facebook.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.110
It's about insta-likes,
and it's about evaluating

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.160
your self-worth by
the number of likes

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.890
and by the number of comments.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.640
And we've had so
many conversations

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.480
with kids about this, and
it's been really an eye-opener

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.700
for us to have them talk about
what it means to really get

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.480
social collateral and social
currency by the number of likes

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.690
they get and the number of
comments, and how strategic

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.570
they are about that, and how
careful they are about that.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.330
And what we say to
parents is that this

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.220
is such an incredibly
important conversation, If you

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.340
see your child completely
defining themselves

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.250
by those likes.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:44.100
And, by the way, I'm going talk
about my own kids around this.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.060
When my oldest son would say to
me, in spite of my best self,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.610
at the age of 29, I cannot
stop looking at how many likes

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.010
I'm getting on Instagram.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.820
So we all know that pull,
and I want you to imagine

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.250
that pool on steroids.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.410
Because for kids, to be
liked in middle school

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.140
is what they are all about.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.190
And to us, that
is the discussion

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.870
that we want to
have, and we also

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.760
want to look at it for
ourselves too, but definitely

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.480
look at it with our
kids and appreciate

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.246
that this is a time when it's
really, really huge for them.

00:31:15.246 --> 00:31:18.350
I want to talk about the
impact of social media

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.850
on the adolescent brain.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.750
And as we talk about
this, we're going

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.604
to be looking at
generalities, and we're

00:31:23.604 --> 00:31:25.770
going to be looking at what
we know about the brain,

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:26.950
and we're also
going to be talking

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.450
about what we have learned and
what kids have shared with us

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.300
as well.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.410
So we know that our
brains are hardwired

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.610
to seek new information.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.530
That is no different.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:41.400
We literally get a shot of
dopamine, the happy chemical,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.500
in today's world with a text,
with a tweet, with a like,

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.550
with the buzz.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.980
We get this surge.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.760
And again, imagine
this in middle school,

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.070
because it's far bigger.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.990
It's a much more intense surge.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.990
What our kids are saying to us
is that their texts and tweets

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.910
are highly perishable, and
they lose that social value

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.234
if they're not
responded to instantly.

00:32:02.234 --> 00:32:04.150
This has been an interesting
transition for us

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.000
in this field, because
what was five years ago

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.830
an acceptable amount
of time-- can anyone

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.320
guess what an acceptable
amount of time

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.510
might have been about three
years ago to respond to a text?

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.310
A day.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.634
What do you think it is now?

00:32:22.634 --> 00:32:23.550
AUDIENCE: Two minutes.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.650
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET:
Not even.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.760
For many of our kids,
they talk about wanting

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.560
an immediate response.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.870
And if they don't get
an immediate response,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.490
they will think that something
has happened-- like dreadful--

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.680
to that person.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.920
They've even said to
us, maybe they're dead.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.860
We've heard kids say that.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.400
Or they think that they've
done something terribly wrong,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.480
and therefore that
person's not responding.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.070
So that response time
has shifted enormously,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.770
and I think it's shifted for
every adult I know as well.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.690
I mean, there's no
question about that.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.050
They also let us know
that the fact that it's

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.370
highly perishable makes
this device so incredibly

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.740
important 24/7, because
they're not in the know

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.830
if they don't have it.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.120
They often will say to us, if
I don't respond to a friend

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.730
right away, she's going to
think I'm a really bad friend,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.640
and that means my call is
to be 24/7 and always there.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.250
And that imperative is
incredibly important

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.520
to look at because that's
a really tough way to live.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.260
And we see a lot of our
kids-- I would say, well,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.410
it's not just our girls.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.540
It's girls and boys
really struggling

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.770
with this issue of
being always on.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.950
Let's continue thinking
about what this biology is,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.080
and let's look at some
of the chemicals that

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.940
are going on in the brain.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.580
Dopamine is one of
these key chemicals

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.030
that we know about
scientifically,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.459
but we're also hearing about
it a lot from our kids.

00:33:45.459 --> 00:33:48.000
Of course, they're not talking
about it in terms of dopamine,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.390
but they are saying it feels
really good to connect.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:55.520
It makes them feel like
they're really in the know,

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.270
and they are really loving
that constant connection.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.030
And we're talking
about brain chemistry

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.310
because it's dopamine
that gets stimulated

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.050
by tiny bits of new
information, which is

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.190
exactly what social media is.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.159
So we can see the pull for this.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.989
And then we're also talking
about oxytocin, which is what's

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.710
called the cuddle chemical.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:20.010
And it releases a feeling
of goodwill and connection.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.020
And that's what the
comments are about.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.840
That's what the likes are about.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.360
And that's what's really
getting highlighted

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.750
in the brain of an
adolescent-- And not just

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.730
the brain of an adolescent,
all of our brains.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.440
So between dopamine
and between oxytocin,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.150
it's really hard to
stop wanting more.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.810
And we can really see that pull
that our kids are experiencing

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.719
and, by the way, that
we're all experiencing.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.270
I mean, I don't
know anybody that

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.350
is completely honest
that would say,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.442
I'm feeling the tug
of this as well.

00:34:50.442 --> 00:34:52.650
But we know that for our
kids, because of their brain

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.340
chemistry, it's more so
than it is for adults.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.440
So that's our
advisory group again.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.160
And with that in mind, with
sort of a very brief look

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.840
at brain chemistry,
would you say that kids

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.980
are addicted to devices?

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.771
And I'm just curious
about a show of hands.

00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:12.650
How many of you would say
kids are addicted to devices?

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.790
So some hands are going up.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:20.240
How many of you would say
you're addicted to devices?

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.470
I think I am.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.540
You're on the fence--
not quite sure.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.280
So we're going to look at
two ways of looking at this,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.530
and I want to say to you
this is without judgment

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.620
at all, as a mom.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.550
I didn't mention earlier I'm
the mom of three young adults,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.546
and they have led me
through this world.

00:35:36.546 --> 00:35:37.920
And the work with
all of our kids

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.970
have really taught us
so much about this,

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.030
and this is what we're
seeing and hearing.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.180
Our kids are saying to us, we're
not addicted to our phones;

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.830
we just like each other.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.636
And in an over-scheduled
intense world,

00:35:49.636 --> 00:35:51.260
where there's so much
expected of them,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.900
and they have to move so
quickly, those times-- I know.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.240
I remember-- of just space,
where I could ride my bike

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.910
and no one was watching me.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.940
And I didn't have
to text my mom.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.610
I can't even imagine
that as an adolescent.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.070
Those days are over.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.520
So what it means to be tethered
to their parent is huge,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.120
and they are missing that.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.800
And they really
don't have that time

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.160
to play the way they used to.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.600
So they're using a device
to connect and to play

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.290
because that need to connect
is no different than what

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.670
any of us had.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.890
What we also have
seen very clearly

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.490
is face-to-face conversation
begins where digital ones end

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.970
and vice versa-- that
there is no on or off.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.170
It's exactly the same.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.190
It's one world.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.580
And that both really contribute
to that formative development

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.180
of identity.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.510
They're both
incredibly important.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.060
So that's one perspective
in looking at this.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.820
And then we're also
seeing another.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.980
We talked about the power, and
we talked about the challenges.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.490
And so I'm going to look at
the challenges right now.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.715
This is a quote from one
our 12th grade students,

00:36:52.715 --> 00:36:55.680
"you're not alone when
you're on your phone."

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.590
And we're seeing that ability
to be alone really shifting.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:04.210
And I know when I take a walk,
I very rarely see someone alone

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.042
anymore.

00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:06.500
I mean, there is
a device going on.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.530
There's a full
conversation happening.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.050
So we are struggling with
what it means to be alone,

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.000
and that's an interesting issue
when you think about invention

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.270
and new energy often comes
out of that alone time.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.030
And we're seeing
less of that now,

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.770
and that's an interesting
thing to ponder on.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.570
So again, this is
our advisory group.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.040
And if we look at them,
we see sort of this

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.730
is a very typical
discussion with our kids.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.855
And you see them kind of on
their-- there's a phone there.

00:37:34.855 --> 00:37:37.720
There's conversation,
and you see a head down.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.040
And that's not uncommon at all.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.460
And what we are hearing and
what we're seeing from our kids,

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.930
and from most people-- and
here's a conversation we had

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.370
with one of our kids, quote,
" if a phone is on the table,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.760
I will keep my
conversation light,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.290
knowing I don't have full
attention and that at any

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.890
minute someone will
be distracted."

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.680
And I think that is a
very, very true issue,

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.960
and that has shifted.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.400
That is something
very different.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.858
We didn't hear that
five years ago.

00:38:05.858 --> 00:38:07.490
We are seeing that now.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.362
If the phone is on the table,
I will keep that conversation

00:38:10.362 --> 00:38:11.820
light, and I'm not
going to go deep

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.510
because I know at any minute
I'm going to lose attention.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.440
That was an 11th grade student.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.970
Our kids are learning this new
social norm in middle school.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.400
They're learning it
when they are learning

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.090
how to look like they're
paying attention to a lecture,

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.200
and their texting
underneath their desk.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.080
They're learning that they can
pull this off and pull it off

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.350
really, really well.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.730
So we're watching our kids
feel that this is something

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.290
they can absolutely do.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.200
But the question that I
think we have to address

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.710
is, are we losing the
complexity of what it

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.470
means to be in a conversation?

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.770
Because conversations are
complex, and we have to know

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.670
and we have to be able to
tolerate that awkward silence

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.820
when you're not sure
is it my turn to talk,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.240
or is it their turn to talk?

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.970
We have to figure out
where to stand in space,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:57.960
and am I too close?

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.080
Am I too far?

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.350
When do I make eye contact?

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.790
When do I look down?

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.590
This doesn't happen if a
child's looking at a device.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:09.610
And this personally gives us
concern, because what we know

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.890
is that those skills
are still needed.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.740
It doesn't matter
our world is here

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.400
to stay-- our world of
media is here to stay.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.490
But those skills
are human skills.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.360
And I think it's
important for us

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.267
to all pay attention
to the fact that we

00:39:24.267 --> 00:39:26.100
are seeing our kids now
struggling with this

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.540
in a really, really big way.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.350
Many of them are telling us
that they would much rather text

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:33.870
than they would
talk, because they

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.160
can control the conversation.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.660
And if they're
talking, they've lost

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.015
control of the conversation.

00:39:39.015 --> 00:39:40.640
And I think that's
an interesting thing

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.780
to pay attention to.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.190
Has anyone seen this photograph?

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.270
I would imagine
some of you have.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.500
It was a photograph sent to
us by one of our advisors.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.190
It was taken about a year
ago in Redondo Beach.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.520
And we are convinced
that this man is

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.300
Googling where to find whales.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:03.960
And we're sure that he missed
exactly what he needed to see.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.870
And we know that there
was a guy in front

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.030
of him taking this picture.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.775
And I had this fantasy of
him screaming, look up!

00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:11.080
I mean, just look up!

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.490
And the guy never did.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.950
So we are tethered.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.019
And you all-- most of
you-- raised your hands

00:40:16.019 --> 00:40:17.310
in terms of your own tethering.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.480
And our kids are very
honest about that.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.020
We're tethered to our devices.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.790
Our kids are tethered
to their friends.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.260
Our kids are tethered in
romantic relationships.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.230
The amount of texts
that go back and forth

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.620
can be overwhelming and almost
suffocating to many of them

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.395
in late middle school
and high school.

00:40:35.395 --> 00:40:37.770
And I want to talk a little
bit about the tethering we're

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.430
seeing for parents,
because that's

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.790
a really interesting
level of tethering

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.360
that has shifted quite a bit.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.950
We are hearing from colleges now
that there's an expectation--

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.510
well, they're
seeing that there's

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.050
parents and kids are texting
sometimes seven to eight times

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.970
a day.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.320
And the texts can take these
very interesting turns.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.500
They can be things like--
and kids are sharing this

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.670
with people at college.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.760
Can you geolocate
the library for me?

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.030
And you can you
geolocate the bookstore?

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.270
And while you're at it, I'd
like you to get my books

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.040
and get them immediately,
because I expect

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.720
things to happen immediately.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.070
So there's a language, and
there's a term for this right

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.570
now.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.940
Our colleges are calling
it drone parenting.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.850
And it's kind of fascinating,
and it's a little scary

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.370
when we think about this.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.310
It's helicopter parenting with
tech-enhanced surveillance

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.740
capacity and expanded reach.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.300
So they move from
hover parenting,

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.080
hovering, to drone parenting.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.780
At college, what
it looks like is

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:39.080
arguing with profs on behalf
of a grown children for grades.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.370
It may also look like correcting
their paper and turning it in,

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.210
and a prof is very
clear that this is not

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.060
coming from a student,
but coming from a parent.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.310
And then let's look at what
it looks like in the world

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.030
of work, and I can certainly
speak to this is as a parent

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.590
of kids that are in
the world of work--

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.840
going to job fairs and bosses'
offices in place of grown

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.940
children.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.910
And I know for myself-- I
see some heads nodding here.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.040
For myself, when my oldest
son got his first job,

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.570
it was amazing for that
job to court my husband

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.630
and I equally as they
courted my husband,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.330
with an assumption that
if they wanted him,

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.080
we had to talk him into it too.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.660
So I'm seeing a shift
happening culturally that's

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.460
looking like it's normal.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.960
And we may not want this to
want to be normal, you guys.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.830
I mean, this one this
one gives us big pause--

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.930
so drone parenting.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.670
Now, I also want to
talk about a shift

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.380
that we have seen in our five
years of working with kids,

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.440
and I'm going to throw
this question out to you.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.690
When we ask kids-- we
show a short video,

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.570
and it's very old
school about someone

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.860
being digitally tethered
and losing conversation.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.740
And we show them this video,
we asked them who they see.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.128
Who do you imagine they see
when we show this, any guesses?

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.470
You nailed it.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.320
Now that's a shift.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.960
They didn't see
their parents before.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.880
They used to see themselves.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.249
And we're now in
fourth grade primarily.

00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:11.540
We're in elementary school,
high school, middle school,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.600
and high school.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.670
And the shift I'd say in
the last year and a half

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.380
are kids are now
saying, that's my mom.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.570
That's my dad.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:19.640
That's my family.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.681
And I'm going to take you
into some of the quotes

00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:25.500
that we've been hearing
from kids on this one.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.060
This is a ninth grade student.
"If parents stop for a second

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.955
to look behind their iPad
and put down the screen,

00:43:31.955 --> 00:43:34.330
they would realize their kids
are right in front of them,

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.840
and they are trying."

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.710
And that's really
pretty intense quote.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.760
We often present this in many
ways in fourth and fifth grade,

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.866
and it's amazing.

00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:47.240
Kids are shooting
up their hands,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.160
and they're sharing strategies
with each other on how they

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.660
can bring their parents back.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.940
And here are some
of the strategies.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.100
One child said, "I see
my dad two days a week,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.830
and he's always on his iPad."

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.420
The bottom are the
strategies kids

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.378
are sharing with each
other about how they pull

00:44:01.378 --> 00:44:03.920
their parents back. "I
shake them, poke them,

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.660
pinch them, bribe them, yell
at them, wave a piece of paper

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.460
in front of their face,
grab their phone away."

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.320
Our newest one that
we heard is "call them

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.726
by their full name," which
we thought was hysterical.

00:44:14.726 --> 00:44:18.440
"Put my face in their
face until they see me,"

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.190
but the one that really
concerns us is "then I give up."

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.280
And then they say, and then I
give up, and I go in my room,

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.110
and I get on my device.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:31.800
And what concerns us is
kids in elementary school

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.180
still think parents
are incredibly cool,

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.990
and they're looking
for connection,

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.140
and they're looking for
a time to have that eye

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.780
contact and conversation.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.270
But if they're learning early,
at this point, that nobody's

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.947
home, they're going
to just drift away.

00:44:45.947 --> 00:44:47.530
And they're going
to just go to Google

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.600
to look up things and
not go to their parents.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.380
So this is definitely an issue
that we're seeing and paying

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.140
attention to.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.440
I also want to talk
about techno perfection.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.300
And when we ask our kids to
define techno perfection,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.470
they're really clear that
it's about a curated image.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.700
It's about trying to be
perfect, and expecting

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:11.700
that perfection is something
they have to have 24/7.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.726
I was amazed, when we
do our advisory groups,

00:45:13.726 --> 00:45:15.100
that we asked them
this question,

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.820
they could have talked
about it forever.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.310
And we asked them, what are
the acceptable body types?

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:23.119
And they told us that it's
super skinny or Kim Kardashian.

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:25.160
And if you look at the
new Barbie dolls that have

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.840
come out, it's interesting.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.380
Has anyone been aware of the
new Barbies that have come out?

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.210
Go check them out.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.110
They're fascinating to me.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.380
Some of them are looking
just like Kim Kardashian,

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.560
and some of them are looking
just like super skinny.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.100
And so in a way-- and they
thought this was really good

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.710
news, because it was
defining real bodies.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.290
But are they real bodies?

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.730
So look at what's
going on there.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.490
Our feeling is that
the subliminal message

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.760
is beauty is unachievable.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.830
And we're hearing our girls
talk about this quite a bit.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.510
And what we're
also very aware of

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.070
is that it's not just
a girl issue, that it

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.650
is a boy issue was well.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:05.070
So what I want to talk
with you about right

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.490
now are the kinds of
things that our kids have

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:09.810
said to us in our advisory
group about what they want

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.390
their parents to do to help.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.860
How do we change this?

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.472
How do we start
this conversation?

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:16.930
And the first thing
they said to us

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.000
is, we want our parents to
help us combat those myths,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.560
because to us it's real.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.630
We see a billboard, and we're
assuming that it's real.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.310
Help us understand
that being thin

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.850
will not bring you happiness.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.030
I love this one-- "help me
not seek external validation

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.900
and find my own voice."

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.620
Start this conversation
early, and people are often

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.194
very afraid to start
the conversation

00:46:39.194 --> 00:46:40.610
because they think
it's too young.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.370
There is no too young.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.360
And shift the
conversation-- what

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.670
are they trying to sell you?

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.145
There is no middle-schooler
that wants to be manipulated.

00:46:48.145 --> 00:46:50.270
And once they realize
someone's trying to sell them

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.100
something, especially
an adult, they're

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.890
going to be able to push back.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:56.440
And as I mentioned
earlier, this one

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.140
gets them screaming
when we show them

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.030
Justin Bieber-- can't
even really explain

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.120
what's going on there.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.860
But what I love about
showing this image

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.430
is that they're not
supposed to see the one over

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:06.120
in this corner.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.680
They're supposed to see that
really buffed defined one.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.820
And what we want them to
get is the manipulation.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.990
We are seeing that because
it's seen as a female issue,

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.010
they're often not
able to discuss it

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.910
the way that girls do.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.090
And we want them to, because
that conversation is important.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.900
And we really love
this quote because we

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.790
think that pushing
back is what we really

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.622
want our kids to be able to do.

00:47:31.622 --> 00:47:33.080
I'm looking at our
time, and I want

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.020
to talk a bit about
sleep because sleep

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.810
is an enormous issue
that's impacting kids.

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.380
And at first, on
this slide I used

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.550
to have what our teens
are saying about sleep.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.040
But we had to change
this because of our kids.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.630
It's what our children and our
teens are saying about sleep,

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.030
and it's been significant.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.780
"I close my eyes to
go to sleep and feel

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.570
like my brain is on coffee."

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:53.970
And this just
happened last week.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.747
That was a fifth grade quote.

00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:58.080
And I'm curious if anybody
ever feels like their brain's

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.090
on coffee in here?

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.490
When you go to sleep, it's
like what is going on?

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.562
This is emerging
science, and we're

00:48:06.562 --> 00:48:08.270
starting to get more
information on this,

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:10.550
and I'll share with you
in brief what we're seeing

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:11.810
and what we're learning.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.310
But we are seeing that our
kids are coming to school

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.930
with digital hangovers.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.710
And I can certainly
see that adults

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:21.240
are going to work with
digital hangovers as well.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.020
What we are finding
out is that kids

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.280
between the ages of 9
and 15 are especially

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.500
sensitive to light
exposure in the evening.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.380
Light comes at
them from any way,

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.040
and they're sensitive
to all light.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.680
But we're also
wondering, and we're

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.470
learning that the blue light
emitted from digital devices

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.560
may be particularly impactful.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.210
And we know it's
impactful to us as well.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.030
The more evening light
exposure, the lower

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.050
that level of melatonin.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.700
It's true for all of
us, and incredibly true

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.310
for this age group.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.690
So it suppresses their
body's time clock

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.260
and makes them fall
asleep later and therefore

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.760
wake up with those
digital hangovers.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.464
So what do we do about this?

00:49:01.464 --> 00:49:03.880
And I want to say what do "we"
do about this, because this

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.520
impacts all of us.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.480
And these are just a
few things to look at.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.850
Is anyone using Flux?

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.060
It's a great one.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:16.920
And the new iPhone
has Night Shift,

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.120
which is going to
be also mirroring--

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.710
we know that blue light tricks
our brain into staying awake.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.540
So Flux does this amazing
thing, which is so important,

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.050
it mirrors our
body's time clock.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.820
It mirrors what our body needs.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.750
When it's nighttime, it
turns that reddish glow

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.640
of the sun setting.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.890
When it's daytime,
it turns blue.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.460
And there are also really
good apps that we recommend.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.930
SelfControl is one of
them that blocks access

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.250
to distracting websites.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.200
StayFocused is another
that sets a timer where

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.790
you can block your own
access to those websites.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.750
And Readability
is one that really

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.700
helps with online clutter.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.280
It's amazing we're
having to develop

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.210
these tools to help us not get
distracted, but we have to.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.880
And we have to really support
our kids at doing this as well.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.230
And then finally, when
Erica and I are in schools

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:06.800
and we're really
challenging parents,

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.520
we're encouraging them to
change the norms around 24/7

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.660
connectivity, because
we're all feeling it.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.380
So what are the
skills our kids are

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.200
going to need in the future?

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.900
We know that it's
the ability to work

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.980
cooperatively and
collaboratively

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.860
through network communication.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.100
We see it.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.920
We're living it right here--
collective intelligence,

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.180
crowdsourcing.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.530
And it's that very
sharing, tweeting, constant

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.280
updating that's preparing
them to do that work.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.640
I mean, it's that
thing that worries us,

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.600
that is so incredibly important.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.470
But here's the paradox,
and here's the piece

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:42.900
that we have to look at.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.110
With the world at
their fingertips,

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.670
it's the ability to tune out
the noise-- because there's

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.590
an awful lot of
noise out there--

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:53.030
and engage in technology with
awareness and balance that's

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.010
going to cause us to be able
to succeed in this world.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:59.130
So that's the piece that's
so incredibly important.

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:04.010
And I want to share with you
that we are really at a place

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.460
right now, after working
with 14,000 kids,

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.990
and we're moving very,
very quickly and expanding,

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:11.680
we're looking for
partners, and we

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.200
are looking to expand our
reach to organizations

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.890
and to schools, particularly
where kids can't afford this.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.280
And we feel that
everybody needs it.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.940
We want to introduce our
executive director, Mia Walker,

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.460
who is a former Googler.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.207
And we will be here
for a conversation

00:51:26.207 --> 00:51:28.040
and really look forward
to talking with you,

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.350
if you have any strategies
and ideas about this.

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.180
Thank you so very
much for coming.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.595
Thank you for inviting us, Joel.

00:51:33.595 --> 00:51:35.011
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
Thank you, guys.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.647
How do you define
acceptable usage of a phone?

00:51:40.647 --> 00:51:42.730
And the question came in
two parts, and I love it,

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.750
so I'll read them out verbatim.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:48.830
One is, is it OK to take
away phones for bad grades?

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:50.830
And as a follow
on, is a different

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.545
when with they or we use the
phone just to research things,

00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.670
like, oh, let me Google
that-- to pick up the phone

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:57.460
and check it out,
that kind of thing?

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.418
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET:
I want to say something

00:51:59.418 --> 00:52:02.510
about taking the phone
away for bad grades.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.080
The danger of doing that is
creating the forbidden fruit.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.242
I mean, if we take it
away as a punishment,

00:52:08.242 --> 00:52:10.200
if you really want to
make someone fall in love

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.310
with something, make
it the forbidden fruit.

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:15.887
And I think that that technique
is just is doomed for failure.

00:52:15.887 --> 00:52:17.470
Personally, as a
parent, I don't think

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:18.830
that that works very well.

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.770
That said, there is an
absolute need for limits,

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.655
and our kids desperately
need our limits.

00:52:24.655 --> 00:52:26.280
Do you have any other
thoughts on that?

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.630
ERICA PELAVIN: Yeah, I
thinking the same thing.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:31.840
And that sometimes being part
of a conversation ahead of time,

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.810
some preventive work--
talking about a contract

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:38.820
or pointing out you're noticing
that their grades are slipping

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.080
or that they're
acting inappropriately

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.340
in their conversation
is a better way

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.990
to talk about it than just
grabbing the device away.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.050
Because we will often
hear kids say, oh,

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.500
I just get a free account and
use my friend's phone to text.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.110
Or I have a dummy phone
that I give my parents,

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:56.619
and they don't remember.

00:52:56.619 --> 00:52:59.160
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET: I also
like kids to really understand

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.450
that our bodies are
not meant to multitask,

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.800
that we don't do it very
well, that our bodies are

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.020
in desperate need of sleep.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.640
And none of us do this well.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.570
I think that parents
have to model this.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.930
I think that if we just
direct kids-- what we're also

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.220
hearing from kids is
parents will say to them,

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.720
get rid of that device.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.160
And as they're saying that,
they're on their device.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.050
And so that will not bode well.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.050
They're really watching
our behavior far more

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.340
than they're listening to us.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.910
So we have to really
be willing to model it.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.520
And that may mean, and some
families are doing this,

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.660
it's 10 o'clock.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.980
All devices are down,
including ours-- not easy.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.290
But that is effective.

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.748
ERICA PELAVIN: In
my house, we have

00:53:36.748 --> 00:53:40.540
forced family fun, where all the
devices have to stay at home,

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.530
and we all leave.

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:46.310
Just really carving out
those digital free spaces

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.730
where kids feel
like-- or families

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.185
are feeling like
we're being heard

00:53:50.185 --> 00:53:51.310
and that they're important.

00:53:51.835 --> 00:53:53.340
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Yes, it's
a great idea for everyone

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.770
to put their phones
down at 10:00 PM.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.950
But how do you reconcile
that with the need for kids

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:59.730
to stay in touch instantly with
their friends, who don't put

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.981
their phones down at 10:00 PM.

00:54:00.981 --> 00:54:02.605
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET:
You know, we're

00:54:02.605 --> 00:54:04.394
in an interesting
time right now.

00:54:04.394 --> 00:54:06.810
And I think, as parents, we
have to come together and work

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.160
as communities.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.110
That is not easy to do, and
yet it's so important to do.

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.610
I mean, I think we
have to model it.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.010
I also think it would be so
great to have a community

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.520
conversation and have
other parents doing it too.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.400
But I remember as a
parent being told,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.550
you're the only mom doing
this, and I'm so angry at you

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.370
for doing it.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:27.020
And it's OK to have that anger,
because we're really helping

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:27.890
them out of a jam.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.940
What kids say to
us privately, they

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.420
don't want to share it with
parents but, "I am exhausted,

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.030
and I want off that group text.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.430
But I can't tell them.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.370
But I'm going to let you know.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.090
And I'm not going
to tell my parents."

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.390
But you're helping
them out of a jam.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.461
So I'm encouraging
parents to set limits.

00:54:44.461 --> 00:54:46.460
ERICA PELAVIN: I'm kind
of agreeing with Gloria.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.060
I've been called the Meanest
Mom NA-- in North America--

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.080
because I wouldn't let phones
come to a sleep over because I

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.800
kind of feel, as my parents
did, that nothing good happens

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.740
after 11 o'clock when
you're in a group,

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.790
that it just kind of goes south.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:06.400
But my experience has been that
we do a super good job finding

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.840
out the best tutors, the
best schools, the best

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.690
camps, talking to parents all
the time to gather information.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.140
And that if we could
use that same curiosity

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.990
and connectedness to
say, hey, you guys,

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:19.800
do you remember when
our parents wouldn't

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.500
let us call after 9
o'clock because it was rude

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.560
or answer the phone
during dinner?

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.380
And it was just an "is," right?

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.120
And so I think the more we talk
to other parents and our kids'

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.250
friends groups or to help
them do what Gloria said

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.020
and realize, like we're
not doing it to be mean.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.770
We're doing it because these
devices are tricking your brain

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.170
into believing it's
daytime, and you don't

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:43.364
feel good and getting at that.

00:55:43.364 --> 00:55:45.030
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: How
many kids actually

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.670
want to fight distractions,
from this question, when

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.240
I was a teen, I
didn't really notice

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.027
when I was tired or distracted.

00:55:53.027 --> 00:55:54.610
And I didn't think
getting A's instead

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.574
of B's was worth the
extra work anyway.

00:55:56.574 --> 00:55:58.990
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET: No kid
wants to fight distraction.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.204
I mean, they're not
even feeling distracted.

00:56:01.204 --> 00:56:02.620
I hope I'm hearing
this correctly.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.340
No child would say to you--
they would all say to you,

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.930
I am amazing at multitasking.

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:09.970
I could do 20 things at once.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.120
I can do whatever.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.900
I mean, but we all
said that too, right?

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.980
I mean, I said I could
do whatever at any time.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.480
Because that ability
to recognize that they

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.190
can't, isn't there yet.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.797
So we have to be the ones
to say, you know what?

00:56:22.797 --> 00:56:24.130
I'm going to help you with this.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.810
It's really not
about getting As.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.790
It's more about staying
healthy and safe.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.870
I mean we can't survive
on three hours of sleep,

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:32.802
and I know some kids
that are trying.

00:56:32.802 --> 00:56:34.885
We've heard teachers say
that papers are coming in

00:56:34.885 --> 00:56:38.080
at 11:30, 12:30
for fifth graders,

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.969
because they're
getting so distracted.

00:56:39.969 --> 00:56:41.260
That's not working for anybody.

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.080
ERICA PELAVIN: We have
to get their pain point.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.204
And right now, what we're
noticing in the classroom

00:56:45.204 --> 00:56:48.090
is group texts are a
pain point-- that they

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.190
go on to several group
texts, and then hundreds

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.480
of [INAUDIBLE]
what's happening just

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.690
flood their inbox and
the bings and make

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:57.820
it hard to go to sleep.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:01.184
So I put it back on them, like
what can we do about this?

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.600
What do you guys
think you can do?

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.800
And they come up with
amazing strategies.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.250
So putting it back into
their hands to help

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.717
and hitting their pain
point really works.

00:57:10.717 --> 00:57:12.300
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's a great segue

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.758
to the question I
had for you guys,

00:57:13.758 --> 00:57:16.780
which is, do you know of or
organize or anything groups

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.280
or meet ups for
discussions among parents

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.630
or between parents and
kids or even among kids

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.470
with your advisory
panel or anything,

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.765
where people can go in and share
and develop their solutions?

00:57:26.765 --> 00:57:28.640
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET:
I love that question.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.990
We're seeing that
popping up all over.

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.260
So we're seeing schools, and
when we go to a community

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.390
and we present to
schools, we're seeing

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.460
parents afterwards going,
we're going to start something.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:40.640
And we need to start it now.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.300
And they come
together as parents,

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.680
no differently than we came
together around other issues,

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.460
as an opportunity to discuss.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.400
Some of our most
effective work has

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.501
been working with parents
separately and kids separately,

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.000
and then bringing
everybody together

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.200
to share strategies with
each other-- really powerful.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.860
So often it starts small.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.080
It's often parents
going, I'm lost,

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.360
and then coming together
other parents who equally

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.640
feel that way, and
then just starting

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.730
that community conversation.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.729
ERICA PELAVIN: I love
what you're talking about,

00:58:07.729 --> 00:58:11.080
because we spend most
of our time talking

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.490
about facilitating conversations
about how it feels.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:18.410
And I love the idea, as we start
to expand our program bigger,

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:20.430
to talk about what
can we do about it?

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.750
How do we work as a
collective community

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:27.180
to create a kinder internet,
where we have incredible power

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.750
and we can do great things?

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:32.520
And I would just love people
to come to us with ideas

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.396
and to help these kids
facilitate their own--

00:58:34.396 --> 00:58:35.770
GLORIA MOSKOWITZ-SWEET:
So, Joel,

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.920
I wanted to say something
about our conversation

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.230
after we met you.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.580
I'm fired up about
parents before they

00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:47.030
have children saying, we
want to do something now

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.070
because we're concerned.

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:49.560
And some of the
current research--

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.950
that the new research that's
coming out around attachment

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:53.070
is a little scary.

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.190
So we are encouraging
parents to talk,

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:56.940
even before they have
kids, about how they

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.430
want to deal with this world.

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:03.029
So this conversation is
incredibly important.

00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:05.070
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Well,
thank you both very much.

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.417
We're just about out of time.

00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.500
I really appreciate you
guys coming down to Google

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.416
to give us all a talk.

00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:11.090
Thank you.
