THIS IS THE GIST.

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:07.875
HOLD ON.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.177
- THIS IS THE GIST
OF THE ARM, RIGHT?

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.979
IF YOU CARE ABOUT AMERICA,
YOU'LL SEE THIS

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.914
FOR WHAT IT'S MEANT TO BE.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.016
- THE SMURF DICK.
[laughs]

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.217
- ALL RIGHT.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.719 line:0%
 
HELLO.

TODAY WE'RE GONNA STALK ABOUT
THE STATUE OF LIVER--[chuckles]

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:23.991 line:0%
 
LIBERTY.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.227 line:0%
 
WE HAVE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
TODAY BECAUSE OF A MAN NAMED

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.631 line:0%
 
FREDERIC BARTHOLDI,
A SCULPTOR IN FRANCE.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.966 line:0%
 
ONE DAY HE WAS SITTING DOWN
WITH HIS BUDDY WHO WAS LIKE,

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.835 line:0%
 
HEY, IT'S 1865.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:38.372 line:0%
 
THE UNITED STATES IS TURNING
100 [bleep] YEARS OLD.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.308
SOMEONE'S GONNA GIVE THEM A GIFT
FOR THEIR 100TH BIRTHDAY.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.377
IT SHOULD BE FRANCE.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.947
AND BARTHOLDI'S LIKE,
[bleep] YEAH.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.550
THIS SOUNDS [bleep] AMAZING.
YEAH.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.553
AND BARTHOLDI COMES UP
WITH THIS IDEA OF THIS GIANT

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:57.057
300-FOOT STATUE OF A STOIC WOMAN
MADE ENTIRELY OF COPPER,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.594
HOLDING A GOLDEN TORCH TO
REPRESENT LIBER--[chuckles]

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.062
[bleep].

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.463
THAT'S A TOUGH--
IT'S A TOUGH WORD.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.731
- IT IS.
- LIBERTY.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.400
- YEAH.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.102 line:0%
 
- SO BARTHOLDI HAS
A SIT-DOWN WITH CONGRESS.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.573 line:0%
 
THE FRENCH PEOPLE WANT
TO GIVE YOU A GIANT STATUE.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.142
LIKE, GIANT.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:18.779
AND WHENEVER PEOPLE COME INTO
THE PORT OF NEW YORK HARBOR,

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.347
THE FIRST THING
THEY'RE GONNA SEE IS,

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:24.384
LIKE, LIKE,
A-A-A 300-FOOT-HIGH STATUE.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:28.422
AND THEY SAID,
EH, WE'RE GOOD.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:32.826
I MEAN, THAT'S--
IT'S IN-[bleep]-SANE.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.961
BARTHOLDI CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.597
I-I JUST WANT
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A GIFT.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.799
LIKE, THIS IS--I'LL MAKE IT.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.367
THE FRENCH WILL PAY FOR IT.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.102
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO [bleep].

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.138
AND CONGRESS SAID,
HERE'S THE THING,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.841
YOU'RE FRENCH.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.611
THE FRENCH
ARE KIND OF PUSSIES.

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.280
AND THE FRENCH
ARE KIND OF DICKS.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.918
AND THE FRENCH
ARE KIND OF NOT AMERICANS.

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.120
SO BARTHOLDI
GOES BACK TO FRANCE.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.588
HE'S LIKE, [bleep] THIS.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.956
[bleep] AMERICA.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.125
WHETHER THEY TAKE IT OR NOT
IS THEIR PROBLEM.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.897
MY PROBLEM IS I NEED TO COMPLETE
A 300-FOOT COPPER STATUE.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.366
I'M GONNA HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM AGAIN IN A SEC.

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.635
- DOESN'T IT SUCK HAVING A DICK?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.970
- NO. NO.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.338
- IT DOESN'T SUCK HAVING A DICK?

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:22.075
- I LOVE HAVING A DICK.
- [laughs]

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.312 line:0%
 
- SO BY 1876,
THE 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:29.683 line:0%
 
OF THE UNITED STATES, ALL HE HAS
DONE IS AN ARM HOLDING A TORCH.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.585
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE LIKE, HOLY [bleep].

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.754
THIS IS [bleep] GREAT.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.423
LIKE, I WONDER WHAT THIS
ENTIRE STATUE IS GONNA

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.824
LOOK LIKE WHEN IT'S DONE.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.928
AND CONGRESS GOES, ALL RIGHT,

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.996
WE WILL ACCEPT YOUR GIFT.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.531
BARTHOLDI IS OVER THE MOON.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.900
OH, THIS IS SO GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.803
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TALK ABOUT THE PEDESTAL.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:51.738
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.841
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
"PEDESTAL"?

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.844
I NEED A PEDESTAL
TO PUT MY STATUE ON.

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:59.613
AND THE UNITED STATES
CONGRESS SAYS,

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.682
UM, [bleep] NO.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.483
I'M NOT PAYING FOR [bleep].

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.052
BARTHOLDI IS FURIOUS.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.421
I'M GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE,

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.824
AND YOU WON'T EVEN GIVE ME
A PLACE TO PUT MY STATUE?

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:13.861
AND CONGRESS SAYS,
THAT'S [bleep] RIGHT.

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.195
- I LOVE PLAY-DOH.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.730
- THE THING IS--
HERE'S THE THING.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.568
BARTHOLDI IS STILL BUILDING,
AND EVENTUALLY A STATUE IS DONE.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.271
AND IT'S JUST SITTING HERE,
BUT THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT IT.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.206
[clatter]

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.075
- WATCH IT.

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.978
- WAS THAT EXPENSIVE,
[indistinct]?

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:34.648
IT'S AROUND THAT TIME THAT AN
AMERICAN NAMED JOSEPH PULITZER

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.819
STEPS IN AND SAYS,
THIS IS [bleep] CRAZY.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.255
WE WON'T ACCEPT IT?

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.523
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.491
ALL WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM
IS A PLACE TO PUT IT.

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:47.327
SO PULITZER MOUNTS
A TOTALLY NEW CAMPAIGN.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.997
LOOK, [bleep] CONGRESS.
FORGET THE PRESIDENT.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.632
I THINK WE SHOULD BUILD
THIS PEDESTAL.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.934
IF YOU AGREE,
I WANT YOU TO GIVE SOME MONEY.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.435
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A LOT.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.472
EVEN IF YOU GIVE A PENNY, I'LL
PRINT YOUR NAME IN MY NEWSPAPER.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.341
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
STEP UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.777
SENDING 5в, 10, 50в.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:08.348
120,000 PEOPLE DONATE,
AND PULITZER'S GOING,

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.684
YEAH.
YEAH.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.386
MY [bleep] NEWSPAPER.

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.054
YEAH.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.524
AND EVENTUALLY THEY HAVE
THIS PEDESTAL BUILT.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.926
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I USED TO DO AS A KID?

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.861
I LOVED EATING PLAY-DOH.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.598
- DID YOU REALLY?
- OH, YEAH.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.266
MM.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.268
- THAT'S [bleep] TERRIBLE.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.336
- [laughs]

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.071
- [gags]

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.539
I'M NOT EATING PLAY-DOH.
- [laughs]

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.342 line:0%
 
- ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.312 line:0%
 
ANYWAYS, THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
IS UNVEILED

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:42.282 line:0%
 
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH
BARTHOLDI ON THE TORCH BALCONY.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.350
LIKE, LOOK AT THIS [bleep].

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.553
LOOK AT THIS [bleep]--

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.822
[gags]

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:49.857
OH, MY GOD.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:52.659
- [laughs]
- [coughs]

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.094
- COME ON.
THAT'S THE [bleep] ARM.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:55.429
- YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT
OF YOUR TEETH.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.231
- [laughs]

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.298
- [spits]

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.235
STAY TUNED
FOR MORE <i>DRUNK HISTORY.</i>
