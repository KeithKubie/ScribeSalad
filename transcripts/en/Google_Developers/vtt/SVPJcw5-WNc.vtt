[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.350
PETE LEPAGE: All right,
welcome, everybody.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.790
My name's Pete LePage.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.160
And today, joining me we have
Brad Frost, who's going to be

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.519
talking to us about some
rather cool stuff.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.170
Brad, I'll leave it to you
to introduce yourself.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320
This is a reschedule of
an event that we had a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.750
little while ago.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.470
So welcome, and I'll turn
it over to you.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.310
BRAD FROST: Yeah.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.900
Thanks, Pete.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.820
Thanks for having me.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.400
I appreciate it.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.060
So yeah, my name is Brad Frost
and I am a mobile web

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.410
strategist and front end
designer at an agency RGA,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.625
which is based in New York, but
I'm broadcasting to you

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.500
from beautiful Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.150
So I've been spending a lot of
time talking about responsive

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.060
design verses separate
mobile design for

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.330
the last couple years.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.630
So that'll do it.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.570
In case you have been living
under a rock, you probably

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.260
realized that we had an election
not that long ago.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.330
So that's what we're going to
talk about, is we're going to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.800
talk about the presidential

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.110
candidates' mobile web strategy.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.790
So this is the "Responsive
Design versus Separate Mobile

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.720
Sites Presidential Smackdown
Edition."

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.950
So let's get started.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.960
This is a dead horse.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.110
And this is a picture of me
beating that dead horse.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.350
A lot has been talked about
regarding responsive design

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.610
versus making a separate mobile
website, which route to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.920
go, which one to choose.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.680
There's been a lot of great
articles, like this one, this

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.450
one, this one.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.650
Google weighing in
a little bit.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.510
Facebook's developers blog.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.530
So a lot of people have a lot of
different opinions on which

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.880
way to go, what's best for your
organization as far as

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.490
what mobile web strategy
you want to choose.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.000
But really, the ultimate answer
is that it depends.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.440
It really depends on the way
your company is structured,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.620
what your budget is, what sort
of team you have in place,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.620
what sort of technologies you're
working in, you're

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.540
proficient in, and all
of that good stuff.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.660
So really, it's not a black
and white answer.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.370
So if you're expecting one,
sorry about that.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.380
So why are we bothering
talking about this?

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.060
Why am I tearing apart the
presidential candidates'

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.490
websites and making
them look so bad?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.220
Really, because I'm a terrible
human being.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.050
Actually, no.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.820
That's not true.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.820
I'm trying to be constructive
here.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.870
But what it really comes down
to is that very rarely do we

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.350
have an apples to apples
comparison of when to use a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.770
certain strategy.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.560
There's a lot of factors
at play.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.740
Time is a big one.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.420
So even if you were to have a
separate mobile site, and then

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.880
redo it into a responsive
website, you're

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.310
in a different time.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.820
The web landscape, the device
landscape has shifted.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.410
People's behavior has shifted.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.760
More people are getting
online.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.230
So could you really chalk any
success or failure up to a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.006
specific technique?

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.700
Maybe, maybe not.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.820
Again, it all depends.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.600
So very rarely do we have
something that's actually a

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.280
very black and white comparison
between two

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.300
different strategies.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.450
But that's exactly what
we have for this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.400
presidential election.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.510
You have two candidates trying
to accomplish the exact same

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.890
thing using the exact same
mediums, only they've decided

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.650
to go different routes.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.900
So that's why this is sort of
such an attractive case study

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.260
because really, all the other

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.980
variables are control variables.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.380
You're going after the
same audience.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.240
You're going after
the same goals.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.670
There's no difference in what
they're trying to accomplish.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.350
So let's take a look at the
candidates' websites.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.290
This is Barack Obama's
website and this is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.390
Mitt Romney's website.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.090
And for the keen observers out
there, you'll probably notice

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.270
something--

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.660
splash screens are back
in full effect.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.950
Why they went that
way is beyond me.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.430
But yeah, so splash screens.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.540
Apparently splash screens
are still

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.300
relevant in 2012, or something.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.240
But this one's my favorite.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.470
Are you in?

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.390
In the website?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.700
No, I am not.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.490
Please let me.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.620
So once you get beyond these
little terrible splash

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.370
screens, you look at something
that resembles

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.690
something like a website.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.350
So this is Barack Obama's
website and this is Mitt

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.280
Romney's website.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.940
Sort of similar feel to both
of them, so makes very good

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.680
comparison.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.740
So again, these are the desktop
versions of the site.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.580
So we have to ask ourselves an
important question, why bother

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.110
with the mobile web?

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.510
Why are these candidates
spending any time optimizing

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.680
their websites for
mobile devices?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.710
Well, we have sort of
some naysayers.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.920
We have, oh, here we go again
with the separate mobile

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.670
versus responsive
design debate.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.360
I predict in the future people
will get sick and tired of

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.710
using their mobile device as the
primary means of using the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.110
internet and go back to using
a nice 27-inch flatscreen

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.140
monitor where they can see
everything, interact with

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.580
everything, and actually type on
a real keyboard versus all

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.560
this touchscreen nonsense.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.760
We are cultivating a nation
of slide-swiping,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.680
screen-surfing zombies.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.030
Well, Ken.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.090
Despite your best attempts at
sounding like a huge jerk,

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.660
this is pretty awesome.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.460
That line is pretty amazing.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.650
We are cultivating a nation
of slide-swiping,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.770
screen-surfing zombies.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.590
That's just great.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.610
I mean, that's what's
happening.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.240
We have a population that
is increasingly mobile.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.330
If you look at the United
States population, it's

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.430
sitting somewhere around
311 million people.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.550
55% of US adults access the web
through a mobile device.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.540
And that number is growing it
seems every single month.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.490
The number gets bigger.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:33.680
In addition, a full 31% of
mobile web capable smartphone

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.570
users access the web primarily
through a mobile device.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.470
That is how they primarily
get online.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.970
Either it's the only way they
get online or absolutely the

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.000
primary way that they're
accessing web.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.650
This is a pretty huge deal.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.880
And what that translates to in
the eyes of the candidates--

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.470
so the presidential
candidates--

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.800
is votes, right?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.610
You have this whole population
that's mobile

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.810
first or mobile only.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.730
And really, getting in touch
with them through the mobile

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.210
web is one of the best ways
to get in touch with them.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.240
If they have a desktop only
website, it might be missing

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.310
out on a huge chunk
of the population.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.900
So we have all these different
things that are driving to the

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.750
mobile web.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.940
We have SMS smart links.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.460
We have my favorite thing in
the world, QR codes, which

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.370
open the browser, which
open web pages.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.010
We have email marketing,
which the candidates

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.789
made ample use of.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:39.280
And email usage on mobile
devices is skyrocketing.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.950
A lot of people use their
mobile device

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.010
to check their email.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.730
That's one of the most
common tasks.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.970
Again, you receive
a campaign email.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.510
You click a link, it
opens the browser.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.110
You have all these different
social media channels--

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.380
Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
all that good stuff, all

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.580
driving to the web.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.640
You share pictures.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.550
You share text status updates,
but you also share links.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.940
And those links open the web.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.930
You have search engine traffic,
and direct traffic,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.940
and referral traffic, and all of
these things are driving to

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.460
the web on mobile devices.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.210
So it matters more and more
to care about this.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.280
So if we take a look at what the
candidates did with their

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.930
respective sites, this
is Barack Obama's

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.700
site on a small screen.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.180
And this is Mitt Romney's
mobile site or

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.040
m.mittromney.com.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.730
So Mitt Romney has basically
gone and made a separate

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.390
mobile site that exists at an
m. location, while Barack

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.120
Obama's is all sitting
under one roof in

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.250
a responsive design.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.170
So we have to ask another
important question, why would

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.840
anybody visit the candidate's
website?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.320
That's a really important
question to ask.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.450
So I've broken it down into
two different sort of

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.940
categories of users.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.100
We have more information-based
users and we have more

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.010
action-based users.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.860
So information people are
looking for the candidates'

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.360
biographies, where they stand on
issues, upcoming events in

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.630
the local area pertinent
to the person viewing,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.160
mythbusting, things like Obama
wants me to marry a penguin.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.710
No, no he doesn't.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.800
He gets to write back on his
own website and bust some

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.470
myths of things living out
there in the media.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.200
And then also, just general
news updates.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.780
Who the candidates chose as
their vice president picks and

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.810
all tat good stuff.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.310
On the action side of things, we
have things like donations,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.660
which is a huge, huge driver,
and the candidates make sure

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.790
not to leave that button
out, the donate button.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:03.270
Volunteer, free events, you can
sign up for local events,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.940
participate in your community
on behalf of the candidate.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.380
And spread the word via
social networks

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.280
and all of that stuff.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.480
And then, of course, buy
some swag from their

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.190
official shops there.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.710
So those are the sort of whys.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.840
Why are the candidates
caring about this?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.940
Why do users care about this?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.190
Why are we even bothering with
this in the first place?

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.590
So we need some criteria in
which to analyze and compare

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.540
these sites.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.310
And Christopher Layon is a
mobile web strategist based

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.560
out of Minnesota.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.350
And he came up with a really
clever way of looking at the

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.970
basic needs of a mobile
web user, or

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.260
just a web user really.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.590
And it's based on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.310
We, as human beings,
have certain needs.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.110
And some of those needs are more
important than others.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.870
Some are prerequisites
for achieving the

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.680
next level of self.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.750
So at the bottom of the
heap, we have our

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.330
physiological needs.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.630
We need to be able to breathe.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.595
We need to be able to eat, and
drink, and sleep, and all of

00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:21.040
that stuff.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.930
So that's really important.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.680
But then, as you climb the
pyramid a little bit, we have

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.790
a sense of safety, a sense
of love, a sense of

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.980
self-actualization, and
all of that stuff.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.230
So those are sort of considered
nice-to-haves

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.120
whenever you put them
side by side to

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.820
something like breathing.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.490
So what Christopher did was
something very clever.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.220
And he basically translated
those into the

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.020
needs of a web user.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.520
So basically, he broke it down
into our ability to see and

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.350
navigate, to be able to read,
to be able to respond and

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.550
share, performance
is in there.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.500
And then he's using the term
HTML5 as sort of as a way of

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.170
talking about enhancing a web
experience to take advantage

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.610
of some of the newer
HTML5 capabilities.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.510
So what I've done is I've gone
ahead-- and I really liked

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.260
that idea-- and I took it and
sort of just simplified it a

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.420
little bit and broke it down
into these 4 areas.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.870
We first need to be able
to access something.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.890
We then need to be able
to interact with it.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.300
It needs to be highly
performant.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.390
And we need to take advantage
of all of the various

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.020
enhancements.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.870
So let's start with access as it
is the most important part

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.530
of the pyramid.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.710
So these are devices.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.970
And even though I'm coming to
you over the interwebs and I

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.650
can't hear you, I think I still
heard an audible sigh.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.120
This is the environment
we are living with.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.550
This is the device landscape.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.350
And it's a pretty
humbling sight.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.320
This is really only just a
small smattering of the

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.720
devices that are out there.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.815
Luke Wroblewski just posted in
an article recently that said

00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:10.510
something like 33 major devices
were released in the

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.640
last 2 months.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.890
And so it's just becoming this
staggering pace of change.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:24.920
And we, as web developers, as
web designers, we need to pay

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.040
attention to all of that.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.920
We need to know how to deal with
it because it's becoming

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.810
unruly pretty damn quick.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.435
So it's important to understand
that the power of

00:14:34.435 --> 00:14:36.400
the web is its ubiquity.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.800
If you look back at this image,
no native platform, no

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.620
iOS app, no Android app, no
Windows Phone app, no any

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.100
native or proprietary
solution can reach

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.930
all of these devices.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.180
But the web can.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.260
Any time you find yourself in
a native versus web debate,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.090
just show them a picture
like this.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.310
And just say, oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.680
Can your solution reach
all of these devices?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.170
I'm not saying that native
apps are worthless.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.950
Quite the contrary.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.290
But at the same time, the web's
level of reach is, by

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.370
and large, the web
super power.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.970
And because of that, we
need to preserve and

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.740
embrace that fact.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.360
We can't continue arbitrarily
locking people out just

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.400
because we don't like what
configuration they have.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.390
PETE LEPAGE: Folks, it looks
like we may have

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.760
lost Brad for a sec.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.420
Let's see if we can
get him back.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.080
Hang on.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.330
One sec.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.200
All right.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.710
Well, always kind of fun dealing
with technology.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.990
Brad's sitting in Pittsburgh
right now and I'm sitting here

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.970
in New York.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.110
But it looks like
we've lost him.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:24.830
So let's give him a second to
join back in and see if we can

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.090
get him back on.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.240
All right.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.490
Let's see.

00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:29.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.045
BRAD FROST: I lost you there.

00:17:31.045 --> 00:17:32.150
PETE LEPAGE: Hey, no problem.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.694
I'll get you back one sec.

00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:34.168
Hang on.

00:17:34.168 --> 00:17:35.590
BRAD FROST: Can you hear me?

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.490
PETE LEPAGE: I can hear
you now, yep.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.204
BRAD FROST: OK.

00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:39.656
Oh, sorry about that.

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:40.624
PETE LEPAGE: That's OK.

00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:42.560
You're coming back
up in one sec.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.360
BRAD FROST: That's pretty odd.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.610
I can't hear you, Pete.

00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:51.110
OK.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.430
My other computer seem
to have frozen.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.377
So I'm just going to share
my screen again.

00:17:59.766 --> 00:18:02.060
And then we can continue on.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.000
All right, sorry about
that everybody.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.250
Technical difficulties.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.430
Share my desktop.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.400
And we're good to go.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.280
Pete, can I get a thumbs up?

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.000
All right, perfect.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.320
Thank you very much.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.670
So where were we?

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.010
Yeah, Tim Berners-Lee drove this
point home at the opening

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:26.400
ceremony of the Olympics where
he said, this is for everyone.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.880
Regardless of race, religion,
color, creed, location, mobile

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.280
carrier, we all have the
right to the web.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.880
So we have to stop thinking in
sort of these myopic ways.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.250
"Mobile users won't do
that," is something

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.080
that we commonly hear.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.610
That's absolute horse shit.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.540
Or elephant shit.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.540
Or donkey shit, whatever
you prefer.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.290
Mobile users will do anything
and everything desktop users

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.330
will do, provided is presented
in a usable way.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.780
So we can't stop thinking,
or we have to stop

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.690
thinking of the web--

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.810
as the mobile web as
the web light.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.200
How many people are used to
seeing something like this?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.120
Sorry, that page is
not supported on

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.790
mobile at this time.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.980
We don't allow mobile devices
on Tee Madness.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.060
FollowMyHealth currently
requires a desktop browser.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.710
A mobile version will
be available soon.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.400
Giving us that false sense
of hope, right?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.750
"The page you are trying to
visit is currently available

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.830
on our full HTML
site." Doritos,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.660
no gallery, no articles.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.800
You're using an unsupported
browser even though you're on

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.890
a very capable Android device.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.790
Pizza Hut.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.660
This is a really robust
single-page scrolling website,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.480
but it says, "This site was
designed to be viewed on

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.960
standard desktops, laptops, and
tablets only." Blah, blah,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.150
blah, blah, some long-winded
excuse.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.470
"This website contains media
too rich for a mobile web

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.290
browser." like, I can't
be bothered

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.640
with you peasant device.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.500
This is Google.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.730
Sorry, guys.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.480
But this is actually
for Google Mobile

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.715
Web Initiative thing.

00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:33.320
And it says, "Alternately, we
suggest checking out the site

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.510
from your tablet if you have
one." I'm not really quite

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.780
sure what you would call
that guy right there.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.110
That looks like a
tablet to me.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.240
This is my favorite
one, though.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.060
"This page has to be ideally
opened on your laptop or

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.540
desktop browser.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.400
Once you open this link on your
computer, then you will

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.790
have a QR code to the URL that
needs to be opened on your

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.750
device."

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.000
Holy crap.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.990
So really, what we're
talking about here

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.980
is the one web principle.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.340
I'm sure we've all heard that.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.130
I talk a lot about achieving
content parity across devices.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.780
The term "thematic consistency,"
which was dubbed

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.970
by the W3C to talk about how web
experiences can look and

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.640
function differently provided
that the information's still

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.280
presentable in some way,
shape, or form.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.210
But really what I found to be
really beneficial is to just

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.900
be-- to talk about it in very
common sense language.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.610
Say, give people
what they want.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.400
If they click on a link,
they have an

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.270
expectation for something.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.705
And it's up to us to provide
that [INAUDIBLE] and meet that

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:47.360
expectation.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.800
So if we take a look at Mitt
Romney's site, this is

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.490
actually a previous edition
of Mitt Romney's site.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.700
You get to see sort of a
breakdown of the desktop site

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.740
in the left, and then the mobile
site in the right.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.210
But if you look at the
navigation in the mobile site,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.540
you'll see that only a few
options out of the desktop

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.630
site appear on the mobile
version of the site.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.470
So that's really bad.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.400
And it leaves a lot of
questions unanswered.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.860
Like, who is this guy?

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.870
There's no way to access
his biography.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.550
Where does he stand on issues
there's no way to access that

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.610
information.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.820
What about his plan for jobs?

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.290
What can he do for my state?

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.460
Where could I shop?

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.210
All of those things were
inaccessible from the mobile

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.100
version of the website.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.650
And again, for a lot of people,
they might not know to

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.980
click the Full Desktop Link.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.880
And as a result, they're just
going to go elsewhere for

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.450
their information, which
certainly could be biased in

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.190
some way, shape, or form.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.350
So thankfully, they
did a redesign

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.010
that did a lot better.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.270
They redesigned the site.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.680
The desktop site looks
different.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.350
The mobile site looks
different.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:14.090
And you could see that the menu
now contains all of the

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:18.550
sections of the desktop
site, which is good.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:25.040
In responsive design, it does a
lot better job of achieving

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.110
content parity just
because everything

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.960
exists under one roof.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.900
But that doesn't mean
that it, by default,

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.550
achieves content parity.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.670
A lot of times--

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.570
and a lot of sites do this--

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.740
will simply hide content
from mobile viewers.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.180
So the site on the left is a
blog and it says, but, hey,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.560
that's just my opinion.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.310
Feel free to shoot me down
in the comments.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:55.390
However, the comments and the
comment form are hidden for

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.650
small screen users.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:01.960
So there's no comments, which
obviously is a bad thing.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.640
On the right is navigation
with a lot of

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.980
important-sounding links.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.560
Post a Job, About Us, Our
Guarantee, Contact Us.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.120
All of that stuff sounds really,
really important.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.210
But because space is constrained
on a small mobile

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:22.170
device, they've simply hidden
all of the navigation elements

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.690
for small screens, rendering
those things totally

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.350
inaccessible.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.940
So if you look at Barack Obama's
redesigned site,

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.020
really the only thing that
I could see that was

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.980
inaccessible from small
screens was the store.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.000
So the desktop version had a
store, but the mobile version

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.080
really had no way to
access shopping

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.340
experience from the phone.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.430
Another problem with regards
to basic access is URL

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.550
redirection.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.390
This is something
I see a lot of.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.740
How many people have seen
something like this?

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.100
You go through.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.190
You're clicking on your Twitter
feed or your Facebook

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.220
feed and somebody shares an m.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.770
link, and you open it from
your desktop browser.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.420
We see this stuff
all the time.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.040
Here's Microsoft.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.085
Here's this.

00:25:15.085 --> 00:25:22.500
Here's this, this this,
this, this, this.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.490
This is pretty common.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.600
And then, of course, we end up
at Mitt Romney's website.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.850
If you're on a mobile device
and you share Mitt Romney's

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:38.040
website and someone clicks
from that onto a desktop

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:43.960
browser, they get this page,
which clearly I'm sure the

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.300
designers never intended
for the site to be

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.830
viewed in this way.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.020
This comic really sort of helps
sum it up, a lot of the

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.300
problems of sort of maintaining

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.870
separate mobile websites.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.950
"Hi, I'm a server.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.480
Who are you?"

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.140
"I'm a browser.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.500
I'd like to see this article."

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.410
"Oh, I can help.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.320
Let me get it for you.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.470
Whoa, you're a smartphone
browser.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.830
"Yeah."

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.120
"Cool.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.780
Well, hey, I got this new mobile
version of my site.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.630
Check it out.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.580
Isn't it pretty?"

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.410
"Sure, but you just redirected
me to the main page.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.820
Where's the article I wanted?"

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.840
"What article?

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.405
Who are you?

00:26:17.405 --> 00:26:19.130
Hi, I'm a server."

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.190
So it's really important, URLs
are extremely important.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.410
And unfortunately,
the sort of m.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.700
and tablet.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.350
and all of those other
dots become

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.160
a maintenance nightmare.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.260
In addition, coming back to our
splash screen issue that I

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:41.700
brought up earlier, this
continued to the website link

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.370
for Obama's site.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.340
You could click on that all
you want from Opera Mini,

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.510
which is a proxy browser.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:55.460
So all the client side stuff
gets handled by the server.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.990
And as a result, you get hit
with a splash screen and you

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.170
can click on Continue to the
Website all you want, but you

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.550
can't get past the
splash screen.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.090
It doesn't redirect you to the
proper home page, which is a

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.590
really big issue.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.010
All of a sudden, Opera Mini,
which is a very, very popular

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:18.050
browser, especially all over the
world, regions like Africa

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.710
and Asia Pacific and stuff like
that, they have no way of

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.250
getting to the site if they're
using that browser, which is a

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.540
pretty big deal.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.680
So access is absolutely
fundamental.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.050
Without it, you could make the
most beautiful parallaxy,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.350
interactive website
you could imagine.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.510
But if people can't access
it, they clearly can't

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.180
interact with it.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.700
So let's talk about the next
tier of interaction, which is

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.280
interaction.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.550
Obviously, there is a whole lot
of different ways a user

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.020
can interact with the site.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.250
But I'm just going to focus on
a couple that I think are

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.660
pretty important.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.170
So let's talk about
navigation.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.420
This is my friend Quincy.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.220
And my friend Quincy is
a good friend of mine.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.510
And I say good friend because
I was able to peruse his

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.780
entire Facebook photo library,
pick the most embarrassing

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.230
photo of him, and post it
online, and show it to all you

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.590
people without asking him.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.780
So that's how good of
a friend Quincy is.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.350
So anyways, I recently moved
from New York City to

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.090
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.880
And the day we were supposed to
move, or the day before we

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.120
are supposed to move,
my wife got really,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.600
really, really sick.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.880
And she was supposed to drive
the car across, and help pack

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.230
and all of that stuff.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.970
Our friend Quincy went out of
this way and said, I could

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.960
help you guys out.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.660
And he took his entire weekend
off and drove over with us and

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.880
helped us move.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.690
So yeah, Quincy is
a good friend.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.840
But the thing is, is that we
don't really see Quincy all

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.360
that often.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.270
We maybe see him once a month
or once every other month.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.780
So it's a pretty big deal for
him to help us out like that.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.950
So what does this have to
do about navigation?

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.980
I think that navigation should
be like Quincy, where it's

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.360
there when you need them
but cool enough to

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.870
give you your space.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.470
Whenever a navigation
is absent, obviously

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.640
that's a big deal.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.070
But if the nav is always
in your face--

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.210
this is an example of a
responsive website.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.810
All these different pages, these
are different pages of

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.790
the website you can see by
the little active state.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.810
But the navigation's
just in your way.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.920
You're not able to get to the
core content of the website.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.590
It becomes that friend that's
just always hanging around or

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.840
always annoying and just
sort of asking you

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.160
what you're up to.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.020
Hey, want to hang out?

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.980
Hey, want to hang out?

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.590
Hey, want to go to the movies?

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.540
Hey, want to go to branch?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.740
It's annoying, right?

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.100
So you want navigation to be
accessible, but you also want

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.760
it to be out of the way.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.170
So if you look at Obama's
navigate, the previous

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.160
addition of Obama's website
utilized the sort of

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.810
Facebook-like slide-out
method.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.540
If you're on a small screen, it
slides out from the left.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.780
And whenever space becomes
available, it simply stacks

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.950
the links across the top.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.570
So my friend Stephanie
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.460
took a look at the navigation
and tested it out whenever it

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.270
first came out.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.140
And she found some pretty
troubling things.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.460
She said, "And the
menu failed.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.690
Never even opened.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.770
Suddenly, the site was without
navigation at all."

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.410
She tested on a lot of
different devices.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.140
She found that it only worked on
the Galaxy Nexus, which at

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.790
the time, had just come
out, and an iPhone 4

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.270
with running iOS 5.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.010
Where it didn't work, as you
could see, is a whole lot of

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.880
different environments.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.830
And so she wrote about
this in a [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.300
for progressive enhancement.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.330
And I have to say that I
totally agree with her.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.500
A lot of people think of
JavaScript support as being

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.730
very binary.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.720
And people say things like, oh,
of course users don't have

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.770
their JavaScript turned
off anymore.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.665
That's very 1998 of
you to think that.

00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:40.300
But whenever you look at
instances like this where

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.890
JavaScript has failed in some
way, shape, or form, but all

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.580
of these different devices are
actually quite capable from a

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.060
JavaScript point of view, the
idea is just about providing

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.370
an adequate fallback
if things go wrong.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.760
This is me testing Obama's
site on a BlackBerry.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.590
And if you note in the top left
corner, that's where the

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.960
menu button should be.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.260
And there's no way of getting
to the navigation.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.190
It just is entirely invisible
or absent.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.750
These are big deals.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:22.800
So thankfully, whenever Obama
redesigned his website, they

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.960
did something a little more
clever utilizing the footer

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.520
anchor technique where you
basically click a link in the

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.570
header and it jumps you down to
the footer of the website

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.800
where the navigation lives.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.090
And also, using the
multi-toggle, which is

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:43.190
basically just nesting
sub-navigation items in little

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:48.180
accordions or sort of nesting
them in there like that.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.270
So the result of that is
something that's a lot more

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.660
accessible.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.810
It works on more devices
and sort of avoids a

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.420
lot of those problems.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.750
If we look at Mitt Romney's
website, you could see that,

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.500
again, this is the earlier
version of his website.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.030
We talked about how it doesn't
include everything on the

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.590
website or on the desktop
version of the website.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.590
That's a pretty big deal.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.620
But it's also sort of weird
that the only navigation

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.350
exists on the home page.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.780
The home page is sort
of this dashboard.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.390
And all the other sub-pages
basically just link back to

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.790
the home page.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.710
So there's really no navigation
on any sub-pages.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:38.340
So it becomes sort of this
full-page redirect in order to

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.330
navigate to another section
of the site.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.760
So I wouldn't say that that's
very efficient.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.150
In addition, you look at things
like back buttons.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.950
If you look, all browsers
have some way of

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.190
going back in the history.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.070
So that sort of back button that
you're including there is

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.250
a bit redundant.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.790
So again, if we look at the
updated version of Romney's

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.590
website, we see he's utilizing
what's called the toggle,

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.870
where it basically
says Open Menu.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.710
You tap that, it exposes
the navigation.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.830
And then is says, Close Menu.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.330
So again, that's a pretty good
way of keeping things

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.141
accessible, yet still
unobtrusive.

00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:26.239
So definitely a step in the
right direction for him.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.070
Another interaction that doesn't
really get talked

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.960
about a lot is that
of scrolling.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.239
It's a pretty common
interaction, obviously. .

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:41.719
But it's also not terribly
sexy to talk about.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:45.980
But what I found is that
whenever we scroll on mobile,

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.679
whether on the web or just
anywhere else in apps or

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:54.310
whatever, we're typically doing
one of three things.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.480
We're either going
back in time.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.740
We're going through a Facebook
feed or an email feed or some

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.020
form of time-based grouping
of items.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.430
We're going through grouped
items or we're diving in deep

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.640
into content.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.250
So again, so we have things
like going back in time.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.810
You're scrolling back in time
through your posts, through

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.550
your email, through whatever.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.990
Going through groups of items,
things like categories of

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.280
names and stuff like that.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.540
So I'm going through my contact
lists on my phone, or

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.080
I'm going through an artist's
list in iTunes, or Rdio, or

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.200
something like that.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.160
Or I'm diving in deep into a
single piece of content.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.450
I'm reading my email and this
Nigerian prince email looks

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.260
very attractive to me, so
I want to learn more.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.230
So I'm going to scroll down.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.160
Or I'm reading a really great
article on the web and so I'm

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.690
going to scroll down
to read it.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.920
So what I've found though, is
that we're always scrolling

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.160
through a singular
content type.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.900
This is important for responsive
design because so

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.570
much of responsive design
is how to--

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.060
the conversation is about
how to re-flow layouts.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.740
What do we do with those second
and third and fourth

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.740
columns and stuff?

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.080
And typically, the answer
is to simply stack them

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.590
underneath each other.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.460
And what I found is that that
just doesn't make for a very

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.210
good user experience.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.855
So if you look again,
here's Mitt

00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:33.550
Romney's site on the left.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:37.860
And here's a previous version of
Obama's site on the right.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.910
And you can see you have this
sort of big call out, this

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.550
Obama, Clooney, and you.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.290
You have an email
sign-up form.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:50.650
You have a couple touts that
highlight certain things.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.210
You have his record in brief.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.290
And then, as you scroll down--

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.540
sorry about that.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.990
Oh, doesn't seem to work.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.860
But as you scroll down
this page, you

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.830
have all of this stuff.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.170
You have the record in brief.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.210
Then you get down to
his blog posts.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.240
And you see the blog posts and
you see all these share icons

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.530
for each blog posts.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.870
And it goes through about
10 different blog posts.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.770
And then underneath,
there's a bunch of

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.150
things like his tweets.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.420
And then underneath that,
it's like take action.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.710
And then underneath that,
it's even more stuff.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.190
And then eventually, you get
down to the footer where it

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.305
just contains this huge
spray of links.

00:37:28.305 --> 00:37:32.520
And the idea is that you're
simply sifting through all of

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.560
this disparate content just to
find what you're looking for.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.480
It's not a very good
user experience.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.040
Again, like the user expectation
on a mobile device

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.200
is to scroll through a
single content type.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.450
And by simply stacking things
on top of each other, users

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.890
are forced to go on a treasure
hunt just to find what they're

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.730
looking for.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.820
So we want to avoid that.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.990
And if we look at Obama's
redesigned website, they've

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.900
done some sort of clever
optimization where basically

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.980
on small screens they just
exposed the title of their

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.930
blog posts instead of showing
the full excerpts, and all

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:14.140
these images, and all
these share buttons

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.070
in addition to them.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:19.280
So that creates a more scannable
experience a better

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.550
performing experience, and
all of that stuff.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:26.040
So definitely a step in
the right direction.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.190
Conditional loading is sort of
what we're talking about with

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:34.710
regards to how to solve
those problems.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.900
How do we include a full
experience, especially for

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:45.290
larger screens, but still keep
things nice and compact and

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.960
fast-loading right out of the
gate for small mobile screens?

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.680
Scott Jehl calls this aggressive
enhancement.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.860
I really love that term.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.430
I hope it catches on.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.740
But basically, the
idea is this.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.970
We have a web page.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.130
This could be any web page.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.010
We have the thing.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.870
And the thing is the thing
that's divined by the URI.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.750
If you click on a picture that
says Click Here for Cute

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.420
Kittens, whenever you click
on that link, what do

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.680
you expect to find?

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.020
You expect to find
cute kittens.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.500
But in addition to those
pictures of cute kittens,

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.420
there's all this other stuff.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.070
We might have related pictures
of cute kittens.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.790
We might have a comment form.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:30.410
We might have social icons
to share the thing.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.770
But all of those things aren't
the pictures of cute kittens

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.460
themselves.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.200
So what we could do is
we can actually chunk

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.270
those things out.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.290
Those sort of supplemental
or [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.760
bits, which actually,
again, might--

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.160
they might not all be crap.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.890
It's not like you could just
remove them entirely.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:54.330
But we can just be a little
more thoughtful of how we

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.920
introduce them into
the experience.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.930
So what we could do is we could
simply chunk those out,

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.580
link to them from
the main page.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.400
So link to the comments and
have them isolated.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.320
So again, if JavaScript fails,
or when it fails, the user can

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.740
click Click Here to
View Comments.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.100
And they tap that, and then
they get taken to the new

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.140
screen that shows
the comments.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.740
So again, the idea is to
create an accessible

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.750
experience.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.390
But then from there, we could
sort of pull everything

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.990
together, like Voltron when
the conditions are right.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.740
Whenever the screen's large
enough to accommodate those

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.670
extra chunks.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.650
Or whenever the user
requests them.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.580
We could sort of just pull
everything all together.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.520
I think that's a really, really
valuable technique that

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.770
we have at our disposal to sort
of help keep the core

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.010
experience really, really light,
but also not sort of

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:59.000
sacrifice serving up an
eventual robust web

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.470
experience.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.190
So the next thing we're going to
talk about is performance.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:10.550
Performance is, in my opinion,
very neglected.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.450
And the expectations are high.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:17.100
Mobile users expect mobile sites
to load as fast, if not

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.580
faster, than desktop sites.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.020
And that's a pretty huge
majority there, 71%.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.850
And a full 74% of mobile
visitors will abandon a site

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.240
if it takes more than
5 seconds to load.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.330
That's a huge number,
a full 3/4.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.830
So in other words really,
you have 5 seconds

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.960
of someone's time.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.790
And if you don't give them
something in that 5 seconds,

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.800
they're gone.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.550
And they'll oftentimes go
to a competitor's site.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.680
And they will be gone
and never come back.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.420
But the problem is, is that
the average page size just

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.740
keeps growing and keeps growing,
growing more obese

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.340
every single day.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.300
Why is this happening?

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.130
What I found is that just
performance is invisible.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:07.710
It's the sort of invisible
aspect of design.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:11.750
You can't mock up performance
in Photoshop.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.880
You can't sort of just put
it there as a line

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.070
item on your thing--

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.320
performance.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.550
It's often this thing
that's just--

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.780
it's always there, but it's
always neglected.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.360
So because of that, I've been
talking about elevating

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.420
performance as a design
feature rather than as

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.880
something that only developers
need to worry about.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.700
Because very often-- and this
will probably sound familiar

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.910
to you, performance is
usually one of the

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.860
sort of lesser concerns.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.460
Deadline's getting closer.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.250
We don't really have a
whole lot of time.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.090
It's like, oh, yeah.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:50.990
We'll just worry about
all those performance

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.320
optimizations later.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.630
Don't worry about it.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.250
We just need to get
the site launched.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.060
And, oh, that's just something
that the developers need to

00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.930
take care of.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.800
If the site's slow, it's
the developer's fault.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:09.210
It's not the fact that they've
designed 30 meg images and

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.700
included a bunch of crazy
parallax stuff.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.380
So I've been talking about
performance as design.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.740
We need to elevate it earlier
in the design process.

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.980
You can't just leave it at
the end of the process.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.450
If you don't think that
performance is important, it's

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.450
important to understand that
performance is good design.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.270
Good performance
is good design.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.170
If you don't believe me,
just look at the

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.420
whole Facebook thing.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.090
I had a lot of people-- and
whenever I mention that I work

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:45.690
in mobile, people would say,
Facebook suck, as if it was my

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.210
fault or something.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:52.310
But they weren't saying that
Facebook sucks because the

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:56.480
navigation was unintuitive, or
that the timeline redesign

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.300
wasn't elegant, or that the
navigation wasn't cool.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:04.520
They were saying it sucks
because it was just so slow.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.660
So we really need to prioritize
performance in this

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.760
day and age.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.450
We can't just sort of cross our
fingers and hope that 4G

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:18.390
and LTE and everyone's just
going to be rocking a FiOS

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.010
connection anytime soon.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.680
We really can't bank on that.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.090
We need to address the
constraints of bandwidth.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:32.370
So if we look at how the
candidates fared, this is

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:38.770
typical web page on Romney's
site, the Pennsylvania page.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.570
And I ran it through a
tool, which at the

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:43.530
time was called Blaze.io.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.190
It's since been renamed, and
we'll get to that in a minute.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:51.250
And what I found is that the
mobile site took 8.75 seconds

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:56.290
to load and weighed
687K, which is

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.620
actually pretty decent.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.645
It's still above that 5 second
mark that we'd like to see.

00:45:02.645 --> 00:45:06.680
But at the same time, the file
size is significantly lighter

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.780
than the average page weight.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.980
Then we get over to the
responsive end of things.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.420
Guy Podjarny, who helped make
Blaze.io, which is now

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:22.610
Mobitest, now works at Akamai,
found that 86% of responsive

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:27.150
websites serve the same payload,
or roughly the same

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.630
payload, to small screen
viewers as

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.510
large screen viewers.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.760
So in other words, all these
mobile sites are basically

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.170
getting a desktop heavy
experience.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.150
And so that's definitely
reflected in

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.920
Barack Obama's website.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.730
This is again, a previous
edition of it.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:51.420
And we ran it through the same
test and found that it takes

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:57.860
21.68 seconds to load and
weighed 3 and 1/2 megs, which

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.110
is gigantic.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:05.480
And that actually creates some
serious accessibility issues.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.970
My cousin, who's a geologist,
has a company-issued

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:11.710
BlackBerry.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.600
And I asked him to fire up
Obama's website on his

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.180
BlackBerry.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.670
And this is what he
sent back to me.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.750
It said, request entity
too large.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.990
In other words, it's saying, I'm
not even going to try to

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.860
render that page.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.430
It's just way too big.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.660
And it's funny to point out
that Obama actually has a

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.370
Blackberry.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.340
So I was sort of curious to see
if Obama could access his

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.390
own website from his phone.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:41.190
Hopefully he can.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.295
But if you look at the waterfall
charts, on the left

00:46:44.295 --> 00:46:45.310
is Mitt Romney.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.500
On the right is Obama.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.870
You could just clearly see that
Obama's site is loading

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.120
way more stuff.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.330
Through the course of the
campaign, they both underwent

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.470
some pretty serious redesigns.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:06.850
So I ran both of the redesigns
through the updated tool,

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.330
which is again, called
Mobitest by Akamai.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.450
And basically, it fires up--

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.470
you could paste in any URL.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:20.110
It will fire it up on a real
device and then spit back the

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.110
performance stats for it.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:27.580
So how long it takes to load,
what the page size is, and all

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.650
the waterfall charts.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.640
And you can provide some
screenshots and stuff.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.990
It's a great, great tool.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:37.770
So I ran Mitt Romney's website
through this tool and found

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:42.500
that it actually now takes 19.58
seconds to load and now

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.370
their mobile site weighs
1.6megs, which is giant.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.690
Once upon a time it was sitting
around, like 8 seconds

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.640
to load and 687K.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.410
And now it's huge and
it's bloated.

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:59.880
Now granted, they are
achieving content

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.860
parity a lot more.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.940
But it's a serious step
backwards for them as far as

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.460
performance goes.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:13.040
And if we look at Obama's
website, their redesign

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.410
actually came down quite
a bit in file size.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:21.010
It used to be 3 and 1/2 megs and
they cut it down to a meg.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.940
It's still on the heavier side
of things, and it still takes

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.670
18.76 seconds to load.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.170
But at the same time, that's
a pretty big step

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.420
in the right direction.

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.720
So performance is absolutely
essential.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.980
I think that we need to sort
of elevate its status.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.380
We need to treat it as more
of an urgent matter.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.640
Treat it as a design
problem rather than

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.480
a development problem.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.990
I think that does a lot of good
as far as getting more

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.080
people on board.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.230
Just include that in your
statements of work and in your

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.070
project briefs and stuff.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:49:01.000
Just say the goal is to create
a really fast website that's

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.970
very flexible.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:07.620
So the last little bit of the
pyramid is this concept of

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.870
enhancement.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.970
Progressive enhancement
is your friend.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:20.190
Just because we have more
limited devices, or legacy

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:24.030
browsers, or whatever, doesn't
mean that we can't capitalize

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.860
on all the new and great
features that are coming down

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.800
the pipes really fast
and furious.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.960
But in order to do this, we need
to build up from a core

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.620
experience.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.880
We need to embrace the
constraints first, address

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.940
those constraints first,
and build up.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.205
You hear the term mobile
first a lot.

00:49:42.205 --> 00:49:47.990
And really, from a development
standpoint, it's about sort of

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:51.090
addressing the constraints
of the mobile medium--

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:56.870
low bandwidth, small
resolutions, potentially

00:49:56.870 --> 00:50:00.100
inferior feature sets,
and stuff like that.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.900
And really just sort of build
up those experiences so that

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:09.530
as devices have more screen real
estate, as devices have

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:14.110
more capabilities, we're in a
position where we could simply

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:18.130
add it onto a core experience
in order to capitalize on

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.140
those features.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.170
Instead of sort of assuming
things by default-- oh, of

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.980
course users are on a large
screen or of course users

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.230
support touch.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.030
Or of course users whatever.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.260
All of a sudden you have to
cross your fingers and hope

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.050
that nobody releases a
popular device that

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.850
doesn't meet those criteria.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.310
So it's really, really important
to progressively

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:44.250
enhance experiences now
more than ever.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:47.010
And really, what I say is that
this is foundational work.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:52.910
Jeremy Keith wonderfully stated,
he said, starting with

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.070
the lowest common
denominator--

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:59.390
or progressive enhancement
doesn't mean designing for the

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.480
lowest common denominator.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.010
It means starting there.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:03.880
I think that there is.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.270
There's a misconception that
if you want to do anything

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:09.770
advanced or whatever, you have
to ignore progressive

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.320
enhancement.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.940
That's simply not the case.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.440
It's just a matter of laying a
solid foundation and covering

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.890
your bases, and then building
up from there.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.810
Again, we have tools like
Modernizr, that gives us all

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.680
sorts of different things
that we could detect and

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.610
capitalize on them.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:29.460
Introduce more advanced
functionality if a device

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:33.290
supports geolocation, if the
device supports App Cache, or

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.120
WebSockets, or whatever.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.780
We actually have these tools
on the server side.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.790
This is Detector by Dave Olsen,
which actually is sort

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:48.050
of a combination user
agent/feature detection tool

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.210
that all gets handled on the
server end of things.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.010
So again, it doesn't all need
to be client side when we're

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.320
doing this adaptation.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.030
But the idea is to really
capitalize on the specific

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:03.370
device that's accessing
your experience.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.330
And it's also important to
understand that different

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.870
users have different
expectations.

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.700
My cousin's BlackBerry, he's
not expecting this crazy

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:18.190
multi-touch CSS3 transition
web experience.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:21.650
He's really just trying to
access some information, and

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:23.460
read some things, and
maybe fill out of

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.980
form or two, or whatever.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.950
But he understands that he
doesn't have the latest and

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:31.160
greatest Android device or the
latest and greatest iPhone.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:37.400
Whenever you make these stupid
assumptions, you

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.900
start looking silly.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.680
"Fatal Error.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.850
No iPhone, iPad, HTML5 images
available." I honestly don't

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:46.100
really know what that means.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:53.900
But yeah, you're depriving
people an experience

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.000
arbitrarily is what's
going on here.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.070
It's also important to
understand that there's a

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.560
difference between support
and optimization.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.310
Unless you wanted to hole
yourself up in a cabin for the

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.400
foreseeable future with a bunch
of different devices,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.230
there's no way you're going to
be able to optimize for every

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.190
single platform and
configuration and user

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:19.900
preference and setting
out there.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.060
So you do, you need to draw a
line between what you support

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.580
and what you optimize for.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.730
And it's important to understand
that difference,

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:33.420
just because I think a
lot of people use--

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.350
they sort of misconstrue
what optimization or

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:37.940
what support means.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.160
And they say, well, we only
want to support WebKit

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.720
browsers, or we only want to
support the iPhone, and

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.520
everything else can
take a hike.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.290
There's still a way to
optimize for iPhone.

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.130
There's still a way to optimize
for the best of breed

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.140
and most capable devices while
still providing some level of

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.280
support for those other users.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.720
Just because you don't like
their configuration or

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.120
whatever, or it's a pain in the
ass to develop for doesn't

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.110
mean we have the right to
arbitrarily lock them out of

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.950
an experience.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.820
So there's a lot of different
things that we could enhance.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.570
This is the candidate's
website.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.280
You have all these opportunities
to utilize

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:30.260
things like the right input
types for forms.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.090
So here we have a zip code on
both Mitt Romney's site and

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:35.240
Obama's site.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:39.420
And what they could do is define
these things as numeric

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:44.250
inputs that allow--

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.940
that pull up the right virtual
keyboard on touch devices.

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.230
That makes the form
a little easier to

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.870
load or to get through.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:58.300
Here we have the newsletter
site on Obama's site.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.400
And you're looking at
the email field will

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.830
actually pull up--

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.180
so they did that one right.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.180
So they did input type
equals email.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.000
And it pulls up the
little at sign.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.830
It gets rid of these other
unnecessary characters, so it

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:16.760
makes it a little
more easy to do.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.520
But then you go down into the
ZIP field and that should be a

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.640
numeric value.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.100
And it's not.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.190
So there's a lot of different
things that we could do.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.330
One of which is, again, changing
the input type to

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.870
number, which is great.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:37.060
But then, also adding this
pattern attribute to the

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.490
string, which basically pulls
up the bigger chunkier

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:43.550
telephone prompt.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:47.560
So instead of just having the
numbers 1 through 10 across

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.420
the top like the previous
screen--

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.030
oh, sorry.

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.250
I don't have an example
of that.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.410
You instead get these
big, huge, chunky

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:59.930
keys, which is fantastic.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:04.140
Another optimization that's
really important to understand

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.950
is that these telephones in
which we're accessing the web

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.560
can make telephone calls.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.260
And Obama's website is actually

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:16.520
using this to his advantage.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.280
So they have this Call Tool
where people are able to make

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.410
calls on the candidate's
behalf and say,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.260
hey, are you voting?

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.610
Are you registered to vote?

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:26.580
Who are you voting for?

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.160
And give their whole spiel.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.180
Basically, from an old school
standpoint, you would have to

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:39.460
look at the screen and then dial
a phone number on another

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.520
device, which is hugely
cumbersome, takes a lot of

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.050
time, and there's a lot
of room for error.

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:49.370
But again, these mobile devices
can make phone calls

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.325
right from the device.

00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:54.320
So the user can be on Obama's
website, simply tap that

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.570
number, and initiate
a phone call.

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:59.980
That's really, really clever.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.670
Other things for the candidates,
like geolocation

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.120
is really, really important.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.660
Things that battleground states
and location matters a

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:09.990
great deal.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:13.590
But there is ultimately just
all sorts of things that we

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:15.330
can enhance.

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:18.460
Again, if we look at that
list from Modernizr.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.200
It's a pretty extensive list.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.550
And this is just
the beginning.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:27.740
So wrapping up.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.860
This is what I want you to get
out of this, is that users

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.910
don't give a shit if your
site is responsive.

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:36.850
They don't give a shit if it's
a separate mobile site.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.810
They do give a shit when they
can't get done what they need

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.150
to get done.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:44.440
Whenever they can't accomplish
their task is when they start

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:48.380
noticing what environment
they're in.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.210
There's all of these different
things that we need to take

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:55.030
into mind whenever we're
creating these multi-device

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.650
web experiences.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.430
And it's just important to focus
on the right aspects of

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:03.050
the process.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.620
And it's important
to understand--

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:09.700
I took a lot of shots at the
candidates' websites, and on

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.330
other sites and stuff as well.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.370
But this stuff is really,
really hard.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:17.180
We're all trying to
figure this out.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.620
It's important to
start somewhere.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:23.210
You might have a current desktop
site that's big and

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:28.470
clunky and crusty and old, but
it's just out of the question

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.350
to do a full-blown redesign.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:34.430
So these separate mobile sites,
while they might be

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:37.850
sort of shortsighted in the near
term, can be a tremendous

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:42.370
opportunity to help you sort of
evolve out from under your

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.300
old legacy desktop site.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.360
So while a mobile site might be
initially limited as far as

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.120
its content goes, as far as its
functionality goes, and

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.470
stuff like that, you can still
plant the seed for a

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.140
responsive future.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:04.040
And that's exactly what a lot
of organizations are doing.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.410
And eventually, you put time.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:08.060
You put effort into it.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:11.940
And ultimately, you can sort
of evolve out of your old

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.900
crusty desktop site and into
this new global site that's

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.390
mobile first built.

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:18.310
It's adaptive.

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.250
It's future-friendly.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.900
That's exactly what
organizations like the BBC are

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.960
doing, like "People"
magazine are doing,

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.160
and stuff like that.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.910
It just doesn't make sense for
them to strip away their old

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:34.680
desktop site just yet.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.810
But at the same time,
they're learning how

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.000
to deal with diversity.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.220
They're learning all the quirks
and the tricks of the

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:44.480
trade with regards to
the mobile web.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.820
The takeaway from that is
to just start somewhere.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.990
Even if you don't fundamentally
agree with

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:55.210
creating separate mobile sites,
that's OK as long as

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.980
you're planning on sort of
treating it as a stepping

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.010
stone for future enhancements.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:06.000
And again, this stuff is
really, really hard.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.920
And there's a lot to
learn from a lot

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.840
of different people.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.380
So it's really important to not
get hung up in specific

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.060
implementations and technique.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.320
I think that we need to sort
of stand together on

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.880
principles that we could
all agree on.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.370
We all believe in the web.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.170
I like to say, this ain't
religion, this is web design.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:31.290
So be willing to abandon a best
practice that you've been

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:35.410
using your whole career whenever
you find evidence

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.610
that it makes sense
to abandon.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.750
I really like this quote
from Benjamin Franklin.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.530
He says, "Whenever you're
finished changing, you're

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:47.270
finished." And that means we
can't get hung up in our ways.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.950
We can't get religious about
certain techniques and say,

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.790
this is the one right
way to do things.

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:56.220
We need to constantly
be evolving.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.690
Again, if you think of all the
different devices that are

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.800
coming out just in the last
couple months, we need to be

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.430
evolving right there
with them.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:09.030
Because the minute we
don't, the minute we

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:11.490
put the web at risk.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:12.670
And let's face it, this
is going to be

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.330
really, really fun.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:19.250
I can't think of a better
problem to help someone then

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:23.540
determining who the web can
reach, what it can do, where

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.310
it can go, how it gets used,
and why is still matters.

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:30.790
I think that's a tremendous
problem to have and just a

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:33.200
really, really fun problem
to help solve.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.000
So with that, I would
like to say, I kept

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.620
politics out of this.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.700
But I did cast my vote for the
candidate that I thought had

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.810
the best website.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:50.890
And that is why I voted for
Jimmy McMillan's "The Rent is

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.520
too Damn High" party.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.180
It's ample use of Comic Sans,
and loud borders, and animated

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.060
GIFs, it won me over.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.870
So I had to vote for him.

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:07.970
I might have to change that to
2016, but I hope him and his

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.600
awesome website is
in our future.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.870
So thanks very much, guys,
for listening.

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:15.360
Sorry for the technical
difficulties.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.570
And hopefully we can take a look
at some questions now.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.600
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.890
So Brad, if you want to come
off screen-sharing and I'll

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:27.410
bring us up so that they
can see us both.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.380
So one of the first questions
that we have that's got a lot

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:34.200
of votes, "When creating a
responsive sight, is it the

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.730
best practice to define media
queries in pixels or Ems And

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:42.040
are their pros and cons to
consider when using each of

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.950
those?"

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:47.530
BRAD FROST: Yeah, so there's
definitely advantages to

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:52.930
defining your media queries in
relative units, like Ems.

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:58.630
Lyza Danger Gardner of Cloud
Four wrote about this, about

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:05.290
basically how proportional media
queries are a lot more

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:06.200
future-friendly.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.780
But also, present-friendly.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.230
So in my experience,
I have seen pixel

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:16.020
widths sort of destroyed.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.030
So a lot of different devices
handle pixels in a lot of

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:20.110
different ways.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.890
16 pixels on a certain device
might look totally different

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:27.020
than 16 pixels elsewhere.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:31.730
But also, user zoom settings
are really important.

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:37.530
If I go into a responsive
website and command + +,

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.110
magnify the site, which I
like to do actually--

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:47.320
if your media queries are set in
pixels, it won't honor the

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.530
user zoom settings.

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:53.340
But if you handle them with
relative units using Ems, it

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.770
will honor them.

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:56.830
I think it requires
a page refresh.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:59.670
But at the same time, it
will re-flow the layout

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:04.490
appropriately if you use
proportional media queries.

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:07.390
And the other thing that's worth
stating is that we're

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:10.710
using proportional units for
everything else now.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:11.530
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
that's true.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:14.580
BRAD FROST: For layouts, for
fonts, for everything now.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.030
Just take it that one step
further and define your break

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:20.630
points in relative units.

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.900
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.520
So next question from Dan in
Amsterdam wants to know,

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.900
"Should we take into account
a device bandwidth before

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.720
serving content, especially
media assets to the device?

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.750
If so, how should we
implement that?"

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.740
BRAD FROST: Yeah, so there's a
lot of actually really recent

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.630
things that have been coming up

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.330
regarding sort of bandwidth.

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:46.230
It's still really tricky
to detect bandwidth.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:49.560
We have sort of the navigation,
navigator

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.590
connection type, and
stuff like that.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.090
But even that's not reliable.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:57.520
Anybody that's been on like
hotel Wi-Fi will probably know

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.080
that 3G is oftentimes
faster than that.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.050
We can't make assumptions even
based on even knowing what

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:07.240
kind of connection
type we have.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:14.230
So I'd say that it's best to
assume a slow, painfully slow

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:19.960
connection by default and serve
up assets appropriately.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.520
Things like adaptive images--

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.750
and there's a lot of different
solutions and stuff that's

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.040
sort of coming down the pipes
with regards to the spec and

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.460
stuff like that.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:35.240
But in the meantime, we have
tools like Picture Fill, which

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.280
allows us to serve a small
image by default.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.690
But then whenever you reach
a certain break point or

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:46.710
whatever, then load in
a larger image asset.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.510
Same thing with retina graphics
and stuff like that.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:53.620
Small by default, but then
conditionally load in a higher

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.240
res version.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.390
But one of the most recent
things that has been pretty

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:03.070
clever is that they're finding
that the image compression,

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:08.620
like JPEG compression, is more
a factor in determining a

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.980
device's bandwidth--

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:16.020
or, I'm sorry, an image's size
than the dimensions of them.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.010
So everyone's freaking out about
retina screens and stuff

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.190
like that now.

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:23.930
And it's important to understand
that you could

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:28.610
actually create larger images
with larger dimensions, but a

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:32.240
lower compression and then just
simply scale them down

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.110
and they'll look great on retina
displays, as well as

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:37.810
just standard displays.

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:43.300
And in some cases, the file
size of the enhanced--

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:43.870
the bigger--

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:45.600
PETE LEPAGE: Is even smaller.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.460
BRAD FROST: Even smaller than
the base image, which is

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.410
pretty crazy.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:56.660
But yeah, image optimization,
other things like maps and

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:01.180
other interactive components,
just don't include those

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.310
things by default.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.390
Again, I was talking about
conditionally loading.

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:07.440
I will give my little example.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.870
I have a demo of this
on the way.

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:12.940
Hopefully I can share
it later on--

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:15.140
of something like Google Maps.

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:19.790
If you want to embed Google Maps
in your site, you have to

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.240
iFrame in the embedded map.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.050
But for small screens, I would
actually argue that's not a

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.750
very good experience.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:32.460
For one, a lot of major
smartphone platforms, like iOS

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:38.710
and Android, will intercept
links to Google Maps and fire

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:42.130
up the native mapping
application, which is a far

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:44.670
better user experience
than anything

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:45.840
on the web can provide.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.940
Again, it just has access
to more things.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.410
So I'd say that that's
the best experience.

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:55.700
So the demo that I have
simply includes a

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.420
link to Google Maps.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:03.900
And you could use the Google
Static Map API or whatever, to

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.310
pull in a still or whatever,
if you want to.

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:11.270
And then whenever the screen
size becomes big enough, then

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:14.120
you can load in that iFrame and
add an editable map and

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:14.880
stuff like that.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.560
So again, it's about sort of
serving the right experience

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.210
to the right context
and stuff.

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.090
But by assuming less upfront,
you're not forcing mobile

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:28.700
users to download all this
JavaScript to render an iFrame

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.850
by default.

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:32.380
And as a result, you're able to
just sort of take bandwidth

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.819
into consideration.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.880
At the very least, if everything
fails, they have a

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.950
link to Google Maps, and I'd
trust Google Developers on the

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:46.430
Maps mobile team more than me
to make sure that people can

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.740
get to where they need to get.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:48.630
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:49.160
Cool.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.140
Well, Brad, I think that's about
all the time that we

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:51.990
have for today.

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.970
I want to say thank you so
much for joining us.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.160
This was enlightening.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.040
This is the second time I've
seen this session and I

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.450
learned stuff again
this second time.

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:02.580
So I want to say thank
you very much.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.800
I want to invite all of our
viewers to join us in 3 weeks

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.630
on December 5.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:11.420
We're going to have another
Chrome Mobile event where

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.439
we'll be talking about some of
the tools that you can use as

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:18.359
a developer building mobile
sites and mobile applications.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:19.850
So with that, thank you
guys very much.

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:20.790
Brad, thank you.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:21.320
BRAD FROST: Cool.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.840
Thank you very much
for having me.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.529
Appreciate it.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:23.920
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.920
Have a good day, everybody.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.859
BRAD FROST: All right,
take care.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:26.910
PETE LEPAGE: Bye.

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.160
BRAD FROST: Bye.
