SULI ALI: We wake up every
morning with excitement

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.670
to make games that
make people happy.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.470
Our mission as a company is to
make people happy five minutes

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.420
at a time.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.020
Building on different
devices is hard

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.640
for a couple different reasons.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.120
We have devices of
different screen sizes.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.330
We also have devices of
different hardware capacity,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.600
and we want to make sure
that we have experiences that

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.859
are incredibly immersive
on tablet devices,

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.400
so you can play in the living
room, forget all about your TV,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.340
and just play our games
in the living room.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.173
And we also want to
make sure that if you're

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:45.040
on a bus on a phone that
you bought two years ago

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.340
our game still runs
incredibly well.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.970
And the way we deal with that
from a technology perspective

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.040
is we built our own
game engine, and we

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.100
built our own
interface builder that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.140
allows us to treat UI
for our games like UI

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.620
on the web, where the UI
scales to fit the screen

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.740
size dynamically, and we
adjust the frames per second

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.270
in animations based on the
type of device that you use.
