00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.820
Welcome back to our
AdWords API series.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.260
I'm Xerxes, a Developer
Advocate here at Google.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.820
In the last episode,
we got you all set up

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.280
to make your first API call.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.990
If you made it through
all of that, relax.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.180
The hard part is over.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.310
The rest is a piece of cake.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.110
In this episode, we'll
take a closer look

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.110
at the ingredients you need to
cook up an AdWords API call.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.500
If you haven't seen the
AdWords API overview video,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.410
click this link here and
come back when you're done.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.400
Again, we're going to be using
the Java client library, along

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.660
with Eclipse, but
the concepts are

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.940
the same for the other
language libraries as well.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.030
Here's what we'll discuss
in this video-- test

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.350
versus production accounts
and application configuration

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.880
ingredients.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.640
So let's get going.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.930
In the last video, you created a
test [? MTC ?] account and then

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.680
a test client account.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.080
A test account is an
extremely useful tool

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.420
for trying out
API functionality,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.400
because it won't
affect your live ads

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420
or charge your account.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.260
The test account is also
useful for playing around

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.790
with the AdWords web interface
without consequences.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.130
When signed into the
AdWords web interface,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.810
this label reminds you that
you're in a test account.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.430
Keep in mind that since test
accounts don't serve any ads,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.740
impressions or cost data
will often be zeroed out

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.616
in reports or API calls.

00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:43.710
Now, let's dig into
the configuration

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.850
ingredients of an API call.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.880
In this video series, we're
using a client library

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.860
to access the AdWords API.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.750
So we won't be going
into the back end details

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.200
of how API calls are made.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.920
But if you want to
know more about SOAP,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.870
OAuth 2, and the other plumbing
that make these calls work,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.930
check out the basic
concepts here.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.139
Even when using the
client libraries,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.479
there are some ingredients
you will always need.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.890
We set them up together
in episode two,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.330
but let's recap and explain
them a bit more now.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.640
Remember, they're all found
in your ads.properties file.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.620
Developer token.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.270
This identifies your
application to the AdWords API.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.140
Only approved tokens
can connect to the API

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.420
for real AdWords accounts.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.120
Pending tokens can connect
to test AdWords accounts.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.610
Once your token is approved,
you can use the same token

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.410
for requests against all
your AdWords account,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.760
including those that are not
linked to the developer's

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.820
tokens [? MTC ?] account.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.720
Client ID and client secret.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.580
These map your application to a
project in the Google Developer

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.120
Console and are
used for OAuth 2.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720
Client customer ID.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.040
This is the account number
of the AdWords client account

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.190
you'll want to
manage via the API.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.610
Optionally, it can be left
out of the ads.properties file

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.840
and set programmatically.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.970
Once your developer
token is approved,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.190
you can use a real client
customer ID here and not

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.470
just a test.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.480
OAuth 2 access token.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.360
If you're using
the client library,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.670
this will be taken
care of for you.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.130
If not, take a look at this
link to learn about the access

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.440
token.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.620
Refresh token.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.310
The client library
uses a refresh token

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.350
to automatically regenerate
the OAuth 2 access token.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.360
We created this by means of a
utility in the client library

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.780
in episode two.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.880
All right.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.470
Now you understand all of the
ingredients for your first API

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.120
application.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.550
In the next video, we'll look
at how code samples will get you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.750
started with custom reporting.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.670
