00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.150
The equation y is equal
to the square root of 2x

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.110
minus 10 has a y-intercept
of 0, negative 10,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.340
and you see that
from this equation.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.520
The y-intercept is where do
you intersect the y-axis,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.140
or what happens to y
when x is equal to 0.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.680
When x is equal to 0, this
part of the expression

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.570
is equal to 0, and you're left
with y is equal to negative 10.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.870
Rearrange the equation to
express x in terms of y.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.630
So I've got to put
this on my scratch pad

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.080
here, so that I can work it out.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.980
So really, we just want
to think about-- we just

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.920
want to solve for x here.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.340
We want to rearrange to
express x in terms of y,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.750
so let me just rewrite it.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.080
y is equal to the square
root of 2x minus 10.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.630
So we want to isolate the
x on the right-hand side,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.213
so the first thing
we might want to do

00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:50.740
is just add 10 to both sides.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.510
Let me add 10 to both sides.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.880
That gets rid of the 10
on the right-hand side.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.030
And we are left with
y plus 10-- Actually

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.230
let me just keep
track of the colors

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.690
just so you can see
what I'm up to-- is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.500
equal to the square root of 2x.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.320
Now, let's see.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.430
To isolate this x, let's square
both sides here, so let's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.810
square the left-hand side.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.300
Let's square the
right-hand side.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.925
Of course, anything we do to one
side, we have to do the other,

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.080
otherwise the equality
will no longer be true.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.060
And we are going to
have y plus 10 squared

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.050
is equal to-- the square
root of 2x squared

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.220
is just going to be
2x-- is equal to 2x.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.990
And now we can divide
both sides by 2.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.070
And we are left with x is equal
to y plus 10 squared over 2.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.430
So let me write that out.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370
Let me actually type that
in into the program right

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.870
over here.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:07.040
So x was equal to
y plus 10 squared

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.740
over 2, which is exactly what
I wrote down on my scratch pad.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.590
And then they say what is
the equation's x-intercept?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.720
So let's just remind ourselves
what's going on here.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.610
So this curve or
this equation could

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.620
describe a curve that
looks something like this.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.660
So that's my y-axis.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
This is my x-axis.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.585
And let's say the curve, it
might look something like this.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.970
It might look
something like that.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.790
So we already figured
out its y-intercept.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.510
Its y-intercept is where
does it intersect the y-axis,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930
and we already figured out
that's when x is equal to 0,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.250
y is equal to negative 10.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.780
Now we want to figure
out its x-intercept,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.680
so that's essentially
what x value

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.850
do we get to when
y is equal to 0?

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.090
So what x value do we get
to when y is equal to 0?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.880
Let me just-- let me clear these
out just so this doesn't-- we

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.130
don't get distracted by
this right over here.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.140
Well, when y is equal
to 0, x is going

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
to be equal to 10
squared over 2.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.350
0 plus 10 is 10
squared, 100/2, which

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.590
is going to be equal to 50.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.990
So we're at the point
x is 50, and y is 0.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.250
So that's this right over here.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.220
The x-intercept is 50.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.550
When x is 50, we clearly
see that y is equal to 0.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.480
So let's also put that in there.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.830
So what is the
equation's x-intercept?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.110
So when x is 50, y is 0.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.230
And we can check our
answer, and we got it right.
