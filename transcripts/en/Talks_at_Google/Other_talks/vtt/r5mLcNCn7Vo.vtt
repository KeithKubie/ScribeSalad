[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:09.110
JOSH SHAPIRO: So we are the
Los Angeles Community Broadband

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.070
Project.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.010
I'm Josh Shapiro, the founder
and acting executive director.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.350
We're building a
community-driven wireless

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.880
ISP in Los Angeles.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.040
That's an Internet
Service Provider

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.120
that is built by the
community for the community.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.880
And we've started
by assembling a team

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.460
of community members,
professionals

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.680
in each of their areas.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.500
And our goal is to create an
ISP that has and maintains

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.910
a symbiotic relationship
between the customer or a member

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.040
and the business, which is very
different than the model we're

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.140
all currently familiar with.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.660
So moving along, we believe that
the root of the problem right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.330
here in Los Angeles
and elsewhere

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.000
is a lack of competition.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.980
The incumbent ISPs,
they operate off

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.500
of anti-competitive
model, where their goal is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.710
to segregate a
portion of the market

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.620
and sort of territorialize
it to maintain control.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.040
That has obvious problems for
the consumer, being that--

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.260
all of the symptoms of an
anti-competitive market.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.780
It's expensive.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.150
The customer service is poor.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.670
The service quality
itself is lower.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.010
And now we're
running into problems

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.450
where we're starting
to see what we believe

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.470
are the beginnings of the
monetization of the internet

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.330
like cable television.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.350
The big step in that
direction is, of course,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.450
the FCC decision to repeal
Title II and net neutrality.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.270
That is just a precursor on
a potential multi-step path

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.590
to building internet services
into a tiered system, where

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.480
there's a fast-track lane
and a slow-track lane.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.250
And if you're not paying or
if the services aren't paying,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.010
then your access to that
content at the consumer level

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.462
could be limited,
possibly restricted.

00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:25.170
At the very least,
it's an inconvenience.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.600
At the most, you could be
talking about the difficulties

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.480
to access specific information,
which has its implications.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.530
So most of you, though,
at a consumer level

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.280
right now, are sort
of feeling the strain

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.600
and the inconvenience level.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.770
And just sort of break
down one of the symptoms

00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:01.060
of a territorialized
market, I guess,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.970
is the service quality
itself and the cost of it.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.960
So we just took one
customer's service plan

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.000
on an incumbent ISP--

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.530
it's a 100 megabit plan--

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.680
and started to just run
some numbers off of that.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.670
It's $65 a month for
on a non-promo rate.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.490
I think it drops to
about $50 on a promo.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.760
But then, of course,
there's no incentive

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.260
to keep people on
promotional rates.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.890
You might have the opportunity
to bounce from promo to promo.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.430
But in a lot of areas that
are not duopolies, but are

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.610
monopolies, you might
just be told, no, you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.380
don't have any other option.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.410
And they know you don't
have any other option.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.960
We started to test average
speeds over a period of time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.450
And at least in this case, the
100 megabit plan, only half

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.640
the time, was greater than
50 megabit per second.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.900
So you're looking at an
average of about 70.6 megabit

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.830
per second download and 7.9
megabit per second upload.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.650
So while you're
sometimes hitting

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.990
the numbers, a good deal
of the time, you're not.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.800
And that mainly comes down
to over-subscription ratio.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.970
There are other factors.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.970
But oversubscribing
your customer base

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.890
is one of the easiest
ways to, I guess,

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.360
pull in more revenue to sort
of stretch your network further

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.910
and further.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.410
So for example, say
you have 1 megabit

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.920
per second on your network to
divvy out to your customers.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.680
So a typical ISP, you might
be looking at multiplying

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.160
that something like 100 to 1.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.140
So you're selling 100 megabit
worth of service off of your 1

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.370
megabit.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.530
The idea there is that
not all of your customers

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.570
will be using that
service or maxing out

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.775
that service at one time.

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:57.025
So you can kind of play
around with over subscription.

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.620
That's a necessary component
of the business model.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.800
But when you start to
oversubscribe more, and more,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.260
and more, then you start
to get into this pattern

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.120
where, if you were testing,
it's an unhealthy network,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.860
where, during peak times or when
multiple users are overlapping

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.900
and using their service, the
total capacity is being divided

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.020
down, and down, and down
until you're dipping

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.650
into the 25s, the 10s, the 5s.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.080
You're getting a small
fraction of your service.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.530
Now it might only be for
a short period of time.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.570
But some are like
Los Angeles, where

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.470
you could be sharing with
hundreds or thousands of people

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.830
off of nearby hubs.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.410
You could be talking about
experiencing these dips

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.650
every single day during peak
hours, which is typically,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.330
like, 4:00 to
7:00, 4:00 to 8:00,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.070
people are coming home
and using their internet.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.970
And so if that's your main
internet browsing time

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.390
or internet
experience, on a whole,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.350
you will be paying for
your, say, 100 plan,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.870
but then usually only
getting a fraction of that.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.280
So another issue that
we see is there's

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.610
a growing digital divide between
low-income and high-income

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.180
users.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.350
The problem there is
that newer technologies

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.950
are being invested in areas
that are higher income, where,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.260
as far as a business
standpoint, there's

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.180
an earlier return on
investment, because there

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.630
are more users in that area that
we'll use that new technology.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.900
So in a sense, maybe
the lower-income users

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.182
won't utilize as
much fiber, simply

00:06:43.182 --> 00:06:44.390
because they can't afford it.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.137
But then the problem is is
that there's no option there.

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:49.970
So actually looking at
the breakdowns here--

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.890
I know this font
is a little small,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.320
so I'll walk you through it.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.920
There was a report released last
year by the Berkeley Housing

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.970
Institute that showed that
34% of Los Angeles households,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.770
approximately 730,000 homes in
Los Angeles on AT&amp;T's network,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.810
did not have access to
high-speed broadband

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.040
as defined by the FCC as 25
megabit per second or greater.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.690
So you've got 730,000 people
just on AT&amp;T's network alone

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.740
in Los Angeles that
don't have broadband.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.490
That's incredible.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.940
Somewhere like Los Angeles with
12-something million people,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.942
you've got neighborhoods,
and some of them are--

00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:32.150
we're looking at District 10.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.830
We're looking at Culver City.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.180
It's not just low
income, but this problem,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.674
it really affects everyone.

00:07:41.674 --> 00:07:43.340
There are entire
neighborhoods that they

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.136
will offer cable service or
higher service up to a street.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.260
And then you'll have a
neighborhood of maybe 30,000

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.800
people that are stuck on DSL.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.670
So one of our missions is
to grow the accessibility

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.340
and service area by providing
high-speed broadband to areas

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:12.410
that are still on DSL and then
also make it more affordable.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.620
Moving along, so our
mission in a nutshell

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.330
is to offer better
quality service.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.100
So that's more
consistent speeds,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.220
especially during peak
times, mainly through lower

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.220
over-subscription rates.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.850
We're looking at something like
a 10 to 1, as opposed to 101--

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.850
fair pricing, more affordable.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.010
We can't last in, say, a
price war against a major ISP.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.100
But our goal is to charge
a fair market rate--

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.010
which right now,
looks like something

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.540
about $10 less than what you
typically get out there--

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.740
and to improve
accessibility to broadband,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.070
so to serve those communities
that are currently under-served

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.920
and provide higher speeds to
the areas that don't currently

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.680
have it.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.820
Net neutral, no filters, no
throttling, none of that--

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.540
and then we want
cellular browsing data.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.690
That's something that, while
being more accessible and more

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.160
affordable, those are
separate components.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.230
We think the net neutrality and
knots touching your data sort

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.010
of goes hand-in-hand with
our moral commitments

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.390
to the community.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.510
So taking a look
at the hardware,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.910
the tech out there is
probably the coolest part

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.420
of this that allows us
to make this possible.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.110
We're working with a new
kind of prosumer technology--

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.260
it's only been out in the
market for a few years--

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.961
that's developed into a
new style of architecture.

00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:48.960
It's got a couple names.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.410
But the big one is
MicroPop architecture.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.040
That's where we're-- instead
of providing wide-area coverage

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.340
to a large area
using a sector tower,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.890
we're back hauling or we're
using a point-to-point link

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.890
from a tower down to a hub,
I guess this access point

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.974
station, usually on someone's
roof, or a telephone pole,

00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:13.140
something along those lines.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.860
And that provides area coverage
to the house around it.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.686
So real quickly,
this is a MicroPop--

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:20.560
Rob will be talking
about these in a minute--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.869
MicroPop and a
client-side antenna.

00:10:23.869 --> 00:10:26.160
This is what the client side
would typically look like,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.840
something like a small
bowl style antenna.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.906
There are various
shapes and sizes, but--

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.197
AUDIENCE: The one on the right.

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:37.160
JOSH SHAPIRO: The one on
the right-- yes, sorry.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.050
One of our goals
is to also build

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.320
a system that's
non-intrusive, since that's

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.390
one of the concerns
for municipalities

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.280
is they're thinking
back to the dish

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.329
days of having giant satellite
dishes on people's roofs.

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:51.870
And there are some
walls around that.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.930
So making it small
and non-intrusive

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.750
is another aspect of that.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.850
Walking through a network,
so our current goal and focus

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.380
right now is on Culver City.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.330
For a test pilot, it's got
a topographical advantage

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.155
with a giant hill
next to a dense--

00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:14.720
I would say, like
a suburban area--

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.580
with a tall tower.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.010
We're talking with the city
about utilizing that tower

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.080
for our test pilot and beyond.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.280
So walking through sort of
the MicroPop model here,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.520
we have our tower backhauling
down to an access point

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.980
on the ground, which, itself,
can have several clients.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.710
That access points
deliver service around it

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.920
and can also bridge to
nearby access points.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.300
So part of the
goal of this system

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.910
is to limit the number
of tower locations

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:52.500
you need to build in redundancy
and sort of lower cost.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.740
The more tower space you need,
the higher the lease price is.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.950
So most of our network design
is designed around affordability

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.980
and reliability-- so making it
as affordable and accessible

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:10.710
as possible without sacrificing
much in the reliability area.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.230
That translates to something
more like this, as far

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.690
as an actual network design.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.290
It might be hard to see on here,
but just to walk through it.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.530
So this is a view
of Culver City.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.070
On the south of this image is
the Culver City downtown area

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.200
where Washington and
Culver kind of collide.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.400
And on the right side
is around Sony Studios.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.860
So we have this
overlook tower, which

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.260
we've learned will be
supplied with fiber itself.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.380
So we don't have to do
any kind of relaying.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.320
From here, we can backhaul
down to access points

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.300
in the neighborhoods,
which each have about--

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.130
those MicroPops are about
1,000-foot radius or so.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.280
They're line of sight.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.460
So we've sort of gone
through and roughly

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.379
mapped out that each one could
hit around 50 structures or so

00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:58.420
wherever they're located.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.086
So they'll be a little
overlap, in order

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:02.040
to hit all of those homes.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.790
And then in green are
links from one access

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.480
point that has backhaul from the
tower to another access point.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.944
So you can start to build
out your network access

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:13.860
point to access point.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.550
It has this granularity
to it that you might not

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.540
had if you were
installing wireline.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.030
And the return investment
on these things,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.690
if you have enough
clients on them,

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.560
could be something like
six to nine months.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.550
So they pay themselves
off really quickly.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.220
And you can just kind
of toss them wherever

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.570
you need to expand your area.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.970
Let's see, the
benefits to society--

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.730
there's the tech side of
things, and there's also

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.280
the community aspect.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.380
The biggest one is
creating competition.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.830
Right now, any
kind of competition

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.750
would start to alleviate
some of the issues we

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.350
see in the price,
the service quality.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.570
And now, even though it could
be difficult on our side coming

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.410
into a market and
even if we can compete

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.500
at a cost perspective
for some time,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.280
it does force the
competition down

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.900
to either compete or
to play with PR hit.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.790
So we're hoping we can help
other people out on that.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.250
Educating the consumer
is a big deal.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.890
Things like cord cutting can
help people save hundreds

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.230
per month, instead of just $10.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.280
We've been reaching
out to our community

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.740
through nextdoor.com
and a few others.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.140
And we have a ton of neighbors
in the Culver City area

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.680
that are paying over
$100 for bundled packages

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.500
that they don't
really use, or seniors

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.620
that don't understand Netflix
and streaming, and YouTube TV,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.320
and those kind of things.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.790
Educating them on those--

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.190
that they exist-- and
helping them migrate over

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.190
could help them save
a ton per month.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.800
There's a open-source
development aspect of this.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.540
A lot of software on our
back end uses open source.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.650
So would we would be
helping those open source

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.900
communities by
developing modules

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.300
and the aspects that we need.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.020
Ultimately, our goal is to
package this in an open wiki

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.340
so other communities
and other citizens

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.760
can build this for themselves
in their own community

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.220
or maybe even build
something else somewhere

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.750
else in Los Angeles.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.740
Since LA is a beast to tackle,
we definitely need the help.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.930
And we think the best
way to do that is

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.170
to put it all out there,
make it very turnkey,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.080
and then support other people
in building themselves.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.910
We're looking into low-income
and student support programs,

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.200
where there's some things
that are experimental that

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.969
are in the works.

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:51.510
We still have to do
some stuff on it,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.800
but looking at ideas
like bandwidth sharing,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.290
or bandwith donations
built into the service,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.950
optional donating an extra
small amount per month

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.210
to buy plans for low income,
and then working with the cities

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.340
to, I guess,
officialize low income,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.160
and find out who those people
are, and qualify, and all that.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.102
And then lastly,
something that's

00:16:21.102 --> 00:16:22.560
sort of new but
we're working on it

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.710
is a neighborhood health
program and building

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.100
in sort of a social
element to all of this.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.710
Nextdoor.com does it
in an interesting way.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.870
And that's a model we
might want to explore.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.120
But they create
neighborhood leads

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.656
for every pocket of each
neighborhood, I guess.

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:41.280
It's usually a few
streets, or a block,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.290
or some kind of
section like that.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:50.042
But they have people sort of
assign themselves a leader

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.000
for their neighborhood.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.840
And then that person can
help nearby neighbors.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.550
And that might be an
interesting model for servicing.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.650
There's some things we've
got to work out there,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.290
like how much they
can do, insurance,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.248
and that kind of stuff.

00:17:04.248 --> 00:17:08.040
But initially, our idea
is, someone like that,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.839
we could lightly train.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.630
They could come in.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.552
We could lightly
train them to do, say,

00:17:14.552 --> 00:17:17.010
educating the consumer aspects
where they're hooking people

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.160
up with Netflix and helping
them walk through it.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.460
And then, on our behalf,
they could help people

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.160
that we assign in
trade for, say, like,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.900
a credit toward the internet.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.100
So involving more of the
community to, at least,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.510
do the light stuff that helps
us in the long run support

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:42.790
our network could
really help things move.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.657
So we've got a
test pilot that's--

00:17:44.657 --> 00:17:46.240
I'll talk about
timelines in a second.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.630
But we're working on designing
a test pilot right now

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.320
for Culver City, something on
the order of 30 to 50 clients

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:53.980
to start with.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.780
It might grow from there.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.360
And right now, we're
looking into building

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.940
in criterias for success.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.370
So what would be a
successful pilot?

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.330
Well, it needs to be reliable,
sustainable, scalable--

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.250
so testing multiple access point
scaling and that kind of stuff.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:19.380
The proof of design, looking at
how this new sort of wireless

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.800
prosumer-grade
technologies operate--

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.480
we're sort of exploring
how much we have to spend

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.240
for what quality of equipments.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.920
And the sky's the limit.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.819
But the real
affordability comes down

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.610
in the entry-level
equipment, where you get

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.080
a lot of bang for your buck.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.070
But somewhere like Los Angeles,
from an RF perspective,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:48.070
is very challenging, so looking
into, what modules work best?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.730
What equipment works best?

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.300
And then ultimately,
customer feedback--

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.020
we would need to hear from our
customers in the test pilot

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.090
to sort of tweak that model.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.140
We want to play with things like
over-subscription, other ideas.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.270
Like say you're paying
for a 25 megabit plan,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.750
but it's not peak hours.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.480
It might be possible to
just open that throttle up

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.290
for those users.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.830
And maybe there's no reason to
force them down into 25 megabit

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.400
all the time if there's extra
headroom on the network.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.140
Looking at more of a
business side of things,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.440
we're planning out
just different phases

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.360
of expansion starting
with a local level,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.330
with the goal being about
500 customers in Culver City.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:40.260
There are some basic outlines
for revenue and expenses.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.880
But the real challenge
is just getting started.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.300
Like any startup, there are
expenses that we have to cover,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.415
especially employee costs, for
all aspects of the business,

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:55.040
and outreach,
marketing sales, tech.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.530
And by our phase 2, we
can push through that,

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.440
and we have our sort of minimal
needs met for employees.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.580
And then as you scale up,
the biggest cost of this

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.610
would be employee
costs for service,

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.810
and maintenance, installation,
and the equipment itself,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.090
which is about something like a
quarter of the employee costs.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.190
So again, our big focus is
reducing those employee costs

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.550
by bringing in experienced
community members

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.690
to help support us.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.030
And then our progress
so far-- so we've

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.710
assembled a team of
professionals right here.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.320
We've designed an RF
and technology model

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.620
that we're continuing to
address as new tech comes out

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.610
on the market.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.230
It's almost
month-the-month right now.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.960
Some of the tech we're
waiting for could be huge.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.987
And it's landing any day.

00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:51.320
But there's some on the horizon.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.000
So it's extremely fast-paced,
these wireless solutions,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.981
the way they're growing.

00:20:57.981 --> 00:20:59.730
We're meeting with
LA-area municipalities.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.020
So right now, we're in
talks with Culver City

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.040
to deploy their first.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.620
We've reached out
to West Hollywood

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.400
and met with their
technology team.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.025
They're interested,
even though they're

00:21:10.025 --> 00:21:13.010
a very small municipality.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.310
They're looking at deploying
mini fiber in the next six

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.100
months.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.500
So it could be ripe.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.430
And then we've
talked to LA itself

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.360
and reached out to
city officials--

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.210
right now, District 10,
I believe District 3.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.430
And we're starting
to explore what this

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.230
might look like in Los Angeles.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.950
Now LA is a much bigger
beast to tackle politically

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.320
than in Culver City
or West Hollywood,

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.030
so we'd probably
be getting our foot

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.980
in the door in
smaller municipalities

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.850
and then expanding
into LA when we can.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.780
There are permits
and other hurdles

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.170
to cross that might
take more time for LA

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.150
than for the smaller
municipalities.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.520
So it's just one step at a time.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.570
And then lastly, we're
looking for investors.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.840
So there are a couple
of different ways

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.620
you could do this.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:11.990
Other community ISPs,
they've started small

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.187
and seeded using investment from
even neighbors-- so collecting

00:22:16.187 --> 00:22:18.020
a couple thousand here,
a couple of thousand

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.900
there on a low-interest loan
or a zero-interest loan,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.630
and then growing organically,
and paying it off.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.040
We're actually in contact
with a small community

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.560
WISP, Wireless
ISP, out in Golden,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.290
Colorado called Au Wireless.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.400
And they started with, I
believe, it was around $8,000.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.612
So it can start very
small and grow from there.

00:22:44.612 --> 00:22:46.320
We're looking at a
little more than that,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.903
because we're tackling
a bigger beast.

00:22:47.903 --> 00:22:54.740
But at least from an
investor standpoint,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.750
it's very approachable
for communities.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.600
It could be just a
series of houses.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.860
It could be an HOA could get
together and do something

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.180
like this.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.800
Really, the biggest
challenge there

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.120
is how you're getting
your service for your ISP.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:13.370
And in our case, the answer is
through Culver City's Culver

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.410
Connect Community Wi-Fi
that's being finished

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.210
in the next couple months here.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.610
They're able to transport
us down to 1 Wilshire

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:25.100
to access very
affordable level 2.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.060
To our timeline, we've
got a tech demo coming up

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.090
in the next month that we
hope to show to some people,

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.600
especially the municipalities
that are interested,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.820
to sort of fast track
some of the permitting

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.460
and that kind of stuff.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.050
For the tech demo,
we hope to set up

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.880
a handful of these in a park.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.230
And they will emulate the
access point on the client side.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.760
And we want to start
to look at speeds.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.645
How many clients
can we get on these?

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:59.770
What kind of air interference
we may be looking at.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.330
Can it punch
through foliage well

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.030
if it's in an access point?

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.000
So that's coming up.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.040
We've got our test pilot
for our first deployments

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.360
sometime in September.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.000
That might depend on Culver
City and what their time

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.010
line is for their fiber.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.670
But currently, that
looks like it's on track.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.430
And then moving forward beyond
that would be early next year

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.930
hitting our first phase 1,
sort of the first official

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.300
deployment where we're
expanding into the neighborhood,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.670
and we have a more long-term
models for scalability,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.560
and then scaling beyond that.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.440
Hopefully, sometime
next year, we'd

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.140
be able to get
permitting from LA.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.290
The Bureau of Engineering
deals with all that and zoning.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.750
So that's one hurdle.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.100
But those are the big ones.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.490
And then it'd be
expanding from there.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.670
Let's see.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.200
And that's it.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.294
So we'll wrap that.

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.710
I'm going to bring
up all my guys.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.360
And we're going to
start kind of a Q&amp;A

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.740
to kind of get some
back and forth going on.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.755
So hop on up.

00:25:04.755 --> 00:25:06.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.176
JOSH SHAPIRO: OK.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.050
Who's got a question?

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.254
You got a-- yeah!

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.600
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question, which

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.304
is, shut up and take my money.

00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.220
Well, I guess it's not
technically a question.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.600
So let me ask you two
other things quickly.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.770
One is, in all
seriousness, how quickly

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.962
do you think you
can get to Pasadena?

00:25:32.962 --> 00:25:33.980
JOSH SHAPIRO: Oh, man.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.930
Actually, I've got
an interesting answer

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.670
in the Pasadena, specifically.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.820
So Pasadena, there's
a big cogent data

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.380
center out in Pasadena.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.490
And there's some great
hill access antennas.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.830
Pasadena was actually
one of our first areas

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.190
that we were looking at
because of that data center

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.330
being really easy
access to level 2.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.400
So I would say that
it would be more of a,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.640
how difficult would Pasadena
be for our west-side-based team

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.460
to service?

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.200
But if we could get
past that hurdle,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.392
maybe the answer would
be, if we started

00:26:12.392 --> 00:26:13.850
to build our own
network in Culver,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.850
but someone was interested
in starting something

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.220
like that in Pasadena, we
could sort of seed them

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.580
with all of our turnkey and
be very hands-on with them

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.950
to get that started,
especially since we've

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.250
done some preliminary
research over there.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.110
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.130
Thank you.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.950
My other question--
I had a little more

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:31.950
of a technical question.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.870
I noticed that your
backhaul, I guess it is,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.790
is by millimeter wave.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.620
So I know this is not
a huge problem in LA.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.036
But do you have
measures of, like,

00:26:41.036 --> 00:26:42.460
how badly that degrades in rain?

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.360
JOSH SHAPIRO: So talking
about the millimeter

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.990
wave and the wavelengths, so
we're looking at, for backhaul,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.110
just to start with-- because
it's super affordable-- we'd

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.890
be either doing 24 gigahertz
or 5 gigahertz unlicensed.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.390
Unlicensed Isn't
great for backhaul.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.030
But 24 is pretty affordable.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.400
It's like $3,000 a link,
something around there.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.340
And the rain degradation
is negligible.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.580
Even for the 60 gig, it's not
bad if you're not going far.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.130
And it rains so
rarely in Los Angeles.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.760
And most of the radios have
a 5 gigahertz fail back.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.580
So if it starts raining, they
can switch over, no big deal.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.780
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.030
JOSH SHAPIRO: Cool, thank you.

00:27:30.802 --> 00:27:33.036
AUDIENCE: What does all
these links do to the ping?

00:27:33.036 --> 00:27:34.410
You talked a lot
about the speed.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.284
What about the pings?

00:27:35.284 --> 00:27:37.450
JOSH SHAPIRO: Oh,
great question.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.976
Do any of you want
to talk about--

00:27:39.976 --> 00:27:41.705
all right, I'll take
this one real quick.

00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:43.080
I do have the
figures in my head.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.404
So you're asking what
rain does to the latency?

00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:48.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
or how is latency?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.180
JOSH SHAPIRO: Or how does
the latency look like?

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.130
Oh, great.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:56.970
Well, in a nutshell,
radio moves faster

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.700
through the air than
light through optics.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.680
So we're looking
at something like--

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.900
depends on how many hops
or how many access points.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:12.150
But you could be looking at
sub-1 millisecond numbers,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.767
upwards to somewhere around 8.

00:28:14.767 --> 00:28:17.100
Right now, most of the stuff
we're looking at is 1 to 2.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.280
So it's been very good.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.650
I think most of our coax speed
tests are like in the 20s.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.350
So I think we can beat that.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.390
AUDIENCE: I guess this is
a pretty obvious question.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:42.400
But given how most areas
in LA are or in Americas

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.350
are monopolies and duopolies.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.000
Why hasn't this
been done before?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.066
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great question--

00:28:49.066 --> 00:28:50.690
looking at you guys,
hoping that will--

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.600
all right.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.760
MARLEY JAFFE: I mean,
just to start off,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.630
this concept of a wireless
ISP has been done before.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.650
So we're not revolutionary
in that world.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.930
I think where we're
revolutionary is that we're

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.900
trying to do it here in LA.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.120
So that's just sort
of the baseline

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.400
is that other communities
and other areas,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.040
both rural and
not-so-rural-- maybe

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.360
not necessarily as densely-based
as we are here in LA--

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.720
but do have solutions like this.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.120
We are trying to
stand out in being

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.630
net neutral, and
community-focused, and driven,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.770
and things like that.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:35.650
But the technology behind
this concept is nothing new.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.960
Although, there are new
developments that are helping

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.630
us succeed faster, and better,
more efficiently in LA.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.190
JOSH SHAPIRO: To add to
that, I would say that--

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.980
on, at least, the tech front--

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.190
handling Los Angeles
kind of density

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.730
was previously an issue.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.840
So I think that
technology to address

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.090
high-density areas, metro,
urban has more recently

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.664
become more affordable.

00:30:03.664 --> 00:30:05.330
CRAIG DUFFY: And
related to that is also

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.000
the help to lower-income
community members

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.500
that we're going
to be trying to do.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.540
That's another factor
that hasn't really

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.752
been done by others.

00:30:13.752 --> 00:30:15.710
So that's one of the
other things that's trying

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.147
to set us above everybody else.

00:30:19.147 --> 00:30:19.980
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great.

00:30:25.326 --> 00:30:28.242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:30.100
JOSH SHAPIRO: All right.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.100
AUDIENCE: Why did you
decide to go to nonprofit?

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.350
Wouldn't it be easier to raise
money if you were for-profit?

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.760
JOSH SHAPIRO: We're
actually non a nonprofit.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.167
I'll have Gabriel touch on that.

00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:41.250
Well let him explain that.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.230
GABRIEL OLSON: So
the plan is actually

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.530
to look at incorporating
as a benefit corporation

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.190
so that we can have,
basically, a dual bottom line,

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.860
both be profitable, but
also have a social mission

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.280
to provide social benefit,
and legally ensconce

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.720
that in the kind of
bylaws of our company

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.050
so that we are able to take
advantage of investment,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.870
and sort of scale
up in the future,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:09.810
and add lots of infrastructure,
and expensive investments all

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.560
of that sort, but also
maintain a responsibility

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.633
to the community.

00:31:14.633 --> 00:31:17.656
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:19.780
ROMAN TATARNIKOV: Also,
just to add to it, actually

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.640
it's legally required
for benefit corporations

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.060
to show that they're doing
their social mission and so on.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.750
So even if we're going
to be a corporation,

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.190
we still have this
social effect.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.088
And we're actually legally
responsible for it.

00:31:33.088 --> 00:31:36.370
JOSH SHAPIRO: OK, great.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.480
Anyone else?

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.850
AUDIENCE: How geography-bound
are you, meaning most of LA

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.707
is surrounded by hills
to some distance.

00:31:48.707 --> 00:31:50.290
But how far away
from the hill can you

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.720
be before you start having
to build really tall towers?

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.690
JOSH SHAPIRO: I missed the
very beginning of the question.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.770
AUDIENCE: Basically,
how far from a hill

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.730
do you have to be
before you have to start

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.440
building really tall towers?

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.270
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great question.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.720
So the technologies
we're using can

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.230
go across Los Angeles Valley.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.100
There's no range
limitation there.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.170
The real issue is line of sight.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.889
So being high off
the ground, and being

00:32:13.889 --> 00:32:15.430
able to point down
on people's roofs,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.190
instead of hitting
across a ton of foliage,

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.440
or structures,
that kind of stuff,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.930
it will really be a
case-to-case basis.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.800
Some areas are
easier than others.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.120
We don't necessarily need to
utilize a bunch of towers.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.760
There are people on the edge
of hillsides, like for example,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.250
West Hollywood.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.152
There might be a
house that will be

00:32:36.152 --> 00:32:37.360
able to host an access point.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.610
And we can just point
it right down from there

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.620
and use it as a relay, as well.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.650
We would want to look
into towers in cases--

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.380
or at least, buildings using
antenna locations in cases

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.950
where we can't serve
that area without them.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.950
But it should be rare.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.370
CRAIG DUFFY: Related to that
is there are some areas where

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.510
you've got a valley that has
10, 20, 30 houses in it that

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.330
don't really have
anything faster than DSL.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.490
And so we have the
advantage of, we

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.100
don't have to lay wire
down for those people.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.440
All we do is get up.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.290
We send a transmit to one of
the houses on top of that hill

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.390
or on the edge of a valley.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.400
And then if that can
hit everybody else,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.539
then we've got that whole
neighborhood covered.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:26.080
MATTHEW VITALE: Me
and the tech team,

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.830
we touched on this
a little bit more.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.520
We did a torture test from
Culver to West Hollywood,

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.090
I believe, where
it was about 5.8--

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.600
JOSH SHAPIRO: 5.7 miles.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.700
This was on
entry-level equipment.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.480
But it was doable.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.480
I think that, touching back
on Craig's response, one

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.550
of the big advantages
of this platform,

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.980
as opposed to a traditional
sector tower layout,

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.000
is that we can use
private rooftops.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.760
So in somewhere
like Los Angeles,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.810
you're not building any
more towers anywhere.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.730
Actually that was, I
think, a quote from one

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.830
of the council member staff.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.940
So we have to find another way.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.239
And one of the ways to do that
is to use people's rooftops.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:21.000
So I guess with
fewer doors opening,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.190
enough to provide the zoning,
and that kind of stuff

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.231
that would allow us to
attach some of the smaller

00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:29.310
equipment on people's homes,
we can use them as our towers.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:35.520
And instead of having to
cast down upon a huge area,

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.790
we can kind of do a zigzag
approach, where we're literally

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.550
expanding pockets at a time,
40 houses at a time, 50

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.044
houses at the time, zigzagging
our way line of sight

00:34:44.044 --> 00:34:45.210
through these neighborhoods.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.290
Now down the road,
you might a tree

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.409
grow in the way of
some line or someone

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.500
might build a structure
in front of that.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.110
It's OK.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.210
You can just reroute.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.490
The WISPs we've been
talking to that deal

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.610
with suburban
environments, they've

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.690
become accustomed to needing
to kind of organically

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.850
grow around things.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.800
And when obstacles pop
up, you sort of just

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.930
make your way around
them in other ways.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.620
It sort of works out.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.999
ROMAN TATARNIKOV: And to add
to it, about the actual tower

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:21.290
set, and the antenna service,
and the customers, that's

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.270
pretty much their last mile.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.240
But if we're talking
about connecting

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.090
different neighborhoods
far away from each other,

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.290
it can very easily done.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.790
Because I have personally have
been on top of 1 Wilshire.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.660
And I saw how there was
a wireless backhauling

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.300
for 1 Wilshire to 100 Wilshire,
which is in Santa Monica.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.910
So we're talking from
downtown LA to Santa Monica.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:48.078
So for those direct links,
it's something very possible.

00:35:48.078 --> 00:35:50.473
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great.

00:35:50.473 --> 00:35:51.592
One more question?

00:35:51.592 --> 00:35:53.050
AUDIENCE: I have
one more question.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.170
I hope that's all right.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.222
What are your plans for
large apartment buildings?

00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:02.680
And when I say
apartment buildings,

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.030
I'm more thinking about
lower-income areas,

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.470
so not the nice areas
here along the beach where

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.240
they actually updated
their call boxes

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.090
so they work with cell phones.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.256
I'm talking about the ones
that would never do that,

00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:15.910
and maybe you are going to
let you put little antennas,

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.868
or it's not feasible to
put the little antennas

00:36:17.868 --> 00:36:19.097
outside every unit.

00:36:19.097 --> 00:36:19.930
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.840
So we're actually building
a technology model

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.410
that works around all of
the sort of data equipment

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:34.084
or hellish boxes we
might come across

00:36:34.084 --> 00:36:35.375
in some of these older complex.

00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:37.820
And you'd be
surprised, it doesn't

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.340
need to be a low-income
structure for it not

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.350
to be touched for 50
years or whatever.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.041
So one of our tech models--

00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:47.040
actually, maybe Marley
can speak to this theory.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.310
We're looking at
battery backup systems

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:54.579
and using exterior ethernets
and that kind of stuff to equip.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.870
Do you want to talk a little
bit about kind of our UPS?

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:57.953
MARLEY JAFFE: Yeah, I can.

00:36:57.953 --> 00:37:00.890
But we also want to touch on
why we can put these antennas

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.640
on people's roofs.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.630
JOSH SHAPIRO: Oh,
yeah, go for it.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.150
MARLEY JAFFE: Well, I'll
let you touch on that part.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:10.490
So our sort of model for
medium-sized apartment

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.470
buildings--

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:18.750
bigger than one to two,
duplex, fourplex units,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.420
but smaller than 50
apartment buildings--

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.140
is, essentially, reverse
power over ethernet.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.540
So each apartment
that has the service

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.710
has a router, just like
everyone has in their apartment.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.200
But that's actually
providing power back up

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.090
to the equipment that's
on someone's roof

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.840
or on the apartment
complex's roof.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.280
And as long as one person
is providing that power,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.810
the entire system stays up.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.300
So if multiple apartments lose
power for whatever reason,

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.290
as long as one
person still has it,

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.410
then all of the equipment
on the roof stays powered.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.510
And then everyone
inside the apartment

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:05.480
should keep internet, as well.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.420
For buildings that are going
to be the access point--

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.300
so serving other
buildings in the area--

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.930
those will also have
battery backups.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.670
And all of this
equipment will be

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.660
able to be monitored by us
to ensure that, when a power

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.310
outage goes out, we're aware.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.770
If it starts getting
close to the time

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.100
that the battery
will be depleted,

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.590
we'll have backup
solutions in place,

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.420
or we'll be repairing
backup solutions

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.060
so that large areas
of the community

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.980
don't lose internet,
and just maybe

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.300
that one building or
something like that.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.360
JOSH SHAPIRO: And
touching on the what

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.330
if landlords don't allow
it, as long as long

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.020
as we're permitted at the
city level, it's allowed.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.260
There's actually a specific
language written by the FCC

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.210
that doesn't allow
landlords to prevent you

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.790
from attaching an antenna to
your roof for internet access.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.570
So the real challenge would
just be getting past the city.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.820
If that's clear,
then we won't have

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.487
to deal with the landlords.

00:39:04.487 --> 00:39:06.070
CRAIG DUFFY: One
thing related to that

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.690
is the access points use very
low amounts of electricity.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.054
It's like a light bulb or two.

00:39:12.054 --> 00:39:13.470
JOSH SHAPIRO: Yeah,
it's something

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.570
along the order of 50 watts--

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.840
could be give or take 20 watts.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.710
But you're looking at
$50 a year, $60 a year.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.750
So the goal with the
access point model,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.310
the MicroPop model,
from that standpoint,

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:34.150
is we're mainly targeting
private households,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.370
because the exchange
is a little simpler.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.150
But the traditional model is
that you offer free service

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.900
to anyone that's hosting it--

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.390
so free top-tier service.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:46.120
So instead of them paying
$80 a month, or $60 a month,

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.310
or whatever it is, they're
getting free service.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.860
And it's really just
at the cost of powering

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.304
the access point itself.

00:39:53.304 --> 00:39:54.970
ROMAN TATARNIKOV: And
just to make sure,

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.430
we will mention that if
the building loses power.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.930
Even if the building
loses power,

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.720
we still have the batteries.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.809
So don't freak out.

00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:03.642
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.790
AUDIENCE: So forgive my
ignorance on this point.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.110
But why can't you-- or can you?

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.110
But is there some legal
restriction or something

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.568
that keeps you from putting
your equipment on existing cell

00:40:17.568 --> 00:40:18.594
towers?

00:40:18.594 --> 00:40:20.510
JOSH SHAPIRO: There's
nothing that prevents us

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.540
from putting our equipment
on existing cell towers,

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.472
it's just the cost of doing so.

00:40:25.472 --> 00:40:26.180
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.310
JOSH SHAPIRO: It's usually
cost-prohibitive, especially

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.360
for something like us.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.390
That would be a major
expense across the network.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:39.094
And we'd have to raise prices
to compensate for that.

00:40:39.094 --> 00:40:41.510
AUDIENCE: If somebody owns the
cell towers and charges you

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.550
money if you want to put your
equipment on the cell towers.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.160
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.560
And it's usually--

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:44.960
AUDIENCE: That's how that works?

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.740
JOSH SHAPIRO: Exactly, yeah.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.150
They charge you money for--

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.710
usually, it's,
like, square footage

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.290
or a certain amount of space.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.007
There's no standards out there.

00:40:53.007 --> 00:40:54.590
They could literally
look in your eye,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.870
and think you're full of
money, and double the price

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:57.960
in front of you.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.930
That's sort of what
we've been told

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.940
by people that are
working in the WISP market

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:02.970
here in Los Angeles.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.761
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:05.780
That make sense.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.060
You also mentioned
something about there's

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.280
a restriction that
says, landlords

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.210
can't stop you from installing
an antenna on your roof

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.892
for internet access.

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:16.850
I live in an historic
neighborhood in Pasadena.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.107
Do you know if the rules are
the same for those, as well?

00:41:20.107 --> 00:41:21.690
JOSH SHAPIRO: That's
a great question.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.430
I do not know.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.730
I was just curious.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.245
GABRIEL OLSON: Are there people
with DIRECTV on their roof

00:41:25.245 --> 00:41:25.670
in your neighborhood?

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.890
AUDIENCE: Yes, there are,
the people, like, next to us.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.800
But I think they're just out
of the historic neighborhoods.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.841
So I'm not entirely sure.

00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:32.190
But I think that they do.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.740
And so I think
that I would be OK.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.060
But I don't actually know this.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.274
I just thought maybe you would.

00:41:37.274 --> 00:41:39.100
JOSH SHAPIRO: Yeah,
we'll look into that.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.640
That's actually the first
question of that kind.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.598
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.410
AUDIENCE: Have you guys seen
any push back from ISPs?

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.930
Or is there any intimidation?

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.920
And at the same rate,
is there anything

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.560
that the ISPs are doing,
in terms of innovation,

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.117
that you see as a
threat to your business?

00:42:08.117 --> 00:42:09.700
JOSH SHAPIRO: That's
a great question.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.460
Well, I'll touch
on the first point.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.010
We haven't seen anything
yet, but we're very small.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.550
That might change
as we grow and start

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.300
to pluck off a sliver of market
share somewhere on some chart.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.052
But currently,
nothing in that area.

00:42:25.052 --> 00:42:27.010
MARLEY JAFFE: I've seen
my internet get slower,

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:27.710
personally.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.080
MATTHEW VITALE: Yeah, same here.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.100
I've been getting
throttled a lot lately.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.944
JOSH SHAPIRO: Yup.

00:42:31.944 --> 00:42:33.360
ROMAN TATARNIKOV:
Yeah, let's wait

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.250
till this video gets uploaded.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.390
And then we're done.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.790
JOSH SHAPIRO: Yeah,
then we're done for.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:41.830
Touching on the-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.069
I already forgot.

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:44.360
AUDIENCE: Innovation from ISPs.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.693
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right, innovation.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.049
Right now, I guess the
scope of technologies

00:42:51.049 --> 00:42:53.340
look like they're moving more
and more toward wireless.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.815
So there may be a point--

00:42:55.815 --> 00:42:59.430
say, it's 10 years from now--
where most people, I guess,

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.980
last mile is all wireless.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.400
Now I think there's already
something like-- what is it?

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.167
Like 50% of people access the
internet on mobile already--

00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:10.125
or is that some figure
like that-- and growing.

00:43:10.125 --> 00:43:14.010
So the real tackle
probably won't

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:18.030
be major ISPs, or at least
the coax technologies

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.050
aren't really concerned.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:23.370
It's probably more
LTE tech that's--

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.880
we've got fifth gen
deployments coming out now.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.637
And so competing with
mobile might be an issue

00:43:31.637 --> 00:43:32.220
down the road.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:37.960
But again, in that regard,
you're talking data caps.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.370
They might not be net neutral.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.492
Even if you aren't capped,
you're hitting some kind of 1%,

00:43:44.492 --> 00:43:46.950
or threshold, or something like
that if you're a heavy user

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.110
and being throttled down.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.860
So it might be some time,
maybe years and years from now,

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:59.670
where the technologies
in mobile or roaming

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:05.580
are cost-competitive with ours,
which is a fixed wireless.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.370
But again, I think at
the end of the day,

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.632
our selling point will
be that where we're

00:44:11.632 --> 00:44:12.840
different from everyone else.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.150
Because we're built
by the community.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.707
And we're for the community.

00:44:16.707 --> 00:44:18.540
CRAIG DUFFY: I also
welcome the competition.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.998
I mean, if someone else is
going to try and beat our prices

00:44:20.998 --> 00:44:22.609
and do it better,
I think that's all

00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:23.900
going to help everybody, right?

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.180
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.010
CRAIG DUFFY: So
that's ultimately

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.130
our goal is everybody gets
faster and cheaper internet.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.960
Because it should be
utility that we all

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.090
get almost as a right.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.790
So thinking bigger
picture there,

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.574
it's important to
all of us for that.

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:39.240
MARLEY JAFFE: Yeah,
it's not necessarily

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.460
the best business model.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.540
But that's one of our
goals is to sort of have

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.390
some of the larger ISPs wake
up and realize that they've

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.300
been taking advantage,
and oversubscribing

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.030
to an unhealthy amount,
and things like that.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.300
And if we can drive that
change here in Los Angeles

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.685
and in greater areas, that's
one of our mission accomplished.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.660
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.440
So yeah, so on that,
I don't know if you

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.880
threw these numbers out there.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.060
But you said that current ISPs
are oversubscribed by something

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.320
like 100 to 1.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.000
And you are thinking of
doing it more like 10 to 1.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.150
But still, more or less, it
seems like the same prices.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:28.040
So I've never
thought about this.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.000
Let me be very stupid.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.410
But help me think about this.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.920
Does that mean the ISP is
overcharging us by 10x?

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.690
Or do you have an
inefficiency of 10x?

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.547
Or how to think about this?

00:45:37.547 --> 00:45:39.130
JOSH SHAPIRO: That's
a great question.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.171
CRAIG DUFFY: On the nose.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.800
JOSH SHAPIRO: There
are some efficiencies,

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.220
I think, in our
set-up over coax.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.090
The biggest one is
probably the speed

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.020
of deployment, the super low
capital expenditure required,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.350
those kind of things.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.360
So it costs us less
for the equipment.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.420
And we can deliver for less.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.980
It's not as robust, per se, as
wireline or especially fiber.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.290
Fiber, it's a huge initial cost.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.530
And maybe you have a ROI
of, like, 10 or 20 years

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.280
in a neighborhood.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.780
But it's always
going to be there.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.600
And you can continue to
upgrade it in other ways.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.000
The real issue with
fiber and wireline tech

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.940
is that, in somewhere
like Los Angeles,

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.210
I think the telecom
commissioner was

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.330
quoted as saying
that they'd hang him

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.134
if he dug up that many roads.

00:46:29.134 --> 00:46:31.050
It creates traffic issues,
that kind of stuff.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.790
And there's a cost
associated with that.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.120
So a little bit of
tech advantage--

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.130
and then, on the
other side, we're

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.870
not seeing what their
books look like.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.440
But a quick guess might
just be that they're

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.500
making a lot of money.

00:46:48.654 --> 00:46:50.320
AUDIENCE: I'm not
that good at throwing.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, let's
just-- thank you.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you guys so much.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.080
Yeah, so this is also a bit
of an ignorant question.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.620
But I know I've had friends
that have gotten letters

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.690
from their ISPs about
torrenting, RIAA, MPAA stuff.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.510
And I was wondering,
to what degree you all

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.520
are responsible for
the types of traffic

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.920
that your customers use?

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.750
Even like child
pornography, are you

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.700
responsible for any of that?

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.730
Are there any legal
concerns that you have?

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.632
Do you have to build
up a lawyer team

00:47:22.632 --> 00:47:24.590
to be able to respond to
these kinds of things?

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.350
Because I could imagine
the MPAA and RIAA

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.187
would be pretty formidable
opponents if they sued you.

00:47:30.187 --> 00:47:31.020
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.680
I can answer to
probably the degree

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.250
of how other wireless ISPs
across the country do it.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.110
But does anyone else
have specific answers

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:40.701
to any of that?

00:47:40.701 --> 00:47:42.450
ROMAN TATARNIKOV:
Yeah, like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.116
Other ISPs, they
pretty much just ignore

00:47:44.116 --> 00:47:45.310
all those complaints.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:47.330
Mostly, they just forward
them onto the user.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:50.660
Because realistically, it's a
job of ISPs to provide a pipe.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.030
And it's the end user
who's responsible

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.510
for its own traffic.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.020
Plus, ISPs, one of the
things we mentioned

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.850
is the way we're
different is we're also

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.230
respect user privacy.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.370
So we're not selling data.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:07.410
But we're also not trying
[INAUDIBLE] any content.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.956
So if a certain user starts
torrenting or something,

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:16.242
then, yes, obviously, it
can be traced by IP address.

00:48:16.242 --> 00:48:18.200
So we're pretty much
going to pass it to users.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.282
There's nothing really
changed in this regard.

00:48:20.282 --> 00:48:22.740
JOSH SHAPIRO: Use a VPN is the
end question for torrenting.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.500
Use a VPN and throw
out those letters.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.015
ROMAN TATARNIKOV:
Actually, there

00:48:25.015 --> 00:48:26.690
was another thing
we were thinking

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:28.820
about is, since
we're a community,

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.590
to educate more in privacy,
that maybe we can partner

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.970
with some VPN providers,
and just partner up,

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.340
and provide a VPN
service with a discount.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.720
So pretty much, we're
forward users to them.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.284
And you get the discount.

00:48:41.284 --> 00:48:42.950
JOSH SHAPIRO: And it
goes without saying

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.952
that we will be compliant
with all FCC laws as required.

00:48:45.952 --> 00:48:46.910
ROMAN TATARNIKOV: Yeah.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.785
And about the lawyers,
we're a business.

00:48:48.785 --> 00:48:50.926
So we'll end up having
some kind of lawyers.

00:48:50.926 --> 00:48:52.550
Plus, we will definitely
have auditors,

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.217
because we're benefit corp.

00:48:54.217 --> 00:48:55.050
JOSH SHAPIRO: Right.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.160
I would also want to touch
on, as far as torrenting

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:05.280
specifically, in doing
this as a community level,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.640
there's a little bit
more of an aspect

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.930
of using your fair
share in the effort

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.870
to make it more
affordable for everyone.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.810
So I think part of
that could be building

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:20.930
in a tier system on our side
for people that are heavy users.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.670
And we're not talking data
caps or anything like that.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:33.680
But people that use more,
the 99 percentile of users,

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.220
it does make it more
expensive on the ISP side.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.250
So there might be some kind of
fairness program or something

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.750
like that.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:45.680
Or could be as simple as saying,
hey, we know you're torrenting.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.470
Can you do it less
during peak hours?

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.830
Or we'll have to quality
of service adjust you

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.210
or something like some.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.293
ROMAN TATARNIKOV: Also,
it's important to remember

00:49:55.293 --> 00:49:59.480
that torrenting does not
equal actual privacy violation

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.500
or anything like that.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.500
Torrenting is just a method
of sharing the media.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.615
So you can download Debian
or CentOS free torrents.

00:50:09.394 --> 00:50:10.227
JOSH SHAPIRO: Great.

00:50:10.227 --> 00:50:11.201
Anyone else?

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.640
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of competitors,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.490
it looks like there's a lot of
satellite internet companies

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:27.880
that might be coming
online in the next--

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.255
you would know better than
me-- but some number of years.

00:50:30.255 --> 00:50:31.296
JOSH SHAPIRO: Soon, yeah.

00:50:31.296 --> 00:50:32.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.730
How do you see them as either
partners or competitors?

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:42.100
JOSH SHAPIRO: I think,
right now, satellite's

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.320
currently more niche.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.240
It stands to be
less and less so.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.134
I think some big sat just
launched-- or will launch--

00:50:49.134 --> 00:50:50.800
GABRIEL OLSON: Elon's
got one this week.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.330
JOSH SHAPIRO: Oh, yeah,
if we want [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.550
And their capabilities are
increasing quite a bit.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.189
It will be soon
where satellite will

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.105
be able to compete, as
least speed-wise, maybe

00:51:01.105 --> 00:51:04.150
not latency-wise with wireline.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.186
So I think that's the technology
that will be on the horizon

00:51:07.186 --> 00:51:08.560
that we'll just
have to look for.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.630
But again, at the
very end of the day,

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.280
competition is healthier
for the consumer.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.600
And that's the
heart of our project

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.500
is to benefit the end user.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.520
So I think we'll
just kind of roll

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.175
with the punches on that one.

00:51:23.175 --> 00:51:24.800
CRAIG DUFFY: Yeah,
satellite is slower.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.250
But definitely, we want
more competition out there

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.740
to help move things along.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.805
JOSH SHAPIRO: It won't be slow
for long, I guess is the point.

00:51:33.805 --> 00:51:35.730
Do you have another question?

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.290
AUDIENCE: No, I was just kind
of fantasizing in my head,

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.260
like imagining one level of
your hierarchy being delivered

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.470
by satellite, so
then, perhaps, you

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.301
could replace the fiber that's
feeding your central tower.

00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:51.800
JOSH SHAPIRO: That'd
be interesting.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:59.120
I would guess that the
business model on the satellite

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.770
couldn't handle
backhaul for level 2.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:05.320
It might be totally
cost-prohibitive.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.830
But as far as competition,
it will definitely be there.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.840
MARLEY JAFFE: Yeah, we're
very fortunate to be

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.760
in LA, geographically, as
well as with Culver City's

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:23.030
municipal fiber that they're
putting in being relatively

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.860
easy for us to get
to 1 Wilshire, which

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.240
is a very large internet
hub for the world.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.200
And so, most likely, there
won't be a competing technology

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.010
that will give us better,
faster, more reliable, cheaper

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.110
backhaul internet.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.270
But one day, who knows?

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:44.840
If Elon Musk gets his vision
or any of the other companies

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.460
out there, then maybe.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.810
JOSH SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.110
All righty, well, we're
running up on our 1:00 PM mark.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.330
So we will wrap it there.

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.770
All right, thank you
so much for joining us.
