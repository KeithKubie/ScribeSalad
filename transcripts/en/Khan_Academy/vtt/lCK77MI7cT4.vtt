00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.890
- [Kim] You have the
right to remain silent.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.170
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.300
in a court of law.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.640
We've become familiar
with the Miranda Warnings

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.720
given to suspects in police custody

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.610
through movies and TV shows

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.500
but who was Miranda and what
do these warnings really mean?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.350
This is Kim from Khan Academy
and today we're digging into

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.930
the 1966 supreme court case
Miranda versus Arizona.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.000
To learn more about the case,
I spoke with two experts.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.720
Jeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.750
of the National Constitution Center

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.270
who's written extensively
about the Supreme Court.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.860
Paul Cassell is the Ronald N. Boyce

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.070
Presidential Professor of Criminal Law

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.150
at The University of Utah School of Law.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.780
He's a leading researcher
on criminal procedure

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.300
and crime victims rights.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.930
So Jeff, if we actually go
back to the time of this case

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.440
what was going on at this
time in constitutional law,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.050
why was the Miranda case so important?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.570
- [Jeff] The Miranda
case was hugely important

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.000
because it represented the high water mark

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.940
of the Warren Court's
criminal procedure revolution.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.580
The 1960's were a time when
there was a lot of concern

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210
about the third degree.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.430
Southern states were interrogating

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.250
African American defendants
in ways that struck

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.160
many people as unfair
but the Supreme Court

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.930
took a long time to respond.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.800
- [Paul] Historically the admissibility

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.410
of confessions into a
trial had been determined

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.790
by what is called, The Voluntariness Test

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.423
and that required a judge to decide

00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:36.830
was the confession voluntarily given

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.760
or had the police used unfair,
overly aggressive tactics

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.110
to extract it but making
those kinds of determinations

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.020
had proven challenging for some courts

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.340
and so there was interest
in coming up with,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.280
I guess what you might
call a bright-line rule,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.320
a single test for determining whether

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.150
confessions were or were not voluntary.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.950
- [Jeff] The court didn't
really settle on a standard

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.060
for deciding whether or not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.010
a confession was voluntary or not.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.530
A test emerged and it was called,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.620
the Totality of The Circumstances Test

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.702
which basically gave
judges a lot of discretion

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:11.210
to weigh different factors.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.470
Was the defendant well educated,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.240
what was his physical health,
his emotional characteristics

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.710
but lots of people were
uncomfortable with the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.120
amorphousness of this test

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.390
and at a time when there's renewed concern

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.840
in the 1960's about the
unfairness of the third degree,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.730
there's pressure to come up with a crisper

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.860
and more constitutionally rooted way

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.300
ensuring that confessions are not only

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.520
involuntary in the sense of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.840
not being beaten out of the suspect

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.380
but not involuntary in the sense of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.270
not reflecting the
subtle coercive pressures

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.130
of the confession room.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.960
- [Paul] So Miranda was
arrested on suspicion of rape

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.210
and at the time the law on
confessions was somewhat in flux.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.250
He appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.070
and then ultimately appealed to the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.230
United States Supreme Court which agreed

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.025
to review his case and
determine the issue.

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:04.840
- [Kim] So who was Ernesto Miranda?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.580
What was his background?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.250
- [Jeff] Ernesto Miranda was
a 23 year old Hispanic man.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.250
He was accused of raping
a woman called Patricia.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.850
That was a pseudonym for her real name,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.210
she was basically forced into a car

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.670
after getting off of a bus and assaulted

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.560
in this terrible way.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560
- [Paul] Miranda was a
laborer, he was poorly educated

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.130
I think is fair to say and
I think it's also important

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.340
to remember that he was a rapist.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.310
There doesn't seem to be
any doubt that he in fact

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.680
had sexually assaulted
a young 18 year old girl

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.190
as she was walking home
from work late one night.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.550
He grabbed her off the street,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.360
threw her into the back of his car

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.280
and drove her out into
the desert and raped her

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.060
and so those are all things
that I think are important

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.700
to recall when we talk
about the Miranda decision.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.220
- [Jeff] And he was identified after

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.100
a friend of hers saw a
car similar to the one

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.670
that she described a week later

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.360
and the police tracked the registration

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.090
down to Miranda's girlfriend
who identified him.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.210
- [Paul] So the police got
the report of the crime

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.640
from the victim and they also had report

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.750
of an unusual car that was involved

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.700
and so eventually they
were able to identify a car

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.900
that was similar to that
described by the victim

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.120
that came back as registered to Miranda

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.380
and so they picked him up for questioning,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.130
they took him into the station house.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.770
He denied having any involvement

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.460
but then the police pulled a ploy,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.690
they had the victim
come and look at Miranda

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.160
along with a couple of
other people in a lineup.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.820
A group of similarly appearing people

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.760
and the victim thought that
maybe Miranda was the person

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.430
who'd committed the crime
but she wasn't sure.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.130
So the police went back to Miranda

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.950
and they said, "Well,
she's identified you."

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.617
and Miranda at that point said,

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:58.710
"Well I guess I better tell
you what happened then."

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.930
and he made a confession to the rape

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.010
as well as to some other crimes as well.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.500
- [Jeff] The question was
whether this confession

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.373
was consistent with the Fifth Amendment.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.080
He might or might not have met

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.060
the totality of the circumstances test

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.670
as Justice Harlan noted in his dissent.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.990
Miranda was 23 years old, indigent,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.700
educated to the extent of completing

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.420
half the ninth grade,
had an emotional illness

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.220
of the schizophrenic type

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.030
and the question was
whether he made a knowing

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.170
and intelligent waiver of these rights

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.680
but the Supreme Court decided

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.710
not to stick to that old totality
of the circumstances test

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.600
and rethink the entire way

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.530
that confessions should be evaluated.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.027
- [Kim] So the Supreme Court
was kind of looking for

00:05:42.027 --> 00:05:46.980
an example case right,
to try to figure out

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.180
what this line should be about confessions

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.470
and how the police should treat suspects.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.821
Why did they choose
this case in particular?

00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:58.840
- [Jeff] The court chose the Miranda case

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.590
'cause it came up at the right time

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.080
at a time when all of the judges

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.180
were increasingly impatient with

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.280
this totality of the circumstances test

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.320
including the great liberal
textualist Hugo Black

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.030
who had been a opponent
of the voluntariness test

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.830
'cause he just thought
it was too subjective.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.450
So they took the case.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.470
It was certainly not a sympathetic one

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.120
in the sense that Miranda

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.070
was not the most sympathetic defendant

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.220
but the court thought the time was right

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.631
and they decided in Miranda to rethink

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.470
the Fifth Amendment law.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.190
- [Kim] Wow, so during his
case what did Miranda argue?

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.520
So why did he think that his confession

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.570
should be thrown out?

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.230
- [Paul] Well Miranda's case
attracted a lot of attention

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.020
because everyone knew the Supreme
Court were very interested

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.771
in the law of confessions
and trying to come up with

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.620
a new rule for addressing
some of the issues

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.530
and so he had a very
good lawyer, John Flynn.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.360
Flynn interestingly enough argued that

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.550
Miranda's right to
counsel had been violated.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.260
It was only the police and Miranda

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.920
who were in the interview
room talking to each other

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.140
and there was no lawyer there

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.954
and so Flynn argued that
this violated Miranda's

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:09.760
Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.400
However as the case developed

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.520
and ultimately the opinion was released,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.330
the Supreme Court rejected
the Sixth Amendment argument

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.580
and instead went with the
Fifth Amendment argument.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.470
The court said that what had been violated

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.680
by the procedures here was Miranda's right

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.470
against being compelled
to incriminate himself

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.900
and the court said that there
needed to be certain warnings

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.620
given to Miranda and
certain procedures followed

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.193
to make sure that confessions
given by suspects like him

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:41.180
were admissible in court.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.280
- [Jeff] Flynn never said
the confession was compelled

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.600
in the sense that it
was coerced by threats

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.810
or promises or compulsion or at gunpoint

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.270
but the fact that he gave the confession

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.340
without knowing his rights, to silence

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.850
or having an attorney present
while in police custody

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.100
made him in effect surrender a right

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.330
that he didn't fully
realize and appreciate.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.633
The State was represented
by very prominent attorney

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.510
Telford Taylor and he said that you should

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.540
retain the totality of
the circumstances test

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.220
and not change the law
but the Supreme Court

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.550
disagreed and on June 13th 1966,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.860
it announced its five to four decision

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.250
in the Miranda case.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.110
- [Kim] So what actually
happened to Ernesto Miranda

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.300
after this Supreme Court case?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.220
- [Jeff] Well the fallout from
the decision was interesting.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.160
Miranda assumed that he
was going to be released

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.870
because the Supreme Court
had ruled his confession

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.090
inadmissible and that was
a pivotal piece of evidence

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.940
without which the prosecution
was not going to be

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.980
able to prove that he was
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.480
and so Miranda's father
ordered a bottle of whisky

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.850
that they were going to open
to celebrate his release.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.600
But unfortunately for Miranda

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.800
and I suspect fortunately
for the citizens of Phoenix,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.490
Miranda had made a few
statements along the way.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.990
He had threatened his common-law wife

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.600
that he was going to get out

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.070
and was going to come back
and try to take the kids

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.190
away from her and she went to police

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.530
and reported that Miranda had
confessed the crime to her

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.400
and of course a confession
to a private citizen,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.560
a common-law wife is not the same thing

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.660
as a confession to a police officer

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.280
and so the case was retried.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.030
Miranda's confession
to his common-law wife

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.140
was used in evidence against him.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.790
Miranda was convicted and
I guess it's fair to say

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.570
that bottle of whisky went unopened.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.740
- [Kim] Alright this is very interesting

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.140
because we see this a
lot on TV procedurals

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.003
and also just in our sort
of everyday policing.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.900
So how is this Miranda rule applied today?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.600
Has it developed at all over time?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.920
- [Paul] Yes, what the
Supreme Court said was

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.430
basically two things were
going to have to happen

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.110
before a confession given by

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.112
someone who was in police custody

00:09:53.112 --> 00:09:55.280
could be admitted at a trial.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.830
The first is that the suspect would

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.890
have to be given Miranda warnings.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.420
That is, you have the
right to remain silent.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.990
Anything you say can be used against you.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.500
You have a right to an attorney

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.210
before you answer any questions

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.914
and if you cannot afford an attorney

00:10:08.914 --> 00:10:11.440
one will provided for you.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.500
So those are the famous Miranda warnings

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.540
that I think a lot of have
seen those on TV shows

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.840
or other programs and there
is a second feature though

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.400
of Miranda that I think
is much more important

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.020
and in some ways much
more harmful to society.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.950
It's what is known as
the waiver requirement.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.787
Police officers must ask a suspect,

00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:33.870
"Do you agree to answer questions?"

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.280
and if the suspect says no

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.360
then the police can't ask
that suspect any questions

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.790
no matter how briefly,
no matter how reasonable

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.410
the questions might be

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.030
and so it's this warning
and waiver procedure

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.300
that the Supreme Court put in place.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.640
- [Jeff] So that core right
remains the law of the land.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.010
- [Paul] So there are some situations

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.310
where Miranda is not in place.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.610
One of them is if a
suspect is not in custody.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.150
For example if the police
are responding to a crime

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.890
and question people on the scene there.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.710
That's not a situation where there is

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.470
what's known in the Miranda opinion

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.460
as the inherent compulsion
of police questioning.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.220
That's just ordinary
citizen police interaction

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.800
and special warnings
aren't required there.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.170
Also a suspect's agreed

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.010
to come down to the
police station and talk,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.750
there's no requirement
of a Miranda warning

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.430
and in very rare situations,

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.620
if there is an extremely
pressing public safety need

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.540
police officers need not
give Miranda warnings.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.810
For example if they've
apprehended a terrorist

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.250
who's hidden a bomb,
police can ask questions

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.520
without giving the Miranda warnings.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.820
- [Kim] How has the Miranda
case and later cases

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.330
that interpret Miranda reflect the way

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.830
that the court balances individual liberty

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.270
and the constitutional
rights of defendants

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.749
with public safety and the
needs of law enforcement?

00:11:54.749 --> 00:11:56.630
- [Paul] When the Supreme Court
looked at the Miranda case

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.170
there were two competing concerns at play.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.560
One was to make sure that
suspects like Miranda

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.490
were treated fairly but the other

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.470
was to make sure that
law enforcement agencies

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.100
could effectively investigate crime

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.810
and what resulted out of Miranda was

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.660
I think it's fair to say,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.970
something of a compromised decision.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.880
There were some who argued
that police officers

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.560
should never be able to question suspects

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.150
once they were taken into custody

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.760
that suspects should receive a lawyer

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.330
and of course a lawyer would immediately

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.602
tell a suspect, don't say anything at all.

00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:29.570
Miranda didn't go that far

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.290
and I think the reason
it didn't go that far

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.010
is there are very significant
countervailing concerns.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.930
A lot of crimes cannot be solved

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.490
unless a suspect is willing
to give some statements

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.750
and provide information
that police can check out.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.830
The Miranda case itself is
a good illustration of that.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.750
The victim in that case,
because the crime was

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.740
committed at nighttime and in the dark

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.070
was unable to give a
positive identification

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.260
of Miranda and it was only when police

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.500
were able to get a statement from him

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.180
that they were in a
position to move forward

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.960
and prosecute him and to
take a dangerous rapist

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.803
off the streets of Phoenix, Arizona.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.520
- [Jeff] Listeners should
definitely check out

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.490
Professor Cassell's study written

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.210
with Richard Fowles in 1998

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.080
called Handcuffing The Cops

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.550
which looked at FBI data
for crime clearance rates

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.810
in the two years after Miranda

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.960
which fell significantly
and they concluded

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.130
that Miranda warnings were the
main cause of this decline.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.240
But it's really important to
stress that other scholars

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.410
have questioned the
study and have also noted

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.020
that even if Miranda initially
made it more difficult

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.520
for officials to interrogate suspects,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.380
the police have since adjusted to Miranda.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.070
In fact they've come often to embrace it

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.740
concluding that basically
saying the magic words

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.330
and mirandizing suspects
frees up the police

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.400
to employ a range of
sophisticated strategies

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.440
to get people to confess anyway

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.750
and for this reason when the Miranda case

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.740
was reaffirmed, far from being upset,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.640
the police in many cases
welcomed the certainty

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.170
that Miranda provides.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.000
So for all these reasons
I think it's fair to say,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.450
just descriptively that
Miranda regardless of the

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.830
empirical dispute about whether or not

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.850
it has discouraged confessions

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.840
has been accepted by law
enforcement by and large.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.030
It's been affirmed by the Supreme Court

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.740
and at least for the immediate future,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.320
it's here to stay.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.540
- [Kim] So we've learned that the ruling

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.780
in Miranda versus Arizona
arose out of concern

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.960
that suspects in police custody

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.220
might confess out of coercion

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.820
or lack of knowledge
about their own rights.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.870
The decision in Miranda that suspects

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.720
must be informed of their rights

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.600
helps to protect individuals
accused of a crime

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.790
from surrendering their
Fifth Amendment right

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.310
not to self incriminate.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.920
But has Miranda harmed
the ability of police

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.410
to investigate crimes by preventing them

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.510
from obtaining important information?

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.900
Professor Cassell suggests
that the broad application

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.940
of Miranda has hampered
police investigations.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.810
By contrast Jeff Rosen argues that police

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.830
have adjusted to working
within the confines of Miranda

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.960
and use other techniques
to investigate crime.
