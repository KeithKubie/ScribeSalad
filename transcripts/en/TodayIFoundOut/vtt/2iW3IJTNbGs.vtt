00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.379
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.940
In the video today, we're looking at how commercial
airplanes keep a steady supply of fresh air

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.320
and how the emergency oxygen masks supply
oxygen given they are not hooked up to any

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.349
air tank.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.210
Let's get started.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.820
Because the economics of having large oxygen
tanks aboard airliners simply doesn't work

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.820
out (not to mention that the air quality inside
the plane would rapidly become unpleasant

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.849
if fresh air wasn't constantly supplied, regardless
of the oxygen levels), commercial airplanes

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.890
have a very clever system installed to solve
the problem of ultra-low pressure atmosphere

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.390
at cruising altitudes.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.430
In most modern airliners (the Boeing 787 Dreamliner
not withstanding), outside air is "bled off"

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.800
from the compressor stage of the turbine engines
and eventually piped into the passenger areas.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.270
However, a bit of processing is needed first
as the compressed air is extremely hot (on

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.020
the order of nearly 400 degrees Fahrenheit
or 200 degrees Celsius) at this stage.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.000
Thus, before it enters the passenger compartment,
it is first allowed to expand and is run through

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.539
a heat exchanger and air cycle system to cool
it off sufficiently.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.340
This system also can work as a heater, with
some of the hot air mixed in with the cooled

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.220
air to regulate cabin temperature.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.720
Once cooled and filtered, the pressurized
air, which now has sufficient oxygen density

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.860
to keep people happily conscious, is piped
into the cabin area, usually at levels around

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.840
12 psi (about equivalent to atmospheric pressure
at 7,000 feet).

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.080
Why 12 psi instead of something like sea-level
pressures of about 14.7 psi?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.070
12 psi is sufficient for the majority of passengers
while simultaneously reducing the structural

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.200
strain on the aircraft itself over something
like sea level atmospheric pressures.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.720
As for the air already in the cabin, this
is vented out through an outflow valve (or

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.560
multiple valves in larger aircraft), usually
located near the rear of the plane.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.810
(Fun Note: Before smoking was banned on commercial
aircraft, the area around this outflow valve

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.560
was generally stained dark brown from tobacco
smoke.)

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.909
This outflow valve opens and closes automatically
to maintain a steady pressure inside the cabin,

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.250
while the entire system is ensuring that fresh
air is continually being piped into and eventually

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.049
blown out of the aircraft.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.789
In fact, while many complain of airplanes
seeming "stuffy," this system ensures that

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.380
all the air in the aircraft is being completely
replaced on average every 2-3 minutes.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.160
Yes, that means that your car, house or office
is likely significantly more "stuffy" than

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640
a commercial airplane flying at 35,000 feet.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.220
(Note: the Boeing 787 Dreamliner handles cabin
pressurization a little differently, using

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.320
a modernized version of the old, somewhat
inefficient, electric compressor system seen

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.950
on many older aircraft.)

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400
Unfortunately, sometimes planes lose cabin
pressure.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.020
Whatever the cause, the loss of pressure (usually
set at atmospheric pressures past 14,000 ft)

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.190
will result in oxygen masks deploying.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.300
From here, useful consciousness may only last
as little as 5-15 seconds, depending on remaining

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500
cabin pressure, which is why it's critical
to immediately put your mask on, rather than

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.390
helping someone else first.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.320
You can help them much better when you're
not unconscious or dead.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.310
So how do these airline oxygen masks actually
work?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.900
It turns out, the economics of having a centralized
oxygen tank to provide even emergency oxygen

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800
for passengers likewise simply doesn't add
up.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.950
Similarly, having tiny individual pressurized
oxygen tanks also isn't feasible.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.110
In fact, these masks aren't hooked up to any
tank or air line at all.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.820
So how are you able to breathe oxygen through
them?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820
Science.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.530
While designs can vary slightly, in general,
when you pull on the device to place it over

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.810
your face, the tug on the mask's lanyard releases
a spring-loaded mechanism that sets off a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.920
small explosive charge.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.420
The resulting spark triggers a mixture of
lead styphnate and tetracene to generate heat,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.820
which will eventually cause a chemical reaction
that produces oxygen for your mask.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.650
(This is why they tell you to tug on the mask
to get the oxygen flowing- you've got to set

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.450
off the explosive charge to get the whole
thing going.)

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.450
That's right.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.420
What you breathe through the mask didn't begin
as pure oxygen.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.370
Rather, the plane is equipped with numerous
small chemical oxygen generators (also known

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.480
as "oxygen candles," about the size of a small
package of tennis balls) which contain a mixture

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.240
of mostly sodium chlorate (NaClO3), less than
5% barium peroxide (BaO2) and less than 1%

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.660
potassium perchlorate (KClO4).

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.960
When these chemicals are heated by the lead
styphnate and tetracene, each undergoes a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.180
reaction that ultimately results in a fair
bit of filtered, life sustaining oxygen running

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.570
through the tube to you.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.560
Of course, you might also smell a faint burning
odor, but this is nothing to be alarmed about;

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.430
it just assures you that the system is working.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.730
In fact, if the plane is actually on fire,
the masks usually won't deploy, so as not

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.010
to make the fire worse with the extra oxygen.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.490
This brings us to the question of why the
plastic bag on the breathing apparatus won't

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.400
necessarily inflate as you're using the device.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.200
More than just cosmetic, the bags serve as
something of a reservoir for oxygen.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.230
If you aren't taking a breath at all (and
have a good seal with the mask tight against

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.830
your face) the bag keeps the precious, continuously
flowing oxygen from escaping into the thin

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.930
air around you, enabling more of the collected
oxygen to be taken in when you do take a breath.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.960
When this is happening, or you are breathing
out with the valves on the mask releasing

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.120
much of the used air, the bag may begin to
inflate as oxygen collects.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.130
When you breathe in, it will deflate.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.460
So why won't it always inflate at least a
little to show its working?

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.290
To begin with, you may not have a great seal
with the mask on your face, particularly if

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.290
you have facial hair.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.530
This will allow any produced oxygen (and air
you exhale) to more readily escape.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.280
(As long as the mask is reasonably secure
on your face, this should still provide you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.040
with sufficient oxygen to get by on as long
as the plane isn't flying above 40,000 feet

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.290
and the pilot does his or her job and gets
the plane down below 10,000 feet as rapidly

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.630
as safely possible.)

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.420
Even if you have a good seal, however, the
rate at which the oxygen is generated is often

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.160
not enough to fully inflate the masks' bag
before you take deep, potentially panicky

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.400
breaths, deflating it.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.880
This is simply because the oxygen generation
isn't on-demand (for the passengers anyway),

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.570
but simply a continuous-flow production of
oxygen.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.680
Despite the potentially slow production, the
chemical oxygen generators do provide oxygen

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.490
at a sufficient rate to sustain passengers,
generally designed such that peak oxygen production

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.890
occurs right away (when the plane may be at
very high altitude) with the oxygen production

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.500
rates tailing off over the course of approximately
12-20 minutes before the system burns itself

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500
out.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.791
This should be long enough for the pilots
to get the plane low enough so that the air

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.790
pressure is high enough for (relatively) normal
atmospheric breathing.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.790
And if you've ever been lucky enough to be
in this sort of situation, you know that those

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.790
pilots can get the plane from altitudes like
35,000+ feet to safer atmospheric levels alarmingly

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.790
quickly in an emergency; while it may not
be literally true, it at least can seem like

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.790
roller coasters have nothing on them, which
is a good thing in this case.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.790
Bonus Fact:

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.790
As a result of the way the system works for
pressurizing the airplane cabin and keeping

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.340
a steady supply of fresh air, the humidity
levels are ultra-low, making it so you dehydrate

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.400
very quickly on flights.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.700
Particularly for long flights, it's critical
then that you drink plenty of fluids.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.210
This ultra-low humidity level, combined with
the low cabin pressure, also reduces your

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.950
sense of taste and smell by as much as 30%,
which is why airline food generally tastes

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.950
so bland.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.740
To try to compensate for this somewhat, many
airlines make sure their food is much more

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.810
strongly flavored or spiced than you'd normally
find appetizing.
