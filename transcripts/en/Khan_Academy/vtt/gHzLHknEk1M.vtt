00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:01.518
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:05.736
is explore taking the derivatives
of exponential functions.

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:08.805
So we've already seen that the derivative

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:12.634
with respect to x of e to the x

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:14.664
is equal to e to x,

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.557
which is a pretty amazing thing.

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:19.491
One of the many things that
makes e somewhat special.

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.194
Though when you have an exponential

00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:23.127
with your base right over here as e,

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.494
the derivative of it,
the slope at any point,

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:29.980
is equal to the value
of that actual function.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.696
But now let's start exploring
when we have other bases.

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:37.193
Can we somehow figure out
what is the derivative,

00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:39.739
what is the derivative with respect to x

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.546
when we have a to the x,
where a could be any number?

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:46.513
Is there some way to figure this out?

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:50.011
And maybe using our
knowledge that the derivative

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.307
of e to the x, is e to the x.

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:55.091
Well can we somehow use
a little bit of algebra

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:57.350
and exponent properties to rewrite this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.419
so it does look like
something with e as a base?

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:04.475
Well, you could view a,

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:08.975
you could view a as being equal to e.

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:10.133
Let me write it this way.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.181
Well all right, a as being equal to e

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:16.493
to the natural log of a.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.417
Now if this isn't obvious to you,

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.006
I really want you to think about it.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.350
What is the natural log of a?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.466
The natural log of a is the power you need

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.973
to raise e to, to get to a.

00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:34.591
So if you actually raise e to that power,

00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:36.660
if you raise e to the power you need

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.636
to raise e too to get to a.

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:41.069
Well then you're just going to get to a.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.055
So really think about this.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:46.112
Don't just accept this as a leap of faith.

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:47.476
It should make sense to you.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:50.832
And it just comes out of
really what a logarithm is.

00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:55.272
And so we can replace a with
this whole expression here.

00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:59.138
If a is the same thing as
e to the natural log of a,

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:01.998
well then this is going to be,

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:06.411
then this is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.449
with respect to x

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.616
of e to the natural log,

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:16.210
I keep writing la (laughs),

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.368
to the natural log of a

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:22.427
and then we're going to
raise that to the xth power.

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:25.075
We're going to raise that to the x power.

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:27.188
And now this, just using
our exponent properties,

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.884
this is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:31.884
with respect to x of,

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.691
and I'll just keep color-coding it.

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:36.307
If I raise something to an exponent

00:02:36.307 --> 00:02:37.605
and then raise that to an exponent,

00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:39.407
that's the same thing as
raising our original base

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:40.870
to the product of those exponents.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.745
That's just a basic exponent property.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:44.891
So that's going to be the same thing as e

00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:48.435
to the natural log of a,

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:53.250
natural log of a times x power.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.833
Times x power.

00:02:56.803 --> 00:02:59.205
And now we can use the chain rule

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:01.538
to evaluate this derivative.

00:03:02.512 --> 00:03:05.201
So what we will do is

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.368
we will first take the derivative
of the outside function.

00:03:10.772 --> 00:03:14.709
So e to the natural log of a times x

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.108
with respect to the inside function,

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:21.375
with respect to natural log of a times x.

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:24.028
And so, this is going to be equal to e

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:28.769
to the natural log of a times x.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.692
And then we take the derivative
of that inside function

00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:33.506
with respect to x.

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:34.655
Well natural log of a,

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:36.470
it might not immediately jump out to you,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.264
but that's just going to be a number.

00:03:38.264 --> 00:03:39.855
So that's just going to be,

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:41.411
so times the derivative.

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.109
If it was the derivative of
three x, it would just be three.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.491
If it's the derivative
of natural log a times x,

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:49.957
it's just going to be natural log of a.

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:52.524
And so this is going to give us

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:56.922
the natural log of a times e

00:03:56.922 --> 00:03:59.825
to the natural log of a.

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:01.363
And I'm going to write it like this.

00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:04.640
Natural log of a to the x power.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.057
Well we've already seen this.

00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.393
This right over here is just a.

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.300
So it all simplifies.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.576
It all simplifies to the natural log of a

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:21.847
times a to the x,

00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:23.275
which is a pretty neat result.

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:25.360
So if you're taking the
derivative of e to the x,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.028
it's just going to be e to the x.

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:30.984
If you're taking the
derivative of a to the x,

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:34.668
it's just going to be the natural
log of a times a to the x.

00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:36.644
And so we can now use this result

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:40.307
to actually take the
derivatives of these types

00:04:40.307 --> 00:04:43.344
of expressions with bases other than e.

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:46.407
So if I want to find the derivative

00:04:46.407 --> 00:04:48.499
with respect to x

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.860
of eight times three to the x power,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.504
well what's that going to be?

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:57.265
Well that's just going to be eight times

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:00.048
and then the derivative
of this right over here

00:05:00.048 --> 00:05:03.198
is going to be, based on what we just saw,

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:05.678
it's going to be the
natural log of our base,

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:09.949
natural log of three times three to the x.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.004
Times three to the x.

00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:15.099
So it's equal to eight natural log

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.599
of three times three to the x.

00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:23.201
Times three to the x power.
