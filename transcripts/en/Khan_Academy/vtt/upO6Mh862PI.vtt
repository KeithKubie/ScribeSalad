00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.980
I received a suggestion that I
do actual old AP exam problems,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.550
and I looked on the internet
and lo and behold, on the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.640
college board site, if you go
to collegeboard.com, you can

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.380
actually get-- I couldn't find
the actual multiple choice

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.760
questions, but you can find the
free response questions, and so

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.790
this question is actually the
first free response question

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.060
that they have on the calculus
BC that was administered

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.620
just recently in 2008.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.990
So let's do this problem.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.140
And frankly, if you understand
how to do all of the free

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.200
response questions, you
probably will do fairly well on

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.840
the multiple choice, because
the free response tend to be a

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.980
little bit more challenging,
especially the last parts

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.260
of the free response.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.110
Well anyway, let's do this one.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.205
So I'll just read it out,
because I don't want to write

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.300
it out all here, but this
is the actual diagram.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.250
I actually copied and pasted
this from the PDF that they

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.360
provide on collegeboard.com.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.630
So it says, let r-- this is r--
be the region bounded by the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.390
graphs of y equals
sine pi of x.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.850
So let me write that down.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:09.116
So this top graph is y
is equal to sine pi x.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.060
and then the bottom graph is y
is equal to x cubed minus 4x.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.320
And how did I know that
this was the bottom one?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.780
Well I knew that this one
was sine of pi x, right?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.840
Because sine looks like this.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.910
It doesn't look
like that, right?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.280
When you go sine of pi
is 0, sine of 0 is

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.380
0, sine of 2pi is 0.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.760
So we do this as sine of pi x.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.600
Well anyway, they want-- so
this is the region between

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.110
these two functions and part A
of this-- and this is kind of

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.890
the softball question, just to
make sure that you know how to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.040
do definite integrals-- and
it says, find the area of r.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.890
So how do we do that?

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.800
I think you know that we're
going to do a little definite

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.290
integration, so let's do that.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.780
So then we're going to take the
definite integral, so let's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.280
just say the area is equal to--
I don't know if that's-- I hope

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.140
I'm writing big enough for
you-- the area is going to be

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.960
equal to the definite
integral from.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.150
So what are the x values?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.266
We're going to be going
from x is equal to 0

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.540
to x is equal to 2.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.330
And what's this?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.510
At any given point value of x,
what is kind of going to be the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.990
high-- when we're taking the
area, we're taking a bunch of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.850
rectangles that are
of dx width, right?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.900
So that's-- that's not dark
enough, I don't think that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.750
you can see that-- so that's
one of my rectangles.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.890
Whoops.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.730
Let's say that's one of my
rectangles right here that

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.070
I'm going to be summing up.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.110
Its width is dx.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.220
What's its height?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.440
Its height is going to be
this top function minus

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.340
this bottom function.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.240
So, essentially, we're going to
take the sum of all of these

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.710
rectangles, so its height is
going to be-- let me switch

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.670
colors arbitrarily-- the height
is going to be the top function

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.500
minus the bottom function.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:35.060
So sine of pi x-- parentheses
here-- minus the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.720
bottom function.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.250
So minus x cubed plus 4x.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.270
Since I'm subtracting, I
switched both of these signs.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.010
And all of that times the width
of each of these little

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.670
rectangles-- which is
infinitely small-- dx.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.810
And we're going to sum them
all up from x is equal

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.510
to 0 to x is equal to 2.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.610
This should be fairly
straightforward for you.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.850
So how do we evaluate this?

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.080
Well, we essentially take the
antiderivative of this and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.870
then evaluate that at 2
and then evaluate at 0.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.590
What's the antiderivative
of sine of pi x?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.900
Well, what functions
derivative is sine of x.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.100
Cosine of x-- let's see.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.420
If I were to take the
derivative of cosine-- let's

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.960
say I took the derivative
of cosine pi x.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.090
This should be reasonably
familiar to you.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.590
Cosine of pi x, if I were
to take the derivative

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.200
of it, what do I get?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.320
That equals pi.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.980
You take the derivative
of the inside, right?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.120
By the chain rule.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.130
So it's pi times the derivative
of the whole thing.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.230
The derivative of cosine of x
is minus sine of x, so the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:54.440
derivative to this is going to
be times minus sine of pi x, or

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.080
you could say that equals
minus pi sine of pi x.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.810
So the derivative of cosine of
pi x is almost this, it just

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.270
has that minus pi there, right?

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.150
So let's see if we can rewrite
this so it looks just like the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.440
derivative of cosine pi x.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.690
And I'll switch to magenta.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.400
I want to make sure I
have enough space to do

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.225
this entire problem.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:36.880
So let's write a minus 1
over pi times a minus pi.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.020
All I did, when you evaluate
this, this equals 1, so I can

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:48.100
do this times sine pi x, and
then that's minus x to the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.370
third plus 4x, and then all
of that times the width dx.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.200
Well now we have it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.810
We know that the antiderivative
of this is cosine pi x, right?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.910
And this is just
a constant term.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.370
So what's the antiderivative
of this whole thing?

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.780
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors again.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.070
The antiderivative
is cosine pi x.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.620
So we have minus 1 over pi
cosine pi x-- remember, I could

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.320
just carry this over, this is
just a constant term-- this

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.590
antiderivative is
this right here.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.330
And then these are a little
bit more straightforward.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.770
So minus the antiderivative of
x to the third is x to the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:41.300
fourth over 4 plus the
antiderivative of this is 4x

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.250
squared over 2, or you could
just view that as 2x squared,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.620
and then we're going to
evaluate that at 2 and at

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.260
0, and let's do that.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:03.510
So this is equal to cosine of
2pi, and we'll have a minus

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.930
sign out here, so minus cosine
of 2pi over pi, minus-- what's

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.680
2 to the fourth power?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.960
Let's see.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.170
2 to the third is 8, 2 the
fourth is 16, 16 over 4 is 4,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:26.750
so it's minus 4, 2 squared is
4 times 2 is 8, so plus 8, so

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.020
that's the antiderivative
evaluated at 2, and now let's

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.460
subtract it evaluated at 0.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:46.470
So this will be minus cosine of
0 over pi-- all right, that's

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.630
that evaluated at 0--
minus 0, plus 0.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.540
So these terms don't
contribute anything when

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.880
you evaluate them at 0.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.250
And so what do we get?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.620
What's cosine of 2pi?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.110
Cosine of 2pi is the
same thing as cosine

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.090
of 0, and it equals 1.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.490
What is the x value of the
unit circle at 2pi, or at 0?

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.070
It's equal to 1.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:15.670
So this equals minus 1 over pi
minus 4 plus 8, and so this

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.900
minus minus, those both become
pluses, cosine of 0 is also 1,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.840
so plus 1 over pi, and so this
minus 1 over pi and this plus 1

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.570
over pi will cancel out, and
all we're left with is minus 4

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.210
plus 8 and that is equal to 4.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:42.830
So that is part one, part A of
number one, on the 2008 DC

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.920
free response questions.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.090
It actually took me a whole
video just to do that part.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.550
In the next video, I'll do part
B, and we'll just keep doing

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.115
this, and I'll try to do a
couple of these every day.

00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:52.690
See you soon.
