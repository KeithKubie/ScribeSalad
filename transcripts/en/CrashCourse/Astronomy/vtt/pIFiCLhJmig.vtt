00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.640
We have one star in the solar system: the
Sun. Sure, it has lots of planets, moons,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.030
asteroids, and comets it shleps with it as
it moves through space, but no other STAR

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.080
is part of our family. The Sun is alone.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.820
Based on that, you might naturally think that,
like the Sun, stars are single, too. They

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.250
sure look that way by eye.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.800
But when you point a telescope at the sky,
you find that this is NOT the case. A lot

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.220
of stars travel the Universe with companions…
and sometimes more than one.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.480
With so many stars in the sky, some appear
close together just by coincidence, even though

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.399
in space they’re actually very far apart.
We call these “optical double stars”.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.660
By the 18th century astronomers were starting
to recognize that many stars that appeared

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.050
close together really WERE physically orbiting
each other. We call these BINARY stars, to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.750
distinguish them from the coincidentally close
together DOUBLE stars. Although the numbers

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.220
are a little bit uncertain, something like
a third to a half of all stars in the sky

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.100
are part of a binary or multiple star system.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.310
One such binary system is visible to the naked
eye, and has been known for thousands of years.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.330
You may have seen it yourself! The star marking
the kink in the handle of the Big Dipper is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.140
actually two stars, one called Mizar, and
a fainter one called Alcor. They’re close

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.990
enough together that you need decent eyesight
to separate them, and they were actually used

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.299
as an eye test in ancient times.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.189
Binary stars almost certainly form together,
near each other in the gas cloud that was

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.470
their original stellar nursery. Instead of
a single clump collapsing and forming a star,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.229
like our Sun, there are two such dense lumps, and
they both collect material until they become true stars.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.259
There are lots of different kinds of binary
stars. If the two stars can be seen separately

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.470
using a telescope they’re called a VISUAL
BINARY. This is kind of a fluid classification;

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.020
as telescopes get better stars that are closer
together can be resolved.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.159
These kinds of stars are fairly common; the
brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, is

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.540
a visual binary. It’s a luminous blue star
about twice the mass of the Sun orbited by

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.790
a smaller, much fainter white dwarf. It’s
funny, too: as I mentioned in an earlier episode,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.670
white dwarfs can be very hot and energetic,
and emit light at much higher energy than

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.000
normal stars. When you observe Sirius with
an X-ray telescope, the white dwarf is by

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.840
far the brighter of the two!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.620
Visual binaries are important, because, if
you observe them long enough you might be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.520
able to see their orbital motion. If we can
measure their distance from Earth then the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.800
actual size and shape of their orbits can
be determined, and in turn — using the math

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.030
and physics of gravity —this can be used
to find the masses of the stars; the only

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.209
way we know to get accurate measurements of
stellar masses is when they’re in binaries.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.349
And once we know the masses of the stars,
as we saw in Episode 26, we can learn everything

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.390
else about them: How big they are, how brightly
they shine, and even how long they live. It’s

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.250
no exaggeration to say that observing binary
stars opened up the new scientific field of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.060
astroPHYSICS, applying physics to astronomy…
and that led to us understanding everything

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.940
we do about the Universe today.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.800
Not bad.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
Not all binaries are visual binaries, though.
Some stars orbit so closely together that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840
we can’t split them even with our biggest
telescopes. So how do we know they’re binary?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.629
Spectroscopy! As the two stars orbit each
other, over time one will appear to be heading

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.129
toward us while the other circles away, and
vice versa as they switch sides. While we

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.560
may not see that motion directly, if we take
spectra of their light, breaking it up into

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.170
individual narrow colors, we can see the Doppler
shift in their spectra. On their merry—go-round

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.890
path, one undergoes a redshift as it moves
away, and the other has a blue shift as it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.280
moves toward us. These kinds of stars are
called SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.860
Remember Mizar and Alcor, the Big Dipper eye
test stars? I said they were a binary system,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.940
but I lied. Well, I understated. In even a
small telescope you can see that Mizar is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.540
actually a visual binary… but it turns out
that both of those two stars making up Mizar

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.620
are actually SPECTROSCOPIC binaries, too.
Mizar is a binary binary star! Even better:

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.730
Alcor is a spectroscopic binary, too! Since
Mizar and Alcor orbit each other, it turns

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.019
out they make up a sextuple star system, SIX
stars all gravitationally bound to one another.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.549
Obviously, stars can be in bigger groups than
binaries. There are triple star systems, quadruple,

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.240
and more. Polaris, the north star, is actually
a pentuple system, composed of five stars.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.349
It’s possible lots of stars are born in
multiple systems. However, it’s pretty hard

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.909
to get a stable system like that; if the orbits
aren’t just right some of the stars will

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.550
tend to get ejected from the system. What
we see today are the ones that, coincidentally,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.689
got things just right. Even then, they may
not be stable in the long run.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.610
Was the Sun born in such a multiple system?
We don’t really know. It’s certainly possible,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.020
and one way to find out would be to look for
stars that have a very similar elemental composition

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.409
as the Sun. But the Sun was born billions
of years ago; plenty of time for any stars

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:03.419
born with it to wander off. Even at relatively
slow speeds, 4.5 billion years is a long time,

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.939
and for all we know they could be 50,000 light
years away and completely invisible to us.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.189
If there are long lost siblings to the Sun
out there, they may remain lost.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.800
Just like planets orbiting the Sun, binary
star orbits can be short, or very long. Some

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.889
stars, separated by tens or hundreds of billions
of kilometers, can take centuries to orbit

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.259
each other, while some are so close they may
only take days. One binary star, the most

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:33.649
bizarre I know of, is called 4U 1820-30, and
it’s composed of a neutron star and a white

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.619
dwarf. Their gravity is so strong, and they
are so close together, that they orbit each

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:44.029
other in 685 seconds… 11.4 minutes… roughly,
the length of this episode.

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.270
Like exoplanets, binary star orbits are tipped
every which-way to our line of sight from

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.770
Earth. But for some of them, we see their
orbits edge-on, or very nearly so. For these

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.429
binaries that means that every orbit we see
each of these stars pass in front of the other,

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.349
blocking it from our view. We call these ECLIPSING
binaries.

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.419
Eclipsing binaries are interesting, because
as one star blocks another, the total light

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.129
we see from the system dips, just like in
a solar eclipse when the Moon blocks the Sun.

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.569
Over the course of one orbit we see TWO such
dips, as the first star blocks the second

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.789
and then half an orbit later when the second
passes in front of the first.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.399
If the two stars are similar, say both like
the Sun, then the two dips look very similar.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.509
But if one star is much brighter than the
other, then the two dips look very different.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.779
The brighter star dominates the total light
we see, so when the fainter star goes behind

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.529
the brighter star, the light hardly drops
at all. But when that fainter star blocks

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.399
the brighter one, we see a bigger dip in the
light.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:42.509
By carefully examining the sizes and shapes
of the dips this way, a lot of interesting

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.569
information can be gleaned from the system,
including the sizes, masses, rotation rates,

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.209
temperatures of the stars, the size and shape
of the orbit, and even the distance to the system.

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:58.800
Some stars, like humans, enjoy cuddling. They
get so close together they become CONTACT

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.879
binaries, literally two stars touching each
other. These are very strange objects. The

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:09.079
stars can be stretched out into teardrop shapes
due to the mutual tidal effects. If they get very close

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.980
together they merge into a double-lobed stellar peanut
shape, like two stars cocooned in shared material.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.740
This can make things really weird for them.
Imagine two stars born at the same time, perhaps

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.789
a few millions kilometers apart, tightly orbiting
each other. One has, say, five times the mass

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.839
of the Sun (so it’s a hot blue star), and
the other just one half (so it’s a red dwarf).

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.939
The red dwarf doesn’t do much. It just slowly
fuses hydrogen into helium, glowing feebly.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:38.830
The bigger star, though, goes through its
nuclear fuel rapidly, and becomes a red giant.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.509
It blows off a wind of matter and loses mass.
Since the stars’ gravity depends on their

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.459
masses, as the big star loses mass the orbits
get a little wonky, becoming more elliptical.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:54.339
But when the massive star swells, it gets
so big the two become a contact binary. A

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:58.749
lot of the material leaving the higher mass
star gets dumped on the red dwarf, which starts

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:03.550
to grow. Eventually, the big star loses most
of its mass and becomes a white dwarf, while

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.939
what USED to be the lower mass star has grown,
and now might be more massive than the other

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:12.739
star! It’s a bit like Robin Hood taking
from the rich and giving to the poor; if he

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:17.149
gets too enthusiastic about it then the poor
become rich while the rich become poor.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:21.520
When we look at that binary system, we see
a white dwarf star that is clearly more evolved

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.069
than a high mass one, the opposite of what
we expect! This is called the Algol Paradox,

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.409
after the contact binary star Algol in Perseus
which shows this effect.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:35.279
Mass transfer between two stars can yield
even more dramatic results. Imagine this same

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.289
system a couple of billion years later. The
high mass star has lost its outer layers,

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.789
and is a dense white dwarf. The other star
eventually runs out of hydrogen fuel, and

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.149
swells into a red giant. This material then
flows onto the white dwarf.

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:52.500
White dwarfs have cruelly strong gravity.
If the hydrogen flowing onto its surface piles

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.459
up enough, the gravity can squeeze it so hard
it fuses into helium. If the flow rate is

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:02.339
just right, it piles up on the white dwarf
and then undergoes fusion in a single colossal

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:07.720
flash, erupting in a huge explosive flare.
Some of these explosions can be incredibly

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.690
violent, tens of thousands of times brighter
than the Sun!

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.940
When this happens, a previously invisible
star can suddenly flare into visibility in

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.810
the sky. These have been seen historically,
and called “Stellar novae”, for “new

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.220
star”. I love the irony: These stars actually
have to be old, near the ends of their lives

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.000
to go nova! But the name stuck.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.370
The explosion can blow out the stream of matter
falling from the other star, but when things

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.839
settle down after a few weeks or month, the
matter stream can fall back on the white dwarf,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.639
and the whole cycle repeats. These are called
recurrent novae.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:41.350
If the matter stream is slower, the material
can fuse steadily, never piling up, so it

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.310
never explodes. However, the mass of the white
dwarf still increases. If it reaches a mass

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.440
of around 1.4 times that of the Sun, it gets
compressed by its own gravity so much that

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.480
its temperature soars upward. It gets so hot
that carbon fusion initiates.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.019
And that a big problem. In a normal star,
it would just expand due to all the extra

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:05.680
energy being generated. But a white dwarf
can’t; it’s ruled by electron degeneracy

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.550
pressure. The extra energy just goes into
fusing more carbon, and what you get is a

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.180
runaway thermonuclear event: All the carbon
EVERYWHERE INSIDE THE WHITE DWARF FUSES ALL

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.620
AT ONCE. ALL of it.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.709
Basically a solar mass of carbon will instantly
fuse, releasing all that energy all at once.

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:29.250
It’s like setting fire to a dynamite factory.
The star explodes.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.300
You get a SUPERnova. And it’s a completely
different process than what we saw when a

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.560
high-mass star explodes, but coincidentally
it releases about the same amount of energy.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.160
The star tears itself to vapor, and gets so bright it can
be seen literally most of the way across the Universe.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:49.339
Ooh, this makes them very, very important
indeed… as you’ll see in a future episode.

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:53.269
Today you learned double stars are stars that
appear to be near each other in the sky, but

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:57.689
if they’re gravitationally bound together
we call them binary stars. Many stars are

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:01.889
actually part of binary or multiple systems.
If they are close enough together they can

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:07.540
actually touch other, merging into one peanut-shaped
star. In some close binaries matter can flow

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.259
from one star to the other, changing the way
it ages. If one star is a white dwarf, this

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:17.540
can cause periodic explosions, and possibly
even lead to blowing up the entire star.
