00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.163
Before he turned physics upside down,

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:15.849
a young Albert Einstein supposedly
showed off his genius

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.952
by devising a complex riddle involving
this list of clues.

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:24.105
Can you resist tackling a brain teaser

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.123
written by one of the smartest 
people in history?

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:28.596
Let's give it a shot.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:32.676
The world's rarest fish has been
stolen from the city aquarium.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:38.786
The police have followed the scent to a
street with five identical looking houses.

00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:41.291
But they can't search 
all the houses at once,

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.244
and if they pick the wrong one,
the thief will know they're on his trail.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:50.189
It's up to you, the city's best detective,
to solve the case.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.491
When you arrive on the scene,
the police tell you what they know.

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.131
One:

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:58.215
each house's owner 
is of a different nationality,

00:00:58.215 --> 00:00:59.716
drinks a different beverage,

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:02.709
and smokes a different type of cigar.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:03.568
Two:

00:01:03.568 --> 00:01:08.060
each house's interior walls
are painted a different color.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.933
Three:

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:14.607
each house contains a different animal,
one of which is the fish.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:18.428
After a few hours of expert sleuthing,
you gather some clues.

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:20.546
It may look like a lot of information,

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.597
but there's a clear logical path
to the solution.

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:26.203
Solving the puzzle will be
a lot like Sudoku,

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:32.668
so you may find it helpful to organize
your information in a grid, like this.

00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:36.415
Pause the video on the following screen to
examine your clues and solve the riddle.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.115
Answer in: 3

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.146
2

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:42.307
1

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:47.024
To start, you fill in the information
from clues eight and nine.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:51.455
Immediately, you also realize that since
the Norwegian is at the end of the street,

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.639
there's only one house next to him,

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:57.383
which must be the one with the blue walls
in clue fourteen.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.695
Clue five says the green-walled
house's owner drinks coffee.

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:06.215
It can't be the center house since you
already know its owner drinks milk,

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:11.211
but it also can't be the second house,
which you know has blue walls.

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:12.561
And since clue four says

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.823
the green-walled house must be directly
to the left of the white-walled one,

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:20.077
it can't be the first 
or fifth house either.

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.707
The only place left 
for the green-walled house

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:25.694
with the coffee drinker
is the fourth spot,

00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:28.841
meaning the white-walled house
is the fifth.

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.884
Clue one gives you 
a nationality and a color.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:35.539
Since the only column missing both
these values is the center one,

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.923
this must be the Brit's red-walled home.

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:41.964
Now that the only unassigned 
wall color is yellow,

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:44.467
this must be applied to the first house,

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.455
where clue seven says 
the Dunhill smoker lives.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:51.663
And clue eleven tells you that
the owner of the horse is next door,

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:55.002
which can only be the second house.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:59.651
The next step is to figure out what
the Norwegian in the first house drinks.

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.015
It can't be tea, clue three tells you
that's the Dane.

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:08.674
As per clue twelve, it can't be root beer
since that person smokes Bluemaster,

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.370
and since you already 
assigned milk and coffee,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.167
it must be water.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:14.456
From clue fifteen,

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:18.076
you know that the Norwegian's neighbor,
who can only be in the second house,

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:20.170
smokes Blends.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.124
Now that the only spot in the grid
without a cigar and a drink

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:24.600
is in the fifth column,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.908
that must be the home of the person
in clue twelve.

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:31.403
And since this leaves only the second
house without a drink,

00:03:31.403 --> 00:03:35.615
the tea-drinking Dane must live there.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:40.686
The fourth house is now the only one
missing a nationality and a cigar brand,

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:45.181
so the Prince-smoking German
from clue thirteen must live there.

00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.623
Through elimination, you can conclude
that the Brit smokes Pall Mall

00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:51.470
and the Swede lives in the fifth house,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.684
while clue six and clue two tell you

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:57.807
that these two have a bird 
and a dog, respectively.

00:03:57.807 --> 00:04:01.974
Clue ten tells you that the cat owner
lives next to the Blend-smoking Dane,

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:05.440
putting him in the first house.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.658
Now with only one spot left on the grid,

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:11.750
you know that the German in the 
green-walled house must be the culprit.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.695
You and the police burst into the house,

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.783
catching the thief fish-handed.

00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:18.933
While that explanation 
was straightforward,

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:23.749
solving puzzles like this often
involves false starts and dead ends.

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.479
Part of the trick is to use 
the process of elimination

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.505
and lots of trial and error
to hone in on the right pieces,

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.359
and the more logic puzzles you solve,

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:34.211
the better your intuition will be

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:39.035
for when and where there's enough 
information to make your deductions.

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.238
And did young Einstein 
really write this puzzle?

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:43.678
Probably not.

00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:44.988
There's no evidence he did,

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:47.784
and some of the brands mentioned
are too recent.

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:49.460
But the logic here is not so different

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.181
from what you'd use to solve equations
with multiple variables,

00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:55.782
even those describing 
the nature of the universe.
