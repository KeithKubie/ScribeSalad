00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.636
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Wow, look at
all these brave volunteers.

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:02.886
Go ahead!

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:04.376
&gt;&gt;Student: "C"

00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:06.296
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Yes!

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:06.826
Nice job.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.056
&gt;&gt;Valerie: So, the impact
of differentiation,

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.446
the students feel successful.

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:11.806
They feel supported.

00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:13.826
They know if something is difficult

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.626
for them there's something
that's a little more in line

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.586
with their strengths coming up soon.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:22.156
So, it really makes education
fun and approachable.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.746
I really think it's the most effective
way that I have seen to teach.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:26.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yay!

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:37.276
&gt;&gt;Jane: The vision and the
mission of Highlander is

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:41.866
to use innovative practice
as a social catalyst.

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:43.406
We want our kids to be able

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:46.476
to do anything any other kid
from Providence could do.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:50.576
&gt;&gt;Valerie: We use differentiation all
across the curriculum here at Highlander

00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:52.256
and especially in the first grade.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.506
Although the content is the same,
having the stations really allows me

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:59.946
to tailor my lessons to each
individual group of learners.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.656
So, how the differentiation
looks in my classroom,

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:05.976
we start off with a whole group lesson.

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:08.436
&gt;&gt;Valerie: So, let's get
our reading classes on.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:13.036
Let's get the letter part
of our brains activated.

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:13.916
&gt;&gt;Valerie: This section

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.826
of our curriculum we have been
looking at non-fiction texts.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.256
&gt;&gt;Valerie: When we're looking at our
book today we're going to be thinking

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:23.896
about where we can get information.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:27.736
&gt;&gt;Valerie: And then in the phonics
realm we focused on contractions.

00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:31.346
&gt;&gt;Valerie: We're talking two words and
what are we sticking them together with?

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:32.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Apostrophe!

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:33.556
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Yes, Karen!

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:33.976
Good job.

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.136
&gt;&gt;Valerie: And then we break
off into our small groups.

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:41.206
So, our yellow group is still learning
how to do a lot of our literacy things.

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:45.176
The green group is doing pretty well,
but has a few things to work on still.

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:48.596
And our blue group is hitting
all the first-grade standards

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.886
and needs to be stretched.

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:53.886
So, our differentiation
kind of takes two forms:

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:59.386
The first is by student grouping and
the second is by modality of learning.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:04.316
We have twenty minutes per station
and there are three of the stations.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:08.276
The students will rotate through
all three stations each day.

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:12.866
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: So, our first station for
the blue group is the computer station.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.196
&gt;&gt;Valerie: The students use
a Google form to check in.

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.606
They'll normally watch a video
or carefully observe a photograph

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:21.726
and answer some questions about that.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:25.576
&gt;&gt;Jamarie: We watched a video
about how to grow a seed.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:29.816
We had to type in our
favorite part and why.

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:34.166
&gt;&gt;Valerie: After they finish that
form, they can check out an e-book.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.666
&gt;&gt;Jamarie: And then you could
do this game of reading called

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.066
"Teach a Monster How to Read."

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:43.616
&gt;&gt;Valerie: We're delivering things in
a way that is visual, that is auditory,

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:47.156
that is individual to the
students through the technology.

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.076
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: After that
she rings the bell.

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:52.406
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Clean-up, switch
up, first grade readers.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:54.546
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: We switch
to the sort station.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:58.916
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Our sort station is
more of a physical modality.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:02.236
They're using their bodies, which
is so important for first graders.

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:03.176
They need to move.

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.726
Kids are cutting out the words,
they're gluing them down.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.436
&gt;&gt;Jamarie: We had a contraction game.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:15.156
It's fun, because it's all mixed up
and you have to find the right pieces.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.276
And then after we do that,
we do rainbow writing.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.346
&gt;&gt;Valerie: That's another
way that we differentiate.

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.896
If students are able to
get through more work,

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:26.326
then they have some freedom of choice.

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:28.866
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Clean up, switch it up.

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.826
&gt;&gt;Valerie: The last station
we're talking to each other

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:33.376
and learning from each other.

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.936
So, that's more of the social
interaction-type of modality.

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:41.286
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: I like the teacher
station the most, because we get to be

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:45.196
with Miss Gallagher and we
get to learn cool stuff.

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:48.186
&gt;&gt;Valerie: So, take a look at
the illustrations on this page.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:48.436
Right?

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.036
&gt;&gt;Valerie: The content is the same,

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:53.586
but it can be differentiated
in a number of ways.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:56.566
My blue group, for example,
they know what text is.

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:58.106
They know what illustrations are.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.766
And, so, for them I create
a Venn diagram.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.756
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: You need to
make one circle like this

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:06.696
and then you make another
circle overlapping that.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:07.486
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Oh!

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:09.566
&gt;&gt;Valerie: For the yellow
or the green group,

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.086
I'm just leaving the
Venn diagram out of it.

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.276
We're still doing essentially
the same thing.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:17.676
But just that piece that might be
confusing to some of those students,

00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:20.166
I just leave that out for a later time.

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:20.846
They'll get to it.

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:22.856
&gt;&gt;Valerie: All right,
so, clean up and meet me

00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:24.536
in the middle of the rug for writing.

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:26.776
Nice work, first grade.

00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:30.626
&gt;&gt;Jane: Being able to move through
those stations it's just another level

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:34.246
of helping the students learn
as much as they can each year.

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:37.576
They really feel excited
when they make that growth.

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.406
&gt;&gt;Valerie: They're proud of themselves.

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:42.116
They feel like they're
effective learners.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:46.826
As a teacher, honestly, it is a lot
of work but the results that you see

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.776
in the happy faces of the kids
and the good feeling that you have

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.306
in the classroom is worth it.
