00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; Automated: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So,
good afternoon everyone,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.530
and welcome to the African
and Middle East division.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.080
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of
the division, and I'm delighted

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.180
to see you, so many of you
here today for the presentation

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050 position:56%
that will surely, surely thrill you.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.010
It is by Toyin Falola, a man who,
in his writings and in his talks,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.980
challenges our preconceptions,
who let's us look at the world,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.240
and at Africa in particular, from
new and exciting perspective.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.380
Dr. Angel Batiste will introduce
him more fully in a moment,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.100
but I feel I must first
say a few things about him.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.790
I actually met him here at
the library several years ago

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.740
when he first became a member of
the board of the Scholars Council

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280
at the Kluge Center,
which at the time was

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.280
under Dr. Carolyn Brown,
who is with us today.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.060
And so we had a couple of
very interesting discussions,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.220
and then one day, a couple of years
later, he called out of the blue

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.450
and suggested that I
present my candidacy

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.600
to the African Studies
Association Board, as I had worked

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.950
for many years on North Africa.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.440
I did, and was very
honored when I was elected

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.080
by the members of the ASC, ASC.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.830
I then attended two of the
board's weekend meetings

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.030
and watched how Professor
Falola deftly

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.160
and diplomatically
guided his proceedings,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.010
highlighted important issues,
advised on important matters,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.380
suggest the speakers,
brought up new ideas.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.240
Why am I saying this?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.470
My point is that he is an -- not
only an extraordinary scholar,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.850
as you will hear in a moment,
but that his accomplishment range

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.310
in many, many fields, in many ways.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.790
He's a dreamer, a scholar,
a thinker,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.710
but he's also very man
-- a practical man.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.720
A man who knows where
things should be going.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.400
And so, not surprisingly, as
you will be invited to see in,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.630
after the talk, Dr. Batiste has
arranged a wonderful display

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.950
of Professor Falola's
works and works

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.640
about him in our conference room.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.500
So, not surprisingly, I found a
book which was dedicated to him,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.090
and the book speaks about
the man, the boss, the muse.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440
But if you look at the chapters,
Toyin Falola, a poet within

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.570
and without, chapter three, chapter
four, Toyin Falola, volcanic force,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.560
[inaudible] news, Toyin Falola,
the African historian and scholar,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.050
Toyin Falola, the master teacher,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.960
Toyin Falola in his
intellectual majesty,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.520 position:56%
Toyin Falola, a new Renaissance man.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.900
And it goes on chapter after
chapter, the recognition

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.330
of what he has contributed
to the field.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.130
So, but I will leave that
to Dr. Batiste, who told me,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.910
"Don't take my ideas this morning."

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.290
No. I said, "No, no.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.060
There's so much to be said."

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.250
But I want to say a few things

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.090
about our division before we
continue with the program.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.370 position:56%
Our division is very honored to have
Professor Falola speak to us today.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.120
But it's a division that is
responsible for countries

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.010
around the world, for 78
countries, to be exact.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.670
And for its literature,
politics, history, humanity,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.440
social sciences, sciences.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.260
We have collections that we hold
[inaudible] in the vernacular,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:38.150
collections from the Middle East,
Central Asia, the whole of Africa,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.840
North and South Saharan,
the Caucasus.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.540
We go -- we extend up to small
groups in China and we have --

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.240
and we have three sections, and
three sections with scholars,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.420
really, who are working and
who advise and help researchers

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.680
to bring their materials to them.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.110
The three sections are the Hebraic
section, the African section,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.890
and the Near East sections.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.320
And today, this program is
organized by the African section.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.740
And we don't only, you know,
provide the materials for research.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:26.020
We also try to display our
materials to attract people.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.320
We have exhibits.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.380
We have certainly exciting
programs, as the one today.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.040
We show films.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:41.760
And recently, after a
long administrative road

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.590
that we all took, we're now on the
social media and we have blogs,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.100 position:56%
and our staff writes blogs about the
collections, about our materials.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.020
We actually have Facebook.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.070
Finally, we moved into
the 21st century.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.540
And so but they focus,
again, on our collections,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.370
as a way of reaching out.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.310
So, you will have, on your
chair, you will find our ads

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.170

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.430
So, those, we announce
our programs there.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.660

You know, you should

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.070
And I have, again, yesterday,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:49.260
African Studies Association has
decided link up to us, and they --

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.930
not only do they like us.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.080
They actually posted
[inaudible] blog on [inaudible].

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.780
They announced Professor
Falola's talk, so that is going

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.640 position:56%
out to the African Studies community
all over, and so we're very excited

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.940
about that and we'd
like you to join us.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.150
I will stop now, but
I want to remind you

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.550
that we are videotaping this
program, as we videotape most

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:31.240 position:56%
of our programs, which means that
it will be accessible not only here,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.410
the talk, but around the world.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:41.460
And so, if when the
question-answer time comes,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.630
if you want to ask
questions, please remember

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.940
that you are being videotaped,
and asking questions means

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.720
that you've given us
permission to record you

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.420
and that your remarks
may be posted on the web.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.820
Okay? So, now, let me introduce

&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Thank you.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.210
I think those introductions
should serve as a lecture

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.320
so that we can begin
to ask questions.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:13.020
Thank you so much for your kindness
and I can only pray and wish

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.600
that I'm able to repay
that kindness.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.600
I have to follow sudden
combinations,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:33.070
some of which may be new to you,
which is that, any time I speak,

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:40.120
I must first exchange a
greetings from the kings

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.700
that I do represent each time
I do a public performance.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.910
And I'm representing
three kings here.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:55.400
First I must extend my greetings
to you [inaudible] who ask me

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.250
to extend this greetings to you.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.960
I have to deliver those messages.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:09.380
I'm very grateful to Mary,
to Angel, to Carolyn here.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.010
You wanted to come on -- she
wanted to come and do her research

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.600
and [inaudible] decided to stay.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.880
When she was a director of Kluge,
she asked me for a proposal,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.420
which I wrote on the
basis of which I'm here.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.890
And on December 15th, I
will be doing a conference

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.550
on African immigrant in the US.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:41.560
This is more publicity, and
I hope you all will come.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:47.180
Let me provide a small
context to this topic,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.280
and it's a [inaudible] context.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.800
Many of you may not be aware
that this is a tremendous moment

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.180
in Africa, with the creation of
so many private universities.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.220
Indeed, in a country like Nigeria,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.680
the number of private
universities is now more

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.060
than the number of public schools.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.500
And we have colleagues
who have the universities

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.020
of their own [inaudible] call
to me [inaudible] call to me,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.670
I will have been thinking of
establishing my own university.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:29.780
Because nobody saw this 30
years ago, where a colleague

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.730
in Seattle moved to Ghana to
establish his own university.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.640
And a good friend of mine,
when I was teaching [inaudible]

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.400
to establish his own university.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.830
What this has done is to let us
begin to rethink the inheritances

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:53.410
in various ways, and to use those
private universities to test a set

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.130
of new ideas and to see
things that don't walk.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.310
With private universities, can
rethink with [inaudible] outside

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.900 position:56%
of a [inaudible] state power
structure and outside of corruption.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.140
So, and as we are -- I'm
on the board of them,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.540 position:56%
some of these universities, in which
we have the opportunities to say,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.800
"This is how we want to define
humanities," and things like that,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.660
"and this is how we want to
define some of what we inherited

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.640
from the western academy and
localize them, far more creatively

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.940
than our predecessors have done."

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.530
And this is part of the challenge.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.360
And what I've been
doing, in recent years,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.090
is to rethink many of these things.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.100
So, this lecture will actually
work more as a workshop

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.710
than as a lecture, and which has
been three days since [inaudible].

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.290
Here's what we agree with.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.310
How do we now translate
what we're talking

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.590
about into curriculum
and begin to teach them?

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.740
Because our project of
translation moves us away just

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.860
from making sure it's
[inaudible] without grounding them

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.770
in those things that are practical.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.160
And we're very grateful
to the [inaudible]

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:23.240
that that whole date is award for
last year to one of these person

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.720
who created his own
university in Ghana.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.770
He used to work for Microsoft,
and the ability to overthink many

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.960 position:56%
of this is all new in the continent.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.590
So, the component of what I want
to present is in four categories.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.200
What is [inaudible] archive?

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.420
How can I break it down
into its components?

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.240
I will do those.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.120
But the real challenge you want,
the ontologies, epistemologies,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.320
I will not be able to do.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.780
Because that's, will
fit more into --

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.070
morph into a seminar of three hours

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.510
where we can actually
do a lot of debate.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:08.610
And I will also do how we can
connect these [inaudible] archives

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.610
into the public domain.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.270
So, the component I'll be talking
about explains the interest

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:20.450
in library and librarians, and
then I will leave out the component

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:27.170
that will interest those
who like to do [inaudible].

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.080
So, let me start by defining what
I mean by [inaudible] archives,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.180
which is how you cumulate awards
and test and ideas and symbols

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.490
and shrines and images,
performances, and [inaudible]

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:48.300 position:56%
that document, as well as picture
religious experiences and practices,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.850 position:56%
in ways in which we have [inaudible]
has turned an Africa world

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.430
[inaudible] of philosophies,
literatures,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.410
languages, histories, and more.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.980
And by implication, these
[inaudible] archives are huge,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.650
unbounded in scale and scope.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.480
They store a tremendous
amount of data on both natural

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.780
and supernatural agents
[inaudible] gods, good,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.220
witches, life, death, festivals.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.480
The interaction between the
spiritual spaces, you and I,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.170
things you can see, and
things you cannot see.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.130
And we like this change.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.840
These archives constitute and
save knowledge about the visible

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.990
and invisible world, even
including what you are going

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.440
to call the nonworld.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.970
Together with forces that breathe
and forces that don't breathe,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:56.240 position:56%
secular ideas and nonsecular ones,
with destinies, ideas within cities,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.330
kinships, medicine, to viral
meds, sciences and technologies.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:08.230
Above all, the content shelves
on sacrifices and shrines, names,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:14.600
places, incantations,
invocations, and the entire cosmos

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.280
of all the [inaudible]
and their living subjects,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.060
among human and nonhuman species.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.490 position:56%
[Inaudible] might have talk about
no more than [inaudible], nonhumans,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:35.520
and humans, because in ritual
knowledge, they do not make

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.340
that distinctions between
nonhuman and humans.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.840
They combine them.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.780
And in some ways, what is on down
at your feet, what is in the sky,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.440
things in the, in the deep
sea, they are combined

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.780
as part of a knowledge system.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.090
And I'm [inaudible] the term
archives in relation to rituals

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.330
to challenge the conventions
of western archives.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.500
Namely, what is deemed worthy
of preservation and organization

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.340
as data, whether or not it is
interpreted at any given moment?

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.100
And this intervention is not

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.300
to restrict archives
inside the location

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.710
of the library or university
or museum.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.630
Because you can just
locate them that way,

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.700
the way we traditionally think,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.890
in terms of western
archives and library.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.180
And I'm also seeking to apply
the techniques and resources

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:36.180
of academic archives to rituals, so
that we can have greater evaluation

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.600
and greater preservation.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.420
And I have [inaudible] good
sense of archive, as well.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.520
One that does not require
residency in the academy.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.710
And I'm insisting that we must
never lose sight of that dimension

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.510
of archive, that is never fully
collected [inaudible] our intense

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.160
power and agency in invisible ways.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.560
The Library of Congress who
deal with the visible ways,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.780
but there are also archives
that had invisible ways to them,

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.890
and I provoke a category
of archive itself

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.570
with the revolutionary insistence
[inaudible] of ritual as a name

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:26.230
for a light component of
cultural meaning making.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:31.240
How do we contend with the
destruction of archive?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.060
Various forms of violence.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.320
Can we qualify, with
certainty, what we can't explain?

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.280
In varied ways, a countless number
of [inaudible] priests, devotees,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.180
and practitioners created oral and
visual libraries, which are linked

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.820
to ritual complexes and
secular [inaudible].

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.890
Subsequently, cultural
knowledge has extended

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.530
from the deep past
to our present day.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.710
It is true there knowledge
that histories

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.980
and traditions were constituted
while identities were formed.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.070
And philosophy, as
we know it, emerged.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.760
Although a lot of people were part
of the community, they were there

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.630
as ordinary members, while
others constituted leadership.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.890
Today, without specific names,

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.900
we live out the [inaudible]
collectively as it passed.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.780 position:56%
And as traditions, sometimes using
traditions in a very misleading way.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.370
And there's a [inaudible] of what

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.660
to call the traditions
and ritual archives.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.790
We provide templates for
the future, and the contents

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:44.070 position:56%
of these archives become
philosophy, literature, and history.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.640
They are interpretations
manifested in our present,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.000
as part of our engagement
with [inaudible].

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.290
Just as in poems, ritual dances,
sacred drums, ritual textiles,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.050
components of the archives
can be isolated,

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.070
but they can also be combined
into a body of interlocking ideas

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.540
and philosophy, and the
context of rough terrain

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.520
of what you can call
ancestral knowledge.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.320
Whether you aggregate
or disaggregate them,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.480
they are called memory,
and remembrance

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.100
in various ways and forms.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.880
They star most of our
indigenous production.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.910
Memories, legacies, histories
of our lives and ancestors,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:35.500
and they lead us to the reinvention
of the cosmos that we inhabit.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:41.580
Different from, but not useless,
to what modern science does.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.360
Why postulating the
[inaudible] of archives?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.520
That is, archives resulting from
the [inaudible] countdown built

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.860
on a template of western knowledge.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.350
We can deduce that the
[inaudible] well, in some number

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.580
of ways [inaudible] it has not
only proven to be severely limited,

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.050 position:56%
but in terms of [inaudible]
possibilities as well as [inaudible]

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:11.420
but it's also an agency of control
that frames our subjectivities

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.420
and objectivities and
that we can pursue them.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.450
The [inaudible] archival name
pose on us and given prominence

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.880
over the ancestral ritual
archive, living to the original

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.880
and the traditional of
indigenous perspective.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.920
They are not genius.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.350
In fact, nothing reveals
the shallowness

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.910
of the [inaudible] archive,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.550
more than the very timeframe
its contents I were to cover.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.960
[Inaudible] national archives
in Ghana [inaudible] Nigeria,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.500
there is [inaudible] records
[inaudible] as expected,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.820
straight to no more than 65
years, any archive in Africa.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.970 position:56%
They only cover 65 years, and we are
talking of a century before Christ.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.330
Contributions in those
[inaudible] archives are crowded

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.140
within the colonial time era,
and after the colonization,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.940
many of them have been
left to their own devises,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:13.330
as post-colonial leaders
struggle for some other things.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:18.120
And as to the time before, only
the long 19th century [inaudible].

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.320 position:56%
Regarding the post-colonial era is a
[inaudible] knowledge [inaudible] be

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.430
confined to the media, because the
archives stop collecting materials

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.280
from the 60s.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.890
Why was trouble for
[inaudible] economic [inaudible]

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.810
and cultural survival.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.280
Histories of centuries
between the Stone Age

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.080
and the 10th century have
been either left to rot

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.390
or are easily ignored, and in the
process, lost, for the most part.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.200
This loss is a function of
lost archives, and suddenly,

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.660
there is regard for those archives
that can still be reclaimed,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.510
as in the case of ritual archives.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.810
They are there.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.440
We just have to reclaim them.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.750
The [inaudible] that the
past was not possible

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.610
to recover is [inaudible]
or assumption

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.250
that many people have
come to accept,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.470
simply because of [inaudible]
coloniality of knowledge, which,

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.760
unfortunately, incapacitated
the possibility of use

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.380
and transformation of
our collective memories.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.570
The very incapacitation of
ritual archives is, by itself,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.110 position:56%
an example of an epistemic violence.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.620 position:56%
Before going to archives [inaudible]
while not necessarily complementary,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.320
have created a knowledge divide.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.820
The [inaudible] one that is aligned
to power [inaudible] and the ritual

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.100
that is outlined with
[inaudible] as opposed

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.070
to [inaudible] ritual
[inaudible] the colonial

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:56.060
as raw materials [inaudible]
existing permanently

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.040
in its shadows and dominance.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.480
Indeed, the archives of
coloniality [inaudible]

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.820 position:56%
that go a long way toward advancing
the projects of [inaudible] concepts

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.090
and legacies to save
[inaudible] interest.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.670
Ritual archives, on the other
hand, deal with ancestral legacies

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.890
and indigenous concepts
and epistemologies.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.370
History, as defined in
the colonial archives,

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.140
is different from [inaudible]
to use [inaudible] by example,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.160
as defined in the [inaudible]
archives.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.640
They are not doing the same thing.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.850
While [inaudible] ritual
archives [inaudible]

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.820
within the realm of
[inaudible] academy.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.540
Analysis of colonial archives
I assessed in the categories

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.020
of originality and validity
in the same academy.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.470
In the western conception

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.660
of historical knowledge
[inaudible] just to stay

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.920
with one example, lacks validity.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.060
While academic history
is [inaudible] with one,

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.500
time is unreliable, but history is.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.750
If time is not accessible and
transparent, why history is?

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:11.000
[Inaudible] what is [inaudible]
graphic knowledge in ways

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.900
that western conception
of knowledge can never do.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.470
As an assessment of western
education [inaudible] successful

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.810
acquires new [inaudible]
of knowledge for mobility.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.510
[Inaudible] rationalizing
the pre-western,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.690
what grudgingly [inaudible]
world views.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:35.430
Why distancing themselves from the
previous [inaudible] knowledge.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:40.890
[Inaudible] historical knowledge
system has been [inaudible] very

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:48.260
formal western system invested with
colonizing values of [inaudible].

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:54.330
What is -- how do we define
and isolate the contents

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.350
of these archives and
their meanings?

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.910
You can do it in multiple ways.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.570
You can invoke [inaudible]
in literature,

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.460
ritual performances
[inaudible] representation

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.310
of gods and goddesses.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.890
It's a fact that this enter
the realm of routine expression

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:15.160
of spirituality, proverbs,
songs, poetry,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.330
all of which generate meanings of
religious and secular significance.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.880 position:56%
Second, we can utilize the
opportunity to frame some dimensions

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.250
of the epistemology [inaudible]
significance of these archives,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.650 position:56%
which is in fact a body of knowledge
on a wide range of issues, including

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.300
but not limited to
cultural recognition,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.780
ideas and idea formation,
semiotics and education.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.460
And I'm going to suggest
some transformational ways

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.200
to keep these archives.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.420
I want to revalidate these
archives, but in doing so,

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.400
within western [inaudible]
academies,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.950
to invoke indigenous
practitioners in research

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.040
and knowledge dissemination and
to formulate evaluation mechanisms

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.930
to authenticate indigenous
knowledge.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.910
And those will communicate
them using the [inaudible]

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:17.180
of the educational system,
indigenous ways of knowing,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.020
along with the knowledge
on the centers

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.890
of those [inaudible]
knowledges was fully blended

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.650
with what we do in the academy.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.060
Ritual archives tell us that
we must review our question,

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.990
our externally derived
approaches, and the limitations

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.600 position:56%
of the methodologies with the pride.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.950
Western derived disciplines, such
as religious [inaudible], history,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.160
philosophy, and subjects
of the humanities,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.660
have carefully fragmented
ritual archives.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.990
But it's time for all those
disciplines to combine

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:55.440 position:56%
to provide [inaudible] of the
center of indigenous epistemologies.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.910
To unify the anthologies
and combine them to theories

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.320
that will be treated as universal.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.550
To take an example, if our
ritual archives can work,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.890
definition [inaudible] by example.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:14.350
We can call it discipline
[inaudible]

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:18.480
and turn it into a department.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:24.100
It's [inaudible] the scholars to
learn and work across disciplines,

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.180
and they probably will have been
able to decode this epistemology

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.050
by now, and use it to create
other forms of knowledge.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:37.230
They will have covered [inaudible]
dimensions of the indigenous.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.070
As scholars dealing with
Africa, questions must be posed

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:45.560
as to how each of us understands
and applies indigenous knowledge,

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.940
which will [inaudible]
values and cultures

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.190
in the research I'm teaching.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:55.260 position:56%
Should we always ground the analysis
and understanding of our fields,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.610
solely in western derived
epistemologies?

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.900
No, we should not be doing this.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.320
Indeed, where we started,
practitioners and others

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.510
who create archives for us.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.470
Others have not studied
us, and suddenly,

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.500
we are [inaudible] studied assets.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.840
So, we have to engage in
various layers of conversation.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.850
Conversations with ourselves,
conversations with ritual archives

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.380
in order to [inaudible]
the voices that are not --

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.910
that are delegitimated
in academic spaces.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:33.300
Pointing to the contents of
these archives as [inaudible]

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.720 position:56%
of multiple epistemology [inaudible]
as well as [inaudible] messaging.

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:43.090
How we must interrogate
broad academic concepts.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.510
What are these things?

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:50.150
I will only use just
one example object

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:56.620
so that I can bring home what
I'm talking about, just objects.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.820
Objects are tests, and you
will look at me very closely.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.500
I'm a body of these
objects and it's deliberate,

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.460
because the body you are
looking at is just part

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.470
of the objects [inaudible] archive,

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.970
including [inaudible],
because it has meaning.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:17.360
If I do it this way,
this way, this way,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.690
with respect to the way I turn it,

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.240
is an object that is
communicating messages.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.730
Gods and goddesses generate around
them a wide range of paraphernalia

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.350
of test and sounds
[inaudible] sounds, visible

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.610
and invisible symbols
[inaudible] symbols.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.050
Objects and signs.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.450
Orality, in itself, is extensive,
comprising parables, proverbs,

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.260
tales, allegories, dilemma stories.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.750
Drums are musical compositions
go with venerations,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.890
along with sacrifices, and
practitioners and priests

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.200
within [inaudible] and [inaudible].

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.320
Rituals are ritual speech.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.690
Ritual speech is very elaborate.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.090
Connect with [inaudible] and
indigenous proverb systems,

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:12.630 position:56%
and it talks about practices,
immunities, and connections and meld

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.630
with ideas of social control.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.080
Invocations have to be made.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.630
Invocations constitute
an entire library,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.220
offerings, compressing food.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.010
I identify with specific datas.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.440
As [inaudible] and
snails for [inaudible] god

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.720
and a definitive [inaudible] go
with his definition of metals.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:43.290
Dress, dances, literature,
performance, drama.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.590
[Inaudible] which I'm using

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.420
because of [inaudible]
was popularize [inaudible]

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.810
and without [inaudible]
won the Nobel prize.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.710
That's the basis of his
Nobel, the god of iron.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.490
That's where he draws
his ideas from.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:02.530
Take [inaudible] for instance,
and the god lists you to chants,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.730
elaborated [inaudible] chants
that you hear from [inaudible]

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:12.390
to the borders of [inaudible]
tries to dancing, to folklore,

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.480
to literature, to [inaudible],
to decorations

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.750
or [inaudible] combat
land with water,

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.500
humans with fish and crocodiles.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.020
Crocodiles are our neighbors.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.910 position:56%
Fish, they are part of our neighbors

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.990
in the way these archives
are constituted.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.560
You are not supposed to be
using their skin for decoration.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.990
It's like killing your neighbors.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.820
These are ideas that would
change their meanings

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.620
because of the way we
change the epistemologies.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.370
[Inaudible] with productivity,
adding to the storehouse

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:48.540
of knowledge on woman and gender,
we can demonstrate this richness

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:53.060
in so many ways, making
use of gods and goddesses.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.190 position:56%
As we rework the complexities around
the datas to modern disciplines,

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.510
which we have to do, we have
[inaudible] get the ritual archives

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.840
into many component units,
as literature, music, drama,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.070
psychology, and topology,
and many more.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.390
And you and I walk
around each component

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:14.860
so that its scholar has studied
far in various departments.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.610
Philosophy, music, drama,
literature, linguistics.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.620
In each of these disciplines
[inaudible] becomes disconnected

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.340
from the modern layout

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.320 position:56%
and intricately connected indigenous
epistemology that produces it.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.130
In favor of the concerns
of the disciplines,

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.440
frame from all the epistemologies
is turn out to be indigenous.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.380
Because all we are doing is
[inaudible] to start with.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.990
In this regard [inaudible] has
been disembodied and fragmented.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.540
The questions posed can become
external to [inaudible] make up.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.040
For example, why do
you pose a question?

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.870
What advice a philosophy
or a religion?

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.130
It's you who's posing the question.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:03.000
Incantation's magical tests
or creative literary test,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.650
if our verses originally
recited [inaudible] what happens

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.480
when they become printed tests?

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.180
You can translate many of them.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.820
Through the printed tests
[inaudible] do they become

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.910
as effective as divination?

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:25.340
I can give you an example
of an incantation,

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.920
but once I translate
it, it loses its power.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.460
It's gone.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.670
Tests as in the case of chance,
taken out of the [inaudible]

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:41.220 position:56%
at entry points to the understanding
of history, to epistemologies

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.340
of cosmology and metrology.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.530
But the cosmology and metrology
cannot operate without forms

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:50.560
of rationality, and they
need to explain other issues,

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.630
such as medicine, politics,
and critical [inaudible].

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.230
I'll be skipping many pages.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.040
If you are interested in the
paper, it's already fully written.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.570
It's 54 pages, and I'll be
willing to send it to you.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.250
Space will not permit me
to elaborate on the breadth

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.790
of these archives or the density of
each of them, which is [inaudible]

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.040
that fragments, and [inaudible]

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.930
of individual constructions
and presentation.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:25.250
Instead, I would like to take
some organic matters and objects,

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:30.520
some of which I brought with me to
illustrate what I'm talking about.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.770
And some of them may
look so ordinary to you.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:42.170
Let me start with what, if you have
been to Brazil or Bayah or Cuba,

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:48.200
it is one of the most common
objects you are going to find.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.140
It's [inaudible] which is
mistranslated [inaudible].

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.330
It's call [inaudible].

00:40:54.330 --> 00:41:01.450
You find it wherever
you find [inaudible] the

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.750
Atlantic [inaudible].

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:10.740
That plant alone, if you go to, you
can't go to Candombles, Santeria,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.400
and all of them, without
confronting it.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.010
It's -- it looks to you like
a small plant or [inaudible]

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:26.150
or [inaudible] photographs, test
ties, paintings and sculptures,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:31.310
all like terms of religious
significance, but they are tests

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.150
that you can accumulate into
rich archives, and they speak

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.040
to a wide variety of issues.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.080
And these tests are so many, and
for those of you who do literature,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.260
you may have come across
them in this interest of time

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.510
and passing a number
of these things around

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:59.300
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.580
They look ordinary
to you, but they open

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.660
up enormous amount of libraries.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.760
Enormous. You have great things
fall apart, you will have come

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.740
across [inaudible] and what that
means in terms of significance.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.810
These objects that I'm sharing
with you, they reach Cuba, Brazil,

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:22.540
United States and other areas, to
form part of the ritual archives

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.930
in the Afro-Atlantic religions.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:29.190
On the African side, spirituality
and [inaudible] reality are united

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:33.760
as in the use of sculpture
to represent the datas.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:41.790
So, for instance, this is
not an object of embroidery.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:45.780
This is connected to the
complexity of divination

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:53.580 position:56%
in which the [inaudible] and he uses
it to communicate so many things.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.920
And for those of you
who have also gone

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.760
to Brazil [inaudible] you will see
the importance and have done it

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.800
in so many ways [inaudible]
in so many ways.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.570
And during question and answer
time, I can talk about this

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:15.210
and you will see how this in
itself is like saying you want

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.950
to write a book [inaudible]
it is an object.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:31.100 position:56%
The [inaudible] were represented by
[inaudible] dance before authors bow

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.310
and arrow symbolized in
various forms of origin.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:40.260
Objects peak and they
communicate with our worlds,

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.570
where people will do
[inaudible] will do silences,

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.130
because they are talking.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:52.190
They're using a different language.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:57.460
They're speaking to you, and
they're supplying narratives

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.280
that encourage the
creativity of storytelling

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.620
and the fascinated performance.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:09.170
And then they use of such
objects as costumes, ritual trees,

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:14.240
woodcarvings, metal
sculpture, carvings [inaudible].

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.390
Ritual special has
become ritual performance,

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.980 position:56%
and they not only become librarians.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.750
They also are narrators.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.540
They manipulate objects.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.860
Some [inaudible] stories
will follow,

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:34.530 position:56%
and they present ritual performances
before an audience to participate.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.610
Objects encode the [inaudible]
of the being they represent,

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.740
even telling us they are
[inaudible] they are [inaudible].

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.350
Whether they are [inaudible]
cool and calm all the time,

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.680
colors are very significant.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.750
And when [inaudible] African,
pay attention to color,

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.290
because they are talking to you.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.970
They are denotative, as in
red, for being aggressive,

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.520
quick-tempered, white
for what it means.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.090
And these colors average
on variations,

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.800
as in blue among the [inaudible].

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.380
In the contrasts [inaudible] binary
epistemology that leads to a series

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.440
of long conversations
on human behavior

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.120
and interpersonal relationships
in society,

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.070
the extensive poetry does work
with words in relation to objects.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.700
Yielding methodologies and
epistemologies in the realm

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.230
of the [inaudible] historical
and institutions that lead us

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.660
to [inaudible] of knowing
and forms of knowledge.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.720
The mistake we've made and why
Africans made this mistake is

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.970
to accept the notion of the museum.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.270
That is a big mistake.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:54.310
Because, when you treat
them as museum pieces,

00:45:54.310 --> 00:46:00.050
with short descriptions
to describe them,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.390
we've undermined them in many ways.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.600
But if we have treated
them as archival items,

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.050
we will have acquired a
different form of results.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.610
Yet these objects actually fit
into the description of an archive

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.300
as a place to keep
historical records.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.420
Although the collection of certain
objects may defy categorization

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:26.110 position:56%
because it means we have to work out
alternative sets of categorization,

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:32.480
the [inaudible] that I'm spreading
around, historical records.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.920
The location of an archive may
be characterized as an archive

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.470
in itself, as in the groove of the
ritual tree, there are so many.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:46.210
Where the tree and its
location constitute a library,

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.450
documents in an archive are
treated as primary sources,

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.210
so [inaudible] many ritual
objects be treated as such,

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:57.900
as they communicate messages that
can be used to reconstruct the past

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.970
and understand ideas
about the world.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.640
Objects open a wide door to a large
body of methodologies, stories,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.290
legends [inaudible] short and long.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.210
And these categories are many.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:13.580
Some, like written records
created for specific meaning,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.280
that we communicate from
one person to another.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.320
Some are signed as [inaudible]
among the [inaudible]

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.220
in which the combination of
powers in relation to [inaudible]

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.840
and other objects,
formulate extensive codes.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.420
And you need special
ways to decode them

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.440
and to create test
and interpretations.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.490
Ritual communications
while elaborate

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.930
from [inaudible] among
the [inaudible]

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:47.150
to the interpretation
of dreams and many more.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:52.490
Objects represent [inaudible]
archives, like cemeteries,

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:57.430
a ground of memory, sacred
groves, and so many examples

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.760
that we have been able to ignore.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:06.700
And in those examples, you see
how we work into us, spirits.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:11.190
Humans and theories are
united in ways of knowing

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.820
that [inaudible] secularization
in academic programs,

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.700
as some students engage with the
belief that witches are with them

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.150
in their classrooms,
thus leading them

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.090
to the generation of
nonwestern ideas.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.820
They supply test on the environment
and open us to multiple worlds

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.490
of charms, magic, and medicine.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:36.480
Songs are constructed,
derived from them.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.140
Based on sound observation of
various uses for curing diseases.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.150 position:56%
The [inaudible] that I've just
prayed around is part of the species

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:52.030 position:56%
that is common, useful for food, but
also for its medicinal properties,

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.570
from its connections with diabetes,
to the reduction of headaches

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.050
and fever [inaudible]
with AIDS, as well.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:05.870
The Brazilian species has multiple
uses [inaudible] and antibacterial.

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:11.780
Plans are part of our
knowledge system.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.370
Certain plans entangle a
world with those of nonhumans.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.730
In this entanglement, facts
and fiction become mashed

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:24.200
into both complex and simple ideas,

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.980
and we try to unite
them in various ways.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.050
They supply ideas of prayers
and philosophy, as in the case

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.590
of [inaudible] and
images and sculpture

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.780
and paintings are abundant,
where there are connections

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.320
with historical writings
and with what we call,

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.770
are characterizing
various departments,

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.600
we need to rethink them
and strengthen them.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:54.990 position:56%
We tend to use more as book
covers, the sculpture and paintings,

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.330
than as elaborate tests
within the books.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.660
[Inaudible] images of
philosophical expressions,

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.640
connected with thought and life.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.480
Look at televisions.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.880
We tend to see and appreciate them,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.880
not necessarily engage
in dialogue with them.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.020
However, images represent
mentalities, power, and strength.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.180
They come used to generate
image theories

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.970
and create extensive
narratives on cultures,

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.070
transcultures, and intercultures.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.250
They supply critically [inaudible].

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.750
To carve an object is
about the representation

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.160
of self, history, identity.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.610
One image of issue, which happens
to be one of my favorite thoughts,

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:43.430
tell us about social and cultural
issues, portray of multiple

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:46.570
and ambivalent ideas, represent
[inaudible] of [inaudible].

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:52.860
This [inaudible] difference,
perception, semiotics, religion.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.900
Multiple specializations can
emerge around image theory,

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.640
image [inaudible] methodologies,
image anthropology,

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.510
image and culture, image
philosophy, perception on singing,

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:09.160
listening, silences, image styling.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.390
An image moves you
towards virtual images,

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:16.550
but it's an aesthetic idea living
within that image, alive with test

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.230
and cultures, forms and styles.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:23.620
While gazing without talking,
you create the test on your own,

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.510
saying something, creating
what [inaudible] calls an omni

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.480
of metaphors.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:34.270
It generates a wide range of
imaginations and tough systems.

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:38.930
To take [inaudible]
image, like the ambiguity

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:44.240
of [inaudible] it cannot be ready
in an interpretive singularity.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.180
[Inaudible] ideas within itself
and ideas outside of itself.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.080
Same, they may use to see
force and strength, power.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.280
Epistemic responses that
connect back to language

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.040
and metaphysical perceptions.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.480
[Inaudible] about the body, in its
physical and nonphysical realms.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.520
An element in the body
[inaudible] and yet another

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.860
to the assumptions
of transgressions.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.590
The politics of images lead us
to the pregnancy of culture,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.730
ready to give birth
to social issues.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:22.380
In a sense [inaudible]
you move to the realm

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:28.270
of beauty [inaudible] conversation
on every day practices, languages,

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:32.890
what creation, forceful
inscription of perception

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:35.940
and experience onto
our consciousness.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:40.960
Look further, and in the issue
image enforce more dimensions

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.170
around performance and other bodies

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:48.600
of knowledge [inaudible]
and other ideas.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.680
The thought that you express
to yourself and to others,

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.480 position:56%
we move you back to the issue image.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.510
Its force becomes a part of you.

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.310
Whether you aide or like issue,
the image becomes activated.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:06.350
In the process, you must
generate test around the image,

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:10.540
expressing your religiosity,
philosophy, and opinions.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.960
Issue has entered your
mental system.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:19.710
Actually, via conversation and
with others, your thought is a test

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.760
on the physical world,
on the afterlife,

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.470
on metrologies, on
religion, and more.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:29.080
And your test is going to be
different from my own test.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.600 position:56%
An artistic production becomes a
body of knowledge at various levels.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.340
Political, cultural, social.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.120
The issue image transfers you

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.930
to the understanding
of culture and society.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:47.650 position:56%
What is left of the past and how the
past is sort of formed, deformed,

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.800
[inaudible] all that
and read all that.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.390
The past may even be disappearing
and that image advances.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.200
[Inaudible] originally appears

00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:02.160
by this small wooden object
opens a vastness of knowledge.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.670
Its edges become borderless.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.770
Its assistance requires a force.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:11.070
We are no longer dealing with
the aesthetic of difference,

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:16.090 position:56%
as in looking at objects in the
British museum in London and looking

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:19.960
at issue in the Republic of Benin.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.930
We are first to move into
the objects of knowledge,

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.370
in which all component parts

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:29.330
of the body become signifiers
of [inaudible] issue.

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.580
Becomes different.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:39.430
A human's face [inaudible] all the
components are breaking them down,

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:45.000
and this unit is semiautonomous,
but aggregated to [inaudible] issue

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.790
in [inaudible] of meaning.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:52.240
Had their issue recitation,
you create [inaudible]

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.870
like your own head [inaudible].

00:54:55.870 --> 00:55:00.010
That of issues also [inaudible]
of intelligence and emotions.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:03.800
All this calculations and
miscalculations reside here.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.450
You can see his head.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.070
You can see his body,
his frowns, attributes.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.650
Then derive from various parts
of these components of the body,

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:16.230
all concerned with
[inaudible] and destiny.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:20.530
You have to trick your own
wisdom and strength to deal

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.370
with [inaudible] issue,
and as you do so,

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:27.220
your own thinking process will
begin to break down into a series

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:32.160
of components, as that of your
own wisdom of your own stupidity.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.080
You draw in your own [inaudible]
knowledge from your stomach,

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.530
because in some cultures,
you put knowledge

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.530
in your stomach, not just food.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:44.980
To rely on your inner senses,
your eyes must work well

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.710
to recall your inner
essence and your perception.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:53.370
So, you become confused,
you have to seek wisdom

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.060
and fully elaborate conversation.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.590
And inside derived from your
stomach, you become the point

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:04.470
of validation and you can
create insets of knowledge.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:09.200 position:56%
The issue image, coupled with all
of the objects as well as all tests,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.450
and the entire ritual archives,

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.640
leads us to the indigenous
intellectuals

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.790
and their epistemologies.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:20.930
Combined, they deal with
invisible realities of knowledge,

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:25.260
as in witchcraft, while they
complicate the visible ones,

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:30.850
as in all forms of epistemologies,
and of a long section

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:37.550
on epistemologies and how, if you
are able to use these archives,

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:42.360 position:56%
we will no longer be talking about
universalism, what about [inaudible]

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:48.420
in which separate epistemologies
that derive

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:53.470
from the [inaudible] archives
will lead us to fresh ideas.

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:58.270
And this is going to be a
bigger project in which we begin

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.720
to understand indigenous
knowledge systems, the [inaudible]

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.470
of the entire range of
vernacular epistemologies

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:11.690
into formal education system, and
we begin to teach a new generation

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:15.290
of students a new body of ideas.

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.920
The connection between
[inaudible] power

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.840
and [inaudible] knowledge
is very clear-cut,

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:26.000
and how [inaudible] knowledge has
been problematic in a continent

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.420
like Africa, and part of the ways

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.550
in which we can challenge
this knowledge is

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:36.760
to rethink not just
the archives we use,

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.770
but to search for the very same
test of the epistemologies.

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:46.060
And these epistemologies are many,

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.430
and we have not started
the work we need to do.

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:53.070
Let me now go to the
last part, which is,

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:56.570
how do we move these archives
into the public spaces?

00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:01.620
Because we have to do them, we have
to move them into public spaces.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.960
Whether it's tests,
objects, or symbols,

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.830
ritual archives are face serious
dangers, ranging from extinction,

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:15.340
ridicule, marginalization,
and [inaudible].

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.560
The first problem is that
of intellectual inequality.

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:25.570
All externally derived knowledge
systems, Islamic and western,

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.450
are seen to be superior to them.

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:32.570 position:56%
The inability to create permanent
written text with specialists linked

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:35.660
to formal system of
knowledge, as in the case

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:41.940
of western derived
academies, create a drawback.

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:45.880
The social contest of
knowledge production is crucial

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.480
and is [inaudible] of trouble.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.140
Africans scholars who
produce knowledge

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.050
for Africa's [inaudible] instead

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:57.660
of fully embracing these
ancestral epistemologies.

00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.070
What should we do?

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.780 position:56%
I want to make five recommendations.

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:08.790
First, that we must modify the
orientation of our research

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:13.170
and that [inaudible] scholars as
researchers and [inaudible] side

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:20.350
of it, should be integrated
in a different manner.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.380
That the [inaudible] that we have
created is forced and we have

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:29.310
to bring back indigenous ways
of knowing into what we do.

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:34.250
We have to rethink the outcome
of our research, the assumption

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:39.880 position:56%
that the research [inaudible] is the
most important is very misleading.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.030
Indeed, indigenous
researchers connect

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:46.170
with the organic communities more
directly, feeding the constitution

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:49.250
of knowledge and ways of knowing.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:54.740
We have to assume that the power
of social agency does not just lie

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.200
in the academy and we must
give social agency to those

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.350
who produce other forms
of knowledge.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:06.250
We have to rethink how we
produce knowledge and have

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:09.270
to ask the question,
"Who are we, anyway?"

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:12.470
We're right about the
sociology of knowledge.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.880
Not necessarily by building
on indigenous inheritances

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.370
or by operating indigenous voices
into a chaotic [inaudible].

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:25.560
We write about the
sociology of social movements.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.440
Without joining the working
class to protest injustice.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.810
We write about gods and goddesses.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.680
Why not join in their worship?

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.700
Is it that observe us.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:43.270
We disconnect what we drew
from the public that we serve.

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:49.260
We must begin to locate
the communities compel

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.860
and update catalogs.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:57.250
Ritual archives already exist in
private spaces with associations,

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:01.460
organized [inaudible] and we
have to connect more with them.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.920
We must begin to encourage
autobiographies, [inaudible]

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:11.730
and religious [inaudible] and we
must begin to keep them in ways

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.320
that assessable to others.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.440
We have to begin the process of
digitizing them, given the fact

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.260
that this is not possible.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.560
I'm calling for the
reconfiguration of disciplines.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.810
Saying that the colonial
structure of the old

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:31.500
and very new universities
has not been very hospitable

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.880
for this form of archives.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.850
We must begin to allow
[inaudible] to be reaching

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.460
with a new set of substance.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:45.290
And even to be written in
indigenous African languages.

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.330
And the academy has
to accept the validity

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:53.850
of the use African languages
as well as the validity of many

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:57.380
of these new and alternative
sources.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.800
And by doing so, the tourists
will [inaudible] will be many.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.850
I want to read my last paragraph
and I want to start with a proverb.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:10.150
"A person who carries
a basket of eggs

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:14.770
on his head must walk
with measured steps."

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:18.090
In the final analysis, perhaps you

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:23.370
and I as practitioners
operating the western academies,

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.400
will become the traditional
intellectuals whose power

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.210
and legitimacy will be
challenged and superseded

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:36.640
by organic intellectuals
connected with this organic data.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.840
And organic intellectuals
whose legitimacy will be based

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.180
on epistemologies derived
from ritual archives.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:49.860
As well as intellectual rationality
build around cultural legitimacy.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:57.380
They have to rethink what we have
inherited, and rethinking them,

01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:00.920
they may move us forward
in new ways.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.300
We cannot continue to
carry baskets of eggs

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.920
on our heads and be
walking in haste.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.720
Thank you very much.

you, Dr. Falola.

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:25.630
I think you've certainly given the
African studies field a challenge.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:29.670
But when we look at the
African world, the importance

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:35.460
of indigenous knowledge
becomes very, very critical.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:42.750
At this point, we can open up
for a very short Q and A. So,

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:50.510

then Doctor Falola will answer.

you so much for your presentation.

&gt;&gt; Joanne: Thank you so
much for your presentation.

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:18.670
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Yeah.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.030
&gt;&gt; Student: First of
all [inaudible] Falola.

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:26.520
My question is, though [inaudible]
African languages documenting the

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.970
statue era of report.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.740
[inaudible] Are you particular

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:41.940
about African institutions
or the United States?

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:53.500
That is one part of it.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:03.980 position:56%
My other question is, how is it with
[inaudible] with use African beliefs

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.580
to write a report [inaudible]
participants [inaudible] Africa?

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.880
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Okay.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:16.170
I want to answer all the questions.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.470
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Okay.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:21.150
let's take one last --
the two last questions

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:25.480
and then we'll let the
professor answer or respond.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.590
&gt;&gt; Student: So [inaudible] the
opportunity to [inaudible].

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:42.250
For those of us in diaspora who are
part of the descendent community.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:48.990
We come seeking knowledge
that is our inheritance.

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:51.520 position:56%
Some of it we can get through books.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.380
We don't have access to the
oral tradition in the same way.

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:03.820
I once asked Dr. [inaudible]
about the way we,

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.820
children in the diaspora
understand things.

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:13.560
And he told me that
sometimes the ancestors talk

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.910
to the children in our dreams.

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:32.360
And I'm wondering if you
might talk about that.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.950
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Yes, ma'am.

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:52.250
&gt;&gt; Student: [Inaudible] can you
just tell us the ritual [inaudible]

01:08:52.250 --> 01:09:00.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Well, I don't think
you can have the time to do that.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:06.510
What are all the ways [inaudible]
because what I was trying to say is

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.730
that they're very elaborate.

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:17.750
They just don't mean one
thing and also be in mind,

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:24.500
and objective operates in multiple
ways in terms of combination.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.410
So, this [inaudible]
and turned them around

01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:28.320
and combined them differently.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.130
That's the way objects work.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:37.430 position:56%
So, they don't lend themselves to
just singularity of interpretations.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:48.580
So, and then when you -- so, when
you take this one, for instance,

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:52.160
it gets connected to
rites of passage.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.270 position:56%
And as a change of rites of passage,
this one changes its meaning

01:09:57.270 --> 01:10:01.400
and it opens up a great
amount of conversation.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.820
So, I drew this as
an interpretation.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.470
If I drew this is that
interpretation?

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:15.060
If I break it, I'm saying
something different.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.500
Then I begin to chew it.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.070
I'm changing this minute.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:26.570
So, the point I'm trying to make,
and I tried to use this shoe

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:37.180
as an example, is to say that, you
see, I tried to use the analogies

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.560
that people can relate to
tests, tests, tests, or library

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.990
and library, because
it's a knowledge system

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.280
that begins to talk.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.370
I can use this to pray that God
is going to give you long life.

01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:56.360
I even had incantations.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.020
I changed the meaning.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:06.370
It become something else, so
I will talk more one on one.

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:10.620
The language questions has
always come up forever.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:16.520
It will always come up.

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:22.920
So, there are countries
on the ten million.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.510
There are actually
countries six million people

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:29.180
who use their language.

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:35.800
Czech Republic, Sweden,
the state of Israel.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.320
[inaudible] you asked
me the question.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.330
Are you there?

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:48.330
They use their language to
[inaudible] for instance, right?

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:52.300
They are bigger than all these
countries that I just mentioned.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.450
And there's a dozen countries,

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:59.690
there's just ten million
people who use their language.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:12.580
Or valley of the development
of Hebrew language [inaudible].

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.770
For the best example the
Africana in South Africa.

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.480
They were so successful.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.350 position:56%
That's -- I do not know
[inaudible] African [inaudible] used

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.240
until current challenges.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.610
They created this language in South
Africa, they insisted on using it.

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:35.600
Part of what led to the
Soviet uprising for those

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.860
of you who are alive then.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.230
Was because they want
to impose Africana.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:46.170
And sold it to black people
and it led to a major crisis.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:53.350
So, it's actually not true that you
cannot take a language and turn it

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:58.140
into a academic project
or use it in school.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:05.490 position:56%
One of the projects that was averted
was [inaudible] she mentioned

01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:09.310
in which we actually started this.

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:13.830
[inaudible] language of
education from elementary school.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.300
Who started it?

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.280
And it worked.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.300
Unfortunately today,
you now have Africans

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.490
who cannot speak African languages.

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:28.760
You have [inaudible] who
cannot use the language.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.240
The tragedy is they are
not good in English either.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.680
It's not that simply
a good [inaudible].

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:45.030
And if you look at [inaudible]
like [inaudible] well,

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.710
it is the grand [inaudible]
language that makes a Chevy.

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:52.020
If you take off the Hebrew
language from there, what is --

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.170
what are you going to have?

01:13:54.170 --> 01:14:02.660 position:56%
So, the tremendous advantages that
are located in this language, right?

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:09.680 position:56%
We begin to lose it by the, so I
don't like to use myself an example.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.820
When I wrote my memoirs,
two of them in French,

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.450
I wrote it in what you would
call [inaudible] English.

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:20.270
They could not find a copy
editor, it's not going to work.

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:24.970
And the publisher said, "And
it became very successful.

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:26.720
Okay, okay.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.450
We will not dub your English."

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:33.000
And each [inaudible] the
memoir they asked me questions.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.220
There's a line I started by
saying, "A frog would not know

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.030
that there are two worlds
unless it jumps into hot water."

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:47.720 position:56%
A student comes to me and said, "Why
would a frog jumps into hot water?

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.020
Is it stupid?"

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:56.610
But as a language, if I say, what
is after six is more than seven.

01:14:56.610 --> 01:15:01.150
Nobody in England can say that
because it's not possible for him

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:06.160
or for her to ever think that way.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.620
What is six after seven, is
an organic way of talking

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.760
and it's connected to
a specific location.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.110 position:56%
And what is after six after seven,
as small as it is, is a conversation

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:25.680
that you and I can stay here
until tomorrow to be discussing.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.010
You can actually, in
Africa universities,

01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:32.310
write [inaudible] in [inaudible].

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:37.310
That is within your
reparations to formulate.

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:40.450
You don't need any stand-up
power to validate it.

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.290
It wasn't like the time when
I was drinking sea level.

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:48.400
That they had to take my
scripts to the west of London.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.110
That moment is gone
because they now,

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:58.200
they can't be blaming
thing on other people.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.180
They [inaudible] of themselves and
say, "We want you to write your PhD

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.660
in [inaudible] of Nigeria
in [inaudible]."

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.170
Nobody can stop them.

01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:11.900
They are the one validating
that degree and making use of it

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.580
within the national boundaries.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.880
And they'll be surprised that
that person can work elsewhere.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.230
So, I think we've been very
careless in that regard.

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:27.040
Generally, we have been
very careless and we have

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.210
to rethink the very process.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:37.410
You can -- the very fact that you
use your languages as a [inaudible]

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:43.000
in Germany or in France does not
mean don't assess other languages.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.360
I'm actually much better in
[inaudible] than in English

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.500
because that was my generation,
that's how we went to school.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:55.450
And then at some point my
grandmother also forced me

01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:56.970
to learn Arabic.

01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:06.330 position:56%
So, this language issue is a project
of state policy and it's one we have

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:09.660
to seriously think about.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.770
The first question, yes, yes.

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:19.420
Can you begin to demystify
this object over time?

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:25.780
That's what morality and western
science will move you towards.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:36.140
But be in mind that those who plan
education system for you and those

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.000
who shape the knowledge system
can also create agencies

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.920
in the other direction.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.220
You know they can do that.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.990
And what they say.

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:52.270
When I was at the age of ten,

01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:55.930
I quoted all the classics
in [inaudible].

01:17:55.930 --> 01:18:00.030
Indeed, I wrote my first
play at the age of 12.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:05.510
Why? Because the set of this
elaborate drama competition,

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:08.670
[inaudible] competition
across a big region.

01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:12.560
And they were asking us to
compete and we're competing.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.760
That's how my interest in language
and performances developed.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.780 position:56%
Years later, when I wrote a play and
I was looking for people to act it,

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.650
I was shocked that getting
people to act was very difficult.

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.310
You know why?

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:34.270
Because they are not -- they are
no longer organically connected

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:40.020
to acting as a day to day
practice as I was as a child.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:47.270
In which, that play that we are
doing was what we later learned

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:50.110
in the U.S. it will be performance.

01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:55.040
I come from Ibadan, and if you have
been to it you will know Ibadan.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.350
You cannot live in my city

01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:03.430
without an extensive
infrastructure of language.

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:05.710
And we pride ourselves
in the ability

01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:10.770
to create instant poems
to abuse people.

01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:14.690
You just have to master
it, you just have

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:19.650
to master it and it's
very intricate.

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:26.320
And as you begin to do that, by the
time anybody sets up a chair there,

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.740
you already have people that are
already so brilliant and so good

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.710 position:56%
in acting that you don't have to be
spending so much time training them.

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:40.130
And you see how Nollywood, which
is the third largest movie industry

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:44.000
in the world, is bringing
back some of these things.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.170
Bringing back some of these things.

01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:53.490
We -- I think it's
tragic to lose them.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.270
It's very tragic.

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.090
[inaudible] history in the
western academy follows a

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:02.390
formative definition.

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:10.190
So, which we give a degree
and that formal definition,

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:13.010
it will say that the
definition of [inaudible].

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:23.790
First of all, any project of
translation is very risky.

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:25.460
If I say [inaudible] you
are making a big mistake.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.860
It doesn't work like that.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.290
If I say character and you say
[inaudible], if I say head.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:36.000 position:56%
So, projects of translations are
very problematic because a component

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.110
of what [inaudible] will call
[inaudible] is much broader

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.860
than what we call history
to every university degree.

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:49.290 position:56%
Because when you break it down, it's
called chains metaphysical world.

01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:51.620
The environment, they
don't separate them.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:55.730
Trees and human beings
can be living together.

01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:59.380
Stories of the elephants and
human beings can be combined

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:04.900 position:56%
and they combine them with issues
of memory and issues of [inaudible].

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.290
So, the way they define
it, you have to fracture it

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:14.360
into various disciplines
because it's not just history,

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.790
it'll include connectings
that we're now starting.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:24.570
And finally, your dreams and
what that you all told you, well,

01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:26.750
we have to keep dreaming.

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:31.000
She's been asking me to
stop and I will wait behind

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
and check more questions.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.910
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: I'm sorry
that we have to end our program

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.890
at this point, but
again, please join me

01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:44.220
in thanking Dr. Falola
for his presentation.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.880
I'd also like to invite
you in our conference room.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:55.640
We have a small display of some
of the works of Dr. Falola,

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.730
so please join us in
the conference room

01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:01.790
and perhaps we can continue
conversations there.

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.460
Thank you.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.170
