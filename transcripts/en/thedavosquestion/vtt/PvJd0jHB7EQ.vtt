00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; So Haiti, obviously breaks my heart.
And it deserves to be on the agenda here in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.170
Davos.
But in many ways, it's an old story.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.679
Haiti is less about the tragedy, this crisis,
the 100,000, almost

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.529
200,000 people, their lives lost, a needless
tragedy.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.739
And the same crisis, the same magnitude earthquake
or thereabouts hit

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.830
San Francisco in 1989 hit Haiti, but in San
Francisco 68 people, I

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.540
believe that's the number, 68 died.
Certainly less than a hundred.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.650
In Haiti, almost 200,000 people have died.
The problem with Haiti is poverty.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.970
It's not that Haitians are any less intelligent
or any less ambitious,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.750
it's that they're less able and less capable
to fend for themselves as

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.860
a result of that environment of poverty, you
have poor infrastructure,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.890
poor government, poor government building,
poor standards, poor values,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.310
poor investment.
And if you go back to when Haiti was an economic

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.280
leader for the
colonies European colonies several hundred

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
years ago, they were doing
really well into a war and beat Napoleon,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.060
the only country to beat
Napoleon.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.050
And some would say as a result of that, some
European interests made

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.659
them pay a price which was economic.
They're still paying that price today.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.710
We have a chance to do it right and get to
right again, to make sure

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.870
this never happens to Haiti again or any other
place that's vulnerable

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.840
in the world by going in.
After we stabilized and after we help people

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.040
in this crisis.
Let's not just give them sympathy.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.300
Let's give them empathy.
Let's give them a hand up and not just a hand

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.580
out.
Let's not just be the Good Samaritan along

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.260
the Jericho.
Let's fix the Jericho road.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.200
Let's go in and give them roads and gutters
and streetlights.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.920
Let's give them safe environments.
Let's give them an opportunity for home ownership

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.950
and individual
property rights and small business ownership

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.060
and entrepreneurship and
self-employment projects.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.599
Because there's not enough jobs to go around
in corporations, we know

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.000
in Haiti, you're not going to save them in
government largesse can't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.490
and shouldn't save them.
We should give people the dignity of being

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.890
able to do for themselves.
So I think that we should really maybe look

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.650
at free enterprise and
capitalism, work for the poor in Haiti, over

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.810
the next 2 to 10 years, it
should be a massive serious campaign to empower

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.540
the Haitian people with
dignity.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.590
It's a boon to I and me because you are you.
I know President Clinton and UN envoy is doing

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.730
his part.
I know there are certain committee members

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.959
here but you are the first
to hear that Operation Hope, the organization

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.590
that I founded that
serves 1,100,000 people will be going into

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.090
Haiti with a massive
five-year campaign to make free enterprise

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.250
and capitalism work for the
people, to teach a generation of young people

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.871
financial literacy and
the language of money and give them the dignity

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.280
and the ability to do
for themselves.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.160
Thank you.
