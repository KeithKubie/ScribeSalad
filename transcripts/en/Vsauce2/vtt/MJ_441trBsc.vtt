Headmaster Gari Chapidze had a retired plane

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.110
transformed into a kindergarten classroom.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.750
He said that he wanted to create a classroom
that kids wanted to go to.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.141
The plane has more that 1500 buttons the kids
can pull, push, flick, and press.

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:33.340
Not only do the kids not want to go home,
there is a waiting list to get into the class.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.660
Botanical artist Maoto Azuma is attempting
to recreate a sustainable bonsai within an

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.780
underwater environment.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.060
Deadwood is garnished with java moss to resemble
leaves and then secured into an aquarium.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.800
To recreate the natural cycles within naure,
LED lights and CO2 emissions within the tank

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.290
stimulate photosynthesis and a fiction system
keeps it clear of bacteria.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.920
Anthony Michael Simon makes sculptured art
out of actual spiderwebs.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.930
While traveling in Korea he came across a
huge spiderweb and realized that he may be

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.000
able to catch the spiders and have them create
webs in his studio.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.350
He sprays a protective coating on the fragile
webs, adds color, and displays them on plastic

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.220
rods so that the viewer can see all the intricacies
of the spiders design.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.530
Robbie and Kara Johnson of Below the Boat
have laser cut bathymetric charts available

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.310
for sale as wall art that display the landscape
below the water.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.190
The countours are laser cut into sheets of
Baltic Birch and glued together to create

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.530
the depths showing off the deep channels,
sharp drop offs and mountainous landscapes.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.170
in this series of illustrations that would

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.170
Post, if there was one of course.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.520
With a Norman Rockwell influence they show
a glimpse of the characters lives that are

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.530
sweet and a little sad.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
Located in the valley of Savoy, France Simon
Beck creates snow art by walking through the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.340
snow.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.310
Taking up to 9 hours to create, Beck walks
carefully creating these meticulous patterned

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.310
tracks.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.360
Beck is a fan of mathematical patterns that
have different effects when viewed from different

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360
vantage points.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.560
The pieces can even be seen as the snow melts
and reveals traces of the last pattern made

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560
during the last snowfall.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:40.790
And now for some Judd Apatow tribute art
Illustrator Ale Giorgini created a series

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.200
of cult movie posters with all the main charters
in very minimalistic geometric shapes.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.950
The titles and catch phrases of the moves
are also cleverly worked into the background.
