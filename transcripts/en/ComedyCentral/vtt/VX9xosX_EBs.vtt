Here we are
in Sacramento, California,

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.206
at the state capital.
Not only a beautiful building,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.175
but a place that welcomes me
with open arms.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.877
This is where
I was given my day.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.179
February 22 is Kevin Hart day.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.380
This is where
it all happened at.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:16.449
- Your day?
- My day. Breathe it in.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.918
- Who told you to stop by?
- Everybody did,

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.720
'cause I came
and I wooed people.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.088
Follow me,

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.823
and wipe your feet off
before you go inside.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.359
- We outside still, why--
- Wipe your foot off!

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.095
- I was gonna wipe mine off.
- Act like you with Kevin Hart.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.064 align:end position:100%
Look, I don't just say
that I'm a big deal

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.866 align:end position:100%
around these parts, guys.
I'll show you.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.136 align:end position:100%
Read it.
That's a senator, okay?

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.404 align:start size:75% position:25%
Senator Hall, my friend.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.672 align:start position:0%
- Kev, you know,
you ain't got to do this.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.075 align:end position:100%
- No, I do.
I'm gonna introduce you.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.309 align:end position:100%
I'm gonna introduce you,
just relax.

Senator.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.921
Ah!
- Kev.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.189
- Ah!
- What's up, bro?

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.523
- Ah!
- How can I help you, man?

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.325
- Boy, look at--how you help me?
Give me a hug.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.526
- Man.
- What'd you eat, barbeque?

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.261
You smell like--
- What's going on?

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.429
What's going on, man?
- I wanted to introduce you

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:04.964
to my friends, man.
- Yeah.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.699
- That's Harry right there.
I call him Bucket Low.

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.367
That's Joey right there.
Good friend of mine, man.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.635
We do a lot of work together.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.370
I want to show
these guys the ropes.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.505
I want to show them your office.
Give me--give me--yeah--

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:14.140
Give me one second.
- Well, hold on.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.141
Before you go, let me--
- Give me one second.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.342
One second.
- Hey--

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.543
- Hey, security!
- Okay.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.411
- Security!

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.213
Hey.
You all right in there?

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.215
You need your back up?
I'm here.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.649 size:78% position:39%
- No, he called security.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.384

he okay.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.686
- No, no, no, no, no--
- Senator, you all right?

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.354
- I think he called them on you.
- On you.

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:31.524
- Well, he didn't call on me--
Hey, Hizzo!

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.392 align:end position:100%
I don't see why
he would have called--

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.995
- Whoa, we got to go.
- Hizzo, I'ma call your phone.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.598
