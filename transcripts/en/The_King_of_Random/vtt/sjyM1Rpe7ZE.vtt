00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're taking 
a look at how to make

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.500
some scars bruises and
bleeding cuts with some DIY makeup.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.460
Some of which is made
from stuff you probably already have.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.060
[Music]

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.800
Guys, we have Calli back
here in the studio,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.242
and she's going to be helping
us out with something fun today.

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.552
Calli, what is it
we're going to be doing?

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:21.800
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.140
I'm going to beat you up.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.992
&gt;&gt; Aww.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna do it
in a nice way.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.800
We've got some DIY Halloween
makeup styles that we're going

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.412
to be doing.

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:34.372
Bruises, blood, cuts,
it's going to be interesting.

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:36.900
But with some household
supplies that you can find

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.880
pretty darn easy,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.400
all the way up
to some things

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.300
that you might find
at the local theater store

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.720
or even Walmart.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900
&gt;&gt; All right, so what are
these supplies were looking at?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.400
Some of these I think
I recognize and some of them,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
I also recognize,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.300
but that's because I've done
some theater makeup before.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.500
So, just walk us
through a little bit of what

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
we've got here on the table.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.460
&gt;&gt; Flour, baby powder, Vaseline,
pretty darn simple.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.800
With these supplies, you
can actually make a scar putty.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400
Now, I do have
theatrical scar wax.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.600
That is something that a lot
of people will use in makeup

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.700
and theater,
but you can make it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.700
at home for a lot cheaper.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.300
So, I'm going to show you
how to do that.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.200
Moving up to liquid latex.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
Now, not all latex
is made the same.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.360
You're going to see
the difference between

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.100
our Walmart latex
and some theatrical supply makeup.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm going to show you how
you can basically make

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it look the same,
work the same for you.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.012
And then liquid collodion,
which... it's probably more fun

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.920
to just show you what that does.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
&gt;&gt; So, here's the plan, Calli is going
to take some of our makeup supplies,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.600
and she's going to start
applying them to me,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.500
and explaining how to do it,
to make it look like I suffered

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.232
some grievous injury.

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.000
Like, maybe someone
hit me in the face,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.300
with a big old weapon.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
&gt;&gt; The basic idea when
you're doing makeup like this,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.940
sometimes less is more.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.300
You kind of want to focus
on the bone structure

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.400
and you also want to focus
on where the skin's really

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.300
going to split.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.500
So if Nate were to get hit
say right there,

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.900
he probably end up
with a black eye,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.380
some swelling around the eye,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.212
and then a pretty good slice in his face.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.600
So, let's see
if we can make that look real.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.600
So the first step is we're going
to take some flour,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.800
and we're going to take some Vaseline,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.002
we're going to mix them together.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.360
We're going to tone it,
to attempt to match your skin.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.700
And then we're going
to add it on.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.700
We'll probably add
a little bit of spirit gum.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000
Also something that you can find
at your local Walmart,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.800
grocery store,
Theatrical supply store,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.980
so that it's going to stick
a little bit better,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.100
and then we're going to add
some color and some blood.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.580
&gt;&gt; Let's get this party started.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000
We don't actually
need this much but,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.400
just you can kind of
see what I'm doing.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.900
&gt;&gt; Vaseline petroleum jelly.
&gt;&gt; Straight Vaseline, yup.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.400
&gt;&gt; Normal [inaudible], brand
doesn't matter but--

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.200
&gt;&gt; Really doesn't,
I just got the regular brand,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.400
just picked it up from Walmart.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.940
I have experimented using
baby powder as well,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.700
works pretty darn good
but the absorbency

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:49.400
is a little bit different,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.220
so we're going to stick
with the flour,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.200
which is what a lot of people use,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.300
and it's going to make
the tinting a little bit easier

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900
and a little bit more opaque,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.700
which in this case is actually
going to be a good thing when

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.460
we're applying color over it.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.300
Usually you're going to want
a little bit thinner,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.500
but this should be fine.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.200
So, what we're looking
for is basically

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.440
a paste-like consistency,
almost a Play-Doh.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.700
It's actually going
to be very similar

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.220
to when you Proto-putty.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.600
&gt;&gt; This point, I would say
that we have approximately

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:19.700
twice as much flour,
as we do Vaseline by volume.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.942
&gt;&gt; So if you touch it,
does it stick to your skin?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.180
Nope, not really.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.700
Okay, good.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.820
So right now,
we've got pretty much,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.920
the perfect consistency.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.000
So that's what
we're looking for.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.900
So now, here's the fun part.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.000
I had to make up match Nate.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.800
&gt;&gt; So, if you go
to the makeup store

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.700
because you want to make this,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.200
you ask one of the nice people
working there where you can find,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.000
liquid foundation
in your skin color.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.900
And, they'll be very helpful,
and they'll show you where to go.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.600
&gt;&gt; In case you wondered
what color Nate skin is,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.580
it's basically primer white.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.800
It's classic Ivory.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.400
You're about as pale
as you can possibly be.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.080
&gt;&gt; That hurts my feelings a little
bit, but it's very true.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.900
This stuff is not like,
super runny thin.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.392
It's kind of like,
ketchup consistency.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.000
And that's also good.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.840
&gt;&gt; And now I mix this up
the same way, right?

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.640
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.800
So, this consistency now,
I would say, sugar cookie dough.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.900
Yeah.
That's a good description.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300
Don't eat it though.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.800
Don't--

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520
No, you eat most things,
don't eat this.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.320
&gt;&gt; Oh-- Mmm.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.580
Mmm-mmm

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.300
Is it working?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.380
I can feel it tingling
on my gum.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.600
They're so stale.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.940
&gt;&gt; Put it down.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.940
All right, so when it comes
to doing the sort of makeup,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.940
you don't have to break the bank.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.100
That's why we're kind of
doing this all DIY style.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.300
So you'll actually
recognize some of this stuff.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.000
If you've ever been
to a Halloween store

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.800
or even Walmart,
these are just some really

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.000
simple grease paints.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400
And if you apply them right,
you're going to get some pretty

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.700
darn cool colors.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.700
So I'm sure
that Nate skin is very clean,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.300
but just in case to make sure
that everything applies

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.900
properly, we're going to use
some witch Hazel astringent.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.000
It's just a little bit gentler
than some others.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.600
&gt;&gt; As an astringent,
it means it's going

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.072
to strip oils off of my face,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.160
and we don't want
that long-term or forever,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.500
but it makes it so that all
of the makeup can stick

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.000
to my skin a lot better.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.800
&gt;&gt; Once the skin is clean
you want to add a layer

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
of spirit gum.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.000
Now, this is going to help
that putty stay

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
a little bit better,
especially because it is

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
a DIY mixture that we've made.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.100
&gt;&gt; Spirit gum is like,
skin glue made

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.960
out of pine trees, I think.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.100
As she's dabbing this on with her finger,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.700
I can feel it as it dries out.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.000
It starts getting stickier
and sticker.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.800
You can probably see how it
was getting more and more stuck

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.700
to her finger
as she lightly

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.740
tapped it in place.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.500
&gt;&gt; So, what I'm looking for is
a really really thin layer.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.600
You can kind of see
that we've got this really

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.260
shiny, tacky surface.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.900
I want to work quickly
before it dries too much.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.200
But I also don't want
it to be so thick

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200
that it gets gummy.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.100
If it gets too thick,
it's going to start pulling

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.300
away from the skin, and then
not only is your prosthetic

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.400
not going to stick,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.012
but you could potentially
hurt your... patient?

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:14.502
&gt;&gt; Victim?

00:06:14.702 --> 00:06:15.202
&gt;&gt; Victim.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.660
So, to apply this makeup,
it's not going to be very difficult.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.600
You don't really
need anything very fancy.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.900
I'm really just starting out
with a cut popsicle stick.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.600
Make sure the ends aren't sharp.

00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:27.500
Again, we're really
not trying to injure him,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.262
just make it look
like I injured him.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.320
I really don't want to get
in trouble for hurting Nate.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.180
So I went for just more
of a... angled spatula.

00:06:37.662 --> 00:06:39.300
The idea is basically
that we want to be able

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.500
to smooth down the edges,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.400
make sure it looks pretty
darn seamless between his skin,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.800
and the prosthetic.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.300
So, even with my spirit gum,
the edges are starting

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.272
to pull up a little bit
because that flour

00:06:49.272 --> 00:06:50.652
is absorbing the Vaseline.

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:52.100
So, we're going to take a Q-tip

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.500
and we're going
to add a little bit

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.300
more Vaseline just
around the edges,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.660
just to smooth things out.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.000
Well, I think that's at
least going to be a pretty

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.900
darn good arc for our cut,
so let's add some bruising.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.540
At this point, it just
comes down to color theory.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.840
We want to make sure
that we can match Nate's skin

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680
as closely as possible.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.880
He's got a very pale skin, 
but a pink undertone.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:27.940
[Music]

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.400
So here's the fun part,
doesn't have to be expensive.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560
You don't have to use
anything super crazy.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.080
So this was $3 at Walmart,
this was I think $2,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.240
and that's really all you need.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.800
So we're going to take, 
our $2 brushes, and let's start

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.720
with some black
and purple.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.060
Make sure that you
also use some skin tones,

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:47.600
but really just
mix and match

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.662
until you get what you want.

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.400
So this is basically
just the same

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.900
as those little grease pencils.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.400
It's just even softer.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.200
So one of the important parts
when you're working on this

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.840
again, just take your time,
be patient,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.900
and don't use one color.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.300
When you use one of those colors
on these really bright,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.800
you know, color palettes,
you saw that I was working

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.880
with a bright red
and a bright purple.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.380
But when you start
blending them,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.420
that's when you get it
to look really realistic,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.300
even with the really, really cheap makeup.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.200
This palette is probably $7,
so out of all of our makeup

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.720
today probably one
of the more expensive ones.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.800
But, it lasts me for years
and I can use it for stuff

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.420
like this all the time.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.500
I'm going to be honest,
I've only ever done this

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.100
to myself once,
usually I'm putting makeup

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.100
on other people.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.600
What does that feel like?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.900
&gt;&gt; It's barely noticeable,
honestly.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.900
Unless I start moving
my face around,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.500
then I can sort of feel
it being tight in spots.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.400
Like where the spirit gum
and where the prosthetic putty,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.500
is sort of like,
resisting where

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.800
my skin would normally move--

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.262
&gt;&gt; But it's not uncomfortable?

00:08:54.362 --> 00:08:57.300
&gt;&gt; No, not at all like, it's less of a feel.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.600
Like, if I had just
a bandaid on my face,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.240
I think I would feel that more,
than I feel this.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.222
&gt;&gt; So when you're doing makeup like this,

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:08.100
you'll notice that I'm not putting nearly
as much red on the prosthetic,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.040
as I am around the eye.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.720
When your skin swells up
in an actual cut or injury,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.700
you're going to have
less blood to that area.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.820
Now there is going to be blood
in the wound of course,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.300
but the redness
is actually going

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.300
to be swelling around it,
and not necessarily right

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.840
on top of the area.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:34.002
[Music]

00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:35.412
How you feeling, Nate?

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.600
&gt;&gt; I got beat up.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:39.700
So, we've got
a pretty good shiner.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.900
We've got his face,
pretty darn puffy.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.000
You can still see the Vaseline,
and the, flour coming through a little bit.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.200
So what we're going to do now,
is we're actually going to slice

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.340
his cheek open,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.700
and add some blood.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.300
You're going to see
that it's just going

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.700
to pull that wax right off.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.622
So, to keep it from doing that,
we're going to add some Vaseline.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.520
Hold still while I
cut your face open.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.820
[Music]

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.000
That cut's going really jagged,
that's actually going to look kind of cool.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.100
Now this, was just
a happy accident.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.680
When Nate smiles-- Nate, smile.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.300
You get this little crinkle
right here.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.600
So I'm actually going to use
that, into the split itself.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.900
Just sort of, add on
to the horror factor.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.200
Now, all I'm going to do is...
add in a little bit of reddening,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.600
and then we're going to set it,
because right now it's very shiny.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.600
You can tell that there's
Vaseline or something there.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.700
So we're going to dull
it down, make it match

00:10:43.752 --> 00:10:46.400
the matte of Nate's skin,
and then we're going, to finish

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.440
with adding some blood.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.800
Are there other ways to do this?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.700
Yes.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.932
Is this more entertaining?

00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:55.982
Also, yes.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.560
&gt;&gt; That smells terrible.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.200
&gt;&gt; There are lots of ways
that you can actually

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.500
make homemade blood but
because we've already

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.900
made our homemade putty,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.100
we're going to go
and use some from

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.400
the theatrical supply store.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.100
You can also get this at Walmart
and at any Halloween shop that

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.960
you want to find.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.300
Make it look most realistic.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.200
Let gravity do its work.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.700
I'm barely tapping it in there,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.780
and I'm going to let it just sort of
fall, the way it naturally would.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.220
Now, let's go out in public.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.880
&gt;&gt; I got beat up by a girl.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.100
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.362
Well, we've successfully,
beat the crud out of Nate.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.400
Sorry Nate,
but I haven't

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.112
gotten to use the latex
or the liquid collodion yet.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.560
Hey Mark, come here.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:12:00.420
[Music]

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.460
So, what you guys
do at work today?

00:12:03.392 --> 00:12:04.900
&gt;&gt; Messed up, pretty bad.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.642
&gt;&gt; Got beat up by a girl.

00:12:06.832 --> 00:12:07.332
Yup.

00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:11.500
&gt;&gt; All right, you have successfully
blackened my eye,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.112
and bloodied up my face...

00:12:13.352 --> 00:12:16.700
But at this time, we want to see
how hard is it to take this off.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.340
Like, if I were doing this
for my Halloween makeup,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.600
going to a party
something like that.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.800
I get done at the end
of the night.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.500
Is it going to take me
forever to clean my face up?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.800
&gt;&gt; No, that's kind
of the best part

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.000
about this sort of makeup.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.100
So, this is just Wish Hazel.

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:31.600
It's an astringent,
wipe it right off.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.680
&gt;&gt; Mmm.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.340
&gt;&gt; Gross.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.240
&gt;&gt; Just wiping off part
of my skin here.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.340
So I had that on, for probably
two or maybe three hours,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.900
and it was staying on just fine.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.160
Like, it worked pretty well.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.900
I think you could
easily have that on

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.800
for an evening for a party,
something like that.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.400
&gt;&gt; But honestly, if you just
take some makeup wipes to it,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.900
it's not going
to hurt your skin.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.400
The worst thing
is the spirit gum,

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.600
and that will come off
in the shower,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.060
if you really need it to.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.600
So...

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.900
&gt;&gt; I think even most
of that's gone.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.100
Thank you to Calli for sharing
her knowledge with us.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.200

some fun makeup that you

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.400
want to try for Halloween.
