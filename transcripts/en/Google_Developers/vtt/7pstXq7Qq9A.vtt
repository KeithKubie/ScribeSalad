BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.210
Good afternoon, or good
morning, everyone.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.610
Welcome to the second in our
week-long series highlighting

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.530
some of the fantastic
examples in our

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.510
Creative Sandbox gallery.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.360
Today's episode will be around
YouTube, which we're very

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.830
excited about.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.020
We've got two agencies on the
line, as well as a digital

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.120
production company.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.420
And we'll go ahead and introduce
those in a moment.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.210
I'm Brian Moroz.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.910
I'm a Creative Lead
here at Google.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.930
And to my left is Jeff.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.215
JEFF POSNICK: Hi, everybody.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.430
I'm Jeff Posnick from
the YouTube

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
BRIAN MOROZ: So we're going to
be first speaking with Ogilvy

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.630
out of Paris.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.400
Then we'll be talking to
Saatchi LA and Stopp.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.950
Initially, we're going
to talk to Thomas out

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.080
of Paris right now.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
And he has a beautiful view
out of his window of the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.560
Eiffel Tower this evening,
if you can see that.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.840
And we're going to talk about
a Perrier campaign.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.195
So, why don't we go ahead
and run the video.

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:49.550
So we'll take a look at the
campaign and then we will go

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.350
live to Thomas and we'll have
a conversation about it.

[CLUB MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.970
ART DIRECTOR: It started
with a simple truth--

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.900
the more people in a room, the
hotter the temperature.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.270
So we decided to find a way to
bring this to life digitally.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.480
The more hits a film gets, the
hotter its story gets.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.840
By going into the club Perrier,
viewers will enter

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840
into the hottest nightclub
ever seen.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.970
Trust me.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.690
We shot a close interior several
times, each take

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.450
becoming more crowded and
hotter than before.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.810
CREATIVE DIRECTOR: And the
result is the first YouTube

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.870
video to evolve with the
number of viewers.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.790
And to make sure it would go
viral, every viewer had to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.800
invite all of their friends to
see the project in order to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.840
advance to the next hotter
version of the video.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.135
Thanks to Facebook, Twitter,
and email.

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:01.740
As the number of it rose, so did
the temperature as the new

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.430
stories were revealed.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.010
And as the temperature soared,
so did the sexiness.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.010
It got so hot, even the lamp
itself started to melt.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.510
We turned an unusual, individual
experience into a

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.970
massive social project.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.899
ART DIRECTOR: A unique club
deserves unique music, so we

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.920
created a one-of-a-kind
band to play there.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.410
Babe Youth has raised a
five-title EP, including the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.285
Le Club track, Break Me, which
has since been remixed by DJs

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:32.120
all over the world.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.190

three weeks, 11.5 million

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.940

first video into

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.150
amazingly sexy content.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.280
The experience has been hotly
discussed on TV and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.720
thousands of blogs.

becoming the first ad in France
ever Tweeted about

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.310
during the campaign.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.190
CREATIVE DIRECTOR: I thought of
a new way of using YouTube,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.790
and prove that Perrier is the
ultimate refreshment when

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.530
things turn hot.

that two girls were kissing

that's a good idea.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.920
I feel overdressed now.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.730
I feel like I'm very
inappropriately dressed for

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.903
the rest of this piece.

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:39.770
So, risque bordering on the edge
of appropriateness in a

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.310
very fun way.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.910
Thomas, can you tell us
a little bit about--

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.160
just tell us about the campaign,
kind of where the

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.810
idea came from, the steps
you guys took.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.570
And just give us a two minute
overview of how

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.950
that all went down.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.300
THOMAS: Yeah, for sure.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.760
Actually, of course it's
a bit provocative.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.550
Maybe it's more provocative for
American people than for

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.600
French people, but
we're Perrier.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.320
We've been in France for
over 20 years now.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.730
And we've always played
provocative [? coats ?].

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.410
And what we've been--

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.270
actually, the brand has been at
the agency working with us

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.410
for a bit more than
20 years now.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.305
And we've been really helping
them developing their presence

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:25.390
on the digital space for the
past four years now.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.780
So, what we've tried to achieve
all the time with them

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.450
is to create a digital presence
that would be

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.520
relevant to the brand,
to [? Commis. ?]

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.830
And that's really where it
started from on this

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.670
execution, and on the previous
execution with them.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.760
So, basically we are too
constrained on this.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.970
When we started, we wanted to
create an innovative digital

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.880
experiment, and we wanted to be
true to the promise of the

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.630
brand, which is ultimate
refreshment

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.630
when things turn hot.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.370
So, when you talk about ultimate
refreshment when

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.630
things turn hot, it can be read
as a physical benefit, of

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.190
course, but also as an
emotional benefit.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.940
And when people get too close
to each other, things turn

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.510
hot, as well, on many
different levels.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.740
And that's what we
wanted to show.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.600
Or actually we made--

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.140
the starting point of the idea
was really one inside which

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.650
was the more people you got in
a room, the hotter it gets,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.800
the hotter the temperature gets,
and that's when you need

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.270
a Perrier to refresh yourself.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.510
So, we thought that
was really true.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.090
That was [INAUDIBLE] when
you're in a club, but we

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.755
wanted to create that online.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.080
And then we ended up thinking,
OK, what's the best way to

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.750
create that kind of
experiment online?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.980
We will create the first
scenario of a club where the

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.910
video evolves with the
number of viewers.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:07.860
And we quite quickly we found
that the best place to make

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.010
this apparent was YouTube,
because that's where our

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.950
target is going.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.660
That's where basically we're
targeting 25- to 35- year-old

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.700
people, quite hedonist
and party guys.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.200
So, that's where they are on
YouTube and that's where they

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.900
will share what they like.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.240
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.690
So let me ask a question about
the idea generation process.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.590
So, I think that the way that
you guys used that insight was

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.830
fascinating-- the more
people in the room,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.480
the hotter it gets.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.450
And the direction you took it
was funny, it was amusing, it

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.000
was titillating, and it was,
obviously, people were

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.570
interested in it.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.490
So, given that you took that
idea, where did the idea of

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.000
changing the actual video
content depending on the

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.980
viewer number come from?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.870
How did you guys come
up with that?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.530
Is that something that you had
thought about before and

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.720
wanted to apply to this?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.140
Did that come out of the
process of ideation?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.890
Where did you guys
come to that?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.590
THOMAS: That's something that
actually came out from the

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.980
agency itself.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.450
Actually, we've been thinking
as much in terms of creative

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.795
execution, as in much of
innovative technology.

00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:13.430
We wanted to have something
that's never been done before,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.290
that people would
talk about it.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.870
We wanted to have something
very social [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.760
that people want to share.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.280
So, that's really an idea that
came from the agency at the

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.400
very beginning.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.980
But, quite quickly, we also
had to involve all the

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.580
partners, which were of course
YouTube, the media agency,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.116
some developers as well, because
we've been working

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:40.366
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.930
And we quickly had to all meet
together in a room to make

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.510
sure that we could make it
happen and find the best way

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.280
to make it happen.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.545
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:55.270
And so to follow up with that,
what were the roadblocks you

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.620
ran into, if any?

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.570
And what were the
breakthroughs?

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.380
How did that process work when
you said, OK, we have this

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.780
idea, it's a pretty clear idea,
but on the technological

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.820
front, on the creative front,
what were the really difficult

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.910
areas, if any?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.870
Or did it go fairly smoothly?

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.610
THOMAS: Actually, we've
had quite a short

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.145
time to develop that.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:16.430
I think we did it in about
two months and a half.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.680
So, it's been a very
rapid process.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.470
That's why we got that everyone
at the same place at

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.760
the very beginning.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.890
And we knew quite well what
we wanted to achieve.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.140
So the main questions were,
how much can we custom our

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.910
channel on YouTube?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.600
Because it was back last year,
and I know the customization

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.360
of channels on YouTube
have been

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.190
developing quite a lot since.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.790
But we just wanted to make
sure that we could, for

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:53.110
example, host our six different
videos on YouTube

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.280
without having them viewed
by everyone.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.580
So that was some basic questions
of, how can we

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.630
hosting at the same place but
not having everyone seeing the

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.940
video before?

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.980
And we had a true need.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.130
That's why we chose
YouTube, as well.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.950
We had [? a 20 to ?]

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:18.250
to make the YouTube channel
become a real club, actually.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.490
So we wanted everyone to gather
in only one very single

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.690
place, which would
be that channel.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.960
So, even in terms of media, we
didn't want to dilute our

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.790
media investment, or
create plenty of

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.060
banners that we were.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.570
And we had to think of a clever
media plan to drive

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.820
everyone on this specific
channel.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.300
So, that's why we work very
closely with YouTube and the

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.500
media agency.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.220
Actually, in terms of media,
it was quite innovative as

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.040
well, because we nearly did
everything on YouTube.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.900
And it really helped us with our
goal, which was to get as

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.810
many people as possible
on our channel.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.040
And in the end, we get like 11
million people in our club, in

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.950
[? sweewix ?] and
[? our house. ?]

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.800
So, that's pretty cool.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.390
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, that's a
lot of people in a club.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:10.770
Very cool.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.820
And Jeff, did you
have a comment?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.036
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:12.940
I actually did.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.190
You mentioned one of the issues
that you faced was

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.890
making sure that viewers saw the
right video and that the

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.690
videos that were for the
different level of view count

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.920
weren't already exposed
in your channel.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.730
Can you talk a little bit about
how you solved that

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.600
technical problem?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.870
THOMAS: Actually, I'm not
a technical expert.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.030
So maybe I won't go into more
details, but you'll be better

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.140
than me at that.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.070
But basically what we did is
that we had only two trailers

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:48.200
were hosted on the classic
YouTube listing, I would say,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.530
the one you arrived first.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.680
And they were really like
drivers to your channel, and

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.240
then on the channel we had the
video seen in a background

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.060
layer, I would say--

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.390
I'm not sure you
would say that.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.486
And we just unlocked them--

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.420
sorry, sorry about my French--

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.880
we just unlocked them depending
on the number of

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.300
viewers, we managed
to [? switch. ?]

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.050
BRIAN MOROZ: Right.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.260
And how did you use other
media, social media, et

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.410
cetera, just to drive people?

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.805
Because that 11 million number
is an impressive number.

00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:26.400
It's something a lot of people
would like to have on their

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.260
brand channel, or
on their pages.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.060
What did you do besides,
obviously, clear just word of

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.280
mouth of this particularly
compelling campaign?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.260
How did you guys drive
people there?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.130
THOMAS: Actually, we tried to
add to the [? campaign ?] as

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.460
many elements of
share-ability.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.130
For example, at the end of each
video we invited people

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.880
to share the video or the
channel or link their Facebook

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.010
or Twitter account.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:14:00.080
And if they did so, they could
see in exclusivity the next

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.180
video before anyone else,
only one time.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.770
So, there were some incentives
to have people--

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.060
to get people excited
about it.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:16.840
But to be fairly honest, we
found it to be complicated to

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.570
find the best way to make people
go from Facebook to

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.170
YouTube and from YouTube
to Facebook.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.360
And in the end, we also wanted
to increase our consumer

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.130
database on Facebook and it
didn't work so well, even the

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.320
number of people we've
had on YouTube.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.980
The link between the two
were not as good as

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.790
we would have liked.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.251
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:14:40.251 --> 00:14:43.020
OK.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.220
And I think it's also
interesting, just to point out

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.510
what you said, that the way
that you guys incentivized

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.840
people to share the content
was give them access to

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.960
further content.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.110
It's not that you were giving
them a product or a discount.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.060
You were like, you're going to
get even more of this content,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.580
meaning your content was
compelling enough that people

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.980
were willing to share it
to see more of it.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.890
I think that's a really
interesting, really cool idea.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.250
THOMAS: That was really the
idea of the campaign.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.720
And when we were watching
other people commenting,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.200
people were saying,
come on guys,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.950
come and use the channel.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.810
I want to see the next.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.395
That's fun.

00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:15.890
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.900
I just wanted to throw out
something there that we

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.800
actually have a fairly new API
that I don't think was around

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.860
when you were developing this
campaign, so it's obviously

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.540
not something that you used.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.660
But it is actually an analytics
API that exposes

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.260
YouTube analytics data, similar
to what you get

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:34.990
through the website.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.510
And I know that your campaign
is very much driven by basic

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.360
view count analytics, but just
throw out there something

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.310
interesting that you
can now do that you

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.390
weren't able to do before--

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.980
is maybe take a look
at more detailed

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.600
breakdown of who is watching.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.590
I don't think you necessarily
want to unlock the video only

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.210
if people in your target
demographic view it, because

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.510
that could be maybe a
little weird, maybe

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.110
a little not weird.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.310
But it definitely gives you a
little bit more control to do

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.420
more fine-grain things than
just raw view count

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.400
information.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.565
THOMAS: I think actually we got
a report of all viewers

00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:13.270
done by Google afterwards.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.040
But it was like three months
after, so we could have earned

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.540
money too directly during
the campaign.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.600
And maybe we could have adjusted
our media investment

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.800
to be more precise towards
our target.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.280
BRIAN MOROZ: But the numbers are
pretty good, regardless.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.110
So, let me ask you a question
about who at the agency worked

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.630
on the project.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.915
Because, of course, from agency
to agency, and even

00:16:34.915 --> 00:16:37.930
just from project to project,
the people who make up the

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.280
teams that do this kind of
really fascinating work tend

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.410
to be different.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.690
So, can you tell us a little bit
about who over at Ogilvy

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.320
kind of came together
to make this happen?

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.970
THOMAS: Yeah, for sure.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.630
Basically at Ogilvy, we've got
a core team working on

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.930
Perrier, which is made of
Creative Executive Officer,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.420
Chris Garbutt.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.740
Our Managing Director,
[? Bernard ?]

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.940
[? DeFleurian ?]

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.610
is very much involved on the
brand, because he's been

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.450
working on it for 25
years from now.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.130
And the account director.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.329
And then we've got Frederic
Levron, who is Head of

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.510
Digital, who worked on it,
and a team of [? fall ?]

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.589
creatives, one Creative
Director, Thierry Chiumino.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.819
And then three young
creatives, but very

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:20.810
brilliant--

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.960
Baptiste Clinet, Nicolas
Lautier, and Florian Bodet.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.130
And one Digital Producer,
which is Hugo Diaz.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.720
So that's the core team
of the agency.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.490
And we really welcome the
conception and the

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.830
coordination of all the work.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.550
We also worked with our TV
production, with Laure Bayle

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.890
for the production of all the
films, because we've been

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.440
shooting these six films in
three days in a cave in

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.040
Romania and it was minus five.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.220
And there are plenty
of [? canister ?]

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.080
behind the scenes.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.300
But they did an amazing
job on this as well.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.140
So that was the core
team at the agency.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.210
And we worked with a production
company outside

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.290
which is B-Reel London.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.140
We had been working with B-Reel
New York before to

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.130
develop Perrier [? many ?]

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.580
times, seven and ten.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.780
So they helped us to imagine the
digital development of the

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.900
custom channel.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.070
And we worked very closely with
the YouTube engineers

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.750
just to answer basic questions,
because there are

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.890
plenty of questions raising--

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.020
concerning what we could do
and if we could achieve

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.820
exactly what we wanted
to achieve.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.580
BRIAN MOROZ: Got it.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.400
And so that's a couple of
interesting points I actually

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.430
would love to delve into
just for a moment.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.570
One, it sounds like you had a
lot of creatives working on

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.950
this-- like every stage
of their career.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.030
It sounded like you have people
that have been working

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.360
with Perrier for decades, and
you mentioned you have some

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.830
really young creatives
on that.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.860
Was that a conscious
decision--

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.090
Let's get people in from all
across the board-- different

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.560
ages, experience levels?

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.160
Is that something you guys
did intentionally?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.430
Did you just-- you just needed
the manpower, so

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.460
that's how it happened?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.400
Why did you do such a broad
swath of experience and

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.350
backgrounds and so on?

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.530
THOMAS: I think for some very
specific reasons, we've got

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.180
some young creatives which are
very much in line with our

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.470
target audience, and which are
very much able to develop some

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.420
media-neutral creative ideas.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:29.830
And I think basically that the
best to find the right

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.790
[? insight, ?]

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.810
that kind of [? leverage ?].

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:38.240
And these teams, we called them
the BNFs, who came up

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.020
with the idea of the more people
there are in a room,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.310
the hotter it gets, and the
transformation of it on the

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.270
digital battle.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.440
That's really the freshness
and youngness we

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.920
were looking for.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.770
And after that, Perrier is a
brand we've had for a very,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.490
very long time.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.470
It has a very, very specific
tone of voice and brand DNA

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.910
which we wanted to
always preserve.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.870
So that's why we've got
some more senior

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.640
people on top of it.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.850
And of course, they're not
implied in the everyday stages

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.050
of the development, but they
were implied in the

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.190
conceptualization at the very
beginning and the association

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.785
of our client as well.

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:24.520
BRIAN MOROZ: Gotcha.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.340
And that of course gives the
client, I think, a little bit

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.980
of confidence, as well hopefully
to say that, look,

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.090
this is a pretty crazy idea
but you trust us, right?

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.170
THOMAS: Yeah, for sure.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.620
Actually, I must thank our
client as well, because he's

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.810
always been quite
bold with us.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.610
He's been trusting
us quite a lot.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.620
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.780
they've never been disappointed,
but they've got

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.725
some balls.

00:20:51.725 --> 00:20:52.130
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.850
And I have one more quick
question for you on something

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.870
you mentioned, which is that the
production values in this

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.370
were actually quite high.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.650
You had film production
out there, you were

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.930
in a cave in Romania.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.420
That's a lot of money spent and
a lot of time spent to do

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.500
some really high-level work
for YouTube, which can

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.390
sometimes be a challenge, I
think, for people to wrap

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.330
their heads around and brands
to wrap their heads around

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.510
that you could put some really
high-quality stuff on this and

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.830
it will draw attention.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.030
Did you guys have to
fight for that?

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.700
Is that something that the
client kind of grasped?

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.740
And have you done
more of that?

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.840
Or have you done
it in the past?

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.890
Or was this your first
experience with producing

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.380
something really high-quality,
television quality for that--

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:34.000
THOMAS: Actually, it's an
everyday education of the

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.310
client, I would say, because
the challenge was really to

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:43.510
explain them that when you're
thinking digital, you should

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.850
not think, OK, low cost in
production, low cost in media,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.610
and I'll do a great
[? best. ?]

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.430
And we're Perrier.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.730
We've always had some very
high-quality executions, and

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.150
we didn't want to lower them
because we wanted to lower the

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:01.770
production costs.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:07.380
So basically, the main thing
we had to make the client

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.020
understand is that when it comes
to digital, we need to

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.150
keep the same high level of
production, but maybe we can

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.490
play a bit differently with
the media amount to have a

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.220
repartition which is
a bit different.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.980
And that's what we've been
doing already before with

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.150
That's what we've done
on Le Club Perrier.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:35.170
And that's what we've done as
well for our next production,

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.650
which will come next year.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.600
I hope you like it.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.930
But that's an education,
basically, we've been doing

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.600
with our client for
years and years.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.670
And it comes to the manner,
and they understand the

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.880
notions of [? earn ?]

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.980
media as well, which you can get
on the digital, not on the

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.790
TV, basically.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.730
So they're quite [? aware ?]
that now but we've been

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.360
fighting quite a lot before.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:08.765
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:09.610
Great.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.410
So, just to wrap up, if you
were going to give one

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.380
recommendation to another
creative or another agency

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.140
that says--

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.270
I would love to do something of
this ilk, or something just

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.560
in this direction, this is
really inspiring to me-- what

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.760
would your single piece
of advice be to them?

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.940
THOMAS: I think basically, given
the process we've been

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.330
following, I think the
most important--

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.840
can I say two things?

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.740
BRIAN MOROZ: OK, two.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.030
THOMAS: OK.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.860
So the first one is, I think
when you are trying to develop

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.010
some innovative ideas online,
you need to keep it simple.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:48.400
As long as the idea is based on
a true insight and can be

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.250
expressed in one sentence,
then to me, it means that

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.750
anyone would understand it and
everyone will want to join it.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.780
And I think maybe sometimes
we like to over-think some

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.520
concepts, and end up with some
huge scenes which only huge

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.970
geeks can understand.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.730
That doesn't work for me.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.750
So that's the first point.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.530
And the second point, to me, is
really, once you get your

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.620
idea, once you get that line and
you know more or less what

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.710
you want to achieve, don't wait
a minute to put everyone

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:26.290
the same place and make it go
together, because we can't as

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.350
alone the creative agency
develop everything.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.110
We need the media, we need the
techniques, and we need to

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.280
gather everyone to make
the best of it.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.350
And sometimes we tend to work
too much in separate places

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.487
before we gather, and I think
we are missing some stuff at

00:24:44.487 --> 00:24:45.540
that point.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.910
BRIAN MOROZ: Those are excellent
pieces of advice,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.790
and thank you so much
for joining us.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.620
THOMAS: Thank you very
much for inviting me.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.520
BRIAN MOROZ: If you can stay
on the line, we will--

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.940
for a Q&amp;A afterwards.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.960
But at this point, let's go
ahead and switch over to

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.250
Saatchi LA and the digital
production company, Stopp.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.865
Are you guys around?

We're here.

00:25:06.542 --> 00:25:07.180
BRIAN MOROZ: There they are.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.470
OK.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.490
There's a whole gang over there,
so I'm going to go

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.820
ahead and-- well, first,
let's go ahead and run

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.530
what you guys did.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.850
Let's take a look at the reel.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.350
And then maybe we can just do a
quick around-the-table, and

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.970
you can introduce yourself and
your part that you played in

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.690
this particular creative.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.860
So let's go ahead
and run that.

00:25:25.652 --> 00:25:29.640
MALE SPEAKER: In 2012, Toyota
debuted the Prius C, a compact

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.720
hybrid built for young
adults looking to buy

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.800
their first new car.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.910
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.820
To let them build their own
Prius C, we transformed a

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.620
traditional online shopping
tool, an old-school car

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.550
configurator, into something
that speaks their language.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:26:04.280
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.520
Users start building their Prius
C by choosing a color,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.110
then choosing their technology,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.630
and wheels, and seats.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:37.120
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.940
Prius C Configurator crossed
the line from a same-old,

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.800
washed-up site experience into
pure entertainment, ushering

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.660
in an era where online car
shopping doesn't have to suck.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.230
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.640
So, a lot going on with this and
a lot of stuff to discuss.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.610
I think it's really interesting,
and I personally

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.580
have a lot of questions.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.460
But before we do that, can we
go ahead and, like you said,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.900
let's go around the table and
maybe just start with Melissa

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.720
over at Saatchi LA.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.020
MELISSA ECCLES: Hi, I'm
Melissa Eccles.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.660
I'm the Associate Director of
Integrated, which just means

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.710
I'm a producer.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.560
And I was the EP on the
project overseeing the

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.810
production.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:22.740
TOMOS EVANS: Hi.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.390
I'm Tom Evans.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.060
I look after social media things
here at Saatchi LA.

The main kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.470
is looking at how, where,
[INAUDIBLE] reach out to

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.166
[? isn't ?] working out, what's
the right platform to

00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:35.416
engage people with, and why.

interactive-based content.

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:49.690

on this project.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.765
I'm Erek Vinluan.

00:27:51.765 --> 00:27:53.040
I'm a creative.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.380
We had two creative teams
working on this, and I'm one

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.395
Creative Director and I'm one
of the Art Directors.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.160
BRIAN MOROZ: And Zak?

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.240
ZACHARY RICHTER: Yeah.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.240
This is Zachary Richter,
Creative Director at Stopp LA.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.750
Basically played a role in
working with all of the film,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.700
design, art direction, and kind
of just helping out in

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.350
the overall creative vision of
the actual production of the

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.600

00:28:20.515 --> 00:28:24.670
I'm Bo, Technical Director and
[? staff ?] for this project.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.810
Basically, sitting next
to Zak on everything.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.370
BRIAN MOROZ: All right,
you guys.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.510
So, this is a big idea.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.890
There is a lot going on in it.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.960
There's lots of filming, there's
lots of technical

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.335
details, there's all
kinds of stuff I

00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:39.590
would love to dig into.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.810
But just to start off, if you
can maybe lead us through--

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.140
how did this idea get developed
within the agency?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.150
With the client?

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.560
Just, what was that
process like?

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.030
MELISSA ECCLES: Well, it was a
little bit risky, actually.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.210
It was something that was
very, very focused on a

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.780
specific target.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.700
And we thought to ourselves,
how can we reinvent the

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.550
shopping process?

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.990
How can we reinvent the
experience that people are

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.640
having when they try
to buy a new car?

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.610
And so we wanted to approach
it from, OK, how does

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.790
everybody look into a car?

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.600
They go to the manufacturer's
website, they start to

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.020
investigate, and maybe if they
get far enough along in the

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.220
process, they decide that they
want to configure a car.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.450
And we wanted to do this in a
way and on a platform where

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.860
our target already was.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.160
And that platform was YouTube.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.220
So we thought of, what is a
different way to do this

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.890
experience?

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.520
And the idea of a live-action
car configurator came up.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.000
And we thought, well, wouldn't
it be fun to see this in a

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.440
different way?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.400
So that's what we did.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.070
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.450
So just an extension of that
question-- so it sounds like

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.570
the idea came early-- you pretty
much knew what you

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.940
wanted to do, but again,
there's so many

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.600
moving pieces here.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.620
How exactly did you decide, at
both Stopp and at Saatchi LA,

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.570
how did you decide what
technologies you

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.070
were going to use?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.270
How you were even going to
just piece this together

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.720
because there is a
lot to do here?

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720
What was that process like?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.620
Did that come early in
the ideation process?

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.250
Or did you say, let's come up
with the idea and we'll figure

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.170
this out two months from now?

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.290
When did the actual hard
technology bit

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.900
start coming in?

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.870
MELISSA ECCLES: It actually
started pretty early.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.630
We knew we wanted to
partner with Stopp.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.770
They were involved from pretty
much the beginning, as far as

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.750
the creative ideation
was concerned.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.660
And so we said, what's the
best way to deliver this?

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.190
And how are we going to
innovate, which we decided to

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.760
do one of the first projects
really using interactive video

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.630
on the platform.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.910
And then basically we partnered
with Stopp to figure

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.000
out how to execute that.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.710
And Bo can talk about that
a little bit more.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.160
BO GUSTAVSSON: Well, one of the
first things we realized

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.050
was when we were actually seeing
how many different

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.530
options you have for this car.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.740
And you could go through this
Configurator basically back

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.030
and forth and selecting all
different colors and different

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.560
extra options.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.560
We realized this was going to
be a lot of videos, and we

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.200
asked how we should piece these
together and how we

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.920
should shoot them was a pretty
big document that we were

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.960
working on, and many versions.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.250
Every version of this document,
we realized, Oh, we

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:24.980
need 20 more videos, and Oh,
this option adds 70 new videos

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.960
and it just--

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.690
but we still have the same
amount of time to shoot it.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:34.740
So we had to optimize how to
shoot and work really fast in

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.715
creating all those videos.

00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:36.360
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.090
And I kind of have a technical
question about how you managed

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.270
those separate sections
of videos.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.380
Was it like one big video and
you'd have specific time codes

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.170
and say, jump here and then use
the API to stop playback?

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.770
Or did you have separate videos
for each of those

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.890
individual things?

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.000
BO GUSTAVSSON: Every single
option was shot separately, so

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.730
we knew we had the option
to use them separately.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.680
And that was the option we
ended up with in the end.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.520
So we had about 500 different
videos that we could piece

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.000
together in many variations.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.800
So, the other option that he
talked about is like having--

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.850
rendering out all the different
options would've

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.947
been way more videos
than we planned on.

00:32:21.947 --> 00:32:22.781
BRIAN MOROZ: Sure.

00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:25.200
Yeah, but it was plenty to begin
with, it sounded like,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.700
and plenty that you guys
ended up with, anyway.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:34.150
So, my question for
Saatchi LA--

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.690
how did you guys put
together the team?

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.270
So, much like my question to
Thomas, how did you pick who

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.100
is going to work on this?

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.690
Who came together to actually
make this happen?

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.660
MEGAN BETTOR: Sure.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.080
We can answer that together.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.740
EREK VINLUAN: Yeah, so for the
Prius C launch, we had two

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.670
creative teams, a designer,
a [? live-wire ?]

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.880
creative director.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:00.880
And we're the team that came up
with the TV, print, I-media

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.940
and this car configurator.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.960
So we kind of worked
across all mediums.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.460
So it's not like a specific team
was selected to work on

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.590
configurator.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.740
It was everyone that
was assigned under

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.630
the umbrella launch.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.140
MEGAN BETTOR: Yeah, I think it's
becoming a-- this project

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.540
was a true test of it, but it's
becoming pretty standard

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:27.470
for how we work at Saatchi LA
is as what's under my title

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.720
kind of indicated, can it
truly is integrated and

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.810
everyone works across
all platforms

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.590
based on the concept.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.730
And we're lucky to have under
one roof a lot of the teams in

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.610
the same agency.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.610
So the social team is highly
integrated from the beginning,

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.930
in terms of strategy, as is
UX and design, creative

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.490
production.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.260
And then we work across those
platforms so that I--

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.560
it's not piecemeal, and it's
someone's not creating the

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.190
video and then passing it off
to developers, where we're

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.015
working on it all together,
which helps with this new

00:33:58.015 --> 00:34:00.370
lesson is especially on
a project like this.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.720
EREK VINLUAN: Yeah, and also
I'll add that we've kind of

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.240
come to a place where creatives
work across all

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.070
mediums now.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.170
We don't work in silos here.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.350
If you work on TV, you'll
work on a banner ad.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.010
If you work on a banner ad,
you'll work on print.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.310
BRIAN MOROZ: Wow.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.580
OK, that's--

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.170
EREK VINLUAN: And it's all the
same problem-solving--

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:24.697
communicate the message
with words and art.

00:34:24.697 --> 00:34:25.639
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah,
that's great.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:29.620
And I think that that's
something that is--

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.520
it's easy to say that everyone
should do that.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.150
It's much harder to
actually do it.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.679
So it sounds like you guys
actually did that, and that is

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.290
a big step.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.719
And I think it makes things
maybe complicated, but it

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:42.179
leads to these very
nice integrated

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:45.380
kind of seamless concepts.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.469
Let me ask you a question
on the client side.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.750
How did they respond
to this when you

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.420
approached them with it?

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.870
Was it a total layup,
easy sell?

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.029
Were they concerned about
the complexity?

00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:56.048
How did that go?

00:34:56.048 --> 00:34:57.370
MEGAN BETTOR: I think we--

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.290
and Melissa can answer this
too-- but I think we tried to

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.000
keep it sounding more simple
than it really

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.720
turned out to be.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.430
And I think we also learned
along the way how

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.100
complicated--

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.790
it just continued, as Bo kind of
mentioned too, it grew and

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.540
grew and grew.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.600
The idea was very simple in its
essence, but the execution

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.330
of it became very complicated.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.670
And they kind of had to come
on that ride with us.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.380
But maybe they don't know all
the bits and pieces behind the

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.930
curtain as well.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.130
MELISSA ECCLES: I think we're
really lucky, too.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.390
We've got a longstanding 30-
year-plus relationship with

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.290
our client.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.340
And they said, all right, if
this is what your consumer

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.370
insights are telling you, if
this is where your users are,

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.450
then we're willing to take
that risk with you.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.810
And it paid off with the
time of engagement.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.490
TOMOS EVANS: I think that was
the key, as well, is knowing

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.570
where the audience was and
understanding was that this

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.540
was a new product which
was reaching

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.090
out to a new audience.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.360
And then we needed to do
something different to really

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.770
engage them and make them
understand what the product

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.200
was and why it was
the car for them.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.960
BRIAN MOROZ: Gotcha.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.360
Was there any one major
technical or YouTube-based

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.960
stumbling point that you
guys can point out?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.150
Or was it just lots of little,
tiny stumbling points that you

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.330
just overcame bit by bit?

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.040
MEGAN BETTOR: I think Bo
can speak to this, too.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.470
But I think, because it ended
up being so many videos that

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.490
had to work together, and that,
in essence, we wanted it

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.740
to feel like one extended
theatrical performance in one

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.120
video piece-- was about how to
make those transitions both in

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.550
how we shot it and then how we
put the videos together on

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.880
YouTube that was probably
the trickiest part for

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.890
seamlessness.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.430
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.330
And I think this is a piece of
feedback that we hear all the

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.010
time from developers who want
to have a seamless playlist

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.190
experience with different
videos, but you don't want the

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.980
buffering in between the end of
one video and the beginning

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.090
of the next video.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.850
From looking and playing around
with the actual live

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:01.114
campaign, it seems like you
guys did a great job.

00:37:01.114 --> 00:37:05.240
It seemed in general very
seamless, and things kind of

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.150
jumped smoothly, or maybe
not jumped smooth--

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.060
where it was smooth.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.350
So obviously, you found
a workable solution.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.080
So that was definitely cool.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.200
BO GUSTAVSSON: Yeah, we
definitely found different

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:22.040
ways to use the [? Kronos ?]
player of the YouTube API in,

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.720
I think, probably the
best way possible.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.280
But we were planning on a lot
of buffering, and a lot of

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.680
background loading, because it's
a experience, it takes a

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.210
lot of time to watch.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.590
And therefore, we had a lot
of time to load in the

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:35.915
background.

00:37:35.915 --> 00:37:40.640
But I think in the end, we have
a really solid build.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.090
One nice little hiccup we found
was we also have a big

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:50.020
tool that's based on a Maps
application with an MPG

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.120
calculator, and everything
here is built in Flash.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.700
And during the development time,
the Flash API for the

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.530
Maps part was kind of
dropped from Google.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:09.410
So, there was a little issue
there, but we were able to

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.480
solve that at development.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.980
It was a little scary
there for awhile.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.860
BRIAN MOROZ: I'm going to
point at Jeff on that.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.570
I have nothing to
do with that.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.470
JEFF POSNICK: I will apologize
on behalf of your experience.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.800
BO GUSTAVSSON: Thank you.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.055
BRIAN MOROZ: So actually, while
we have Jeff here, I

00:38:23.055 --> 00:38:27.190
just want to throw him at your
feet since he can run nowhere,

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.770
he's trapped in this
room with me.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.600
If you wanted one or two
things on the YouTube

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.540
development side to make
some of your creative

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.880
ideas come to life--

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.480
this is a brilliant idea, it
was very complex, you guys

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.510
obviously figured out
all these pieces at

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.310
a very quick pace.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.040
Has there been something that
could have made your life

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.930
easier or something down the
line that you would love to

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.380
see, what would that be?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.540
MELISSA ECCLES: That's
a great question.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.540
I think the share-ability factor
with this project and

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.490
the playlist.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.390
That was the biggest challenge
that I saw, as far as the

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.900
metrics coming back.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.270
We really wanted people to be
able to share it easily, and a

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.450
lot of people were feeling like
the sharable playlist

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.050
wasn't as seamless as
it could have been.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.380
And I know we spoke about that a
little bit, but more options

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.380
for customizing that
share-ability and getting

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.380
those playlists to a place where
it can feel like one

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.290
experience versus multiple
video experiences.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.330
JEFF POSNICK: And was the
specific issue because it was

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.690
a playlist of videos versus
sharing a single video?

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.610
And you found some difficulty
around that?

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.260
MELISSA ECCLES: Yeah, in order
to share your configured

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.720
vehicle, we couldn't really
share just one video with

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.580
their configuration.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.810
We had to share a string
of videos that

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.990
went through to them.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:40.080
And when people saw it
originally, they were a little

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.210
bit confused about what it is.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.140
So, trying to find a way to do
that that's a little bit more

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.730
elegant in the next iteration of
the API would be something

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.740
that we'd be really
excited about.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.890
JEFF POSNICK: That's
great feedback.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.360
I'll ask if they can pass that
on to the relevant folks

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.130
internally.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.630
BRIAN MOROZ: Definitely.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.490
And let me ask you guys, because
there's a lot of folks

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.530
on the Hangout right now from
two different groups, right.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:04.820
And I'm sure there's more
people internally.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.720
It sounds like there was
just a whole lot of

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.450
cooks in the kitchen.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.860
How did you guys manage, and
especially given that it is

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.660
not siloed, everyone does kind
of work across all these

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.660
mediums, et cetera--

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.400
how do you manage having
so many brains on

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.650
one enormous idea?

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.860
MELISSA ECCLES: There's
war rooms.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.780
TOMOS EVANS: A lot
of meetings.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.470
MELISSA ECCLES: A
lot of meetings.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.200
MEGAN BETTOR: And a lot of
deferring to our expert

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.370
partners at Stopp.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.640
That's why we bring in
partners like them--

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.850
to help take the lead and help
direct us, too, especially

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.130
when things start to move really
quickly and with a lot

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.480
of factors.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.360
ZACHARY RICHTER: Yeah, I think
to Melissa's point earlier

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.870
when she was talking about
essentially have everything--

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:50.590
just bring us in early on a
project, having us all sort of

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.860
formulate these, bringing
everyone's expertise to the

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.530
table early and having these
workshops in the beginning was

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.120
so important.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.050
We definitely did not feel like
a vendor on this project,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.980
and we really felt like a
partner and that was key to

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.330
making this whole thing go
as smoothly as possible.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.870
There were a lot of hiccups
along the way, but really just

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.900
liked when she was saying,
[? Boo ?] made this document

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.320
early on that showed how many
videos we actually did making

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.190
these giant trees, figuring all
these things out visually,

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.570
and having everyone
together was key.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.450
MELISSA ECCLES: Yeah,
one team one dream.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.090
It sounds cheesy,
but it's true.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.240
And everybody really believed
that we were doing something

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.740
innovative and something
groundbreaking.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.720
So it's easy for people to
collaborate when they're

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.030
really excited about the idea
they're collaborating on.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.910
So it was a dream project
in that respect.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.220
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.050
And it sounds like you had quite
the backing from your

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.150
client, too, which that always
helps as well, to say, no,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.040
we've got the green light on
this as long as we can pull it

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.660
all together.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.530
MELISSA ECCLES: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.600
JEFF POSNICK: Now might be a
good time to mention that we

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.920
are taking questions from
the general viewing

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.550
audience right now.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.750
We have a Google Moderator
link that should be

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.040
somewhere below me.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.820
And feel free to add whatever
questions that you might have

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.610
after watching what we've been
talking about to supplement

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.440
the types of questions
we're asking.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.680
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, and so just
to ask you guys one further

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.790
question, I'm going to ask you
the same question I asked

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:12.240
Thomas which is, if you had one,
or in his case two, one

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.280
or two insights that if that you
were going to share with

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.120
another person who said, I'm
thinking about doing something

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.620
that's kind of similar in this
vein, it's a big idea, it's

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.280
really complicated, lots of
video, what would be the one

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.080
or two things you would say,
this is absolutely necessary

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.750
and we learned this
in this process?

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.460
TOMOS EVANS: I think one
of the keys was really

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.460
understanding the audience and
being able to tie that back to

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.150
the product, because if we
were doing this for a

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.790
different product, this wouldn't
have been the right

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.480
place to do it.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.550
So having that and really being
clear from Day One on

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.030
that really, really
helps a lot.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.170
BRIAN MOROZ: So know
your audience.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.260
That's something
that honestly--

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.630
and that's actually a very
good insight and one that

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.460
maybe gets missed sometimes when
people get very excited

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.910
about a particular technology.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.060
Because it's easy to say, we
could do this really flashy

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.370
thing, but having that focus
on the audience is a really

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.660
great piece of advice to people
that are actually

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.410
thinking of developing
something like this.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.590
So, before we cut over to see if
we've got some questions on

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.550
the moderator tool, any
last comments or

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.020
questions from you guys--

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.500
Saatchi LA, or Stopp?

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.650
Either just in general on the
project, the experience, or

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:26.180
any final questions or requests
of Jeff and YouTube?

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.360
ZACHARY RICHTER: I would say--

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.670
sorry, I was going to say one
thing that we definitely

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.830
learned and if we could do it
all over again would be to

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.710
have all these technologies
solidified upfront.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.200
We worked at such a fast pace
that to have things changing

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.770
and moving along the way, that
definitely creates hiccups and

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.410
you spend more time working on
these things that could have

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.160
been solidified instead of
working on the actual

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.920
creative, and I think that
definitely hindered part of

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.570
it, hindered a little bit of
the seamlessness that we

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.350
discussed earlier.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.240
But overall, I think everything
went pretty

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.500
smoothly, but again, if we could
just have everything

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.980
very, very solidified,
it would've helped.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.010
MELISSA ECCLES: We'd love to
borrow your engineers so we

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.380
could all work in-house
together.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.398
That would be awesome.

00:44:07.398 --> 00:44:08.742
ZACHARY RICHTER: Agreed.

00:44:08.742 --> 00:44:09.890
BRIAN MOROZ: Feel like
going to LA?

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.650
The weather's getting really bad
here in New York, so it's

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:14.230
a good time to make an offer.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.030
MEGAN BETTOR: It's beautiful
in LA, today.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.350
JEFF POSNICK: That does
sound really tempting.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.830
I also wanted to point out that
this is absolutely not

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.560
the only opportunity that folks
have to ask questions of

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.010
me, whether you're one of the
agencies that we've worked

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.150
with, or you're just an average
YouTube developer, the

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.330
Developer Relations team tries
to do our best to answer all

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.740
the questions that come in
related to the YouTube APIs.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.690
And our actual best way of
reaching us right now is

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.280
posting on Stack Overflow--

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.880
which is a website
for developers--

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.220
and tagging your question
with YouTube-API.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.440
And I and my teammates look at
those all the time, and we're

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.970
always happy to help folks.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.640
BRIAN MOROZ: So, we actually do
have a couple of questions

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.700
that have come in.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.660
So I will go ahead and pose
these to everyone on the call.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.110
And this one-- is Thomas
still with us?

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.130
THOMAS: Yes, I'm still there.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.390
BRIAN MOROZ: Thank you, sir.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.450
So was Le Club Perrier
embeddable?

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.190
How did it perform in mobile
devices outside of the regular

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.900
YouTube channel experience?

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.090
So was that embeddable?

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.000
Was that something that you
could move to other devices?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.980
Or was that something
that lived on the

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.450
brand channel only?

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.100
THOMAS: Actually, that's a very
good question and that's

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.950
one of the difficulties we've
had with the custom channel of

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.520
YouTube, because we would have
liked, ideally, to be able to

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.340
give people the same experiment
online, on the

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:37.680
[? device, ?]

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.071
sorry.

00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:42.240
And we found it quite difficult
to get an adaptable

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.860
custom channel, so what
we did is we were

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.300
working with [? APO ?]

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.500
[? Ziad ?]

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.100
and we developed the same kind
of experiment directly on

00:45:54.100 --> 00:46:00.850
[? miad, ?] but we couldn't do
it with YouTube mobile app.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:06.540
So if that's something to
work on guys, that's it.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.190
Very good question.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.860
BRIAN MOROZ: On Saatchi
LA, same thing--

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.300
any mobile work with
the campaign?

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.173
Or was it the same situation
as for Thomas?

00:46:18.173 --> 00:46:19.119
MEGAN BETTOR: Same situation.

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:21.850
It was a--

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:22.560
BRIAN MOROZ: I figured.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.208
OK, so we have another list
of items to work on?

00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:26.200
JEFF POSNICK: We do.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.690
I'll point out that we actually,
back in July at our

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.887
Google I/O conference, announced
something that is

00:46:33.887 --> 00:46:36.570
kind of relevant to the mobile
space, and that's an Android

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.940
player library that will now
allow for native YouTube

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.480
playback within Android
applications.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.810
And it makes it a little bit
easier to do that whole

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.980
embedded playback scenario if
you already have a mobile app.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.620
So that's not something that's
quite public yet, so obviously

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.290
not something you
could have used.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.040
But we're working really hard
on making that publicly

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.030
available and releasing it.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.200
So I think, in that sense,
things might get a little bit

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.336
better soon.

00:47:02.336 --> 00:47:03.620
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.700
And that question, by the
way, was from Tim.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.720
Another question from Peter in
Vancouver, which is very

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.480
similar and I think we just
heard the answer there was,

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.150
how important was mobile
participation to

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.440
the campaign success?

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.410
And it sounds like these were
just not mobile-focused

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.080
campaigns, in this case,
but would've been

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.080
great if they were.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:17.760
THOMAS: Unfortunate.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.210
BRIAN MOROZ: If I'm
not putting words

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.920
into people's mouths.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.520
Another question that just
came through, which was

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.040
actually quite interesting,
from Alex in Los Angeles.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.270
Besides sharing the configured
car to social networks, what

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.200
other CTAs were encouraged?

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.360
Were you able to tie a
configuration down to the

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.740
actual sale of a car?

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.400
How did this integrate across
other media and channels?

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.470
So what were the actions that
you guys were really measuring

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:40.120
and wanting to see?

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.230
And how tightly was it connected
to actual dollar

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.240
sale ROI, et cetera?

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.980
MEGAN BETTOR: For us this
was a bit more,

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.140
it was a new vehicle.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.700
And for our first-time car
buyers, it was more about,

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.820
meet the Prius, an initial
introduction to the vehicle,

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.910
and getting to know it and
all of the elements

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.750
available to you.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.130
So for us, it was really about
engagement and time spent,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.035
which was a shocking metric
for us, actually.

00:48:05.035 --> 00:48:07.525
We had people spending about 22
minutes in the experience.

00:48:07.525 --> 00:48:08.190
BRIAN MOROZ: Whoa!

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.680
MEGAN BETTOR: Yeah.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.930
Crazy, right?

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.960
We've rechecked the numbers
so many times.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.740
That they were spending that
much time going through the

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.780
Configurator, building their
version of the Prius C, and

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.500
entering it again-- so to us
that was the primary element

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.816
for success.

00:48:25.816 --> 00:48:26.810
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:27.110
ZACHARY RICHTER: Yeah.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.750
I was going to say, due to the
time that we actually had to

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.340
launch this, we did have the
idea to tie this experience

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.630
directly in with something that
was going to deliver on

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.060
toyota.com.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.180
But it actually just kind
of ended up being quite

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.400
complicated, and it was more
important that they were just

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.090
actually able to configure their
car and share it than to

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.380
actually have it on toyota.com,
to see it on

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.610
toyota.com.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.330
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.170
22 minutes, that
blows my mind.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.905
That's like a sitcom without
the ads, essentially.

00:48:53.905 --> 00:48:56.700
So when you TiVo a sitcom.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.630
That is crazy.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.330
So that's great.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:04.880
And Saatchi LA, Stopp, Thomas
with Ogilvy, any final

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.410
questions or comments before
we wrap up for today?

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.050
MEGAN BETTOR: That was really--
it was a fun project,

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.140
and it's really exciting to get
to talk about it and share

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.036
it with everybody.

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:16.392
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:49:16.392 --> 00:49:20.180
Yeah, these were both just
beautiful and amazing pieces

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.970
of creative and technology.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.340
And both so totally different
and totally amazing.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.350
So it's been a real pleasure for
us to be able to talk with

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.900
you and for everyone who's
on the Hangout.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.350
So thank you guys, everyone,
so much for

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.780
being here and sharing.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.420
This has been recorded, so we
will be releasing it sometime

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.810
in the next several
days, I believe.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.080
And that information will go out
in the same channels that

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.610
the information for
this Hangout went.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:51.210
And I'll just wrap by saying,
thank you so much to everyone

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.570
here today and for those of you
that are watching at home

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.270
or at your offices.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.580
If you'd like to join tomorrow,
tomorrow we're going

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:01.610
to be discussing some
DoubleClick Rich Media uses

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.120
that we thought were
pretty interesting.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.520
And you can find these fantastic
examples that we

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.810
talked about today, as well
as many others at

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:09.410

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.000
So go check that out if you'd
like to see some further work.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.330
So with that, thanks again so
much to everyone, and we

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.710
really appreciate it.
