00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.440
Although they may not be
immediately apparent,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.910
the consequences of the uncountability
of languages are rather profound.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.300
We'll let sigma be the set
of ASCII characters.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.450
These are all the ones you would
need to write a computer program.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.450
And observe that the set of strings
that represent valid python programs

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.600
is a subset of sigma star.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.100
Each program is a finite
string after all.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.710
And note here that I
chose python arbitrarily.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.230
You could choose any language or
set of languages if you like.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.340
Well, since this set is a subset
of the countable set sigma star,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.810
we have that it is countable.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.020
Thus, there are a countable
number of python programs.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.590
On the other hand, consider this fact,
for any language L, we can define f sub

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.950
L to be the function that is 1
if x is in L, and 0 otherwise.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.850
All such functions are distinct.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.530
So the set of these functions
must be uncountable.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.290
Or in other words, the set of functions
from sigma star to (0,1) is uncountable.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.980
Here's the profound point.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.870
Since the set of valid python
programs is countable, but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.480
the set of functions is not, it follows
that there must be some functions

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.300
that we just can't write
computer programs for.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.960
In fact,
there are uncountably many of them.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.410
So going back to our picture
of the high school classroom,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.420
we can see that the teacher, perhaps
without realizing it, was talking about

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.755
something much more general than
what the student ended up thinking.

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.485
There are only countably many
computer programs that can

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:32.545
follow a finite number of steps
as the student was thinking.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:36.245
But there are uncountably many functions
that fit the teacher's definition.
