&gt;&gt; Hi, so I'm here to talk about RingDroid.
RingDroid is a--Android App that let’s you

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
edit your own ring tones from existing music
on your SD card. So I'm going to demo it right

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.800
now. Now, you’ll see that when RingDroid
starts up you see of a list of available music

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:39.519
that you have, and I am now going to edit
one of my songs and make it into my ring tone.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.559
Notice how RingDroid starts up with a waveform
and with this waveform you can actually see

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.829
what you’re editing and you can move it
around. So I’m going to drag it around and

00:00:47.829 --> 00:01:02.909
show you how this works. And now after I’ve
dragged it around, I can play a preview to

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:15.601
see if this is actually what I wanted to hear
for my ring tone. If I feel happy about it,

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:26.810
I can go edit and save it. Now I can set it
as my default ring tone. Even better than

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.640
that, RingDroid is also great for developers
because with a very simple intent call developers

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.520
can use RingDroid inside their own application.
So I'm going to show a quick, very quick demo

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.631
of that which is, which is a--there is the
app called the sound port. There is--there

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:51.250
is the app called the sound port which lets
you use--which let’s you create your own

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.590
goofy sound board--of goofy sounds, and it
lets the users set their own thing. So I'm

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:10.869
going to start that. Now the idea behind sound
board is that the user can create their own

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.250
icons, create their own sounds, and do whatever
they want, and they edit their sounds by using

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:27.360
RingDroid.
So I'm going to create a button here with

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:52.650
the RingDroid sound. And now, if I try to
pick a sound clip, they’re all I’m taping.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.580
And so now, while I try to take a sound clip
here, it’s going to use RingDroid. So, I

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.190
just clicked the Run RingDroid button, and
that is how I’ve now started RingDroid from

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:16.000
this other application.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.820
And so now I can cut this piece of music out
and, voila! Now I’ve made a sound porter

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.930
that uses that piece of music I’ve selected.
And there you go. So this is how you can use

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.150
RingDroid in another application. Thank you
for watching and search for RingDroid at Android

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.080
Market. It’s free and open forth, so go
out there and grab it. See you.
