00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.380
What the heck is quantum computing?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.820
And should I care?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.380
Hey guys, Crystal here with DNews,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.110
I dont know if you’ve noticed lately, but
there is a new wave of computer technology

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.730
being quietly developed in basement labs and
secret company offices.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.349
I’m talking about “quantum computing”.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.499
Companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM,
not to mention the U.S. government, have started

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.199
investing heavily in the development of quantum
computers in the last few years and news of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.349
their investments is slowly leaking out into
mainstream media.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.390
So what is a quantum computer and why are
all of the major powers that influence our

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.940
lives interested in them?

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.140
Well the short answer is that they promise
to be faster, safer, and better at solving

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.200
certain kinds of problems than our trusty
laptops.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.300
but that’s only one part of the quantum
picture.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.410
First off lets figure out what it means for
something to be “quantum”.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.870
Sometimes “quantum” is used interchangeably
with “small” but that’s not accurate.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.920
Quantum things are happening on all length
scales all the time--the distinction is that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.220
the likelihood that we notice these corrections
on top of Newton’s “classical” physics

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.549
decreases rapidly the bigger you get ...weird.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.880
At the quantum level, a particle can teleport,
travel backwards in time, be “entangled”

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.200
with a distant cousin, and a hypothetical
cat in a box can be both alive and dead.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.190
This apparently fantastical behavior is all
possible because of science… well, physics

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.679
really … and a little math.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.039
Most relevant to our quantum computing plot
is the idea of “superposition” which transcends

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.159
classical deterministic outcomes: alive or
dead, heads or tails, 0 or 1, to describe

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.560
these states as a distribution of probabilities:
“the cat has a 70% probability of being

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.649
alive” and as a funny outcome of the science
we don’t get a fixed answer until we actually

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.939
open the box and observe the cat, take a measurement,
or otherwise ask the system for a specific

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:49.939
output.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.869
A computer capable of exploiting this and
other quantum properties, like entanglement,

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.549
would not be constrained by a classical computer’s
need to perform calculations sequentially

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.579
because quantum bits would be capable of existing
in a probability of many states and thus,

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.070
be much better at tasks like simulating molecular
bonds, performing rapid searches of complicated

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.450
databases, or factoring large numbers very
quickly.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.650
These examples may seem silly or irrelevant
until you learn, for instance, that factorization

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.200
is prohibitively time-consuming for a classical
computer, which is why it forms one common

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.760
approach to data encryption.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.630
Now, quantum computers are looking pretty
good, especially if you have an interest in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.810
National Security.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.510
So how close are we to a programmable quantum
computer?

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.100
Noooooot that close.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.910
You’ll probably use one in your lifetime,
but don’t run out to find one in the store

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.000
just yet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.480
Research in this area is happening at a rapid
rate and has even resulted in the Nobel Prize

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.460
for Physics in 2012, but scientists still
have a long way to go.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.170
Challenges arise both from the difficulty
in control and manipulation of quantum states,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.470
something that makes encoding quantum information
difficult, as well as the vulnerability of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.050
that information to disturbance from the environment.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130
Nevertheless, scientists like those at Caltech’s
Institute for Quantum Information and Matter,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.850
are working at the cutting edge of our current
knowledge to make quantum computing a reality.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.020
And as for it’s potential, being able to
simulate molecular interactions to create

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.080
optimized materials on demand seems reason
enough for Google, Microsoft and IBM to throw

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.590
tons of money at quantum computing, But as
one scientist recently reminded me: Who would

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.750
have been able to foresee the impact of Facebook
or the internet when classical computing was

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.750
in development?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.750
What do you think?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.860
Will quantum computation change the world?
