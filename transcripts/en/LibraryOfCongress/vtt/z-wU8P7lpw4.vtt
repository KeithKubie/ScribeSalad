afternoon everybody.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.800
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040
Sorry about the delay.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.560
My name is Muhannad
Salhi and on behalf

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470
of the African/Middle
Eastern Division

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.450
and our chief Dr. Mary-Jane
Deeb I would

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.740
like to welcome you
all to our event.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.910 position:56%
Just a few words about our division.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.510
Our division is divided
into three sections.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.870
The African section, which
deals with Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.500
The Hebraic section, which deals

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
with the Hebraic and
Judaic world-wide.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.470
And the Near East section, which
deals from Kazan in the north

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.600 position:56%
to Hatune in the south, Kashgar in
the east, to Casablanca in the west.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990
So as you can see, we
have our hands busy.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.860
We deal with about 78
different countries

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.500
and about 35 different languages.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.830
So I would urge all of you who
are interested in our areas

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.140
to come here and do your research.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.300
I would also like to urge you to
check out our four corners blog

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.290
and check out our Facebook.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.340
Like us on Facebook.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.970
We also have a number of
noon-time programs like this,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.860
and without further ado I'd

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.100
like to introduce my colleague
Ms. Nawal Kawar who is going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.550
I'm so glad and thrilled to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.860
Laila Haddad is parking,
as you all know.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.160
And Maggi Schmitt.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.130
I'm going to introduce
Maggi Schmitt first.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.030
Maggi Schmitt is a writer,
researcher, translator,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.370
educator, and social activist.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.730

Writing, production,
photography, and video.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.900
Using everyday life as a way

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.760
to approach complex political
and social realities.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.300
She co-authored the acclaimed
documentary cookbook <i>The Gaza</i>

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.170
<i>Kitchen: A Palestinian Culinary
Journey </i>which has reached an

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.470
astonishingly large and diverse
audience with this peculiar blend

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.040
of intimate antidotes, political
analyses, and local food ways.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.260
Which is the topic of this program.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.900
The hybrid approach
mixing scholarship

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.230
with fresh first person narratives
is characteristic of Maggi's work.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.640
She was one of the creators
of [foreign word] --

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.890
am I pronouncing it right?

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.260
A Madrid based project that
used innovative methods

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.950
of collective storytelling
and cartography

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.490
to show the changing
relationship between work and life

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.360 position:56%
for young woman in the city,
creating not only a much cited book,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.130
but film and also knitting
together with a network

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.460
of mutual support in the process.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.480
In the same spirit,
she initiated a project

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.560 position:56%
that brought together feminists from
various Middle Eastern countries

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.460
to visit each other's spaces
and conduct in depth interviews

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.030
with each other about political
strategies and personal lives.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.550
Creating a small archive of stories
and strong network of allies.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.080
Ms. Schmitt has worked
extensively on the issue

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.220
of migration and discrimination.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.530
Domestic work and the
economy of care

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.060
and the uses of space in the city.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.800
She has participated in
various documentaries

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.960
and social research projects,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.300
as well as grass roots initiatives
addressing these issues both

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.290
at home, in Madrid, and in
broader European networks.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.980
Recently her work has focused
largely on food and music.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.520
In addition to the <i>Gaza Kitchen</i>
and the other ongoing research

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.790
on the political -- on
the politics of food --

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.750
do we have politics on food?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.050
[Inaudible].

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.340

to digital technology and
creating the video elements

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.970
of the related app Sufi plug-ins.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.760

I like to tell the audience that

Maryland with her husband Yassine
Daoud and their three children.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.430
When not containing the
blissful cowls of her household,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.090
you will frequently find her poking
around other people's kitchen,

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.790
in a forest, or on
a basketball court.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.510
Without further ado, Ms. Maggi
Schmitt and Laila Haddad please.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:32.550
[ Applause ]

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.850
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: All right.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.390
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: We apologize

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.370
for those really extensive
and long bios.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.620
We really didn't think they were
necessary, but we were pressed

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.720
and told we have to have them.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.020
Anyway.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.440
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: The biography
is always an embarrassing moment.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.430
But, so welcome.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.800
Thank you very much for being here.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.050
Again, so sorry for the delay.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.980
As you've heard, we're here
to speak about this book

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.020
that we published initially
almost five years ago.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.010
The second edition has just been
released by Just World Books.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:11.100
It's a much larger, more extensive
edition with more photography,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.720
additional recipes, et cetera.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.780
So we're very, very pleased
to see this finally in print

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.050
on nice quality paper
and everything.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.920
So -- and delighted to speak
about it to you all today.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.030
The project was born basically each
of us from our different angles,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.710 position:56%
from our different life experiences,
from our different relationship

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:39.070
with the region, as a response to
what people usually imagine or know

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.970
about Gaza which is sort of this.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.870
This -- these are the
typical images that one sees.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:54.400
Anonymous, distant, always
shown either as a hapless victim

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.490 position:56%
or as a somehow dangerous aggressor.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.330 position:56%
And this doesn't resonate
certainly for Laila who's from Gaza,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.310
with her experience of the place.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.900
Didn't resonate with my
brief experience of the place

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.960
on an initial visit
that I made in 2009.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:20.330
And for both of us what really
grabbed our attention about Gaza,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:25.180
what we felt like was an important
story to tell about Gaza is not --

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.200
and yes, Nawal, we will avoid the
sort of over political polemic,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.310
but it's impossible to
speak about the Gaza Strip

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.050
without in some way speaking
about its political situation

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.570
because it's so overwhelming.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.870
That's all there is.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.170
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: I feel

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.670
like there should be a hot
cold button, like the closer --

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.360
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: The closer
we get to controversy.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.110
But for us the question was to
-- precisely by writing a book,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.170
a cookbook, a sort of
ethnographic documentary cookbook,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.910
was to avoid the sort of big
discourses of official politics

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.190
and look at daily life,
ordinary life.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.490
How are people surviving?

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.350
How are households staying sane?

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:10.110 position:56%
How are people continuing with their
lives every day in extraordinary

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.700
and truly terrible circumstances?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.000
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
With the understanding

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.300
that all that stuff exists.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.570
Right? It's not in
a vacuum obviously.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.140
But kind of the idea was how do we
tell the story in a different way?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.630
Sort of the same old story,
but in a different way,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.000
using a different lens.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.910 position:56%
A lens that is, you know, more
meaningful, that is more humanizing,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.960
that is more dignifying
for, you know,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.200
the people that we were
-- the subject of this.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.500
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And it helped --

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.440
I mean the interesting thing about
the reception of this book is

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.780
that it clearly helps an
audience not familiar with Gaza

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.300
to understand this place
in its every day humanity.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.100
But also for the people
we interviewed,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.850
for the people we talked to there,
they've really embraced the book

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.620 position:56%
as a representation of their place
and their lives that they recognize.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.440 position:56%
And the way that most of the sort
of mediadic representations of Gaza,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.190
they don't recognize
their daily life in that

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.740
because it's often
pictures like this.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.070
So, what we always say is we were
sort of trying to sneak in anyone

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.220 position:56%
of those anonymous block windows and
get into the inside of households.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.960
The inside of daily life,
and begin talking from --

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.360
fr om something as tactile
as material, as human,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.050
as every day as for
example, the baking of bread

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.310
or the cooking of the daily meal.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.800
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Which is often
where the real stories get told

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.730
and where the histories
are perpetuated.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.480
Right? And where ultimately
dignity is retained.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.400
It's the sort of one safe
space that we frequently

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.530
like to say people have sort of --

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.390
when everything else
seems sort of out

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.370
of your control you do
exercise an element of control

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.830 position:56%
in how you bake your bread or what
ingredients you're using to purchase

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.200
to make those -- you know, the
food that you've always known

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.960
or what stories you are
sharing and meals you're making.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.400
And so it's liberating
in that sense.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.940
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And as we -- as
we undertook the fieldwork for this

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.780
which was several months of
fairly intensive fieldwork,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.080
talking to different individuals
who were incredibly generous.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.210
Inviting us into their homes.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.550
We tried to get a sort of a cross
section of Gazan society which goes

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.730
from very humble households,
rural households to very --

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.800
an urban elite of very accomplished
people and wealthy households.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.430
We tried to cover a whole spectrum.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.930
Discussing with them --
basically asking for recipes,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:37.360
talking about family recipes and
family techniques for cooking.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.280
But of course as you
all surely know,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.710
recipes are never just how
do you make a given food.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.730
They always drag along with them
on the one hand family stories,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.090
histories, where do things come
from, what do you remember?

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.540
I remember my mother-in-law taught
me this, but she said that it --

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.220
so you begin to pull on
long threads of history

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.690
and those long threads are
invariably connected also

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.150
to the circumstances of people's
lives, how they've changed,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.140
when they've moved, when
they've been exiled,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.840
when they've been pushed
from one place to another.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.400 position:56%
The sort of vicissitudes and ups and
downs of their economic conditions,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.700
their household conditions.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.140
So all of these stories kind
of come along with the recipes.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.180
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: And we do
remind people over and over again

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.200
in the book that again,
it's about sort

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.070
of getting beyond these caricatures

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.420
and getting a true deeper
understanding not only

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.110
of the people themselves,
but of the place.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.520
Right? And we remind people

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.670
that Gaza historically is a very
rich -- is a very rich place.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.970
It was a trading city.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.730
It was a main port
along the Mediterranean.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.400
It was a place through which, you
know, all major caravan routes

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.490
and spice routes passed
including the Frankincense route

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.790
and on and on.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.390
So it has a very unique and
storied place in history.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.580
And it's very difficult to remember
that obviously in the context

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.530
of everything that we know
is happening these days.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.930
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: But it's
very easy to remember this

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.240
when you're looking at the recipes.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.890
And this is again --

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.190
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Kind of
tying those two things together.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.490
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: We kind of felt

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.610
like we had stumbled
upon a secret wormhole,

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.080
a secret door into a different
way of telling history.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:18.010 position:56%
Because if you simply smell the
rice cooking, how could you not know

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.210
that this had been [foreign
word] of he spice trade?

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:27.590 position:56%
How could -- so in the same way that
recipes tell us family histories,

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.790
and therefore economic histories,
and therefore political histories,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.510
they also tell us sort of
great global histories.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.470
You know, the fact of all of
these spices here being integrated

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.150
and now -- I mean in the last
month we've been doing sort

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.790
of more historic research, and
the resonance's of Gazan cuisine

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.630
with Medieval Abbasid
cooking, the same --

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.040
we can find these same recipes.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.340
In some ways Gaza --

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.640
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
Sometimes with the same names,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.170
although somewhat different
ingredients, yeah.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.950
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: So it's
also kind of a backdoor access

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.600
to a broad historical
spectrum of the place.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.620
It's relationship, as Laila says,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.470
in the spice routes,
in the trade routes.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.740 position:56%
Its relationship to different
courtly cuisine's and different sort

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.050
of power structures over history.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Arabian caravans
would obviously pass through

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.700
or maybe it's not common knowledge,
but from Arabia they would then go

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.540
to Gaza, and it was known that,
you know, the grandfather's --

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.920
the grandfather of the
Prophet Muhammad was --

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.890
died there and so on and so forth.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.880 position:56%
And it was -- this is very different
we should mention then elsewhere

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.180
in historic Palestine.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.360
The cuisine differs remarkably.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.460
There's certain components
that altogether absent --

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.230
that are present in Gaza
that are altogether absent

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.580
in other parts of Palestine.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.320
And this was what I
think was so interesting

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.620
to us and to so many people.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.920
Why did this happen?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.220
Why was this the case?

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.520
You know, how did it come about

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.630
and why was it preserved
through the years?

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:57.160
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: So the
strategy of the book is to tell --

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.960
provide the recipes and of course
that in itself is an undertaking

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.380
because the translation from
the oral history and the sort

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.070
of folk knowledge of you take a
little bit of this and just enough

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.880
of that and you do it and you
sauté it until it's done.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.610
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: And then we
would say like explain how --

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.910
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: How
do you translate that?

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.210
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: It's
like, what are you a moi?

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.510
Why do you need me
to explain to you --

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.810
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: You
know when it's done.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.110
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Should
just be common knowledge,

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.410
you should understand
how this is done.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.710
Yeah.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.010
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: We
all have grandmother's.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.310
We all know that that's
how cooking is transmitted.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.210
But then, translating that kind
of knowledge into the written kind

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.950
of knowledge of a cookbook and,
you know, teaspoon measurements,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.960
and how many minutes and so
on is a whole paradigm shift.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.930
So we did the kitchen testing
and Laila the lion's share of it.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:49.700
And from the recipes we received in
interviews with these different --

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:55.040
mostly women, some men -- we
documented, and wrote down,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.530
and sort of formalized
those recipes.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.160
Which was a real labor of
love for this Gazan cuisine.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.380
A lot of people have told us
that they're really pleased

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.140
to see these recipes
that nobody's ever heard

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.950
about now sort of documented
forever.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.750
And for us it was important
to recognize that body

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.080
of folk knowledge that's
mostly in the hands of women.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.130
Never really acknowledge -- I mean
everyone's proud of their food,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.130
but it never sort of makes the leap

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.250
into what gets recognized
as knowledge.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.710
And so to acknowledge that body of
knowledge as knowledge and write it

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.280
down is sort of -- recognizes
its dignity and its importance

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.430
to generations and generations.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.250
So that was one of the kind
of legs of what we were doing.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.550
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
Sorry about that.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.430
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Another was
the photographic documentary part

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.810
as you see in this photo.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.640
It was important to us to
document absolutely mundane spaces.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.780
The absolutely ordinary.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.080
Kitchen sinks.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.380
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.000
We have documentary style
photography throughout the book.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.840
The point wasn't to make it this --

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.860
I mean it was to be a beautiful
book, but not in the sense

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.610
of like sort of these really
photo finished, you know,

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.340
images of what we sort
of call food porn.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.780
I mean it was sort of -- it's very
ethnographic documentary in nature.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.160 position:56%
To give you a real sense of like
ordinary life and ordinary kitchens,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.300
and markets and so on and so forth.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.210
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And then also
it was important to us to look

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:25.750
as we said, to trace some of those
personal stories and kind of pull

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.330
on those threads and follow
them -- follow them upwards,

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:37.830
out from the immediacy of how
do you make a cauliflower stew?

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.210
To look at well, how
much does the meat cost

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.570
and how much did it used to cost?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.880
And where does it come from?

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.180
And how does it get here?

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.070
And what is the conditions
in the markets?

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.390
And speaking to individual
households about their kind

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.310
of home economy and then
to shop keepers and people

00:21:53.310 --> 00:22:00.780
in the market places, to farmers
to aid workers, to different NGO's

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.670
that are trying to facilitate
some sustainability or some --

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:09.300
just to keep Gaza fed under
its present circumstances.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.560
And try to extrapolate sort of
beginning from the micro level

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.870 position:56%
of these recipes in these individual
households, extrapolate outwards

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.270
and learn about the whole
food system and there

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:27.810
for necessarily the whole political
circumstances of the Gaza Strip.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:35.670
What's happening there and intuit
or begin to understand why.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.250
So we looked at industry.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.610
This for example is a
picture of the industry

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.150
in Gaza is reduced
to almost nothing.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.980
But this particular [inaudible]
factory was still operating.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.380
So here are the great
machines that they had

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.650
for toasting the sesame seeds.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.290
And a whole interesting discussion

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.270
about where do you get
the sesame seeds from?

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.050 position:56%
How do they get through the borders?

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.350
Et cetera.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.630
You can choose sort of almost
any mundane ingredient and from

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.040
that draw a very complete
picture of what's happening

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.300
in this tiny little
part of the world.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.670
That's so embattled
and so constantly

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.250
under the magnifying
glass of geopolitics.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.420
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: And so many
issues as Maggi talked about.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.840
I don't -- I'm thinking in my mind,

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.870
like what's too political,
what's not?

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.220
But, you know, like
Maggi was saying,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.200
it's kind of inescapably political.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.270
Right? I mean the food
economy itself there, you know,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.830
we talk in the book how it's --

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.130
Gaza itself is kind

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.930
of an experimented
post-modern colonialism.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.630
But it is sort of one big
social experiment in the sense

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.430
that Everything that goes in and
out is rationed and calculated,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.900
and it varies from week to week.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.650
And you know, and there's
this whole, you know,

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.700
shadow government operating
as well beyond the current --

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.480
you have the UN, you
know, and the [inaudible].

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.140
Then you have the various
aid groups and NGO's.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.000
And the aid economy,
you know, what's allowed

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.300
in and what's allowed out.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.090
And how many people are
actually dependent on that.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.940
And what -- how they use those
ingredients to then manufacture

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.080
or create all kinds of new dishes,
and substitute certain ingredients,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.310
and what access they have
to what is available.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.950
And you know, is a
whole other issue.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.730
So we kind of weave together all
these various stories in the book

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.400
and -- I'm trying to
think of one example.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.270
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And with them
we also provide sort of profiles

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.220
of individuals who tell their
stories in the first person.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.640
So it's an attempt to like
I said, document and kind

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.760
of formalize the recipes as
knowledge and the peculiarity

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.050
of Gazan cuisine, because as
Laila said, it really is different

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.180
from other regions of Palestine.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.430
And very notably different from
other parts of the greater region.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:54.740
So really recognizing that and
sharing that with the world.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.040
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: And the ways --

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.150
we should probably mention some of
the ways in which it's different.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.950
Because we do -- so what we try
to do is like we were saying,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.050
is we have this sort of
documentary style photography.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.260
We have the profiles
of the individuals

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.120
and the various text boxes and,
you know, analysis of the political

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.600
and economic situation and
everything that entails.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.190
And then of course we have
the recipes themselves.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.960
And some of what makes it

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.560 position:56%
so different is the way that's it's
absorbed certain ingredients amongst

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.850
which are the use --
extensive use of spice.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.310
Both actual spices and heat.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.960
The peakensey of the cuisine
is very notable as well.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.500
Mainly in the urban areas.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.510
Much of Gaza of course is
rural or else descendants

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.290
of former villages and so forth.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.990
And their cuisine is
also very different.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.900
But it kind of incorporates --

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.600
it's a great place we say to
experience the cuisine of sort

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.470
of greater Palestine
within the context

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.860 position:56%
of the small little tiny Gaza Strip.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.240
Because so many Palestinians came

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.770
from elsewhere throughout
historic Palestine to Gaza.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.830 position:56%
So you have the peakensey of the
urban areas, and the sophistication,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.730
and the extensive use of
spices which is again an ode

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.120
to Gaza's position in ancient
times along those trade routes.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.470
And then you have sort of
the Mediterranean flavors.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.120
You have the extensive use
of dill and dill seeds.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.730
And very lemony sour flavors,
which again dates back

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.510
to sort of the Basit times.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.130
Sour pomegranates, and
lemons, and tamarin,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.640
and all these various flavors.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:25.310
So it's a very urban -- herby
vibrant, you know, peakant cuisine.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.380
But again, even in an area
small as Gaza it varies greatly

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.860
from like one mile to the next,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.430
and people have very heated
conversations about like,

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.370
this is not how they
make it in our village.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.760
You know, or we would never
dream of making Sumagia.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.210
That's a Gaza City thing.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.380
And we never use -- you
know, villagers would say

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.850
to us frequently, we
never use garlic.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.150
Ew, garlic.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.030
You know. [Inaudible] us
villagers only use onion.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.980
And so it was really remarkable
how well preserved some

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.690
of these traditions were.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.410
I just -- you know, from
one area to the next.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.220
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: This was one of
the things that really surprised us

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.150
in the field work was
how faithfully and sort

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.740
of endogamically each village would
reproduce -- these are villages,

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.700
many of them that had been
destroyed after or in 1948,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.970
and often the only trace left
of them was the taste of them.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.640 position:56%
And therefore you got a sense that
people understood themselves, cooks,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.730
women understood themselves
as somehow the --

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.030
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Keepers.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.330
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: The
keepers, the safe guarders

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:30.000
of the only little intangible
heritage left of a village

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.530
of which no stone is
left, no evidence is left.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.290
It's name's not on the map.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.210
But we know that we make
lentils in this way.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.140
You know? And that these
recipes were being perpetuated

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.190
from one generation to
the next in this way.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.460
It was very beautiful and
very interesting to see

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.110 position:56%
that these are not first generation,
these are second and third,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.160
and sometimes fourth generation

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.440 position:56%
that are perpetuating these specific
tastes of these specific villages,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.890
and identifying them as such.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.080
So that was one of
the many surprises

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.270
that awaited us in the fieldwork.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.570
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Right.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.230
The regional specificity
of a lot of these dishes.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.530
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: In general

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.250
in the fieldwork it was shocking
just how generous people were,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.130
and we know -- we know that in
this region people are generous

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.430
with food in general.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.940 position:56%
And passionate about food in general
and proud of their food in general.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.340 position:56%
But we felt like it was quite a lot.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.010
We were a little nervous when
we set off to do the field work

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.290
because speaking to publishers
with the idea in the United States,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.350
mostly we got from sort of more
political publishing houses,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.700
they said, ah how frivolous,
a cookbook.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.990
And from more cookbook
publishing houses they said,

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.220
ye Palestine, Gaza, very political.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.520
We don't want to touch it.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.170
So we were nervous that we would
get sort of similar responses

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.750
from the people we
approached in our field work.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:57.030
And on the contrary, it was a sort
of affirmation of our intuition

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.770
when we went and as soon
as we started asking people

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:04.310
about food they immediately
understood that if we're asking

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.700
about food we're also
really asking about --

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:14.380
or talking about family histories,
human dignity, cultural continuity,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.850 position:56%
sustainability, the present economy.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.070
Like in Gaza everyone we spoke

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.680
to about this really
immediately captured the whole --

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.980
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: They
were head over heels.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.280
I mean we --

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.580
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Got
the whole idea.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.880
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: I mean we
had trouble sort of -- yeah.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.180
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And we
had to fend off invitations.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.480
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: We did.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.780
We would be speaking to someone and
suddenly they would be pouring --

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.080
people would pop their heads out.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.380
Let me offer you the
best way to make this.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.680
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Okra, okra.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.980
No you make okra like this.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.280
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: And
then they would -- yeah.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.160
It was incredible and I mean it
really does speak to sort of again,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.470
the very humanizing, you
know, aspect of all of this.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.440
And we frequently say that
Gaza's besieged with media

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.850
in addition to many other things.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.440
And people were always
kind of bracing themselves

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.720 position:56%
to give us their rehearsed responses

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.480
to whatever question they
thought we were about to ask them

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.830
and were really pleasantly
surprised to find out that like no,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.430
we actually want to know how, you
know, you make [foreign word].

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.320
But again, with the
understanding that all --

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.690
we're not like pretending
that none of this exists.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:09.230
But getting to there through
a different window as it were.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.560
And then, you know, I
mentioned a lot of --

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.860
how some of these dishes some

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.830
of their ingredients we
noticed had changed over time.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.480
People frequently ask us about like
how have people sort of adapted?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.870
And we like to say, you know,

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.110 position:56%
that it's pretty remarkable how they
have managed to adapt given sort

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.620
of the impossible circumstances
under which they live.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.460
And this is a good example.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.260
This is a mushroom cultivation
facility that we went to,

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.190
and of course mushrooms aren't
ordinarily used in the cuisine,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.890
but because of the very dire
conditions and the high rates

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.310
of food insecurity, you
know, many NGO's along

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.760
with the agricultural secretary
were struggling over --

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.790
for ways in which to -- through
which to supplement the --

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.310 position:56%
people's inaccessibility to protein.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.650
Right? Like fresh meat
and fish, and so on.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.200
So they came up with this idea of
cultivating mushrooms and using

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.490
that as an income generation
scheme for women,

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.960
and giving them little recipes, you
know, to help them adapt to using,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.130
incorporating the mushroom
in their food and so on.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.300
But one very obvious
one also was the --

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.650
I should say, not the use but the
disuse of olive oil which is --

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.710
of course is a -- one of the --

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.460
the main fat, right in
Palestinian cuisine.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.630
Now people we noticed mainly were
using it just to sort of drizzle

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.520
or finish certain dishes
and that's due to the --

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.530
again, the large rates
of food insecurity.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.700
The prohibitive, you know,
price tag on olive oil now.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.160
The fact that so many of those
groves, the trees are uprooted,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.660
and the inaccessibility of course
between Gaza and the West Bank

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.220
where most of the olive trees grow.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.900
So people have now swapped soy oil,
which is distributed by many --

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.340
much of the aid organizations.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.250
Which of course, you know,
aid distribution is intended

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.570
for a short term emergency and in
Gaza it's become a long term thing.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.160
And so that's just a whole
other sort of can of worms.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.610
What happens -- what's the impact
of long term aid distribution

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.300
and dependence on a
population and how they eat?

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.600
Another good example is --

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.340
Maggi showed you the picture
of those two brothers --

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.190
well not that you would know
they're brothers, but they are,

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.770
and they're sort of
these entrepreneurs

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:18.120
that established the fish
farming industry in Gaza.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.560
Which again, why would you need
fish farming in a coastal --

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.300
you wouldn't but again,
due to the restrictions

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.450
on the fishing zones off Gaza's
coast they became inventive,

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.800
innovative, and this sort
of, you know, took off.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.630
I'm always careful
about my use of words.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:38.270
Blew up. And the NGO secretary
adopted this very enthusiastically

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.720
and began to buy the fish from them
and distribute them to other farms

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.930
or NGO's to distribute to people.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.230
And um --

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.030
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And
they are characteristic --

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:54.970 position:56%
I mean we like these stories of what
the sort of pop word in the world

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.130
of NGO's these days is
talking about resilience.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.240
I have a lot of ambivalence
about this notion of resilience.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.950
But we do like these
stories of individuals

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.430
who have found incredibly
inventive ways to get

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.230 position:56%
around every obstacle that's put up.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.320
And these guys besides being
just very charming and very funny

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.530
in themselves -- they get
giant electric blackouts

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.950
and they can't aerate the fish
tanks and the fish will, you know,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.030
suffocate for lack of oxygen.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.640
And so they invite all the
village kids to come over --

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.640
the kids from the neighborhood
come over

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.040
and swim in the pool and splash.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.140
And they have splashing
competitions for the kids,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.430
and that aerates the pools
and then the fish can breathe.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.530
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: There's like
12-hour power outages in a row.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.840
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: So that
sort of constant ability to --

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.070 position:56%
okay, this is the situation, how do
-- and being very much on their feet

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:53.770
and coming up with solutions
that get around these obstacles.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.910
With -- I mean I love that example
because invite all the kids to come

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.210
and have a splashing party?

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.800
Like it's not only getting around
a really serious material limit

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.860
to the infrastructural
problem, but also with joy,

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.030 position:56%
with a sense of community, with like
let's have a splashing competition.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:15.710
So, and we came again
and again upon this kind

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.010
of inventiveness and ingenuity.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.230
And yeah, there are more
things about these guys story

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.860
that are relevant, but we
should probably stop and give

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.470
over the floor to questions.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:29.240
But we have many many,
many, many more anecdotes.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.500
We can keep going and going.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.130
But should we pass the
floor to questions?

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.430
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
This is an example

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:39.930
of the aid distribution we
were talking about which again,

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:44.750
something like 75% of the
population is a participant

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.210
in either the World
Food Organization,

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.090
the World Health Organization,
whatever it is, [inaudible].

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.860
There's food vouchers and coupons
and all this sort of, you know,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.390
a whole intricate system network
through which aid is distributed

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.730
and there's constant
questions as to whether --

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.980
how the food aid packages
should be changed.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.160
And I was shocked to
discover in writing, you know,

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.500
updating the second
edition of the book

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.600
that chickpeas were never
included in UN packages.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.010
That was -- I was pretty
floored by that.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.750
That seemed like sort
of a basic thing.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.510
But again, a lot of
it is white sugar,

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.570
white flour, you know, soy oil.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.190
These kinds of things.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.490
[Inaudible] kind of --

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.790
&gt;&gt; Maggie Schmitt: With the
corresponding nutritional problems.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.090
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Right.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.390
&gt;&gt; Maggie Schmitt: That generates.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.690
Anyway, we should give
the floor to questions.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.020
We're happy to -- yes please?

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.100
&gt;&gt; Well since there's two speakers
I get to ask two questions.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.590
For Laila I really have to kind
of exonerate Anthony Bourdain,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.330
who I went to see here
two weeks ago,

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.640
who said he always gets
asked about Andrew Zimmer.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.120
So I'm going to ask you
about Anthony Bourdain.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.800
How was his cultural sensitivity?

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.360
Because I take it that he's
somebody who is very open-minded

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.520
and really makes an effort
to give dignity to cultures.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:59.630
And then for Maggi, Miami
has an ethnic cuisine.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.680
Have you ever looked at
Miami's ethnic cuisine?

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.410
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Miami
has many ethnic cuisines.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.040
&gt;&gt; Even Chinese food, when I tell
people about Cuban Chinese food.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.870
And then just to ask
both of you all,

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.400
do people depend on home gardens?

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.880
You know, how important
are those, you know,

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.020
things that they could
do in their own homes?

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.460
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Yeah,
those are great questions.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.830
So, in regards to Anthony Bourdain.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.540
Yeah, I was a little
like nervous a first.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.840
I didn't know what to expect.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.720
I thought -- you know, I just
knew sort of his bad boy persona

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.270
and I should mention I had
my two daughters with me

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.120
and like my youngest
was four months old,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.940
and then my other was I guess
five, and I had no one to help me.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.640
I went there under really
sort of arduous circumstances

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.310
and I was then told to meet
him at a location in Gaza City.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.790
And I kept getting told by the
producers, like no don't --

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.190
you can't bring the
baby, and this and that.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.730
And come in your own car,
and you know, all the --

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.380
and so I was getting really
nervous this would be a very child

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.720
unfriendly operation.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.270
And he -- you know, I
immediately met him and he --

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.970
you know, and then my -- at one
point during the shooting I had

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.820
to take my baby with me to nurse
her and she was freaking out,

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.250
and I didn't know what to do.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.580
And I don't think people put two
and two together, but that was her

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.630
in the video and he just
picked her up and was just

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.930
like hushed her to sleep.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.620
And so I was like, oh okay then.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.130
So that was fantastic.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.800
And he's like, I miss this age.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.890
Because his daughter was
seven I guess at the time.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.840
And so that was a real delight.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.690
And you're absolutely right in the
sense that he's very comfortable,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.550
you know, speaking not
only about all topics,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.510
but respecting people and,
you know, their cultures.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.370
And having an open mind
and open conversations.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.700
And it was fantastic.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.140
It was a really special
unique opportunity I think.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.090
And I'm so glad it happened at
that precise moment in time.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.540
It would have been impossible a
few months before and a few months

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.720
after due to all the
border closures and so on.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.350
So it was great and I
was able to take him

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.280
to places I don't think they would
have been able to get to otherwise.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.690
It was a really unique opportunity
and I was really nervous about how

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.350
or whether they would spin it sort
of in a certain way at the end.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:10.420
Because I was only sort of part of
-- one part of the whole episode.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.860
But overall I was, you know,
very pleased and very happy

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.960
that we had the chance
to take him through.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.550
The only part we didn't get to
do was take him out into sea.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.590
We were supposed to go out with
some fishermen but they deemed it

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.950
like too unsafe or
something at the time.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:28.510
But in regards to the home gardens
and so forth, yeah absolutely.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.090
We talk about that in the book.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.580
People not having not only
dove coats, but rabbit --

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.660
there's little rabbit
rearing operations

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.600
and of course each one presents
its own set of challenges.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.330
Access to water that isn't
completely, you know,

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:47.130
saline or being able to find,
you know, the proper feed

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.850
for chickens or whatever it is.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.280
There's restrictions on what
comes in and out to the strip.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.790
And, you know, the heat
and so on and so forth.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.180
But certainly you'll
find everyone --

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.780
even if they have a small little
strip of land will have something

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.080
on their rooftop or if they
have just a tiny little section

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.640
of land will be growing something.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.820
But again, it is a very
densely populated place

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.120
with very limited space.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.050
And not everyone has the luxury
to be living in a building

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.350
with a rooftop obviously.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.550
But they do what we --
what they can I think.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.480
And part of the problem
is that sometimes

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.520
that knowledge isn't inherited due
to the sort of constant, you know,

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.500
misplacements and migrations,
and so forth.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.360
And so we were always, you know,
very pleased to find certain cases

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.270
where that knowledge was given
from -- passed down from an uncle,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.480
to a mother, to -- but often
times they just didn't know how

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.780
to do this.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.170
And so they -- in one
particular case they --

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.240
one NGO or community center grouped
together sort of grandmothers

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.520
with younger women and
the grandmothers kind

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.010
of taught the younger women how
to care for the rabbits and how

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.710
to raise for them --
raise them and so on.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.220
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: So
yeah, lots and lots

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.020 position:56%
of micro sustainability initiatives.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.610 position:56%
And then a much bigger debate at the
level of the Ministry of Agriculture

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.930
or how much too really
push for sustainability.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:04.740
Because any hope of sustainability
in a territory like Gaza that is

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.340
so tiny, so totally
lacking in water.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.180
I mean the big crisis
there is countdown

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.480
to doomsday in terms of water.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.020
There is no water.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.690
They've over -- the aquifer of the
whole region has been overdrawn.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.890
The saline water is
entering from the sea.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:25.010
Like you could push for
sustainability but A,

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.280
the territories just not big
enough to ever provide the calories

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.680
that population needs,
and B, at great --

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.220
like the more agriculture
you do the more risk

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.690
of over drying the aquifer.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.930
So there are lots of
different parameters.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:41.110
So on an individual like household
level everybody is drawing

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.810
on every resource they can to
raise pigeons, to raise rabbit's,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:49.300 position:56%
to grow mushrooms in the closets,
to grow, you know, herbs in barrels.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.600
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
But don't you feel --

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.950
like sometimes I feel the average
American household can learn

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.250
so much from --

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.550
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Absolutely.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.850
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Or whoever.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.240
There was one woman we visited in
a tiny little space like cooked

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.320
up a storm, like a three course
meal, and you know, the grey water

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.320 position:56%
from washing the parsley went to her
garden and the parsley stalks went

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.880
to the chickens outdoors, and
you know, everything was done

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.170
in a completely sustainable way
in this one woman operation.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.870
And it's just incredible.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.320
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Absolutely.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.580
So yeah, and as for
the Cuban Chinese.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.990
I'd love to go back and do this
kind of ethnographic in Miami.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.930
I left Miami when I was 13

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.360
so I've never really
lived there as an adult.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.320 position:56%
But one of these days I'll go back
to Miami and do something like this.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.700
Because it really is an
unbelievably rich, weird,

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.650
idiosyncratic, interesting place.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.140
&gt;&gt; I lived on South
Beach for five years.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.440
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: There's
a lot going on there.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.070
In any city block there's a lot
of stories to tell in Miami.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.670
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Other question?

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.970
Yes?

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was intrigued by your
mentioning the regional differences.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:58.930
That the food in Gaza is
different from other parts

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.610
of the Palestinian region.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.980
Could you give some
concrete examples of that?

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.280
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Of course.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.580
Very roughly I mean there are lots

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.060
of different regional
differences even

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.710
within Gaza as Laila was saying.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.850
Like between families that
originally of the sort

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.020
of farming village
interior, the hill towns.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.620
Families that are from
the coastal --

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.250
the sort of more urban
coastal places like very --

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.120
even within Gaza there are
very striking differences.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.010
But in the north of
Palestine for example,

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.480
there's much more use of yogurts.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.190
They do not like spicy food.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.320
Like spicy in the sense of hot.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.610
At all. There's in general, a much
lesser use of all kinds of spices,

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.060
both aromatic spices and
like spicy hot spices.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.520
And a lot of use of yogurts.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.330
It's much more similar
to the Lebanese or --

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.410
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Seems to be
a north/south thing doesn't it?

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: North/south thing.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.510
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: I mean
the most obvious example --

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.480
if I was to give you
like one example.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.360
It's sort of the most
stereotypically

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.850
but it does hold true, is
the use of the chili pepper.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.020
So they use a lot of chili
peppers in the Gaza region,

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.850
both in green form
and sun-dried form.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.320
You know, chili flakes and chili
sauce, and all sorts of things.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.500
And there's a really
famous pounded salad similar

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.240
to a salsa almost I would say,
called [foreign word] Gazan salad

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:22.210
or dead guy, which means pounded
that's made with dill, tomatoes,

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.560
garlic or onions depending
on who you speak to.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.310
Another very heated
debate as we learned.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.450
And then chili pepper,
green chili peppers.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.040
Very fiery hot chili peppers.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.360
That seemed to be sort of an
indigenous variety [inaudible].

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.020
Obviously before it
came to the Americas.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.350
But that's one obvious example.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:41.590
Again, other's -- Fellaheen will
tell you, we don't -- they don't --

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.850
they're not very fond
of the chili pepper.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:45.150
Their tradition was one of more --

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:50.300
much more mild seasonal
flavors of root vegetables

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.600
and [foreign word],
and things like that.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.620
But the chili pepper and then dill.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.750
The extensive use of dill in
green form and then dill seed

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.010
as well, is used -- yeah, sorry?

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:03.610
No dill, dill.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.590
Like dill weed or dill greens.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.890
&gt;&gt; What is the Arabic [inaudible]?

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.190
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Ah,
what is it in Arabic?

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.090
Okay, in Egypt and
elsewhere they call it Shebat.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.640
In Gaza they call it Jirada.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.620
And yeah -- and the dill seed
is called [foreign word].

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.240
Right. Leave it to the Palestinians
with their sick sense of humor.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.640
That means locust eye.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.230
So because it looks
like a -- I know, right.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.580
And yeah, they use that a lot.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.070
The other thing I would say is --

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.220
I'm trying to think
off the top of my head.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.520
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And also seafood.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.910
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Right, that
was what I was going to mention.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.210
Right.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.480
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Gaza is
the last little piece of --

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.570
of what is presently Palestine
that has access to the sea.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.340
So there is a historic
seafood cuisine in the region,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.590
but very few Palestinians

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.340
in the region presently
have access to the sea.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:55.620
Gaza has maintained a lot of
the sort of high-end, elaborate,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.890
you know, stuffed and rolled,
and fried, and breaded --

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.420
these sort of very elaborate,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.020
very sophisticated seafood
cuisine is actually form Yafa.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.570
Yafa was the great sort of city
-- cosmopolitan city on the sea.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:13.870
Pre '48 Palestine.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.140
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Many of those
Palestinians from Yafa came by sea,

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.480
fled to Gaza in 1948
and ended up there.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.780
Yeah.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.890
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: And so there is
significant Yafa population in Gaza

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.500
and they've really
maintained that seafood cuisine

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.910
and those seafood traditions.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.540
So yeah, the -- and
you talk to the --

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.190
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Everything from
fish, calamari, you know, octopus.

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.490
All sorts of things
you'll find there.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:38.150
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: You talk to
Palestinians from the West Bank

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:42.460 position:56%
and in Israel, et cetera, and many
from before the borders were closed,

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.860
many have this sort of romantic
memories of going to the beach

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.820
at Gaza, and having
the seafood at Gaza.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.770
It's like a thing, that
you went down to Gaza to go

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.610
to the beach and eat seafood.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.790
That was a -- you know, a lovely
family Sunday for many years

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.090
until the borders were closed.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.670
So it's very famous for
its seafood and rightly so,

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.970
because it's spectacular.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.050
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: There's
also a lot of these, you know,

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.440
dishes that we never knew
quite how to categorize them.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.740
Mush bowls.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.040
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Mush.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.340
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: No they're not
-- come on, give them their due.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.640
They're very nice.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.620
But they're basically like one pot
-- like they're cooked in one pot

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.800
and made with either a
green or a pulse like,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.200
you know, Sumagia's a good one.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.500
It's made with charred
chickpeas, lamb meat.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.140
Usually a [foreign word]
thickened with taina and sumac --

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.550
tartness from the sumac berry.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.520
And then kind of all cooked
together until it thickened.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.690 position:56%
Pour it into bowls and then eaten
with bread or distributed to family.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.990
And there's other's.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.290
There's [foreign word]
there's, you know, fogiya.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:42.530
And they're all cooked, poured into
bowls, you know, allowed to kind

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.040
of congeal and then eaten.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.340 position:56%
That's something that seems to be --

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.640
&gt;&gt; Maggi Schmitt: Scooped up.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.940
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
Scooped up with bread.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.660
That seems to be peculiar or, you
know, unique to that area as well.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.330
&gt;&gt; That does sound
tough [inaudible].

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.630
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: The what?

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.930
&gt;&gt; That does sound --

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.230
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Right,
yeah, absolutely yeah.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.530
&gt;&gt; Maggie Schmitt: It's an
Egyptian type pronunciation

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.830
and in Gaza it's more --

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.130
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: No, is it?

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.430
No. It's not.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.730
That's different.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.030
No, in Egypt it's - no, in --

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.330

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.630
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.930
In Gaza it's yeah --

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.260
&gt;&gt; Du-ca becomes du-gah.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.840
Sumatia becomes sumagia.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.410
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.710
Yeah?-

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:19.310
&gt;&gt; I was actually interested
in thinking about substitution.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:20.610
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Ah right, yeah.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.840
&gt;&gt; So in your book do you
mention the original recipe

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.410
and various substitutions?

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.710
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Yeah.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.010
&gt;&gt; Maggie Schmitt:
This was a big debate.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.310
We were all the time sort
of going back and forth

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:33.810 position:56%
between a sort official of memory of
like how things were supposed to be.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.830
Like really this should
be made with barley.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.840
Maybe this should be
made with [foreign word].

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.530
But now we make it with, you know,
imported FAO short grain rice.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.120
Or this kind of substitution.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.010
So we try to represent both.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:54.830
In some cases we specifically
say like this is a dish of memory

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.130
that should be done like this,

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.830
but none of these ingredients
are presently available.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.130
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Like
for the most part we --

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.690
&gt;&gt; But the audience is not in Gaza.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.620
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: No,
no, for the most part we --

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.780
no, we include the original
version of the dish.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.700
But then just for the sake of
sort of representing this --

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.690
you know, this reality we
include like two or three recipes

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:16.950 position:56%
that emerged in the aftermath of
1948 either during the exodus itself

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.290
or that continue to be made.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.570
Very simple dishes that -- and
we say, this emerged, you know,

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.530
and is -- was created through
sort of patchwork of, you know,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:25.830
ingredients and what not.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.340
But no, we do include
the authentic --

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.640
&gt;&gt; Several.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.940
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: We do.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.240
We have -- we have
several recipes, right.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.220
So, you know, we -- there are a
couple of recipes too that are sort

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.430
of in disuse, that are no longer
made or not very frequently

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.100
from certain -- like from
[inaudible] and other places.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.400
Sort of ceremonial dishes that we
thought were really interesting

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.380
to record sort of for, you
know, historical reference,

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.860
but that most people because
there aren't these big gathering

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.220
in [inaudible] in Gaza
right, don't make.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.170
But one example is [foreign
word] which is eaten like a feta.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.770
It's made with [foreign word]
but it's like feta, a big platter

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.650 position:56%
and everyone kind of gets around it.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.050
It's made with wheat --
during the wheat harvest.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.670
So we include a few
references to dishes like that.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.050
But for the most part we
try to sort of remain true

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.370
to the original versions
of the recipe.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:10.670
Yeah.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.920
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.220
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Are we done?

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.520
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: While
we're waiting for questions,

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.510
I was going to mention one
more thing that is unique

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.470
to the way the dishes
are prepared in Gaza.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.760
Is the extensive use of the
zubdiah, the mortar and pestle.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.040
That -- I don't know if we
have a picture of it here.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.300
That is fashioned from
this really rich red clay

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.940
and you'll see mortar's and pestles
obviously throughout the world

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.210
and elsewhere in Palestine, but
what makes this unique is again,

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.220
it's made from clay
from a lemonwood pestle.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.520
It's used to prep ingredients.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.820
It's used to cook in.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.740
It's used to serve other dishes in.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.270
It's ubiquitous, absolutely
ubiquitous.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.980
You'll see it in every household.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.940
Families retain it for generations
and consider it sort of a member

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.330
of their family and we thought

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.040
that was really kind
of a lovely anecdote.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.520
&gt;&gt; What about the popular dish?

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.880
Do you have it in your cookbook?

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.030
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: I'm sure we
do, but I don't know what it is.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.340
Ah right.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.420
&gt;&gt; And then you have the
fire and then you put

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.500
in a clay pot the rice --

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.800
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: Ah yes.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.100
Idra. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.700
&gt;&gt; I can't remember.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.000
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad:
Yeah, Idra, yeah.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.300
Yeah, yeah, of course we have that.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.850
That was sort of one of
the first ones I mentioned.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.560
And I know there's
debate about -- yeah.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.710
And we never claim that
a particular dish is

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.750
like only exclusively made in Gaza.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.490
You know, that would
be absolutely absurd.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.620
And so we do mention that this is
made in Hebron and made elsewhere.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.310
And in Gaza they have
their own spin on it.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:33.620
But it's certainly kind of the go
to ceremonial dish for weddings

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.550
and funerals, and this
sort of thing.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.680
[Speaking in foreign language], you
know, birth ceremonies and so on.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.790
And it used to be made in the way
that you mention and when we went

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:46.960
and did the field work we found
one remaining oven, right,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.850
like a community oven
where they were still made

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:53.260
in these big clay vessels and
placed in a brick oven I suppose.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.290
And that's still going based
on my most recent, you know,

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.600
contact with the family there.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.190 position:56%
But for the most part it's not made
in the very traditional way anymore.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.750
People will usually take the
meat to the oven and say,

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.550
can you make me enough for
200 people for this party,

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.570
and they'll give them to them in
little foil packets and so on.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:12.960
&gt;&gt; It's not the same.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.730
&gt;&gt; Laila El-Haddad: No I -- it is.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.700
Well this oven is really
good though.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.750
This is the one remaining
oven that does it in the --

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.090
sort of in the clay
vessels still in the way,

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.910
and they pour the [foreign
word] on top.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.840
So this is actually awfully good.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.250
But you really have to go out I
think to the more remote areas

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.090
of the Gaza Strip and
the Bedouin areas

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.900
to find them doing
the fire pit thing.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.760
And they'll do -- a good example of
that is the dish that they showed

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.060
on the Anthony Bourdain
show, [foreign word].

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:44.040
And a lot of the, you know,
descendants of, you know,

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.420
[inaudible] some of the Bedouin
clans will still make those dishes

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.200
in the fire pit and so forth.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.500
But not in the city.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.540
&gt;&gt; The nice thing about this one
is when it is cooked they get it

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.790
out from the pit and they use
trays, they [inaudible] it

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:03.170
and they come and knock
out the clay.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.470

this -- they do break these too.

-- but yeah, this is now --

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:19.570 position:56%
this is a commercial oven that these
urns that you see, they fill them

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:24.740
with the rice, the meat, the
spices, and then they cook slowly

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.140
in a stone oven which produces
a sort of similar effect

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.350
to the embers in the ground.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.300

thing they break it open.
