00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, let's do something tricky. Let's use 8, 5, 8 for y, which gives us a mean of 7 for y.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the following table down here 1, -2, 1. Let me test your intuition.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Is r larger than 0?  r = 0? Or r smaller than 0?

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which means positive correlation, no correlation, negative correlation. Pick one.
