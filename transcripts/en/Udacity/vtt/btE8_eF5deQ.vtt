00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.701
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know the second rate must be 8% because that was from our other fund. The

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:11.579
second amount was y. That's the amount we invested at 8%. We don't know it, so

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:17.487
that goes here. We convert 8% to a decimal and get 0.08y or .08 times y. Our

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:23.121
total interest we actually knew. We gained $787.50. So that goes here. This quiz

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.854
is pretty tough, and there's a lot of algebraic reasoning going on. So don't

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:30.573
worry if you didn't get it right on your first try. Stay with me so that we, we

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:32.896
can continue to make sense of this word problem.
