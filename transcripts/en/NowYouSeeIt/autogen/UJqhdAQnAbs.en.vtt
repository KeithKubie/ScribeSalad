00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.339
Since the beginning of Game of Thrones the show felt like it could never end in the book present shock Douglas rushkoff

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.739
uses the show's opening title sequence as an allegory to this problem the camera pans over an

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.320
Animated map of the entire world of the saga showing the various divisions and clans within the Empire

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.420
It is drawn in the style of a fantasy role-playing

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.539
Map used by participants as the game board for their battles and intrigues and like a fantasy role-playing game

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.419
The show is not about creating satisfying resolutions

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.479
But rather about keeping the adventurer life and as many threads going as possible there is plot there are many plots

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.410
But there is no overarching story no end there are so many plants

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.619
In fact that an ending tying everything up seems inconceivable

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.339
even beside the points rushkoff definitely has a point the best word to describe the earlier seasons of the show would

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.009
Probably be chaotic main characters die at a moment's notice and plots meander in many different directions

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.879
And that's part of the appeal of Game of Thrones. It's exciting to experience a world where the present moment is. So unpredictable

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.040
but what rushkoff fails to mention is the narrative hidden beneath the surface of all that present chaos in reality game of Thrones does have

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.639
A story it is the story of characters traumatized by the past shocked in the present and looking for a future to believe in

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.729
Yes, the world of Game of Thrones is defined by chaos

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.400
but many

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.519
Characters in Game of Thrones are not they are

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.110
Instead defined by their struggle to find a story within the world they exist in there's no episode that makes this distinction better than in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.049
the season 6 finale

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.089
The winds of winter the episode shows us characters trying to make sense of the world in many different ways by putting them all together

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.170
This episode becomes a metaphor for the entire series as a whole it is the symbolic end of the chaotic era of Game of Thrones

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.659
From seasons 1 through 6 and the beginning of its attempt of finding meaning within that chaos

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.619
The episode begins with the biggest act of chaos in the show's entire run up to this point the destruction of the Sept of Baelor

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.289
This sequence leads up to an act of terrorism

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.270
Orchestrated by Cersei Lannister the character who most embodies the chaos and cynicism present in the Game of Thrones world up to this point

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.279
She and her family have been responsible for the show's most significant discontinuities in its linear narrative

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000
She and her son had the show's main character killed in the ninth episode

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.619
She and her father had more main characters killed in the red wedding and she herself has lost all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.400
attachment to the future after two of her children died suddenly she gave up on preserving anything other than herself and those

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.399
Immediately loyal to her we can therefore see her destruction of the Sept of Baelor along with the religious hierarchy

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.199
Political rivals and many more main characters as the ultimate act of chaos

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.069
Not only does she destroy the literal embodiment of belief in the Seven Kingdoms

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.280
But she does it because he felt good to watch them burn

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.279
You felt good to imagine that

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.129
Cersei doesn't destroy the Sept because she has some plot for world domination

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.279
She does it because she feels she has nothing left to lose and when someone has nothing to lose they can risk everything to end

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.880
Up on top Margaery a character with just as much political savvy as Cersei is the only one in the Sept who sees this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.120
so she

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.009
Understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.039
Which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.250
the other characters are so blinded in their belief in the sanctity of religious traditions that they couldn't fathom the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.779
Possibility that Cersei wouldn't show up for the trial much less retaliate with violence

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.738
Cersei cynicism is an advantage while others cling to their beliefs

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.119
She decides to embrace the chaos and protect herself. Her destruction of the Sept is the epitome of the chaotic worlds of Game of Thrones

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.429
Ironically this act of chaos is also the beginning of a more linear ending to the show

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.000
It gets rid of multiple important characters and ends a major plot line that has dominated the show for the last two seasons

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.159
Thus the show begins its shift from a chaotic and meandering character study to an end

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.169
Oriented and plot focus - TV drama the winds of winter begins with the familiar chaos of Game of Thrones

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.280
But the rest of the episode shows us something unfamiliar characters banding together getting revenge and realizing their destinies

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280
I'm to be the new Meister

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.809
The rest of this episode focuses on wrap-up of various characters plot lines a further attempt at bringing an end to the chaos

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.170
Jv's military campaign ends Sam reaches old town

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.700
Melisandre is cast away John and Sansa resolved their tension and some unlikely

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.649
Alliances form as we landed marine with Daenerys the show points towards some finality and progress while tenaris has spent the entire show in Essos

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.300
Growing as a leader and as a character

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.610
She was always going to return to Westeros to reclaim the throne her conversation with Daario naharis

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.809
Shows us she is finally ready to take this crucial step in her personal narrative Daenerys his whole life story has been about her

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.100
Right to the Iron Throne while Cersei desires power out of a desire for self-preservation

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.179
Daenerys fights for the throne because of a belief in destiny. What is it?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.050
You want my bath, right?

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.810
the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros her right to rule comes from a belief in a story about

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.070
Succession but Cersei rules because she tore down those beliefs. This is why Tyrion decides to support Daenerys, so I said no

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.649
Thank you to believe and yet

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.290
Here I am

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.020
I believe in you

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.720
Tyrion a self-proclaimed cynic son of the most cold-hearted politician in Westeros and brother of Circe herself

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.440
finds his faith in Daenerys her potential rule offers a

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.579
Restoration from the chaos brought by his family and it is why she is central to this story

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.329
She hopes to restore the stories and institutions undone by civil wars and cynical Lords back in Westeros

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.060
We get another satisfying culmination Arya's revenge murder of Walder Frey for his betrayal of her family

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.209
This scene shows a different solution to the chaos revenge

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.370
The last thing you're ever going to see is a stock smiling down at you as you die

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.810
It's a satisfying moment in Game of Thrones because this type of justice is so rare

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.810
the idea of justice itself is a

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:16.479
story

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:22.479
it requires cause and effect in the writing of wrong while Circe's retribution at the start of this episode was explosive and

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:30.339
Indiscriminate Arya's retribution is incisive and personal then in Winterfell the lord of chaos himself Petyr Baelish speaks with Sansa by the weirwood tree

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.379
Sansa remarks on her growth from a naive aspiring princess too. Cynical warden Assaf the north

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.199
She is the most prominent victim of chaos in the show

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:41.930
her multiple

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.310
Traumas have created a discontinuity in her personal narrative while she once prayed and wanted to become a princess the horrors

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.069
She has been subjected to have crushed her belief in stories and happy endings like Cersei and Littlefinger

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.990
This cynicism is her advantage

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.770
But even in such a hopeless

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.810
character the show manages to find her something to believe in a way to end her trauma and finish her story setting the scene in

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.179
The godswood hints at that one last thing that Sansa believes in you my love

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.809
The future of house talk her family

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:22.029
Finally, we see the immensely consequential vision of Jon's true parentage leading into the scene where he is declared king in the north, though

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:23.960
Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.279
Heritage is not the basis of his leadership like it is for Daenerys

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:32.019
Nor is it simply because he killed his enemies like Cersei while these things are a part of it

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.329
They only matter because he could unite the disparate houses under a single banner without this popular approval

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.299
Jon's rule would be just another chaotic plotline

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.640
but their overwhelming support shows that people will put chaos and cynicism aside to fight for a common cause

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.259
Something rare for the series John is able to do this because he gave the northern Lords

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.729
Something beyond the present to believe in his warnings of White Walkers in the army of the Dead

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:03.140
Motivated them to put rivalries on hold to fight a common enemy John represents an alternative to chaos and to restoring old stories

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.610
so at the end of the winds of winter

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.090
We have two opposed

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:13.100
coronations and another would-be ruler on the way one who represents the chaos of a world without a story another who promises to restore an

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.890
Old story and a third who offers a different story entirely

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.779
At its core Game of Thrones has been a story about people finding ways to survive in an uncertain world

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.170
learning to trust in one another to fight for common causes and

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.069
reconstructing a new narrative in a world without any but before this finale

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.390
Episode the show was more about people finding their way through the present chaos

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.090
And after this episode it became about pushing

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:42.020
characters towards a future that wrapped up the past as Thrones moved towards a world driven by story and away from a world driven by

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:48.290
Chaos, it had to make a complete shift no longer focusing on the exciting and watchable present chaos

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.290
Of course the show had to end sometime

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.209
But endings are in a way against everything that made Game of Thrones special in the first place. Nonetheless

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.819
It's the fantasy we've all been indulging in for the last decade because it speaks to a universal struggle

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.169
So don't be sad how the show ends because in reality. There's no time like the present

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:14.810
In

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.630
Present shock rush coughs sometimes sounds pretty pessimistic about the current cultural landscape

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.339
He stresses how technology traps us in the present not letting ideas and thoughts have the time

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:30.309
they need to settle the cruel irony of this issue is that the Internet does give us the opportunity to learn and consume in a

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.950
productive way

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.689
If you're doing something that takes time and effort, like writing your own story
