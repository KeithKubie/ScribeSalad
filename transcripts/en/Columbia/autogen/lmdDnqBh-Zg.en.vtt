we'll talk with you about how we define
these metrics what aspects of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
these metrics what aspects of
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.110

measure which I think is one of the
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499

critical issues that we have to think

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
critical issues that we have to think
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.410
critical issues that we have to think
about and then the relationship of these

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
about and then the relationship of these
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570
about and then the relationship of these
sustainability metrics to the

the methodological issues raised by
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700
the methodological issues raised by
measuring sustainability and I hinted at

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
measuring sustainability and I hinted at
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.660

that I think an organization should
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.440
that I think an organization should
measure and I should really say that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
measure and I should really say that
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.260
measure and I should really say that
these are starting points I'm really

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270
these are starting points I'm really
 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.320
these are starting points I'm really
working and I do this here and I do this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330
working and I do this here and I do this
 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
working and I do this here and I do this
a little bit in my writing I'm trying to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
a little bit in my writing I'm trying to
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490
a little bit in my writing I'm trying to
create some boundaries knowing the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
create some boundaries knowing the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.630
people are going to take potshots at it
okay and that's okay that's really how

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
okay and that's okay that's really how
 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.520
okay and that's okay that's really how
these things start that's how they

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
these things start that's how they
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.890
these things start that's how they
evolve so I don't want you to think oh

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
evolve so I don't want you to think oh
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.540
evolve so I don't want you to think oh

when you think about material intensity

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000
when you think about material intensity
 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.180
when you think about material intensity
one of the questions is is this is it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
one of the questions is is this is it
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.630
one of the questions is is this is it
possible to recycle this are the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640
possible to recycle this are the
 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.470
possible to recycle this are the
materials being used for this product

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
materials being used for this product
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.150
materials being used for this product
renewable or mined from one-time

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160
renewable or mined from one-time
 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.420
renewable or mined from one-time
geologic resources so it's not so part

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430
geologic resources so it's not so part
 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.790
geologic resources so it's not so part
of its can it be used again but part of

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800
of its can it be used again but part of
 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.920
of its can it be used again but part of
it is is this something that we don't

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
it is is this something that we don't
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.060
it is is this something that we don't
have to worry about whether it's

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070
have to worry about whether it's
 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.010
have to worry about whether it's
recycled because we can make more of it

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020
recycled because we can make more of it
 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.909
recycled because we can make more of it
because it's essentially solar and

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919
because it's essentially solar and
 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.400
because it's essentially solar and
organic in its in its orientation

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410
organic in its in its orientation
 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.590
organic in its in its orientation
so that's material intensity the second

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600
so that's material intensity the second
 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.110
so that's material intensity the second
area is energy intensity and this is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120
area is energy intensity and this is
 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.050
area is energy intensity and this is
expressed as BTUs per unit it's a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060
expressed as BTUs per unit it's a
 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.089
expressed as BTUs per unit it's a
measure of the net fuel energy consumed

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099
measure of the net fuel energy consumed
 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.980
measure of the net fuel energy consumed
to provide the heat and power

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990
to provide the heat and power
 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.010
to provide the heat and power
requirements of the production process

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020
requirements of the production process
 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.140
requirements of the production process
okay so that's energy intensity also

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150
okay so that's energy intensity also
 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.290
okay so that's energy intensity also
again renewable versus fossil fuels so

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
again renewable versus fossil fuels so
 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.510
again renewable versus fossil fuels so
it's not just how much energy what's the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520
it's not just how much energy what's the
 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.950
it's not just how much energy what's the
source of the energy and also the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960

other words how much of the energy in

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300
other words how much of the energy in
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.610
other words how much of the energy in
the production process could have been

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620
the production process could have been
 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.110
the production process could have been
recovered so we'll have a production

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120
recovered so we'll have a production
 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.510
recovered so we'll have a production
process that uses say a thousand dollars

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520
process that uses say a thousand dollars
 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.460
process that uses say a thousand dollars
worth of electricity but it turns out

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470

are they things that we can't do
anything about if the impact is asthma

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050
anything about if the impact is asthma
 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.879
anything about if the impact is asthma
is that something that's treatable

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:06.889
is that something that's treatable
 

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:10.939
is that something that's treatable
versus the impact being cancer which

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:10.949
versus the impact being cancer which
 

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.529
versus the impact being cancer which
whilst treatable perhaps is less

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539
whilst treatable perhaps is less
 

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:14.390
whilst treatable perhaps is less
treatable so we actually have to look at

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400
treatable so we actually have to look at
 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.890
treatable so we actually have to look at
those things though this may sound a

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900
those things though this may sound a
 

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.050
those things though this may sound a
little brutal but those are in fact

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060
little brutal but those are in fact
 

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.019
little brutal but those are in fact
things you have to judge how bad is this

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:21.029
things you have to judge how bad is this
 

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:23.719
things you have to judge how bad is this
stuff is a question you have to ask and

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:23.729
stuff is a question you have to ask and
 

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:27.019
stuff is a question you have to ask and
has to be answered no other factors are

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:27.029
has to be answered no other factors are
 

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.820
has to be answered no other factors are
you know the issue of sustainability can

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:28.830
you know the issue of sustainability can
 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.730
you know the issue of sustainability can
differ by geography okay you can have a

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740
differ by geography okay you can have a
 

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.399
differ by geography okay you can have a
landfill in a desert and it's going to

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:34.409
landfill in a desert and it's going to
 

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.500
landfill in a desert and it's going to
have less of an environmental impact on

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.510
have less of an environmental impact on
 

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.600
have less of an environmental impact on
the surroundings because it's not going

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.610
the surroundings because it's not going
 

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.459
the surroundings because it's not going
to do much to ground water you put a

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:40.469
to do much to ground water you put a
 

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.649
to do much to ground water you put a
landfill you know you you know or you

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659
landfill you know you you know or you
 

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.939
landfill you know you you know or you
you know if you try to hydro frack gas

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:45.949
you know if you try to hydro frack gas
 

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:48.860
you know if you try to hydro frack gas
by the watershed that's a little bit

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:48.870
by the watershed that's a little bit
 

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.810
by the watershed that's a little bit
different than if it's in a place that

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820
different than if it's in a place that
 

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.010
different than if it's in a place that
doesn't have a lot of groundwater

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.020
doesn't have a lot of groundwater
 

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.630
doesn't have a lot of groundwater
not to say you should do in either place

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640
not to say you should do in either place
 

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.550
not to say you should do in either place
but that is something a sustainability

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560
but that is something a sustainability
 

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.850
but that is something a sustainability
metric would help you to measure and to

00:08:59.850 --> 00:08:59.860
metric would help you to measure and to
 

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.889
metric would help you to measure and to
weigh along with other kinds of issues

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:01.899
weigh along with other kinds of issues
 

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:04.760
weigh along with other kinds of issues
and then you have to wait all this stuff

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:04.770
and then you have to wait all this stuff
 

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.970
and then you have to wait all this stuff
water energy toxic pollutants what's

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:08.980
water energy toxic pollutants what's
 

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.650
water energy toxic pollutants what's
more important as we develop the

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:10.660
more important as we develop the
 

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.380
more important as we develop the
measures for our organization in this

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:13.390
measures for our organization in this
 

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.900

place all of which is going to vary by

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:15.910
place all of which is going to vary by
 

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.590
place all of which is going to vary by
what we do where we are and what's the

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600
what we do where we are and what's the
 

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.740
what we do where we are and what's the
human settlement patterns are around us

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:21.750
human settlement patterns are around us
 

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.660
human settlement patterns are around us
okay now again I said human settlement

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:24.670
okay now again I said human settlement
 

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.620
okay now again I said human settlement
patterns there people would say well

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:25.630
patterns there people would say well
 

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.389
patterns there people would say well
that's unethical we should worry just as

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399
that's unethical we should worry just as
 

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.340
that's unethical we should worry just as
much about the B's and the answers about

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.350
much about the B's and the answers about
 

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.829
much about the B's and the answers about
people well I know that there people

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839
people well I know that there people
 

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:34.079
people well I know that there people
believe that and I I think that that is

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:34.089
believe that and I I think that that is
 

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:37.800
believe that and I I think that that is
an ethical choice that they make I don't

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:37.810
an ethical choice that they make I don't
 

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.500
an ethical choice that they make I don't
make that choice I'm more concerned

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:40.510
make that choice I'm more concerned
 

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:46.019
make that choice I'm more concerned
about people so those are the problems

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:46.029
about people so those are the problems
 

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.060
about people so those are the problems
in measurement I mean just think about

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.070
in measurement I mean just think about
 

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.490
in measurement I mean just think about
what I've just laid out you know all of

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:50.500
what I've just laid out you know all of
 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.130
what I've just laid out you know all of
these different issues and all of these

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.140
these different issues and all of these
 

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.840
these different issues and all of these
complexities and how do you measure that

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:54.850
complexities and how do you measure that
 

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.060
complexities and how do you measure that
in an organization now

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.070
in an organization now
 

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.220
in an organization now
having laid out how complex is let me

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.230
having laid out how complex is let me
 

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.930
having laid out how complex is let me
just say that organizations do this all

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:00.940
just say that organizations do this all
 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.630
just say that organizations do this all
the time you have to measure what an

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
the time you have to measure what an
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.699
the time you have to measure what an
organization does you have to measure

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:05.709
organization does you have to measure
 

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.370
organization does you have to measure
its performance this is an aspect of its

its performance this is an aspect of its
performance that's going to become more

performance that's going to become more
 

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.110
performance that's going to become more
and more important in organizational

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120
and more important in organizational
 

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.090
and more important in organizational
management in part because of the

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.100
management in part because of the
 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.290
management in part because of the
regulatory environment because

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:16.300
regulatory environment because

government's going to make people do it
in part because resources themselves are

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399
in part because resources themselves are
 

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:23.940
in part because resources themselves are
becoming contaminated and scarce and we

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:23.950
becoming contaminated and scarce and we
 

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.819
becoming contaminated and scarce and we
have no choice because otherwise we will

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:26.829
have no choice because otherwise we will
 

00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:28.980
have no choice because otherwise we will
degrade the resources of the providers

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:28.990
degrade the resources of the providers

with wealth government it may lead us to

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.060
with wealth government it may lead us to
 

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.880
with wealth government it may lead us to
do that but corporations themselves may

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:32.890
do that but corporations themselves may
 

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.040
do that but corporations themselves may
see the importance of doing it and some

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.050
see the importance of doing it and some
 

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.230
see the importance of doing it and some
of them already have and then this is

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240
of them already have and then this is
 

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.790
of them already have and then this is
cultural change which i think is taking

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800
cultural change which i think is taking
 

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.819
cultural change which i think is taking
place which is to say that you know how

as we come up with these metrics then
 

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.440
as we come up with these metrics then
they have to be developed collected and

did we admit we want to make sure we
 

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.410
did we admit we want to make sure we
only admit about no more than half the

only admit about no more than half the
 

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.630
only admit about no more than half the
people that that apply and then how many

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:01.640
people that that apply and then how many
 

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.710

well we want at least half of those

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.010
well we want at least half of those

okay so our retention and attrition

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920
okay so our retention and attrition

the time and so what this is saying is
we need to add sustainability indicators

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:28.730
we need to add sustainability indicators
 

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.569
we need to add sustainability indicators
to that mix it's very straightforward

00:14:31.569 --> 00:14:31.579
to that mix it's very straightforward
 

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.210
to that mix it's very straightforward
what we're trying to do but it's very

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:34.220
what we're trying to do but it's very
 

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.550
what we're trying to do but it's very
hard so it leads me to the fourth issue

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560
hard so it leads me to the fourth issue
 

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.319
hard so it leads me to the fourth issue
for today what are the methodological

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:38.329
for today what are the methodological
 

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:40.569
for today what are the methodological
issues raised by measuring

00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:40.579
issues raised by measuring
 

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:43.240
issues raised by measuring
sustainability now part of the problem

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.250
sustainability now part of the problem
 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.920
sustainability now part of the problem
is when you when you can when you

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:44.930
is when you when you can when you
 

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.930
is when you when you can when you
develop a measure you want the measure

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:46.940
develop a measure you want the measure
 

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.370
develop a measure you want the measure
to be reliable and valid reliable means

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.380
to be reliable and valid reliable means
 

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.230
to be reliable and valid reliable means
that every time you do the measure

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240
that every time you do the measure
 

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.019
that every time you do the measure
you're measuring the same thing you

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:56.029
you're measuring the same thing you
 

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.030
you're measuring the same thing you
don't change it you don't change the

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040
don't change it you don't change the
 

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.819
don't change it you don't change the
goalposts you don't change the scoring

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:00.829
goalposts you don't change the scoring
 

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:02.829
goalposts you don't change the scoring
system in the middle of of the

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839
system in the middle of of the
 

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.810
system in the middle of of the
measurement you know you don't decide oh

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:04.820
measurement you know you don't decide oh
 

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.210
measurement you know you don't decide oh
this isn't going too well let's change

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.220
this isn't going too well let's change
 

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.790
this isn't going too well let's change
the criteria okay that's that's a

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800
the criteria okay that's that's a
 

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.460
the criteria okay that's that's a
measure that's that's not reliable and

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:12.470
measure that's that's not reliable and
 

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.900
measure that's that's not reliable and
then they have to be valid you have to

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:13.910
then they have to be valid you have to
 

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.130
then they have to be valid you have to
measure what you actually think you're

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:15.140
measure what you actually think you're
 

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.120
measure what you actually think you're
measuring okay and when you so that's

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.130
measuring okay and when you so that's
 

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.819
measuring okay and when you so that's
the creation of the measure itself but

00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:21.829
the creation of the measure itself but
 

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:23.710
the creation of the measure itself but
then once you decide what you want to

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720
then once you decide what you want to
 

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.210
then once you decide what you want to
measure then you have to collect

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.220
measure then you have to collect
 

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.579
measure then you have to collect
information you have to collect

00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:27.589
information you have to collect
 

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:29.949

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440
methodological II they had the worst
 

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.860
methodological II they had the worst
polls during this election they were off

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:56.870
polls during this election they were off
 

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.470
polls during this election they were off
more than anybody else and they looked

00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480
more than anybody else and they looked
 

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.940
more than anybody else and they looked
at how they were collecting their

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:00.950
at how they were collecting their
 

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.710
at how they were collecting their
information one of the things you do

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720
information one of the things you do
 

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.630
information one of the things you do
when you do polling is you have to

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:04.640
when you do polling is you have to
 

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.390
when you do polling is you have to
randomize at the place of you know went

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:07.400
randomize at the place of you know went
 

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.700
randomize at the place of you know went
like when you make the call you have to

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:09.710
like when you make the call you have to
 

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.410
like when you make the call you have to
say you have to decide you want to talk

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.420
say you have to decide you want to talk
 

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.590
say you have to decide you want to talk
to the oldest female in the house and so

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600
to the oldest female in the house and so
 

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.140
to the oldest female in the house and so
if the oldest male in the house is there

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.150
if the oldest male in the house is there
 

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.850
if the oldest male in the house is there
you say no no I need to talk to you

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:18.860
you say no no I need to talk to you
 

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.650
you say no no I need to talk to you
oldest female she's not here you hang up

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.660
oldest female she's not here you hang up
 

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.540
oldest female she's not here you hang up
you got to go to another person that's

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:22.550
you got to go to another person that's
 

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.490
you got to go to another person that's
how you randomize at the household

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:24.500
how you randomize at the household
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.830
how you randomize at the household
apparently they don't do it they do a

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:26.840
apparently they don't do it they do a
 

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.410
apparently they don't do it they do a
few other things in their methodology so

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:29.420
few other things in their methodology so
 

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.960
few other things in their methodology so
how you collect information has a lot to

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:31.970
how you collect information has a lot to
 

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.700
how you collect information has a lot to
do with the quality of the information

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:33.710
do with the quality of the information
 

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.310
do with the quality of the information
that you collect now when you're new

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320
that you collect now when you're new
 

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.110
that you collect now when you're new
it's something when you're starting

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120
it's something when you're starting
 

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.640
it's something when you're starting
something for the first time you don't

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:39.650
something for the first time you don't
 

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.140
something for the first time you don't
have a lot of experience collecting it

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.150
have a lot of experience collecting it
 

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.690
have a lot of experience collecting it
you make mistakes I mean you make

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:43.700
you make mistakes I mean you make
 

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.130
you make mistakes I mean you make
mistakes because you don't quite know

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.140
mistakes because you don't quite know
 

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.890
mistakes because you don't quite know
how to ask the question you don't quite

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:47.900
how to ask the question you don't quite
 

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.620
how to ask the question you don't quite
know how to calibrate your measurement

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:50.630
know how to calibrate your measurement
 

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.590
know how to calibrate your measurement
tools and so as you're doing it you have

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600
tools and so as you're doing it you have
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.040
tools and so as you're doing it you have
to learn so after a while you figure it

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.050
to learn so after a while you figure it
 

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.930
to learn so after a while you figure it
out you get better at it you know you

00:16:58.930 --> 00:16:58.940
out you get better at it you know you
 

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.790
out you get better at it you know you
get better at taking the measurement and

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800
get better at taking the measurement and
 

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.150
get better at taking the measurement and
so eventually the your collection system

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160
so eventually the your collection system
 

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.449
so eventually the your collection system
or works better so you need to

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:07.459
or works better so you need to
 

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.610
or works better so you need to
understand that the second method issue

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:09.620
understand that the second method issue
 

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.370
understand that the second method issue
here is the experience and skill in

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380
here is the experience and skill in
 

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.110
here is the experience and skill in
collecting information itself and then

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120
collecting information itself and then
 

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.400
collecting information itself and then
sometimes it's hard to know what to

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:18.410
sometimes it's hard to know what to
 

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.480
sometimes it's hard to know what to
measure you know we just went through

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:19.490
measure you know we just went through
 

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.579
measure you know we just went through
all those other measures right the whole

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:21.589
all those other measures right the whole
 

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.640
all those other measures right the whole

is material intensity is important for

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.130
is material intensity is important for
 

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.150
is material intensity is important for
example is energy intensity probably not

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160

is it a coffee company and the service
 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.080
is it a coffee company and the service
is incidental judging by the service I

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.090
is incidental judging by the service I
 

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.280
is incidental judging by the service I
beginning I think the service may be

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.290
beginning I think the service may be
 

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.830
beginning I think the service may be
incidental but no the question here is

00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840
incidental but no the question here is
 

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.860
incidental but no the question here is
you have to make that decision as you

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:02.870
you have to make that decision as you
 

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.230
you have to make that decision as you
create your measurement system and you

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240
create your measurement system and you
 

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.630
create your measurement system and you
have to and what you decide to measure

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640
have to and what you decide to measure

when we start focusing on taking tests

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:20.690
when we start focusing on taking tests
 

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.830
when we start focusing on taking tests
teachers start teaching to the test they

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840
teachers start teaching to the test they
 

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.720
teachers start teaching to the test they
don't care whether the kids are learning

they care whether they're performing
well on the test now if the two things

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.030
well on the test now if the two things
 

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.600
well on the test now if the two things
are the same great but if they're not

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:31.610
are the same great but if they're not
 

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.540

you've got a problem so measurement is

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:34.550
you've got a problem so measurement is
 

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.549
you've got a problem so measurement is
not neutral and it's certainly not

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559
not neutral and it's certainly not
 

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:40.169
not neutral and it's certainly not
neutral within the organization okay so

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:40.179
neutral within the organization okay so

neutral within the organization okay so
you need to understand that as you think

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:42.890
you need to understand that as you think
 

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.250
you need to understand that as you think
about sustainability indicators and this

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:45.260
about sustainability indicators and this
 

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.900
about sustainability indicators and this
issue of cherry-picking indicators you

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:46.910
issue of cherry-picking indicators you
 

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.700
issue of cherry-picking indicators you
look to see what are we doing good at

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:48.710
look to see what are we doing good at
 

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.100
look to see what are we doing good at
let's emphasize that makes us look more

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.110
let's emphasize that makes us look more
 

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.870
let's emphasize that makes us look more
sustainable and particularly with the

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880
sustainable and particularly with the
 

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.370
sustainable and particularly with the
emphasis on green washing you have to

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:54.380
emphasis on green washing you have to
 

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.060
emphasis on green washing you have to
watch for that weighting indicators in

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.070
watch for that weighting indicators in
 

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.950
watch for that weighting indicators in
an overall scale can it can introduce

00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960
an overall scale can it can introduce
 

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.110
an overall scale can it can introduce
bias and as we want to come up with an

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120
bias and as we want to come up with an
 

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.169
bias and as we want to come up with an
overall sustainability measure like the

00:19:05.169 --> 00:19:05.179
overall sustainability measure like the
 

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:08.230
overall sustainability measure like the
gross national product like market share

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240
gross national product like market share
 

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.780
gross national product like market share
like the bottom-line okay what's it

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:10.790
like the bottom-line okay what's it
 

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.610
like the bottom-line okay what's it
going to be how do we put that number

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:12.620
going to be how do we put that number
 

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.080
going to be how do we put that number
together how do we weight it so that's

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.090
together how do we weight it so that's
 

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.600
together how do we weight it so that's
an issue that's still out there and I

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:19.610
an issue that's still out there and I
 

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.120
an issue that's still out there and I
think will vary by organization by

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.130
think will vary by organization by
 

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.500
think will vary by organization by
geography by product by service by what

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.510
geography by product by service by what
 

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.760

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:32.830
competences what is it trying to trying
to do in some cases qualitative factors

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840
to do in some cases qualitative factors
 

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.260
to do in some cases qualitative factors
may be just as important as those things

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:35.270
may be just as important as those things
 

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.910
may be just as important as those things
that you can measure some of the

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:36.920
that you can measure some of the
 

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.560
that you can measure some of the
sustainability issues that are important

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.570
sustainability issues that are important
 

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.450
sustainability issues that are important
to you aren't subject to measurement yes

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.460
to you aren't subject to measurement yes
 

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.970
to you aren't subject to measurement yes
you know the fair trade issues you were

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:42.980
you know the fair trade issues you were
 

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.410
you know the fair trade issues you were
describing before which aren't part of

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:44.420
describing before which aren't part of

describing before which aren't part of
my measurement of sustainability but

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640
my measurement of sustainability but
 

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.980
my measurement of sustainability but
might be part of yours how do you

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:47.990
might be part of yours how do you
 

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.690
might be part of yours how do you
measure that how do you measure

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:49.700
measure that how do you measure
 

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.780
measure that how do you measure
satisfaction how do you measure then if

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:52.790
satisfaction how do you measure then if
 

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.210
satisfaction how do you measure then if
you're comparing material intensity to

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.220
you're comparing material intensity to
 

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.770
you're comparing material intensity to
water intensity to energy intensity

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:56.780
water intensity to energy intensity

which is more important but management

00:19:59.050 --> 00:19:59.060
which is more important but management
 

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.549
which is more important but management
has to make these decisions and

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559
has to make these decisions and
 

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:03.129
has to make these decisions and
one of the critical issues for a manager

00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:03.139
one of the critical issues for a manager
 

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:04.840
one of the critical issues for a manager
is decide what's the definition of

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:04.850
is decide what's the definition of
 

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.090
is decide what's the definition of
success and how will you know if we got

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.100
success and how will you know if we got
 

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.249
success and how will you know if we got
there so in sustainability is the same

00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:09.259
there so in sustainability is the same
 

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:10.960
there so in sustainability is the same
thing what's the definition of a

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:10.970
thing what's the definition of a
 

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.090
thing what's the definition of a
sustainability success for organization

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:13.100
sustainability success for organization
 

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.310
sustainability success for organization
and what are the indicators that I is

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320
and what are the indicators that I is
 

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.549
and what are the indicators that I is
the manager I'm going to use to measure

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559
the manager I'm going to use to measure
 

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:21.249
the manager I'm going to use to measure
against as we seek to perform it so

00:20:21.249 --> 00:20:21.259
against as we seek to perform it so
 

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.110
against as we seek to perform it so
despite all of these problems and I

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120
despite all of these problems and I
 

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.149
despite all of these problems and I
don't think I've been too shy about

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159
don't think I've been too shy about
 

00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:27.369
don't think I've been too shy about
introducing them to you

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:27.379
introducing them to you
 

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:30.820
introducing them to you
sustainability metrics are essential we

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:30.830
sustainability metrics are essential we
 

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.980
sustainability metrics are essential we
really have to figure out how to do this

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:32.990
really have to figure out how to do this
 

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.720
really have to figure out how to do this
we need to develop a way to

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:34.730
we need to develop a way to
 

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.359
we need to develop a way to
operationally measure success in this

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:37.369
operationally measure success in this
 

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:41.799
operationally measure success in this
area measurements force precision in

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:41.809
area measurements force precision in
 

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:44.769
area measurements force precision in
defining goals and then force precision

00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:44.779
defining goals and then force precision
 

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:47.230
defining goals and then force precision
in the actions to achieve those goals

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240
in the actions to achieve those goals
 

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.200
in the actions to achieve those goals
now sometimes that means you make

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.210
now sometimes that means you make
 

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.139
now sometimes that means you make
mistakes some of the first efforts at

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:53.149
mistakes some of the first efforts at
 

00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:55.749
mistakes some of the first efforts at
measuring performance in organizations

00:20:55.749 --> 00:20:55.759
measuring performance in organizations
 

00:20:55.759 --> 00:21:00.159
measuring performance in organizations
were led organizations astray the

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:00.169
were led organizations astray the
 

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:03.460
were led organizations astray the
classic was actually in the military

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:03.470
classic was actually in the military
 

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.980
classic was actually in the military
during the war in Vietnam one of the

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:05.990
during the war in Vietnam one of the
 

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.330
during the war in Vietnam one of the
first quantitative performance

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340
first quantitative performance

indicators used by Bob McNamara was

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320
indicators used by Bob McNamara was
 

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.440
indicators used by Bob McNamara was
Secretary of Defense was body counts

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:11.450
Secretary of Defense was body counts
 

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.710
Secretary of Defense was body counts
they measured how many people were dying

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720
they measured how many people were dying
 

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.810
they measured how many people were dying
they forgot something so they saw how

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:16.820
they forgot something so they saw how
 

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.190
they forgot something so they saw how
many Americans were dying how many

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200
many Americans were dying how many
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.769
many Americans were dying how many
beaten to me soldiers were dying what

00:21:20.769 --> 00:21:20.779
beaten to me soldiers were dying what
 

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.690
beaten to me soldiers were dying what
they didn't understand is that our

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:22.700
they didn't understand is that our
 

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.080
they didn't understand is that our
tolerance for loss was a quite a bit

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.090
tolerance for loss was a quite a bit
 

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.629
tolerance for loss was a quite a bit
lower than the Vietnamese because they

00:21:28.629 --> 00:21:28.639
lower than the Vietnamese because they
 

00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:30.879
lower than the Vietnamese because they
were defending their country and so if

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:30.889
were defending their country and so if
 

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:32.799
were defending their country and so if
they lost a million or two million

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:32.809
they lost a million or two million
 

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:34.419
they lost a million or two million
soldiers in the defense of their

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:34.429
soldiers in the defense of their
 

00:21:34.429 --> 00:21:36.970
soldiers in the defense of their
homeland they were going to put up with

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:36.980
homeland they were going to put up with
 

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.669
homeland they were going to put up with
that if we lost 50,000 soldiers we

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679
that if we lost 50,000 soldiers we
 

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:40.840
that if we lost 50,000 soldiers we
weren't going to put up with it

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:40.850
weren't going to put up with it
 

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.629
weren't going to put up with it
so the real measure of success probably

00:21:43.629 --> 00:21:43.639
so the real measure of success probably
 

00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:45.609
so the real measure of success probably
should have been territory held or

00:21:45.609 --> 00:21:45.619
should have been territory held or
 

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:47.830
should have been territory held or
should have been something else besides

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840
should have been something else besides
 

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.950
should have been something else besides
body counts but you know look like a

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960
body counts but you know look like a
 

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.509
body counts but you know look like a
good measure seemed pretty important at

00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:52.519
good measure seemed pretty important at
 

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:58.109
good measure seemed pretty important at
the time just happened to be wrong now

00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:58.119
 

00:21:58.119 --> 00:22:00.999
organizations always allocate scarce

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:01.009
organizations always allocate scarce
 

00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:03.730
organizations always allocate scarce
resources all organizational resources

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:03.740
resources all organizational resources
 

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.700
resources all organizational resources
are always scarce and they allocate them

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:05.710
are always scarce and they allocate them
 

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.159
are always scarce and they allocate them
to focus on goal achievement there's

00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:09.169
to focus on goal achievement there's
 

00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:10.990
to focus on goal achievement there's
always a competition for the time and

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000
always a competition for the time and
 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.310
always a competition for the time and
energy of the people who work in an

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320
energy of the people who work in an
 

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.690
energy of the people who work in an
organization

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.700
organization
 

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.049
organization
and so that's the other reason you want

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:17.059
and so that's the other reason you want
 

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:20.049
and so that's the other reason you want
sustainability indicators by creating

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:20.059
sustainability indicators by creating
 

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:21.850
sustainability indicators by creating
those indicators you then get into the

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.860
those indicators you then get into the
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.820
those indicators you then get into the
competition for money and people in an

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:24.830
competition for money and people in an
 

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.519
competition for money and people in an
organization okay if you don't have

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:27.529
organization okay if you don't have
 

00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:30.549
organization okay if you don't have
those sustainability indicators then you

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559
those sustainability indicators then you
 

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:32.289
those sustainability indicators then you
know people will be managing the

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:32.299
know people will be managing the
 

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:34.060
know people will be managing the
organization against other factors and

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.070
organization against other factors and
 

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.669
organization against other factors and
so it's absolutely essential to develop

00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679
so it's absolutely essential to develop
 

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:39.820
so it's absolutely essential to develop
these indicators or this activity will

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:39.830
these indicators or this activity will
 

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.399
these indicators or this activity will
not continue in an organization so

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:42.409
not continue in an organization so
 

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:45.250
not continue in an organization so
that's the the bottom line frankly of

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:45.260
that's the the bottom line frankly of
 

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.299
that's the the bottom line frankly of
why these measures have to be developed

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:48.309
why these measures have to be developed
 

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:52.149
why these measures have to be developed
the process of defining and improving

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159
the process of defining and improving
 

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.129
the process of defining and improving
organizational routines which is what

00:22:54.129 --> 00:22:54.139
organizational routines which is what
 

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:55.629
organizational routines which is what
we're talking about to make

00:22:55.629 --> 00:22:55.639
we're talking about to make
 

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:57.549
we're talking about to make
sustainability happen in an organization

00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559
sustainability happen in an organization
 

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:00.850
sustainability happen in an organization
has to begin somewhere sometimes it

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:00.860
has to begin somewhere sometimes it
 

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.340
has to begin somewhere sometimes it
begins with a small step something that

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.350
begins with a small step something that
 

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.049
begins with a small step something that
you can get your arms around you can

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:05.059
you can get your arms around you can
 

00:23:05.059 --> 00:23:07.720
you can get your arms around you can
define so let's say it's let's reduce

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.730
define so let's say it's let's reduce
 

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.960
define so let's say it's let's reduce
energy use okay let's just reduce our

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:10.970
energy use okay let's just reduce our
 

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.840
energy use okay let's just reduce our
electric bills okay that will make us a

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:13.850
electric bills okay that will make us a
 

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.340
electric bills okay that will make us a
more sustainable organization you see

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:15.350
more sustainable organization you see
 

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.289
more sustainable organization you see
that happening people are putting in

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:38.809
sustainability's are developed they can
 

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:41.320
sustainability's are developed they can
be applied they will be and then they

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.330
be applied they will be and then they
 

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.620
be applied they will be and then they
can be refined so the indicators

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:44.630
can be refined so the indicators
 

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.980
can be refined so the indicators

against this we're going to be asked how

00:23:55.389 --> 00:23:55.399
against this we're going to be asked how
 

00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:57.519
against this we're going to be asked how
much water we use how much electricity

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:57.529
much water we use how much electricity
 

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:01.149
much water we use how much electricity
we use we might even be asked how much

00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159
we use we might even be asked how much
 

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:03.399
we use we might even be asked how much
garbage we're producing and how much of

00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:03.409
garbage we're producing and how much of
 

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:06.279

start with the simple stuff the stuff

00:24:08.289 --> 00:24:08.299
start with the simple stuff the stuff
 

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.100
start with the simple stuff the stuff
that we know are relatively easy to do

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.110
that we know are relatively easy to do
 

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.649
that we know are relatively easy to do
and then as time goes on you'll see the

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:14.659
and then as time goes on you'll see the
 

00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:17.759
and then as time goes on you'll see the
measurements become more sophisticated a

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:17.769
measurements become more sophisticated a

and so what you're gonna see is a lot of

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:29.270
and so what you're gonna see is a lot of
 

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.210
and so what you're gonna see is a lot of
people borrowing from each other people

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.220

going to other organizations and trying

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:32.780
going to other organizations and trying
 

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.880
going to other organizations and trying
to figure out well how do they do it at

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:33.890
to figure out well how do they do it at
 

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.850
to figure out well how do they do it at
Starbucks how they do it at Walmart

let's see let's try to imitate that

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.180
let's see let's try to imitate that
 

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.930
let's see let's try to imitate that
let's see if that'll work here

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:39.940
let's see if that'll work here
 

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.280
let's see if that'll work here
eventually you're going to start seeing

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.290
eventually you're going to start seeing
 

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.940
eventually you're going to start seeing
the indicators get more common and in

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:45.950
the indicators get more common and in
 

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.760
the indicators get more common and in
more general use you know we saw this

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:48.770
more general use you know we saw this
 

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.250
more general use you know we saw this
actually in the financial world with the

accounting practices those are the ones
 

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.510
accounting practices those are the ones
that developed over time as more and

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520
that developed over time as more and
 

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.060
that developed over time as more and
more organizations started to use them

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.070
more organizations started to use them

measurements essential very often though

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.150
measurements essential very often though
 

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.790
measurements essential very often though
when you start measuring something for

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:33.800
when you start measuring something for
 

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.090
when you start measuring something for
the first time you make mistakes and so

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:37.100
the first time you make mistakes and so
 

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.920
the first time you make mistakes and so
what's really important is that we

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:38.930
what's really important is that we
 

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.800
what's really important is that we
program an organizational learning that

to take place early on we have a lot to
 

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.500
to take place early on we have a lot to
learn and need to be open to listening
