00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.283
Hello Internet!

00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.483
You know I love me some voting videos.

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:05.003
These, however, are mostly about how

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.562
organizations can improve their elections.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.718
But normal people need better voting too.

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:10.960
Say a group of you are trying to decide

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.252
what to have for dinner.

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:13.360
There are three options:

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.915
Steak Shack - All meat all the time

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.219
Veggie Villa - Hope you like lettuce

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.878
and Burger Barn - Every burger ever.

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:19.906
(Including the ones made from not-meat?)

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:21.384
Just asking people to pick their favorites

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:24.076
as normal results in three starved carnivores.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:25.355
Now you could use one of these

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:27.131
better methods I've talked about before.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.259
But seriously, who wants to break out

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.744
the pens and paper and nerd

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:31.316
to crank the algorithm for a question

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:33.507
that should be answered in under 30 seconds?

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.096
No one. So here the fastest way to vote

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:36.299
in a group with none of that stuff required.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.331
Don't blink or you'll miss it.

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:38.665
Hands up if you're good with Steak Shack,

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:39.936
Hands up if you're good with Burger Barn,

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.445
Hands up if you're good with Veggie Villa.

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:42.018
Boom

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:42.599
Election over.

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:43.887
Burger Barn domination.

00:00:43.887 --> 00:00:45.557
This time, everybody gets to live.

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:47.553
The difference? Letting people vote

00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:48.744
more than once.

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:49.584
If you're in a group and picking

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.733
from several options quickly,

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.964
then this is the way to go.

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:53.854
It's world-changingly great at stopping

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.696
arguments like, for example,

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:56.710
in a classroom.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.392
Hey kids! We're gonna watch a movie today!

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.996
Because, I just can't, anymore...

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:01.834
So let's go:

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.004
Hands up for Terminator 2

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.117
Hands up for Spirited Away.

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.094
Hands up for WALL-E.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:05.944
Done. WALL-E it is.

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:07.910
Lazy Bonus! If you're in charge of the vote,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.976
no need to keep an eye out

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:10.130
for those aspiring dictators who

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.257
subvert democracy by voting more than once.

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:13.575
Voting more than once

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:14.604
is the whole point.

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:15.430
So, next time you're in a group

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.112
trying to decide,

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:17.543
don't just ask for the favorite,

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.324
ask for all the OKs.

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:20.448
Best way to decide quickly,

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:23.596
no pen or paper or nerd required.
