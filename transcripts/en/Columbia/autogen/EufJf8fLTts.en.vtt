I'll give you some examples later on

I'll give you some examples later on

rent-seeking were used not only more

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.500
rent-seeking were used not only more
 

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.530
rent-seeking were used not only more
polite but sometimes more intelligent

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:28.540
polite but sometimes more intelligent
 

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.329
polite but sometimes more intelligent
because sometimes it's hard to

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:30.339
because sometimes it's hard to
 

00:12:30.339 --> 00:12:32.189
because sometimes it's hard to
distinguish between what is waste and

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199
distinguish between what is waste and
 

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:33.660
distinguish between what is waste and
what is corruption

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.670
what is corruption
 

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.280
what is corruption
what is stealing and what is waste and

what is stealing and what is waste and
 

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.350
what is stealing and what is waste and
rent-seeking is sort of a mix of both

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360
rent-seeking is sort of a mix of both
 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.780
rent-seeking is sort of a mix of both
more easily anyway be that as it may

kind of data try to drill down more and
 

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:51.769
kind of data try to drill down more and
more and at the World Bank for example

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779
more and at the World Bank for example
 

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:54.679

the tax officer comes or when the

the tax officer comes or when the

operating license etc and so the hope

00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199
operating license etc and so the hope
 

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:19.290

was by drilling down we're getting more

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
was by drilling down we're getting more
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.059
was by drilling down we're getting more
and more to people who may have an

get better data sets etc and now we have

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040
get better data sets etc and now we have
 

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960
get better data sets etc and now we have
a little bit of time to evaluate whether

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:30.970
a little bit of time to evaluate whether
 

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.910
a little bit of time to evaluate whether
that is really so and it's not terribly

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.150
170 have 107 countries and I'll just
mention the examples of Russia and China

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160
mention the examples of Russia and China
 

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.490
mention the examples of Russia and China
so on the CPI the corruption perception

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:05.500
so on the CPI the corruption perception
 

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.820
so on the CPI the corruption perception

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.210

from the corruption business say there's

from the corruption business say there's
 

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.220
from the corruption business say there's
a huge difference so we don't really

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.230
a huge difference so we don't really
 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.050
a huge difference so we don't really
know or necessarily what is the truth

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060
know or necessarily what is the truth

other cases have come out up since then

other cases have come out up since then
which cast doubt as to whether the

that erupted led to a material shift in

really known you know there shouldn't
 

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.660
really known you know there shouldn't
have been a shift in the index but

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:27.670
have been a shift in the index but
 

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.060
have been a shift in the index but
apparently they didn't this is not

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.070
apparently they didn't this is not
 

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.800
apparently they didn't this is not
surprising and this is not to say that

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:31.810
surprising and this is not to say that
 

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.660
surprising and this is not to say that
these perception indices don't make any

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:33.670
these perception indices don't make any
 

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.390
these perception indices don't make any
sense and can't be used for something

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:35.400
sense and can't be used for something
 

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.140
sense and can't be used for something
but we just have to be

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.150
but we just have to be
 

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.230
but we just have to be
aware of how much reality and how much

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240
aware of how much reality and how much
 

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.690
aware of how much reality and how much
meaning there is in each one of them and

meaning there is in each one of them and
 

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.490
meaning there is in each one of them and
so then what have we learned what can we

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.500
so then what have we learned what can we
 

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.470
so then what have we learned what can we
say we've learned from all these data

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480
say we've learned from all these data
 

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.290
say we've learned from all these data
including data of individual scandals

including data of individual scandals
 

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.090
including data of individual scandals
where there were investigations or

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:51.100
where there were investigations or
 

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.250
where there were investigations or
judicial processes press reports about

actual amounts being stolen first

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:56.470
actual amounts being stolen first
 

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.400
actual amounts being stolen first
observation is when you compare the

00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.410
observation is when you compare the
 

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.460
observation is when you compare the
amounts stolen through corruption to the

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:02.470
amounts stolen through corruption to the
 

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.100
amounts stolen through corruption to the
sales volumes to which they apply if you

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:05.110
sales volumes to which they apply if you
 

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.140
sales volumes to which they apply if you
like it's just a few percentage points

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.150
like it's just a few percentage points
 

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.120
like it's just a few percentage points
on average it's not a lot

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.130
on average it's not a lot
 

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.980
on average it's not a lot
so normally economists would say three

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:13.990
so normally economists would say three
 

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.110
so normally economists would say three
four or five percentage points of

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120
four or five percentage points of
 

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.660
four or five percentage points of
indirect tax in an economy is actually a

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:18.670
indirect tax in an economy is actually a
 

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.290
indirect tax in an economy is actually a
quite efficient way of raising revenue

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300
quite efficient way of raising revenue
 

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.270
quite efficient way of raising revenue
so why should raising three to five

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.280
so why should raising three to five
 

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.420
so why should raising three to five
percentage points or so off corrupt

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.430
percentage points or so off corrupt
 

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.510

money or money in corrupt ways raising

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:30.520
money or money in corrupt ways raising
 

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.400
money or money in corrupt ways raising
that in corrupt ways why should that be

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:32.410
that in corrupt ways why should that be
 

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.260
that in corrupt ways why should that be
so bad

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.270
so bad
 

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.450
so bad
this is a puzzle so the amount itself

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:36.460
this is a puzzle so the amount itself
 

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.900
this is a puzzle so the amount itself
cannot explain why corruption is so bad

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.910
cannot explain why corruption is so bad
 

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.240
cannot explain why corruption is so bad
it must be something else going on the

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.250
it must be something else going on the
 

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.160
it must be something else going on the
way in which this money is raised is the

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.170
way in which this money is raised is the
 

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.950
way in which this money is raised is the
big issue not the amount per se not

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:46.960
big issue not the amount per se not
 

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960
big issue not the amount per se not
trying to justify the amounts I'm just

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:48.970
trying to justify the amounts I'm just
 

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.150
trying to justify the amounts I'm just
saying the amounts per se don't explain

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160
saying the amounts per se don't explain
 

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.960
saying the amounts per se don't explain
it the second thing is it seems

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:54.970
it the second thing is it seems
 

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.910
it the second thing is it seems
plausible that countries that are

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920
plausible that countries that are
 

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.920

relatively rich in this world are

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:58.930
relatively rich in this world are

ostensibly not so corrupt that's what

ostensibly not so corrupt that's what
comes out of perception indices that

is actually no significant correlation

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:14.830
is actually no significant correlation
 

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.400
is actually no significant correlation
between corruption and growth rates so

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.410
between corruption and growth rates so
 

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.820
between corruption and growth rates so
the level of income is associated with

the level of income is associated with

the level of income is associated with

less corruption higher income less
 

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.290
less corruption higher income less

to higher riches don't seem to be
 

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.130
to higher riches don't seem to be

as measured by the data which with all

the problems that we have and so the

the problems that we have and so the
 

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.320
the problems that we have and so the
question is so this after two decades of

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.330
question is so this after two decades of
 

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.919
question is so this after two decades of
work on data to my mind is a

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:45.929
work on data to my mind is a
 

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:48.350
work on data to my mind is a
as a snapshot of what we have learned

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360
as a snapshot of what we have learned
 

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.649
as a snapshot of what we have learned
from that exercise and so then people

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:51.659
from that exercise and so then people
 

00:17:51.659 --> 00:17:53.090
from that exercise and so then people
are now calling some maybe there is

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100
are now calling some maybe there is
 

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.710
are now calling some maybe there is
something about the types of corruptions

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720
something about the types of corruptions
 

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.239
something about the types of corruptions
the nature of particular corrupt

corruption itself that is the prime
 

00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:18.169
corruption itself that is the prime
should be the prime focus I think of

00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179
should be the prime focus I think of
 

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:21.139
should be the prime focus I think of
analysis this is not to say corruption

00:18:21.139 --> 00:18:21.149
analysis this is not to say corruption

is not important but when thinking about

are made to everybody and the way he
 

00:18:58.169 --> 00:18:59.840
are made to everybody and the way he
described it was that it was almost

00:18:59.840 --> 00:18:59.850

etcetera so like a fee schedule and you
 

00:19:07.499 --> 00:19:09.440

just had to know what it was

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.450
just had to know what it was

just had to know what it was
that's why you need intermediaries who

00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:11.249
that's why you need intermediaries who
 

00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:14.810
that's why you need intermediaries who
know that the rules and then he made

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820
know that the rules and then he made
 

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.430
know that the rules and then he made
sure that happened and that's the way

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440
sure that happened and that's the way
 

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.879

government say we have to do something
about this and most countries find it

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:50.399
about this and most countries find it
 

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:52.609
about this and most countries find it
attractive to make it easier for small

the formal rules elsewhere can be

the formal rules elsewhere can be
circumvented so it's not obvious that

circumvented so it's not obvious that

to the rules to see whether what are the

dodging ously generate actually and look

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:39.390
dodging ously generate actually and look
 

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:45.440
dodging ously generate actually and look
at that as the primary issue and then

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.450
at that as the primary issue and then
 

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:52.549
at that as the primary issue and then
when we want to go further and look a

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559
when we want to go further and look a
 

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:57.410
when we want to go further and look a
little bit at can we put more structure

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:57.420
little bit at can we put more structure
 

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.060
little bit at can we put more structure
to this question I mean it must be the

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.070
to this question I mean it must be the
 

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.710
to this question I mean it must be the
type of corruption that matters not the

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720
type of corruption that matters not the
 

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.090
type of corruption that matters not the
amounts and it's the type of rules etc

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.100
amounts and it's the type of rules etc
 

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:09.620
amounts and it's the type of rules etc
then it's probably argue it is useful to

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:09.630
then it's probably argue it is useful to
 

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.120
then it's probably argue it is useful to
actually look at it from the point of

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.130
actually look at it from the point of
 

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.910
actually look at it from the point of
view of somebody who wants to be corrupt

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:12.920
view of somebody who wants to be corrupt
 

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.350

so they reconstructed the bridge were
paid etc but a lot of enforcement uses

that explains in a lot of cases why

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840
that explains in a lot of cases why

that explains in a lot of cases why
things do not work and a last point in

things do not work and a last point in
 

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.710
things do not work and a last point in
about about enforcement just to make

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720
about about enforcement just to make
 

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.450
about about enforcement just to make
that case in enforcing if you run your

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:01.460
that case in enforcing if you run your
 

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.720
that case in enforcing if you run your
corruption record

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:02.730
corruption record
 

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.600

way of enforcing loyalty is to have some
 

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.200
way of enforcing loyalty is to have some
dirt on members of your racket and so

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.210
dirt on members of your racket and so
 

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.330
dirt on members of your racket and so
you want to have them exposed through

being part to a corrupt transaction and
 

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.960
being part to a corrupt transaction and
then it is when you have that when you

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:23.970
then it is when you have that when you
 

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.990
then it is when you have that when you
control the information and to some

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000
control the information and to some
 

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.790
control the information and to some
extent the police that can try to mess

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:28.800
extent the police that can try to mess
 

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.860
extent the police that can try to mess
with information then it's actually very

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:30.870
with information then it's actually very
 

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.140
with information then it's actually very
useful in to run a corruption record to

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.150
useful in to run a corruption record to
 

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:38.090

and one of the measures that seems to be
 

00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:42.769

success and so if you just give export

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380
success and so if you just give export
 

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.430
success and so if you just give export
targets these can be measured actually

targets these can be measured actually
 

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.620
targets these can be measured actually
quite well and exports have the

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:54.630
quite well and exports have the
 

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.870

we asked a bunch of questions on

corruption and over time I've just
 

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.020

gotten away from them because I'm just

it just becomes much more difficult to

using the firm level surveys we really
 

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.830
using the firm level surveys we really
have to be careful about this type of

have to be careful about this type of
 

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.040
have to be careful about this type of

actually talk about corruption things
 

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.700
actually talk about corruption things
might look a lot better than they than

they are in in in reality you know and
 

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.560
they are in in in reality you know and
also the thing about corruption is that

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:00.570
also the thing about corruption is that
 

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:05.950
also the thing about corruption is that

people not only have a lot of incentives
they also have a lot of ability to

they also have a lot of ability to
 

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:17.260
they also have a lot of ability to
manipulate perceptions about corruption

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:17.270
manipulate perceptions about corruption
 

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.790

corrupt behavior and nothing not nothing
 

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:08.000
corrupt behavior and nothing not nothing
can can happen to me so I've done

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.010
can can happen to me so I've done
 

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.180
can can happen to me so I've done
interviews with people where you know I

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:10.190
interviews with people where you know I
 

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.440
interviews with people where you know I
you just don't really know what you're

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:12.450
you just don't really know what you're
 

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.030
you just don't really know what you're
getting whether they're boasting about

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040
getting whether they're boasting about
 

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.770
getting whether they're boasting about
what they can get away with when they're

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780
what they can get away with when they're
 

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.320
what they can get away with when they're
talking to you and inflating the

talking to you and inflating the
 

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.750
talking to you and inflating the
the level of corruption when actually is

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760
the level of corruption when actually is
 

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.070
the level of corruption when actually is
much lower than what they're saying

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:24.080
much lower than what they're saying
 

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.190
much lower than what they're saying
versus people who are saying oh I've

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200
versus people who are saying oh I've
 

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.380
versus people who are saying oh I've
never paid a bribe in my life here

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:29.390
never paid a bribe in my life here
 

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.550

likely scenario also so these types of

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:38.300
likely scenario also so these types of
 

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.550

cross national comparisons are

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:39.560
cross national comparisons are
 

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.800
cross national comparisons are
especially problematic because people

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:41.810
especially problematic because people
 

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:42.820
especially problematic because people
have different notions about what

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:42.830
have different notions about what
 

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.070
have different notions about what
corruption is so not only is there a

corruption is so not only is there a
 

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.690
corruption is so not only is there a
problem in trying to get people to

problem in trying to get people to
 

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.790

very much are are much aggravated when
we talk about corruption right so when

we talk about corruption right so when
 

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.350
we talk about corruption right so when
we ask somebody out how frequently does

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:20.360

bribes well what could be frequently in

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:23.900
bribes well what could be frequently in
 

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.070
bribes well what could be frequently in
one country could be infrequently in

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:27.080
one country could be infrequently in
 

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.330
one country could be infrequently in
another country although the actual

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:28.340
another country although the actual
 

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:31.780
another country although the actual
number might be actually the same so

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:31.790
number might be actually the same so
 

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:33.340
number might be actually the same so
also we're not always sure whether we're

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:33.350
also we're not always sure whether we're
 

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.290
also we're not always sure whether we're
capturing trends or whether we're

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:35.300
capturing trends or whether we're
 

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.120
capturing trends or whether we're
capturing levels you know people could

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.130
capturing levels you know people could
 

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:40.120
capturing levels you know people could
say Oh corruption is really bad because

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:40.130
say Oh corruption is really bad because
 

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.560
say Oh corruption is really bad because
we're starting from a very low base and

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:41.570
we're starting from a very low base and
 

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:42.540
we're starting from a very low base and
I had to pay a bribe

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:42.550
I had to pay a bribe
 

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.750
I had to pay a bribe
so it's really bad here or it could be

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760
so it's really bad here or it could be
 

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.990
so it's really bad here or it could be
that you're actually capturing the the

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000
that you're actually capturing the the
 

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.130
that you're actually capturing the the
actual level of corruption which could

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:51.140
actual level of corruption which could
 

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.410
actual level of corruption which could
be very low we say oh I only paid a

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:53.420
be very low we say oh I only paid a
 

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.820
be very low we say oh I only paid a
bribe last month

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:54.830
bribe last month
 

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.670

you know so not really so bad one of

you know so not really so bad one of

there's been a lot of progress though I

00:53:59.050 --> 00:53:59.060
there's been a lot of progress though I
 

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.410
there's been a lot of progress though I
think in terms of trying to think more

there's some studies been olkin and some

there's some studies been olkin and some
of his colleagues have came up with a

of his colleagues have came up with a

of his colleagues have came up with a
very ingenious way of measuring

although it's very difficult to
 

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.380
although it's very difficult to
generalize about this as they studied

generalize about this as they studied
 

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.870
generalize about this as they studied
road building in Indonesia and they were

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880
road building in Indonesia and they were
 

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.540
road building in Indonesia and they were
able to drill core samples of the roads

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:22.550
able to drill core samples of the roads
 

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.530
able to drill core samples of the roads
and then match those up with the

and then match those up with the
 

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.390
and then match those up with the
reported expenses that the companies

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400
reported expenses that the companies
 

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.640
reported expenses that the companies
used to build the roads and they could

used to build the roads and they could
 

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:33.940
used to build the roads and they could
show the degree to which companies were

do is look at the differences in the

police so it's not everybody 20 percent
 

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.609

reported that they had paid a bribe and

reported that they had paid a bribe and
 

00:57:45.619 --> 00:57:48.099
reported that they had paid a bribe and
this is I think much closer to the truth

00:57:48.099 --> 00:57:48.109
this is I think much closer to the truth
 

00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:50.349
this is I think much closer to the truth
than the surveys that just asked people

00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359
than the surveys that just asked people

so those this might be a somewhat a

so those this might be a somewhat a
 

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:06.370
so those this might be a somewhat a
better way on effects of corruption I

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:06.380
better way on effects of corruption I
 

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:09.039
better way on effects of corruption I
agree that that we can it's very easy to

agree that that we can it's very easy to

overestimate the economic impacts of
 

00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:14.020
overestimate the economic impacts of
corruption there probably a lot smaller

corruption there's some nice papers that

corruption there's some nice papers that
demonstrate this also responses to

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:27.950
demonstrate this also responses to
 

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:31.079
demonstrate this also responses to
corruption can also be costly right so I

00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:31.089
corruption can also be costly right so I
 

00:58:31.089 --> 00:58:33.670
corruption can also be costly right so I

procurement process which takes up three
 

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.289
procurement process which takes up three
months is incredibly burdensome and you

00:58:47.289 --> 00:58:47.299
months is incredibly burdensome and you
 

00:58:47.299 --> 00:58:48.940
months is incredibly burdensome and you
know eats up huge amounts of man-hours

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:48.950
know eats up huge amounts of man-hours
 

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:54.250
know eats up huge amounts of man-hours
and probably you know on average it is

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:54.260
and probably you know on average it is
 

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.109
and probably you know on average it is
reducing corruption in some way because

00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119
reducing corruption in some way because
 

00:58:56.119 --> 00:58:58.390

for us the honest people trying to go

for us the honest people trying to go
through this process is horrible so the

through this process is horrible so the
 

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.050
through this process is horrible so the
worst thing is just trying to be an

worst thing is just trying to be an
 

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.330
worst thing is just trying to be an
honest person in a situation where the

engage in corruption a couple other
 

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:31.330
engage in corruption a couple other
points now it may be true that there are

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:31.340
points now it may be true that there are
 

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.150
points now it may be true that there are
no billionaire autocrats right but

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160
no billionaire autocrats right but
 

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.530
no billionaire autocrats right but
there's also probably no poor middle

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:35.540
there's also probably no poor middle
 

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.920
there's also probably no poor middle
class autocrats either so they tend to

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:38.930
class autocrats either so they tend to
 

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.830

work is great and one question we want

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:01.460
work is great and one question we want
 

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.670
work is great and one question we want
to ask right is if mafias were more

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680
to ask right is if mafias were more
 

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.140
to ask right is if mafias were more
efficient than States than we would see

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:05.150
efficient than States than we would see
 

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:08.230
efficient than States than we would see
States out competing mafias and mafias

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240
States out competing mafias and mafias
 

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.310
States out competing mafias and mafias
would be running the world rather than

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:09.320
would be running the world rather than
 

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.500
would be running the world rather than
States right so one of the points that

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:11.510

first of all do they really want you to

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:04.060
first of all do they really want you to
 

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.120
first of all do they really want you to
do your job but secondly how do you

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.130
do your job but secondly how do you
 

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.770
do your job but secondly how do you
really do your job because the point is

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:07.780
really do your job because the point is
 

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.830
really do your job because the point is
to get you know as much money back to

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:10.840
to get you know as much money back to
 

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.300
to get you know as much money back to
them as you can but maybe they're able

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:12.310
them as you can but maybe they're able
 

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:14.340
them as you can but maybe they're able
to get more money back not because

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:14.350
to get more money back not because
 

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:15.810
to get more money back not because
you've helped the company become more

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:15.820
you've helped the company become more
 

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.280
you've helped the company become more
transparent but because they can help

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:17.290
transparent but because they can help
 

01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.630
transparent but because they can help
get it another other way so I think it's

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640
get it another other way so I think it's
 

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.910
get it another other way so I think it's
it's a very complicated question that

01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920
it's a very complicated question that
 

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.320
it's a very complicated question that
you know we can't resolve you know

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:22.330
you know we can't resolve you know
 

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.480
you know we can't resolve you know
tonight but I think that you know if I

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:24.490
tonight but I think that you know if I
 

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:25.950
tonight but I think that you know if I
were asked by the World Bank to sort of

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960
were asked by the World Bank to sort of
 

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.010
were asked by the World Bank to sort of

could be very interesting and very

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400
could be very interesting and very
 

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.300
could be very interesting and very
important to try to think that through

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:32.310
important to try to think that through
 

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.770
important to try to think that through
very carefully and another sort of

01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:34.780
very carefully and another sort of
 

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.510
very carefully and another sort of
wrinkle to that is that you you can

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520
wrinkle to that is that you you can
 

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.810
wrinkle to that is that you you can
really only do it with local people you

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:39.820
really only do it with local people you
 

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.570
really only do it with local people you
can't parachute in you know people like

can't parachute in you know people like
 

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.340
can't parachute in you know people like
me you can't parachute in foreigners

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:44.350
me you can't parachute in foreigners
 

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.380

because we will never really understand

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:46.390
because we will never really understand
 

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:48.150
because we will never really understand
how that system works and if people

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160
how that system works and if people
 

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.860
how that system works and if people
don't want it to work include

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:49.870
don't want it to work include

know the so-called owner who's getting
 

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:00.480
know the so-called owner who's getting
money out of that business it's

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:00.490

what I think is sort of interesting is

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:22.330
what I think is sort of interesting is
 

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:23.970
what I think is sort of interesting is
that you know no matter I'm not trying

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:23.980
that you know no matter I'm not trying
 

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.230
that you know no matter I'm not trying
to say that I don't think this is work

01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:25.240
to say that I don't think this is work
 

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.610
to say that I don't think this is work
is obviously it has but I think it's

01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:26.620
is obviously it has but I think it's
 

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.260
is obviously it has but I think it's
something interesting to look at what I

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:28.270
something interesting to look at what I
 

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.210
something interesting to look at what I
also find interesting though is that you

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:30.220
also find interesting though is that you
 

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.470
also find interesting though is that you
know there are a lot of state-owned

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480
know there are a lot of state-owned
 

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.960
know there are a lot of state-owned
companies and elite owned companies and

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:33.970
companies and elite owned companies and
 

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.300
companies and elite owned companies and
countries that have you know very bad

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:36.310
countries that have you know very bad
 

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:39.180
countries that have you know very bad
corruption ratings yet you also see a

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:39.190
corruption ratings yet you also see a
 

01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:41.130
corruption ratings yet you also see a
great deal of foreign interest in

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:41.140
great deal of foreign interest in
 

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.020
great deal of foreign interest in
investing in these companies and I'll

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:43.030
investing in these companies and I'll
 

01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:44.160
investing in these companies and I'll
get back to this point but I think

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:44.170
get back to this point but I think
 

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:46.470
get back to this point but I think
there's a pretty interesting disconnect

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480
there's a pretty interesting disconnect
 

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.270
there's a pretty interesting disconnect
between what we say is important to us

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:48.280
between what we say is important to us
 

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.310
between what we say is important to us
and we say corruptions not having you

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:50.320
and we say corruptions not having you
 

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.260
and we say corruptions not having you
know transparency and non corruption is

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:52.270
know transparency and non corruption is
 

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:54.000
know transparency and non corruption is
important to us we say that good

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.010

corporate governance is important to us
 

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:58.740
corporate governance is important to us
but if you look at how big investment

01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:58.750
but if you look at how big investment
 

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.510
but if you look at how big investment
banks invest and where your mutual fund

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520
banks invest and where your mutual fund
 

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.540
banks invest and where your mutual fund
and pension is going it's sort of

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:03.550
and pension is going it's sort of

parallel observation I wanted to make

01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:08.740
parallel observation I wanted to make
 

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.390
parallel observation I wanted to make
has to do with my experience with

01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400
has to do with my experience with
 

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.800
has to do with my experience with
related party lending and the reason I

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:13.810
related party lending and the reason I
 

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.540
related party lending and the reason I
think it's sort of parallel is if you

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:15.550
think it's sort of parallel is if you
 

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:18.000
think it's sort of parallel is if you
think of corruption as sort of a coping

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.010
think of corruption as sort of a coping
 

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:21.210
think of corruption as sort of a coping
mechanism in a dysfunctional economy as

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:21.220
mechanism in a dysfunctional economy as
 

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.490
mechanism in a dysfunctional economy as
a society I've come to think of related

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:23.500
a society I've come to think of related
 

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.830
a society I've come to think of related
party lending also as a coping mechanism

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:25.840
party lending also as a coping mechanism
 

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.530
party lending also as a coping mechanism
so related party lending is just you

in a bank so if I were say you know but
whether you know it's important when

owner the president so if for example I
 

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.330
owner the president so if for example I
owned 75% of a bank and the bank made

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:45.340

loans to companies that I also loan
 

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.060
loans to companies that I also loan

down we don't have that conversation we

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.230
down we don't have that conversation we
 

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:34.710
down we don't have that conversation we
put limits on it and then what happens

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:34.720
put limits on it and then what happens
 

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.990
put limits on it and then what happens
is that you know the one or two banks

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000
is that you know the one or two banks
 

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.900
is that you know the one or two banks
that actually observe the limits they're

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:39.910
that actually observe the limits they're
 

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:42.090
that actually observe the limits they're
disadvantaged because they can't grow as

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:42.100
disadvantaged because they can't grow as
 

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.010

quickly as their competitors and the
 

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.600
quickly as their competitors and the
only thing that happens is that the

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:45.610
only thing that happens is that the
 

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.250
only thing that happens is that the
bankers because their rules don't make

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:47.260
bankers because their rules don't make
 

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.490
bankers because their rules don't make
sense to them come up with ways to

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500
sense to them come up with ways to
 

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.780
sense to them come up with ways to
conceal their related party loans so

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:51.790
conceal their related party loans so
 

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.030
conceal their related party loans so
what we actually end up doing is we're

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040
what we actually end up doing is we're
 

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.790
what we actually end up doing is we're
sort of inadvertently kind of fostering

non transparency and kind of potentially
 

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:02.880
non transparency and kind of potentially
corruption and I think that that what

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:02.890
corruption and I think that that what
 

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:06.320
corruption and I think that that what
underlies what I was trying to say about

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:06.330
underlies what I was trying to say about
 

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:09.660
underlies what I was trying to say about
corporate governance and this issue with

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:09.670
corporate governance and this issue with
 

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.460
corporate governance and this issue with
related party lending and there's other

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:11.470
related party lending and there's other
 

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.840
related party lending and there's other
examples I could bring but I'll just

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:12.850
examples I could bring but I'll just
 

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.030
examples I could bring but I'll just
stick with those for right now is that a

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040
stick with those for right now is that a
 

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.150
stick with those for right now is that a

01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:03.339
and local knowledge it's really just
done to de buttress the local elites and

01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:03.349
done to de buttress the local elites and
 

01:23:03.349 --> 01:23:05.439
done to de buttress the local elites and
to keep the market small but to keep

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:05.449
to keep the market small but to keep
 

01:23:05.449 --> 01:23:08.439
to keep the market small but to keep
their share of it relatively big so we

01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:08.449
their share of it relatively big so we
 

01:23:08.449 --> 01:23:11.200
their share of it relatively big so we
really need to come down a level level

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:11.210
really need to come down a level level
 

01:23:11.210 --> 01:23:14.350
really need to come down a level level
of abstraction and really look at you

01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360
of abstraction and really look at you
 

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.299
of abstraction and really look at you
know who's involved what are the stakes

01:23:16.299 --> 01:23:16.309
know who's involved what are the stakes
 

01:23:16.309 --> 01:23:18.339
know who's involved what are the stakes
you know what are the cost of getting

01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:18.349
you know what are the cost of getting
 

01:23:18.349 --> 01:23:20.470
you know what are the cost of getting
information about what's going on and

01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480
information about what's going on and
 

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.109
information about what's going on and
then we can start to say something about

01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:23.119
then we can start to say something about
 

01:23:23.119 --> 01:23:26.290
then we can start to say something about
how we change the situation but that's

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:26.300
how we change the situation but that's
 

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.899
how we change the situation but that's
really hard that's really hard to do and

01:23:28.899 --> 01:23:28.909
really hard that's really hard to do and
 

01:23:28.909 --> 01:23:31.509
really hard that's really hard to do and
for all the reasons Gael was pointing

01:23:31.509 --> 01:23:31.519
for all the reasons Gael was pointing
 

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:35.109
for all the reasons Gael was pointing
out it's even harder for people who are

01:23:35.109 --> 01:23:35.119
out it's even harder for people who are
 

01:23:35.119 --> 01:23:38.830
out it's even harder for people who are
kind of outside the system to do so

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840
kind of outside the system to do so
 

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.959
kind of outside the system to do so
so our greatest hope is elites who want

01:23:40.959 --> 01:23:40.969
so our greatest hope is elites who want
 

01:23:40.969 --> 01:23:44.520
so our greatest hope is elites who want
to enrich themselves improve the system

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:44.530
to enrich themselves improve the system
 

01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:47.439
to enrich themselves improve the system

economist I'm a competitiveness and for

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280
economist I'm a competitiveness and for
 

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.350

me I I'm just really struggling with the

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360
me I I'm just really struggling with the
 

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.759
me I I'm just really struggling with the
ways in which we talk about corruption

01:24:12.759 --> 01:24:12.769
ways in which we talk about corruption
 

01:24:12.769 --> 01:24:15.580
ways in which we talk about corruption
using this transactional definition that

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:15.590
using this transactional definition that
 

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:18.310
using this transactional definition that
transparency international uses and it

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320
transparency international uses and it
 

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.569
transparency international uses and it
just seems like politics is really

01:24:19.569 --> 01:24:19.579
just seems like politics is really
 

01:24:19.579 --> 01:24:22.120
just seems like politics is really
missing corruption equals bribes and if

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:22.130
missing corruption equals bribes and if
 

01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:24.790
missing corruption equals bribes and if
that's what corruption means why not

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800
that's what corruption means why not
 

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.979
that's what corruption means why not
just call it bribes embezzlement or

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:26.989
just call it bribes embezzlement or
 

01:24:26.989 --> 01:24:28.660
just call it bribes embezzlement or
whatever like what what does it add and

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:28.670
whatever like what what does it add and
 

01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:31.000
whatever like what what does it add and
then you know the focus is mostly about

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.010
then you know the focus is mostly about
 

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.890
then you know the focus is mostly about
inefficiency like that's the frame of

01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:32.900
inefficiency like that's the frame of
 

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.239
inefficiency like that's the frame of
our conversation today and that's just

01:24:34.239 --> 01:24:34.249
our conversation today and that's just
 

01:24:34.249 --> 01:24:37.049
our conversation today and that's just
not not the way that I see corruption

01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:37.059
not not the way that I see corruption
 

01:24:37.059 --> 01:24:39.160

you know and even in dr. Klein's

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:39.170
you know and even in dr. Klein's
 

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:41.529
you know and even in dr. Klein's
comments it's this question about you

01:24:41.529 --> 01:24:41.539
comments it's this question about you
 

01:24:41.539 --> 01:24:43.149
comments it's this question about you
know one of the things that you said was

01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159
know one of the things that you said was
 

01:24:43.159 --> 01:24:45.040
know one of the things that you said was
that the system of rules is what matters

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:45.050
that the system of rules is what matters
 

01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:47.049
that the system of rules is what matters
right if it's pretty simple then people

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:47.059
right if it's pretty simple then people
 

01:24:47.059 --> 01:24:49.509
right if it's pretty simple then people
kind of follow the rules so isn't it

01:24:49.509 --> 01:24:49.519
kind of follow the rules so isn't it
 

01:24:49.519 --> 01:24:50.919
kind of follow the rules so isn't it
really the rules that we should be

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:50.929
really the rules that we should be
 

01:24:50.929 --> 01:24:53.680
really the rules that we should be
talking about and then I'll end with

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:53.690
talking about and then I'll end with
 

01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:55.479
talking about and then I'll end with
I've been writing on Iceland you know

01:24:55.479 --> 01:24:55.489
I've been writing on Iceland you know
 

01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:57.459
I've been writing on Iceland you know
which is another you know small case it

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:57.469
which is another you know small case it
 

01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:59.169
which is another you know small case it
doesn't really matter very much it can't

01:24:59.169 --> 01:24:59.179
doesn't really matter very much it can't
 

01:24:59.179 --> 01:25:02.350
doesn't really matter very much it can't
be generalized but Iceland in 2004 five

01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360

years was number one on transparency and

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280
years was number one on transparency and
 

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.470
years was number one on transparency and
corruption perception index and I would

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480
corruption perception index and I would
 

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.000
corruption perception index and I would
argue that in fact Iceland was

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.010
argue that in fact Iceland was
 

01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.070
argue that in fact Iceland was
incredibly corrupt in which there was a

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080
incredibly corrupt in which there was a
 

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.439
incredibly corrupt in which there was a
small group of elite that had taken over

01:25:15.439 --> 01:25:15.449
small group of elite that had taken over
 

01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:17.180
small group of elite that had taken over
the political system and engaged an

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:17.190
the political system and engaged an
 

01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:20.390
the political system and engaged an
insider privatization and in essence

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400
insider privatization and in essence
 

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.220
insider privatization and in essence
captured the state and those things

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:22.230
captured the state and those things
 

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:23.810
captured the state and those things
inside her privatization in state

01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820
inside her privatization in state
 

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.300
inside her privatization in state
capture I think are corruption and I

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:26.310
capture I think are corruption and I
 

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:27.800
capture I think are corruption and I
think are actually more problematic

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:27.810
think are actually more problematic
 

01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:31.399
think are actually more problematic
corruption at least politically and and

01:25:31.399 --> 01:25:31.409
corruption at least politically and and
 

01:25:31.409 --> 01:25:34.459
corruption at least politically and and
and it was a pots and pans revolution

01:25:34.459 --> 01:25:34.469
and it was a pots and pans revolution
 

01:25:34.469 --> 01:25:36.560
and it was a pots and pans revolution
led by women that overthrew the

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:36.570
led by women that overthrew the
 

01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.120
led by women that overthrew the
government now I'm not sure that their

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.130
government now I'm not sure that their
 

01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.410
government now I'm not sure that their
system has can been completely

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420
system has can been completely
 

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.109
system has can been completely
eradicated of the corruption but it was

01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119
eradicated of the corruption but it was
 

01:25:42.119 --> 01:25:43.910
eradicated of the corruption but it was
a People's Revolution

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920
a People's Revolution
 

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.790
a People's Revolution
in that case that did so I would say

01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800
in that case that did so I would say
 

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.530
in that case that did so I would say
that both we need to think more about

01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540
that both we need to think more about
 

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.620
that both we need to think more about
the politics I mean what's the

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:51.630
the politics I mean what's the
 

01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:53.840
the politics I mean what's the
connection between patronage patrimonial

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:53.850
connection between patronage patrimonial
 

01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:56.120
connection between patronage patrimonial
ism clientelism and all these sort of

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:56.130
ism clientelism and all these sort of
 

01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:58.220
ism clientelism and all these sort of
broader political questions but also I

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:58.230
broader political questions but also I
 

01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:00.500
broader political questions but also I
think that there is a political question

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:00.510
think that there is a political question
 

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:02.570
think that there is a political question
about how we get rid of corruption as

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580
about how we get rid of corruption as
 

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.370
about how we get rid of corruption as
well that isn't just about Elysee but

01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380
well that isn't just about Elysee but
 

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.340
well that isn't just about Elysee but
there is a role I hope for people and

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:07.350
there is a role I hope for people and
 

01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:09.080
there is a role I hope for people and
engaging more transparently and it's not

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:09.090
engaging more transparently and it's not
 

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:12.379
engaging more transparently and it's not
by not paying bribes necessarily because

01:26:12.379 --> 01:26:12.389
by not paying bribes necessarily because
 

01:26:12.389 --> 01:26:14.330
by not paying bribes necessarily because
bribes just may be part of the system

01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340
bribes just may be part of the system
 

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:15.649
bribes just may be part of the system
but there are other ways of getting rid

01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659
but there are other ways of getting rid
 

01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:20.689
but there are other ways of getting rid
of corruption I would have thought there

01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699
of corruption I would have thought there
 

01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:22.700
of corruption I would have thought there
are always three dimensions to look at I

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:22.710
are always three dimensions to look at I
 

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:25.370
are always three dimensions to look at I
mean I don't know all the answers either

01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:25.380
mean I don't know all the answers either
 

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.800
mean I don't know all the answers either
but three dimensions to look at one

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:27.810
but three dimensions to look at one
 

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:30.500
but three dimensions to look at one
other other rule what is what is legal

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:30.510
other other rule what is what is legal
 

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:33.669
other other rule what is what is legal
what is legitimate and what is efficient

01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679
what is legitimate and what is efficient
 

01:26:33.679 --> 01:26:35.870
what is legitimate and what is efficient
so the economists talk a lot about

01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880
so the economists talk a lot about
 

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.800
so the economists talk a lot about
efficiency

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:36.810
efficiency
 

01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:39.350
efficiency
the lawyers talk a lot whether it's

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360
the lawyers talk a lot whether it's
 

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.510
the lawyers talk a lot whether it's
legal or not and much of what you said

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520
legal or not and much of what you said
 

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.149
legal or not and much of what you said
was really about legitimacy whether the

just to answer your question I think

01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280
just to answer your question I think

just to answer your question I think
that what it it sounds a little bit

01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460

the fact that in a democracy you feel
like you are part of the rules and

01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100
like you are part of the rules and
 

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.580
like you are part of the rules and
therefore you follow them in systems

01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:52.590
therefore you follow them in systems
 

01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:53.930
therefore you follow them in systems
where you don't feel like you're part of

01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940
where you don't feel like you're part of
 

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.610
where you don't feel like you're part of
the rules you know why would you bother

01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:55.620
the rules you know why would you bother
 

01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:58.100
