00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.990
The price per gallon. The price per gallon is measured in dollars over gallons.

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:09.980
And this makes perfect sense if we think about what quantities we're using to

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:14.640
calculate this slope on this graph. y here, stands for the total price of

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:19.709
solution, which is, of course, measured in dollars. And x here, stands for the

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:24.422
number of gallons of solution that Grant has bought, or is willing to buy. And

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:29.135
that's measured in gallons. We know that slope is equal to the change in y over

00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:33.379
the change in x, which is, just as we found here, dollars over gallons.
