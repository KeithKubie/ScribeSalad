00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.220
Design is the posh word for thinking a lot about how stuff looks

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.580
A designed object is one whose makers worked long and hard to get it just right

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.820
Most of the world has sadly not been well designed, it's full of office towers, door handles,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.340
bed, lamps, and plates, that have been deeply unloved

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.600
and were thrown together in a hurry by untalented people

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.940
When many people around the world lack the bare necessities, it can be tempting to say that good design

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.980
can't really matter that much

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.600
But we're arguing that it does, desperately so,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200
because of a weird quirk of our psychology

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.140
We feel like, and are in a sense, quite different people depending on what's in front of our eyes

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.320
A dark brooding sky brings out certain feelings, a bright blue one others

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.680
This kind of bedroom makes you feel one way, that one another

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.000
Design matters because our identities and moods are fluid and shifting

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.960
and it's often the quality of the designed environment

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.720
that determines whether we'll feel confident or defeated, at ease or guarded,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.180
generous spirited, or alienated

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.920
One of the great debates about how much design should matter took place in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.460
between the Catholics and the Protestants

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.260
Broadly speaking, the Protestants didn't believe in spending much money on design

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.880
They put up simple, functional churches, painted them plain white inside with minimal fuss and bother

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.740
Nowadays, many Protestant churches continue to look extraordinarily cheap and basic

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.100
The intellectual thought here is that what really matters is certain ideas

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.060
and these enter your mind through your understanding, not through your senses

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.040
You can get close to God by reading the Bible in a hayloft; you don't need a fancy building

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.380
But the Catholics beg to differ

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.400
They invested so heavily in design: in stunning stain glass windows, beautiful carved angels,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.180
and passionate renditions of the life of Christ

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.480
because they fervently believed that our environments do change who we are

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.740
We may be further or nearer God,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.260
depending on what's on the wall and how high the ceiling is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.740
Governments have always understood and respected the underlying idea that design changes us

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.580
Nazi designers like Albert Speer paid a huge amount of attention to making sure the design world

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.620
would speak of Nazi values like aggression and power

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.500
Just as modern German architects have tried to ensure that contemporary Berlin

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.820
will project an image of democracy, peace, and openness

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.520
We mold ourselves to the spirit that emanates from the objects around us,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.340
we become a little as they are

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.660
Even if we're not always able to say quite how objects make us feel,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.580
we all sense a spirit, better or worse, that emanates from a given set of objects

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.700
We're generally good at playing that game

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.840
where you try to imagine what sort of person the work of design would turn into

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.360
if it miraculously became human

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.660
When we call an object of design beautiful, what we're really saying

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.980
is that if it turned into a person it would be someone we liked,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.660
someone maybe dignified or self-possessed, intelligent or adventurous

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:11.080
Beauty is a promise of goodness and ugliness is evocative of nothing short of despair and evil

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.720
And that's why beautiful design matters

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.260
because it encourages our better sides, while ugly design stokes our worst ones

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.500
We need to make sure the world around us is well designed,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.260
not out of some superfluous expensive taste, but because good design helps us to be the best versions of ourselves
