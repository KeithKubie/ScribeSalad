00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.048
- [Voiceover] So, we're
told, consider the formula

00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:04.648
Y is equal to two-C over P,

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:08.084
where Y represents the carrot yield.

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:11.515
So, Y represents the carrot yield.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:16.530
C represents the number

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.980
of expected carrots,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.387
and P represents the number of plants.

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:25.463
So, P represents the number of plants.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:28.098
Select an appropriate measurement unit

00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:30.583
for carrot yield.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:34.563
So, the key here is to realize
that we can treat units

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:37.254
like we would treat algebraic variables.

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:40.168
And so, for example, over here,

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.327
if we're saying our yield is going to be

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:46.390
two times the number of expected carrots

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.886
divided by the number of plants,

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.090
well, our units are going to be...

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.911
Well actually we could put
some numbers in here actually

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:56.896
just to make something more interesting.

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:59.475
Let's just say that C is equal

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.905
to 10 carrots,

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.572
and I'm just making these numbers up.

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:06.009
Just, hopefully, it makes
sense what I'm about to do.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.595
And let's say that P is equal to,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:13.045
I don't know, 30 plants.

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:15.308
P is equal to 30 plants.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:18.628
And so using this formula, Y,

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:21.944
Y would be equal to

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:26.435
two times 10 carrots,

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.345
two times

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:33.107
10 carrots,

00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:37.577
divided by P,

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.677
which for this case is 30 plants.

00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:43.677
30 plants.

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.387
And so two times 10 carrots,

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.663
that's going to be 20 carrots.

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:50.611
So we can write the numerator
as, this is 20 carrots,

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.585
divided by 30 plants,

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:54.849
and so that is going to be equal to...

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.532
You could divide the numbers.

00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:59.991
So, it would be 20 divided
by 30, which would be 2/3,

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.991
2/3, and then the units
would be carrots per plant.

00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:09.000
2/3 carrots per plant.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.559
Carrots per plant.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.579
Carrots per plant.

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.786
And once again, the whole point

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.143
of what I just did is just to
see what the units would be

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:22.907
for our carrot yield.

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:26.578
And we can see the units
would be carrots per plant.

00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:28.039
And I put the numbers
there just so hopefully

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.649
it makes a little bit intuitive
sense of what we just did.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.854
As we algebraically manipulate

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.082
or mathematically manipulate the numbers,

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:39.601
we do the same thing with the units.

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:40.812
And so, when we try

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:43.364
to find the appropriate
measure unit for carrot yield,

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:46.074
which I had never heard
of before this video,

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:49.676
we see it's carrots per plant is

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.825
the appropriate measurement unit,

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.078
not carrots per plant-squared.

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:55.564
That would have been the
case if we were squaring

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:57.038
this P, over here,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:00.056
or plants times the
square root of carrots.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.879
Well that would be more if we
were taking the square root

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.446
up here and we weren't dividing by P,

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:05.280
but we were multiplying by P.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.217
But the general theme that you
could see is this constant,

00:03:08.217 --> 00:03:11.154
this two, didn't affect
what happens to the units.

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:13.883
But what did matter is
how these variables relate

00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:14.463
to each other.

00:03:14.463 --> 00:03:17.040
We're taking the variable,
C, dividing it by P.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.200
So, whatever the units were for C,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.545
we divide those units by the units for P

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.599
and we get the units for yield,

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.651
carrots per plant.
