00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.638
Since we've been adding and subtracting functions so much, this time why don't

00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:07.971
we multiply. I'd like us to keep using the same functions we've been working

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:12.230
with, p and q. Instead of jumping right into graphing though, why don't we

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.340
start by filling out a table. For each value of x I've listed here, please tell

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.110
me the value of each of these functions. We have p of x in this column, q of x

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.806
in this column, and pq of x in this column. Remember that for every value of x,

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:32.689
the value of this function is just the product of p and q.
