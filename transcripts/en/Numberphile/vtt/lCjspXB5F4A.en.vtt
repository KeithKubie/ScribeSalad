00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.580
We're talking about the maths of crime

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.880
Crime?  Yeah! For people who don't know, you're a proper mathematician.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.580
And we're really getting into your research.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.080
Yup. We're gonna... In fact, even look at a paper that I've even done with one of my PhD students.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200
So yes, I am a real person.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.940
This is your area of expertise?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.940
Ahh... yeah.  Ahh... yeah.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.940
One of the things....

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.740
That's important to know about crime... or terrorism... things like that...

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.020
is when it's going to happen.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
There's a bit of old maths

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.580
that kind of helps us start off understanding that.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.760
and that's something call the Poisson Distribution,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
named after a guy called Poisson.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.760
Nothing to do with fish? :-)

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.440
I don't think so, although some of my students call it the Fish Distribution, which is... *giggles*

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.700
But the main point about the Poisson Distribution

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.640
...umm...its first practical application was looking in the Prussian army

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.160
There were lots of soldiers who were dying from being kicked by horses

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.440
over a number of years.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.100
By their own horses?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.180
By their own horses, yeah.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.620
Horses objecting to being used as an army horse, perhaps.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.720
And so... there was one guy called Bortkewitsch

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.220
in 1898 who was tasked with looking into

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.600
how frequently these horse attacks were happening... these horse kick attacks were happening

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520
Horse attacks?  They sound more dramatic all the time! Ok...

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960
I know it does, and I'm sorry, and it is actually quite a serious thing.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.520
The point is... is that

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.160
I like to think anyway... horse kicks are...

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.400
generally independent, right, horses don't sort of... "collude" with each other

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.280
and decide that they're going to kick up a ruckus on a particular day.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.180
So if you look at a timeline of incidents then

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.780
you would sort of expect your incidents, your horse kick incidents to be

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.340
kind of randomly distributed across this thing

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.360
So maybe you'd have a couple very quickly after each other

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360
But what that means you can do is

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.000
if you take a time interval, so a set number of years perhaps

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.420
and you look at the chances of a particular number of incidents in that interval

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.500
then it follows this really nice neat distribution

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.520
which looks like this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.000
and this is called... this is your probability

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and this is your number of incidents

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and this is your Poisson Distribution

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.060
so that means that there's an average number of incidents that you expect in a year, say

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.920
and that average number of incidents is the most likely thing to occur

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.500
and has the highest probability of all

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.240
so it might mean that, you know, in 1890

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.960
you only have, you know, one incident perhaps

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.440
and then in 1891 you have a huge number of incidents

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.980
but also very low probability

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.600
But... that most years you're going to expect to have

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.140
something around the average rate of incidents

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.860
It means that you can start looking at the time between different events

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.040
and you can start coming up with sort of  a susceptibility for events

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.080
But there's one really crucial thing that this stuff is missing

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.620
that the Poisson Distribution is missing

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.080
which is that events, and crime, and terror attacks

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.600
and things like that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.680
they're not completely independent, so...

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.260
if one happens, the chances of another one happening very soon after

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.460
really increase, and the Poisson Distribution can't take that into account.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.640
So the first people to look at events that weren't completely independent

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.280
were scientists who were studying earthquakes

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.620
Now you could say that perhaps earthquakes were random

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.040
were completely random and Poisson distributed

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.060
so each earthquake was independent of every other

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.800
But the thing is, is that if you have one earthquake you're going to be really likely to have aftershocks

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.140
Right, so a series of earthquakes

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.100
in the same place, in quick succession of one another

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.500
[Announcer] continual aftershock are keeping everyone nervous

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.900
Scientists, and mathematicians developed something called "Hawkes Process"

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.400
which I think might be named after Hawkes actually

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.580
So they came up with something called the Hawkes Process

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.440
which takes into account the fact that events aren't completely independent of one another

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.660
So instead if you were looking at an earthquake

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.680
you'd expect to have something much more like this

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.820
One earthquake happened and then you'd expect a few more smaller earthquakes to happen

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.580
within a really short space of time

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.260
and then perhaps you'd go a little while

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900
you'd have one with no aftershocks

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.340
and then another, but with another few, uhh, sort of, aftershocks tagged on quite quickly afterwards

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.520
I mean things kind of take a bit more of this pattern

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520
But the thing that is nice is that

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.520
uh... well, "nice" probably isn't the right word, uh...

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.620
But... is that crime follows this same pattern.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.620
So if you take burglaries for example,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.320
anybody who's been burgled will know that your chances of being burgled again

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.320
within a really short space of time hugely increases.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.800
This is something called "repeat victimization".

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.040
And the reason is, is that burglars get to know the layout of your house

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.020
they get to know, um, where you keep your valuables.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.440
They get to know all sorts of things about your local area.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.900
So your chance of being burgled again increases.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.520
But so does your neighbours', and your neighbours' neighbours', and neighbours' neighbours' neighbours' neighbours' and so on

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.880
as you go along down the street.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
This Hawkes Process then, of seeing events as connected

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.720
in time, means that you can then model

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.300
what happens with burglary statistically.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.820
It goes beyond just sort of saying "Oh well, you know, obviously that happens"

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.780
because you're actually able to describe it and capture it

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.160
using numbers and using equations

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And as soon as you can do that, then

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.400
you can start actually implementing genuine strategies back into the real world.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.920
So, for example, this is a paper that I wrote with one of my PhD students

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.560
and this looks at, um, a very similar story

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.800
about attacks from the IRA in Northern Ireland

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.640
and you can see here, this is... the events as they go along

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.300
This is really similar to this graph here.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.740
So you'll have one big event and then you'll have sort of a cluster of events afterwards.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.160
And then a gap for a little while and then another cluster of events going through.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.760
But what this means knowing that there's this model that sits behind the scenes

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.480
is that you can actually assign numbers.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.840
There's a proper equation for this.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.060
So you have your kind of background rate, so this is...

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.140
I don't know what that first symbol is!

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.140
Oh, it's lambda, Greek lambda.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.340
Umm.. and that's a "mu"... another Greek letter

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.660
So this one here... this... you're going to be talking about your "intensity" of attacks.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.840
How likely it is for an event to occur

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.600
within a short space of time.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.060
So you have some sort of a background rate, so this is like your randomness,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.720
cuz there is still some element of complete randomness in this...

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.020
But then, every time an event happens, you have a little "kick".

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.880
So your chances of another event get a little "boost".

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.060
And that's what this thing here does.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.240
But then finally, this "boost" it doesn't last for very long,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.240
so it looks like this...

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.340
So your little "kick", your chance of another event happening

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.380
boosts up and then dies away quite quickly in time.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.680
You're effectively... you're summing over all of the incidents that have happened in the past,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.080
and you're working out your "kick" from every possible incident .

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.000
When a house gets burgled, or a bombing happens,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
or anything like that...

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.160
numbers are being fed into equations that tell us what?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.940
Yeah, well, so they tell us, they tell us... they capture...

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.920
sort of the process that's going on behind the scenes.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.960
But they do it in a way that's sort of free from emotion,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.620
and free from "hand-wavy-ness".

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.240
So if you apply this to something like the Troubles in Northern Ireland

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.240
and the frequency of IRA incidents

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.080
there were 5 actual different phases of attacks

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.280
and you can see here with this equation

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.820
the different values of these different parameters at different points throughout the process.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.740
So you've got mu there, k-nought (the "boost") there,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.780
and omega, which is how quickly things died away back down to normal.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.040
And what's really interesting about this, is that

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.340
this allows you to come up with a comparison between different processes,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.680
or different stages in a conflict and actually to quantify it.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.440
Hannah, is this all hindsight, or does this give, like, predictive powers?

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.200
Or is this just something you apply afterwards, like "oh, yeah, I can see..."

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.440
Well, so this example is all retrospective,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.940
but what I think is really exciting about these ideas is that you can also apply them in real time.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.200
So with burglary in particular,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.120
umm... if you're just looking at how the past influences the present

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120
and will influence the future

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.180
which this allows you to do, by talking about intensity

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.720
and susceptibility of burglaries

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.880
what that means is that in real time you can pick up

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.840
on a particular area, or even a particular street

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.700
that is more likely to be the centre of our burglary hotspot going forward in time

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.740
by using these methods.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.220
So there's a company in America called PredPol who were the first

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.220
to take these equations

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.000
and wrap it up neatly into sort of an iPad app, effectively.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.480
So that they can give it to different police forces across the U.S.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.460
and the police forces will then get a printout

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.740
on basically a map with like a red square, saying

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:56.040
here is where is where is most likely to be victims of burglarly or car theft tonight

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.600
So just by looking at these, just these really simple equations

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.780
putting in the numbers of the system

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.600
and reacting to what the maths tells you

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.700
they've reduced burglarly by up to 32% in certain areas of the States.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.080
It's like a pre-crime, this is like "Minority Report".

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.200
Yeah, yeah, "predictive policing" that's what they call it. Yeah.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.560
Thanks to audible.com for supporting today's episode

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.640
Audible has thousands and thousands of titles in stock

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640
and they're bound to have something that you'll enjoy

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.440
and among them, is "The Mathematics of Love", by Hannah Fry -- who you've just been watching.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.480
Now I've got Hannah's book.  Here's my "dead tree" version.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.860
But I think an audio book's even better

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.860
because you can enjoy it on the go,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.860
such as like in your car, or walking the dog

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.540
or more importantly, you can hear it read by Hannah herself.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.880
[Hannah] Have you ever wondered why we're all so obsessed with how "hot" a person is?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.680
It's always really interesting to hear an audio book read by the author, his or herself,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.460
and I know Hannah spent a lot of time in a studio doing it,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.380
so I'm sure she'd appreciate it as well.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.480
If you'd like to give Audible a try, and I recommend it.  I use it all the time.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.780
Go to audible.com/numberphile

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.780
that way they know you came from here

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.360
and when you're there, you can then join for a 30-day free trial,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.280
and, why not make Hannah's "The Mathematics of Love" your first download?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.720
So, as the authority's get smarter,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.320
and the police get smarter and start using mathematics

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.760
so, you know.... fight crime,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.960
could criminals start using mathematics to plan crime?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.460
...chuckles...

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.760
Well...

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.720
I hope not.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.720
...ummm....

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.840
I hope not.
