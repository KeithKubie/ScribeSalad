there's not anything particularly bad

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840
there's not anything particularly bad
 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.260
there's not anything particularly bad
about all these sugars that are added

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270
about all these sugars that are added
 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.389
about all these sugars that are added
it's that we're getting too much of it

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
it's that we're getting too much of it
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.389
it's that we're getting too much of it
so it's really that it's in more foods

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399
so it's really that it's in more foods
 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.260
so it's really that it's in more foods
than we expected or then we can handle

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270
than we expected or then we can handle
 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.540
than we expected or then we can handle
and were individually people are

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550
and were individually people are
 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.610
and were individually people are
choosing to drink or eat too much of

things to have sugar in them sugar is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
things to have sugar in them sugar is
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.000
things to have sugar in them sugar is
probably just fine for our bodies in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010
probably just fine for our bodies in
 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.920
probably just fine for our bodies in
small amounts which is why the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930
small amounts which is why the
 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.020
small amounts which is why the
recommendations are not that we get zero

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030
recommendations are not that we get zero
 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.840

sugar there's nothing evil about sugar
but getting too much sugar is hard on

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
but getting too much sugar is hard on
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.020
but getting too much sugar is hard on
our bodies and it contributes to you

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030

possibly weight gain and a lot of things

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
possibly weight gain and a lot of things
 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.999
possibly weight gain and a lot of things
that we wouldn't want so it's more the

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009
that we wouldn't want so it's more the
 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.459
that we wouldn't want so it's more the
volume that we get than anything

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469
volume that we get than anything
 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.940
volume that we get than anything
particularly special about sugar one of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950
particularly special about sugar one of
 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.010

them and i recommend water and milk so
 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.300
them and i recommend water and milk so
about three glasses of milk per day is

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
about three glasses of milk per day is
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.730
about three glasses of milk per day is
typical for a child who likes milk and

typical for a child who likes milk and
 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.639
typical for a child who likes milk and
can handle milk and then water really is

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649
can handle milk and then water really is
 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.769

probably don't get enough not enough
water in our society and so I think

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869
water in our society and so I think
 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.379
water in our society and so I think
learning to drink plain water is

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389
learning to drink plain water is
 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.239
learning to drink plain water is
probably a good lifelong habit and

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249
probably a good lifelong habit and
 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.669

the transition if a child is used to
very sweetened drinks that transition

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
very sweetened drinks that transition
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.620
very sweetened drinks that transition
can be difficult and so there are so

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
can be difficult and so there are so
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.889
can be difficult and so there are so
some tips some ways to do that might be

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899
some tips some ways to do that might be
 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.199
some tips some ways to do that might be
to gradually decrease the amount of

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
to gradually decrease the amount of
 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.850
to gradually decrease the amount of
sweetness and drink so start watering

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
sweetness and drink so start watering
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.600
sweetness and drink so start watering
things down use water for most of the

things down use water for most of the
 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.270
things down use water for most of the
day but then have a special like this
