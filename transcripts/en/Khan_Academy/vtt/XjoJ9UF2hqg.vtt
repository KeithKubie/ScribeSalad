00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.280
Welcome back.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.860
Well, in the last presentation,
we described a

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.200
situation where you had
a bunch of borrowers.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.160
They needed $1 billion
collectively, because there's

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.760
1000 of them and they each
needed $1 million

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.810
to buy their house.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.790
And they borrowed the money
essentially from a special

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.530
purpose entity.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.580
They borrowed it from their
local mortgage broker, who

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250
then sold it to a bank, or to
an investment bank, who

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.770
created the special purpose
entity, and then they IPO the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.840
special purpose entity and raise
the money from people

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.700
who bought the mortgage-backed
securities.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.580
But essentially what happened
is the investors in the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.940
mortgage-backed securities
provided the money to the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.160
special purpose entity to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.830
essentially loan to the borrowers.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.120
And then the reason why we call
it a security is because,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.040
not only are these people
getting this 10% a year, but

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.030
if they want to -- let's say
that you had one of these

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.220
mortgage-backed securities and
you paid $1000 for it.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.700
And you're getting this 10%
a year, but then all of a

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.390
sudden, you think that the whole
mortgage industry is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.950
about to collapse, a bunch of
people are going to default,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.380
and you want out.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.860
If you just gave someone
a loan, there'd be

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.720
no way to get out.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.570
You'd have to sell that
loan to someone else.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.380
But if you have a
mortgage-backed security, you

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.070
can actually trade the security
with someone else.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.980
And they might pay you, who
knows, they might pay more

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.780
than $1000.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.460
They might pay you less.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880
But there will be at least some
type of a market in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240
security, so you could have what
you could call liquidity.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.960
Liquidity just means that
I have the security

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.740
and I can sell it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.340
I could trade it just like I
could trade a share of IBM or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600
I could trade a share
of Microsoft.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800
But like we said before, this
security, in order to place a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.020
value on it, you have to do some
type of analysis of what

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.240
you think it's worth.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.180
Or what you think the real
interest will be after you

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.520
take into account people
pre-paying their mortgage,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.340
people defaulting on their
mortgage, and other things

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.770
like short-term interest rates,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280
And there is only maybe a small
group of people who are

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.870
sophisticated enough to be able
to figure that out to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.470
make some type of models and
who knows if even they're

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.720
sophisticated enough.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.440
There might be a whole other
class of investors

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.340
here, say this guy.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.800
He would love to kind of invest
in insecurities, but he

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800
thinks this is too risky.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.940
He'd be willing to take a lower
return as long as he was

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.979
allowed to invest in less
risky investments.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.530
Maybe by law, maybe he's a
pension fund or he's some type

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.140
of a mutual fund, that's forced
to invest in something

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.860
of a certain grade.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.230
And say that there's another
investor here, and he thinks

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.180
that this is boring.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.350
You know, 9%, 10%.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.160
Who cares about that?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.370
He wants to see bigger
and bigger returns.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.750
So there's no way for him to
invest in this security and to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.810
get better returns.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.510
So now we're going to take this
mortgage-backed security

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.650
and introduce one step further
kind of permutation or

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.910
derivative of what this is.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.930
That's all derivatives are.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.730
You've probably heard the term
derivatives and people do a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.320
lot of hand-waving saying, oh,
it's a more complicated form

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.030
of security.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.770
All derivative means is you take
one type of asset and you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.120
slice and dice it in a way to
spread the risk, or whatever.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.950
And so you create a
derivative asset.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.450
It's derived from the
original asset.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.000
So let's see how we could use
this same asset pool, the same

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.810
pool of loans, and satisfy
all of these people.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.630
Satisfy this guy, who wants
maybe a lower return but lower

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.680
risk, and this guy, who's
willing to take a little bit

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.410
higher risk in exchange
for higher return.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.060
So now in this situation, we
have the same borrowers.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.390
They borrowed $1 billion
collectively, right, because

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.310
there's 1000 of them, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.410
And they're still a special
purpose entity, but now,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.780
instead of just slicing up the
special purpose entity a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.680
million ways, what we're going
to do is we're going to split

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.810
it up first into three, what
we could call, tranches.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.190
A tranche is just a bucket,
if you will, of the asset.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.370
And we're going to call the
three tranches: equity,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.140
mezzanine, and senior.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.710
These are the words
that are commonly

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.350
used in this industry.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.010
A senior just means, if this
entity were to lose money,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.810
these people get their money
back first. So it's the least

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.220
risk out of all of
the tranches.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.900
Mezzanine, that just means
the next level or middle.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.890
And these guys are some
place in between.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.850
They have a little bit more
risk, and they still get a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.300
little bit more reward than
senior, but they have less

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.700
risk than this equity tranche.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.350
Equity tranche.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.060
These are the people who
first lose money.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.040
Let's say some of these
borrowers start defaulting.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.190
It all comes out of the
equity tranche.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.770
So that's what protects the
senior tranche and the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.770
mezzanine tranche
from defaults.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.580
So in this situation what we did
is we raised -- out of the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.690
$1 billion we needed -- $400
million from the senior

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.990
tranche, $300 million from the
mezzanine tranche, and then

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.810
$300 million from the
equity tranche.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.730
The $400 million senior tranche
we raised from soon.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.880
1000 senior securities,
collateralized debt

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.380
obligations.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.815
These are these, right here.

00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:02.870
Say there were 400,000 of these
and these each cost

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.990
$1000, right?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.030
Let's say these cost $1000.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.690
And we issued 400,000
of these.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.780
So we raised $400 million.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.890
Let's say we give these
guys a 6% return.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.100
And you might say, 6%,
that's not much.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.920
But these guys, it is pretty low
risk, because in order for

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.910
them to not get their 6%, the
value of this $1 billion asset

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.700
or these $1 billion loans, would
have to go down below

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.460
$400 million.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.440
Maybe I'll do a little bit more
math in another example.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.370
But I think it'll start
making sense to you.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.900
For example, every year we said
there's going to be $100

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.930
million in payments, right?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.170
Because it's 10%.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.800
$100 million in payments.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.850
Of that $100 million in
payments, 6% on the $400

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.770
million, that's $24 million
in payments.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.550
Right?

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.950
So $24 million in payments will
go to the senior tranche.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.150
Similarly we issued 300,000
shares at $1000 per share on

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.200
the mezzanine tranche.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.060
This is also 1000.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.030
This is the mezzanine tranche.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.660
And let's say they get 7%,
a slightly higher return.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.320
And these percentages are
usually determined by some

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.100
type of market or what people
are willing to get.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.700
But let's just say it's
fixed for now.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.350
Let's say it's 7%.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.950
So 300,000 shares, seven 7%.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.290
These guys are going
to get $21 million.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.170
Right?

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.080
So out of the $100 million every
year, $24 million is

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.570
going to go to these guys, $21
million is going to go to

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.370
these guys, and then whatever's
left over is going

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.110
to go to the equity tranche.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.960
So the $300 million from equity,
they're going to get

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.820
$55 million assuming that
there are no defaults or

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.400
pre-payments or anything shady
happens with the securities.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.860
But these guys are going
to get $55 million.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.090
Or on $300 million, that's
a 16.5% return.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.170
And I know what you're
thinking.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.880
Boy, Sal, that sounds amazing.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.280
Why wouldn't everyone want
to be an equity investor?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.590
I don't know.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.170
My pen has stopped working.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.900
But anyway, I'll try to move
on without my pen.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.890
So you're saying, why wouldn't
everyone want to

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.570
be an equity investor?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.400
Well, let me ask
you a question.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.850
What happens if -- let's go to
that scenario where we talked

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.020
before -- 20% of the borrowers
just say, you know what?

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.780
I can't pay this mortgage
anymore.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.326
I'm going to hand you back
the keys to these houses.

00:07:24.326 --> 00:07:27.760
And of that 20%, you only
get a 50% return.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.550
So for each of those $1 million
houses, you're only

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.060
able to sell it for $500,000.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.240
So then instead of getting $100
million per year, you're

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.080
only going to get $90
million per year.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.340
I wish I could use my pen.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.540
Something about my computer
has frozen.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.960
So instead of $100 million a
year, you're now only going to

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.980
get $90 million a year.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.530
Right?

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.480
And all of a sudden,
these guys are not

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.460
going to be cut off.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.230
This guy is still going to get
$24 million, this guy is still

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.320
going to get $21 million, but
now this guy is going to get

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.070
$45 million.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.675
But he's still getting
above average yield.

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:05.830
Now let's say it gets
even worse.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.430
Let's say a bunch of
borrowers start

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.720
defaulting on their loans.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.010
And instead of getting $90
million per year, you start

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.880
only getting $50 million
in per year.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.940
Now you pay this guy
$24 million.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.570
You pay this guy $21 million
-- or this group of guys or

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.970
gals -- $21 million.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.510
And then all you have left is
$5 million for this guy.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.260
And $5 million on $300 million,
now he's getting less

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.840
than a 2% return.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.419
So this guy took on higher
risk for higher reward.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.900
If everyone pays, sure,
he gets 16.5%.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.820
But then if you start having a
lot of defaults, if, let's

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.090
say, the return on what you get
every month goes in half,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.470
this guy takes the entire hit.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.130
So his return goes to 0%.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.030
So he had higher risk,
higher reward, while

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.450
these guys get untouched.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.130
Of course, if enough people
start defaulting, even these

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.440
people start to get hurt.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.250
So this is a form of a
collateralized debt

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.000
obligation.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.870
This is actually a
mortgage-backed collateralized

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.560
debt obligation.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.100
You can actually do this type
of a structure with any type

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.580
of debt obligation that's
backed by assets.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.260
So we did the situation with
mortgages, but you could do it

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.110
with a bunch of assets.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.250
You could do it with
corporate debt.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.450
You could do it with receivables
from a company.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.880
But what you read about the
most right now in the

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.910
newspapers is mortgage-backed
collateralized debt

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.490
obligations.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.820
And to some degree, that's
what's been getting a lot of

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.890
these hedge funds in trouble.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.230
And I think I'll do another
presentation on exactly how

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.370
and why they have gotten
in trouble.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.760
Look forward to talking to you
