00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.100
SPEAKER: If you're a
mobile app publisher,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.516
you probably already
know that you

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.485
can earn revenue by showing
AdMob ads to your users.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:14.760
But what you might not
know is that you can also

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.730
use AdMob to show your
ads to your users,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.130
and that's done with
AdMob Campaigns.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.170
A campaign is a
run of ads that you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.870
create and configure to get
a portion of your total ad

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.980
traffic.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
You determine the goals and
how many impressions to serve,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.500
which ad units are targeted,
and-- the best part--

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.840
design your own creatives
in a bunch of formats,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.520
including video.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.690
So what are your goals?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.610
Got a new app that you'd like
to promote and the ones you've

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.570
already launched?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.820
Campaign for it.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.380
Want to drive traffic from
your apps to your website?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.030
Campaign for that.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.980
Meet a sneaker tycoon
who loves your app

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.470
and wants to pay you directly
to advertise his dope,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.880
remastered lows?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.460
Make a campaign for it--
and then send me a pair.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.210
I'm a size 12.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
