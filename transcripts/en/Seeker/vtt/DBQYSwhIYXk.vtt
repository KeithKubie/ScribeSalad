00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.490
Having a “gut feeling” isn’t just folklore,
you’re literally feeling things from your

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.950
gut, and also other organs.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.510
Yup, it’s pretty nifty!

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.790
Hey everyone!

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.510
Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.960
And I’ve got a feeling you’re going to
like this episode, and odds are my gut is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.980
right on that.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.939
So let’s start with the gut part of the
whole gut feeling thing.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.310
It’s kinda gross to think about, but our
bodies are teeming with bacteria - this is

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.599
the microbiome you’ve probably heard about.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.780
Most of those bacteria live in the gastrointestinal
tract, what we colloquially refer to as the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.780
gut.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.640
These bacteria regulate digestion and metabolism,
extract vitamins and nutrients from food,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.780
and program the body’s immune system.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.710
But there’s so much more going on!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.530
This complex bacterial ecosystem has prompted
the gut to evolve a complex neural network

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.789
called the enteric nervous system,3 which
is so ridiculously sophisticated it’s sometimes

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.789
called the second brain.4 This network of
over 100 million neurons can even function

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.770
when it loses connection to the brain!34

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.910
And the gut-brain connection goes both ways.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.200
Gut bacteria produce neurochemicals that regulate
basic physiological and mental processes,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.720
influencing things like memory and mood.4And
the brain affects the microbiome; psychological

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.590
stress can suppress certain helpful bacteria
making you more likely to get sick.3

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.590
This two-way communication is part of a larger
network of inter-body talk.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.830
The brain connecting to the gut through neural
networks, and also your ability to recognize

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.090
this connection, is an example of something
called interoception.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.610
This is a sense of self-identity beyond knowing
what self-help books call “the real you.”

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.970
It’s the sensing of physiological signals
that originate within the body and carry information

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
to the brain: things like body temperature,
breathlessness, and heart rate that ultimately

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
give you an indication of states like hunger,
thirst, pain, and anxiety.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.050
Whether we’re consciously aware that our
body is sending these signals, they happen,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.640
particularly when we’re making risky decisions.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.540
They send information to the brain and affect
the way we make decisions, so what you think

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.460
of as a “gut feeling” is actually you
responding to those subtle cues.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.720
A recent study from the University of Cambridge
took interoception into the real world and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.950
looked at its role in successful financial
trading, a career notorious for acting on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.950
“gut instincts.”

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.980
The researchers measured 18 male traders’
abilities to detect subtle changes in their

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.950
physiological state by a heartbeat detection
test: how well they could count their own

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.420
resting heart rate without using a pulse point.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
Admittedly this is a small sample size, but
these 18 men were better able to count their

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.740
heart rate than non-traders, and within the
group those with a higher score were also

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.920
better traders who survived longer in the
financial world, earning more money than their

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.890
less body-aware peers.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.720
So in this case, interoceptive ability does
correlate to good decisions in a risky environment.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.870
But correlation isn’t causation.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.810
Just because you can pretty accurately measure
your heart rate doesn’t mean you will make

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.080
millions trading.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.840
Other interoceptive studies have found people’s
ability to detect their heart rate increases

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.090
during times of stress, so the correlation
from traders could just be an awareness honed

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.460
from years in the industry.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.440
But it’s also the case that professionals
practised in a field can manage their stress

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.390
better, so traders might not be experiencing
the stress reaction of an increased heart

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.390
rate.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.440
Or it could be something totally different.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.460
Maybe successful traders with money use their
downtime to work out, which could help develop

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.350
keener sense of body awareness.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.630
In any case, the results do show a link between
better body awareness to interoceptive cues

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.790
and good decisions in risky environments.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.490
So maybe there’s something to be said for
trusting your gut.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.670
And speaking of guts, our guts do a lot more
for us than we think.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.830

can actually program our gut bacteria to fight

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660
harmful infections.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.550

gut?
