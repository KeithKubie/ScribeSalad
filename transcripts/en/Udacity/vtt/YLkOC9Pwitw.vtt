00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.260
The first is column drop.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.620
Column drop is probably the easiest.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.700
At its narrowest viewport,
each element simply stacks vertically,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.550
one on top of the other.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.740
As things get wider,
the elements expand,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.570
until the first break point is hit.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.140
At the first break point, instead
of having all the elements stacked,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.020
two elements are now side by side.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.910
And the third element is underneath.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.490
The elements keep expanding as the
viewport gets wider until the next break

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.010
point is hit.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.280
And then,
things reflow to a three-column layout.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.760
Generally, once the viewport hits a
maximum width, the columns hit a maximum

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.410
size, and instead of getting wider,
margins are added to the left and right.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.200
So how do we code this?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.610
Let's start with the smallest viewport.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.080
We have our three divs,
inside of a container div.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.090
The container is a flex container,
with flex-wrap, wrap.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.470
Next, I've set the width of
all of the divs to 100% to

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.610
give me that stacked layout.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.209
Because this is just a sample,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:10.190
I'll pick a totally random
break point at 450 pixels.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.520
I want that dark blue div to be
25% of the viewport width, and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.950
the light blue div to be 75%.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.940
And I want to keep the green
at the full width.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.930
I'm going to add a new media query that
checks if min width is greater than or

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.510
equal to 450 pixels, and then change
the width of dark blue to 25 and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.334
light blue to 75%.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.234
I'll add a third break point at 550
pixels and make the dark blue div 25%,

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:45.250
the light blue div 50%, and
the green div to be 25%.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.950
To get that to happen, I'll add
a new media query that tests for

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.130
screen, and min-width 550 pixels.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.620
Inside that media query,
I'll set the width for

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.085
dark blue and green to 25% and
light blue to 50%.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:04.460
Let's try it in the browser.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.470
We're all stacked at 400 pixels.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.680
At 450, our layout changes,
and again at 550 pixels.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.700
Perfect.
