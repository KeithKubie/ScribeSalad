00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We have this wonderful relationship.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When a ball rolls down a hill, the distance it rolls,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I tried to mark off equal distances here--excuse my terrible drawing--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but the distance the ball rolls is somehow proportional to the square of the time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I say proportional to and not equals because remember we don't know the units

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of time or distance, in fact.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Time was measured by allowing water to flow and then weighing the resulting water.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
One distance unit was just defined as the distance a ball rolled in one time unit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay, so we have this relationship. What can we do with it?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, it reminds me a little bit of what we saw from Aristotle earlier in the unit.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Aristotle thought that all objects fell at constant velocity

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and that that velocity was proportional to the mass.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The way we use this relationship was to set up ratios.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we have two objects, 1 and 2, with masses 1 and 2, and some velocities

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that we're assuming are proportional to that mass,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we can set up this equation.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If we happen to know three of these quantities--maybe two masses and one velocity--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we can figure out the unknown quantity.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay, not so bad. But what does this square do? How does that change the calculation?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Well, initially this setup looks just the same as before.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The only difference is now we have to square this side--pretty straightforward.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's practice. We have two identical balls, which we'll number 1 and 2.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I let this first ball fall for 2 seconds, and it falls a distance of 20 m.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If I let this ball fall for 7 seconds, how many meters will it fall?

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can use this equation and enter your answer here.
