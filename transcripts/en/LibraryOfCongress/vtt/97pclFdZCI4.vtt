00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.890
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.940
Good afternoon everyone and
thank you all for coming here.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.450
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle East Division

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.750
and I would like to welcome you
to this very special program.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.580
I always begin with a few
statements about our division

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.360
and our division is made
up of three sections.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.900 position:56%
The African section, the [inaudible]
section and the Neri section.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.420
And between the three
section we cover 78 countries.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.110
Most - well all of Africa, North
African, sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.510 position:56%
the whole Middle East and that
expands to Afghanistan, central Asia

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.380
and the Caucasus and the
Hebraic world worldwide.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.850
So we collect from and
about this large region.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:40.630
We collect via our offices in
Cairo, in Nairobi, in Islamabad,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.300
and the materials come
directly from those officers.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.960
They catalog there, they come to
us and then we put them in our -

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.990
on our decks and we serve them to
patrons here in our reading room.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.630
But we don't only do that.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.300
We don't only serve those books,
we don't only acquire them.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.670
We always do programs around
them and we do programs

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.720
about the region, about
our 78 countries.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.380
We feel that these materials
are alive and need to connect

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.310
with people and we do so directly.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.980
Some of our experts come up here
and talk about their collections

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.380
and in other cases we invite
people to come and talk

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.830
about the work they had done,
the books they have used,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.320 position:56%
the research that they're interested
in doing, and the materials

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.490
that they using in
different formats.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.840
We also have conferences
and we have exhibits

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.930
and we have smaller
displays around the library

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.530
and all our programs
are public and are free.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.170
And so we are always delighted
to bring people to the library.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.370 position:56%
We also webcast our programs so that
they can be seen around the world

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.960
and a lot of people watch them.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.030
And they click on our websites
and watch the programs.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.490
So I want to speak about
the African section today,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.750
because the African section
is hosting this program

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.740
and in particular Ed Ferguson,
who has invited our guests today.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.930
And the African section
has a wonderful collection

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:49.190
in many languages spread around
the library, so the materials

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.780
that we hold on Africa are
extensive and they're multilingual.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.190
And they're also beautifully
illustrated in there.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.000
We have them not only
in this division,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.130
but in the rare book
division, in the low library,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.490
in the general collection,
Hispanic division.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.860
These materials are there
for people to consult.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.190
Also our own African specialists
are scholars in their own fields.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.950
They give lectures, they
publish, they do research,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.870
and they are very active
participants

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.090
in various professional
organizations.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.700
And today Eve has invited -
oh, and I also want to point

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.410
out a very special series that we
have, which is the conversations

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.580
with African poets and writers.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.460
And this is something that
we started four years ago.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.670
We get award-winning
poets and writers to come

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.530
and discuss the work here.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.950
And recently we had [inaudible].

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.380
She's the 2015 game prizewinner
for African fiction in English.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.640
We've had Chino Achebe, Eddie
Matsui, the poet laureate

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.190
of South Africa, Carrio
Petsi, Keiko Sutso [phonic].

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.580
We've had Amu Daconi [inaudible]
from the CÃ´te d'Ivoire.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.290
We had Egone Barret
[phonic] from Nigeria.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.030
We had Omi Congo Dbanga [phonic]

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.470
from the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.320
We had DeJean Cella
[phonic] a Gandhian poet.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.570
So we being also to this series
writers who are up-and-coming

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.360
as well as established writers and
we do that with the Africa Society

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.970
for the National Summit on Africa

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.030
and with the poetry
center here at the library.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.480
So I invite you all to
attend our programs.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:01.730 position:56%
And now our special program is going
to be introduced by Eve Ferguson,

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.790
the reference librarian
here in the African section.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.990
So Eve.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.970
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and
I want to thank you all

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.740
for coming to this program today.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.420
I just wanted to mention first

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.020
of all how Erin and
I became acquainted.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.910
Many, many years ago we had planned
to do a collaborative exhibit

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.680
on African independence
with materials

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.060
from the Library of Congress.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.950
That was so long ago I don't
even remember what year it was.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:38.280
Maybe 2010 and since then
Erin and I have kept in touch,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.840 position:56%
may be sporadically, but I have kept

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.690
up with the wonderful
work that she's done.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.200
Erin is a fantastic photographer.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.140
Obviously a great curator of this
exhibit that we'll hear about

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.300
and she is also in a published
author of photography in Africa,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.530 position:56%
which covers the whole continent of
Africa in the history of photography

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.070 position:56%
on the continent, which is a valiant
effort, to say the very least.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.330
And she is currently working on a
book on Priya Rom Rocka [phonic],

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.060
the Kenyan photojournalist
who met a very early demise

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.040
and last year I saw
a great film on it

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.520 position:56%
and I'm looking forward to her book.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.470
So Erin Haney is a graduate
of SOAS, University of London.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.230
She's a curator, writer, and
a scholar and she partners

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.400
with a number of international
research collaborations,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.930
including the pioneering workshop,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.560
three PA in Porto Novo
Benin as part of resolution.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.100
And if anybody got the flyer
it has the website on there

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.860
as well as on the screen.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.770
She's written extensively
on the photography, art,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.970
and politics of Africa and maybe
beyond, because I heard something

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:03.840
about writing about burkas, so I'll
let her explain that to you more.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.560
Erin is research associate in
the faculty of art, design,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.110
and architecture at the University
of Johannesburg in South Africa

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.740
and at the Smithsonian
Institution in right down the hill.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.730
She's presently working on
that book on Priya Rom Rocka

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.790
and I hope she'll tell us more.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.980
And I am looking forward to this
talk on sailors and daughters,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.380
early photography in the Indian
Ocean, because one of my goals here

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.240
as reference librarian for
East Africa is to shed light

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.340
on the little-known
region of the Indian Ocean.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.850
And so I've tried to
do a number of programs

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.680
that address the Indian Ocean.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.490
A lot of people don't know
what the countries are.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.010
Places like [inaudible]
Reunion, Seychelles, [inaudible],

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:58.190
and of course the Swahili
coast of Tanzania.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:06.420
So on May 19th kind of biting
off of a Erin's program here,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.870
I decided that I would also like
to showcase some of the photographs

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.260
that we have at the Library of
Congress from the same region.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.140
And so she called her Sailors
and Daughters and I decided

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.070
to call mine sultans and farmers,
because that is where we have a lot

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.240
of photographs of from that region.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.530
So please look out for
that program on May 19th,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.690
and as not to take any more time
away from what we all came to hear,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.880
I want to introduce my friend

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.680
and the fantastic photographer
and author, Erin Haney.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.480
Thank you.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.020
[ Applause ]

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
Eve and Mary Jane.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.150
Thank you all for coming.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.490
I prepared a bit of an informal
talk and I can sort of circle back

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:59.310
to some of the earlier projects
as questions come up about it.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.880
But I was really happy
with the launch

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.940
of Sailors and Daughters last year.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.890
I need to start by
thanking a few people

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.210
and organizations that
made that possible.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.720
Nicole Schivers at The
National Museum of African Art

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.310
at the Smithsonian commissioned
the online exhibition,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.360
which was the first one
done with African art.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.280
And so it has of course a massive
outreach in a way that we can sort

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.410
of see and see feedback from and
really see the comments and sort

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.090
of approaches and things that
really interest people in a way

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.810
that is very difficult to quantify
and sort of discuss and feel

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.230
when you're in a gallery setting.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.620 position:56%
So I quite liked being part of that.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.800
I worked on it with my research
associate and assistant,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.070 position:56%
Savieh Cohubla [phonic], who is from
the DRC and he did a lot of research

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.930
on this exhibition and brought
his own sort of knowledge to bear

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.430
in really important
ways I think on this.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:01.410 position:56%
We worked with Jean Wilcox of
Wilcox Designing in Cambridge, Mass.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.790 position:56%
and Doug Green of Green Interactive.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.720
We had a lot of help
from Janet Stanley

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.400
at the Warrens Warner
Robins Library.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.880
Amy Staples at the Elliot
Elisofen Photographic Archive,

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.270
which in both of those
collections were really central

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.010
to this exhibition.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.730
Lots of people, including David
Hoag at the Sackler Freer Archives

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.790
and David Easterbrook who has
just left or recently left

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.580
and is the fantastic curator at
the Northwestern Africana library

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.910
and whose images as you'll see are
really instrumental and fundamental

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.520 position:56%
to this, even though they are really
undocumented and it's sort of,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.790 position:56%
you know, we put this forward really
to sort of launch further interest

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.050
in scholarship because it's
really quite an unresearched

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.820
and a new area.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.750
The field of early 20th
century photography

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.090
and this is a great opportunity
to sort of move into that -

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.490
into that realm a little bit.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.680
So what I want to do
I'll just briefly go

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.640
to the website so that you can see.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.460
It's hard to navigate, so I'm
going to sort of go back and -

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.670
it's not hard to navigate, but
it's hard to navigate for a talk.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.870
So what I'd like to do is just sort
of briefly show you the main page

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.780
of it, the front page and then what
I'll be doing is going through bits

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:27.060
and sections just a few images
from each of these sections here.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.470
And I'm also going to
really fold into it a bit

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.610
of responses that I've received.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.090
I teach at Maryland and I teach at
GW and really to have the feedback

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.860 position:56%
from younger generations and
younger audiences and trying to see,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.130
you know, what was really
interesting to them about it

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.570
and what dialogues that sparked
was really important to me.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.240
So I'll try and bring that in.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.400
Sailors and Daughters first
began with the concern

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.820
to feature this early
photography from East Africa coming

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.920
from the archive and from the
library collections at the museum.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.140
And from there it grew
very, very quickly.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.750
We realized, you know, the
possibilities were much bigger

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.720
than what was there
at the Smithsonian,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.190
even with Sackler Freer, and
on the other hand, you know,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.800
while we have very little
documentation of this area so far,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.790
there was so much material that
signaled a really colonial point

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.610
of view and we really
wanted to disturb

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.280
and upset those kinds
of image fictions.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.970 position:56%
And so the challenge became how to
do this for photographic collections

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.600
that predominantly featured
commercial and touristic kinds

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.030
of imagery, so this map
really kind of, you know,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.510
gives us a large perspective of
when we are starting to think

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.090
about things not in
terms of territoriality,

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.830
but in terms of connections and
the Indian Ocean as connecting all

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.130
of these different points of view.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.310
And probably viewed by the cultural
exchange, the artistic exchange,

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.890
and the exchange of people,
ideas, and technologies

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.560
through the Indian Ocean.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.390
Not over the two centuries, you
know, in which this work comes

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.520
from that really over the
millennia answered of trying

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.630
to draw attention to
that sort of thing.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.750
When we were learning about
their early photographers

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.160
who were working in this region.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.550
You know, we wanted to find out -

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.100
what we found out resonates
very much with what happens

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.700
in other parts of the world.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.520
And that is that early
photography in East Africa

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.030
and a larger Indian Ocean
are resolutely the products

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.840
and imperatives of
movement and migration.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.360
And it was the mobility of
photographers and the wider realm

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.540
of their audiences that situates
these photographic modernities,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.040
really from the 1870's on.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.410
So these photographs are the
creative collaborations I would

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.940 position:56%
argue between photographers, between
their subjects, their patrons

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.790 position:56%
and us and, you know, future viewers
to come to sort of global audiences

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.440
that we see happening now.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.740
And as such they really fold

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.940
in across a vast photographic
and cultural space.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.030
Sailors and Daughters evoke that
fundamental premise of movement

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:10.110
of ideas and people and so
we will see a lot of that.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.640
These, you know, this area
in particular of West India

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.110
through Muscotc[phonic] the
Gulf Coast and through the horn

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.470
of Africa, East Africa up
through to Cairo and down as far

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.440
as the Indian Ocean Islands
Mozambique and really centering.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.160
We'll start with Zanzibar.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.610
Zanzibar doesn't look
like this today.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.080
I don't know how many
of you know that,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.860
but we have this big golf there.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.490
It was kind of a lagoon.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.600
What we wanted to do
by starting with a map

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.460
of Zanzibar town before
it started to really shift

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.480
and become very different with
British colonization and the sort

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.200
of changing of the urban
landscape is to think

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.400
about photographers exploring that
land and the very different divides

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.470
that sort of characterized
Zanzibar city at the time.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.560 position:56%
So on the left here in this sort of
triangle part we can see Stone Town.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.300
You know, the part that when you
Google [laughs] Zanzibar you get

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.910
this sort of, you know, nostalgic
images for the UNESCO site.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.070
You know, the beautiful stone
buildings and we see bits

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.720
of them here in this exhibition.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.340
And then on the other side

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.200
of the lagoon called the Quami
Jogo [phonic] is what was known

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.650
as Ingambo [phonic], which
is called the other side.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.650
And the other side was the
place where slaves lived

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.580 position:56%
where people lived who were the
laborers who made the labor possible

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.930
and made, you know, and
basically were the source of labor

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.510
and the source of revenue for
the people who lived in those -

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:51.480
in that very dense city, in the
very wealthy city of Stone Town.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.470
So just trying to sort of alert
us to this sort of neighborhoods

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.690
as they were mapped and tracked
there before everything changed.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.020
So we see - hold on.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.970
So we see here Bitell Hakoom
[phonic] part of the palace complex

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.380
of the Sultan of Zanzibar.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:18.050 position:56%
So the sultans, especially in
1870's, he was a massive modernizer.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.000
He commissioned lots and
lots of architecture,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.430
a huge new palace complex.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.480
And, you know, was really known
for trying to bring Zanzibar into,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.840
you know, the very, very modern
era and he was really proud of all

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.950
of the commissions that he had.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.730
Here's one of the early - these
are a couple of different guys, HH,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.680
his highness Sultan Sayed
Survagosh Dinsyed [phonic].

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.950
This is around 1880 and we can see,
you know, again people traveling.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.620
This is a great portrait
I'm taken in London

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.870 position:56%
and then a bit later closer to 1902.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.660
The Sultan Sayed [inaudible]
Mohammed Bin Sayed

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.890
and this is around 1902.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.410
So we see lots of images
like this throughout.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:10.160
And I'm trying to give a sense
of the urban infrastructure

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.760
that may be really surprising for
people who haven't seen, you know,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.320
that East Coast urban build up
and the extraordinary wealth

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.640
of that mercantile
economy that existed there.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.690
And then the people who were, you
know, who made it all possible.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.910 position:56%
And the people who were the laborers
and, you know after the abolition

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.160
of slavery in the 1890's
were the people

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.610
who manage the clove plantations
and had been brought not only

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.260
from the East African mainland,
but also from, you know,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.360
as far north as Ethiopia.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.380
People had come from India, of
course, with the great migrations

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.060
that had come from Western India.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.630
People were really coming
from all over the place.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.450
Tippu Tip, how many
people know who he is?

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.750
The great slave trader, Tippu Tip
and, you know, his house is there

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.310
and we can see that
mapped in Zanzibar.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:10.640
He was, you know, responsible for
so much of the migration of people

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.410
as commodities really across to the
Indian Ocean and through the Gulf.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.040
And then on the other side of
Umgumbo [phonic] we see people who,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.590
you know, the infrastructure
and the layout of the land

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.950
and how people are living
is of course quite different

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:31.720 position:56%
and it's very, very rare to actually
see images like this of, you know,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.310
people living and sort of
going about their daily lives

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:39.420
when they weren't working in,
you know, out on the plantations.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.650
So we see, you know,
people like AC Gomez.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.370
A lot of the photographers
who started in Zanzibar

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.050
and founded the first photo studios
were not only exploring Stone Town,

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.760
but they were going to
Umgumbo, going to the other side

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.670
and really exploring the
whole countryside and it's

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:03.020
through their photographs that
we have a sense of what Zanzibar

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.350
in the area look like,
really from the 1870's.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:11.550
You know, we have that happen in
Zanzibar, in Mombasa, in Aiden,

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.520
you know, all over the place
and there remains much more work

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.650
to be done on those photographers.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.030
So we're trying to piece
together really there

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.270
and it's very, very tricky.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.690
And again with the problem that
we see with a lot of histories,

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.600
creative histories in Africa
is where are the archives?

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.500
Where are the repositories
of these photographs?

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.990
And so this is the trick, right.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:46.940
We'll move on to [inaudible] who
was an explorer who is moving

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.160
through the North African coast
and down the Swahili coast in the,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.100
you know to sort of
map out strategic ports

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.790
in French holdings along the
Indian Ocean in the 1840's.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.960
So right at the start
of the, you know,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.740
the sort of birth of photography.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.110 position:56%
And as he moved, you know, he had
his ships and he had a daguerreotype

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:10.180
and a camera and so what he
managed to do was not only working

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.680
with an artist who
is sketching things,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.030
he had a photographer
who was taking pictures.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.670
And we'll go into that
a little bit more,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.650 position:56%
but what we see here are really some
of the very first daguerreotypes

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.570
that were made in East Africa
and they were bound in this book

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.600
that he made this Voyage
[foreign language].

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.340 position:56%
The book is actually about this big.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.640
It's huge.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.890
It's down there at the
Library of Congress or sorry,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.380
down at the Warner Robins
Library down at the Smithsonian.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.050
It's about this tall, sort
of this wide and this long,

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.980
so the technological difficulty
of trying to make the scans

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.190
and then trying to figure out
a way to make that accessible

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.100
and disseminated on a website that
people could look at on their phone

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.610
in Nairobi was really,
really a trick.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.820
And so we tried to manage it.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.920
There's a huge amount
of information there.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.890
I mean I really strongly
encourage everybody

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.420
to sort of flip through these.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.590
We have a selection
of those images there.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.900
You know it was really a priority
for us to be able to disseminate

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.740
that and these images
are very compelling to me

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.950
because they reveal the diversity
of people who were coming

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.770
from central Africa and
East Africa and then living

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.420
on those coastal cities,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.770
such as [inaudible]
Mogadishu, Zanzibar and Mombasa.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.610
So we see them in the cities
that they were living in and some

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.960
of the prominent traders,
which of course were the people

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.670
that Geelem [phonic]
was coming in contact

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.750
with because that was his mission.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.380
You know, along the coast of
East Africa and further afield.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.380
What we see with this
one is Swahili family

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.010
and of course we can see
these are lithographs based

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.310
on the daguerreotypes
that are there.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.730
These are not of course the
original daguerreotypes.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.060
We haven't found those yet.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.410
I'm not sure that they exist.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.700 position:56%
It's often the case that they don't.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.520
The rules of - you know,
the other thing that I

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.600
like about these portraits, their
complexity they really force us

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.240
to look hard, especially when
we deal with Geelem's text,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.070
which is which is also
there in these huge volumes

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.670
and which has been written about
my colleague a little bit Zavia

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.810
Korvubla [phonic], which
is available on our site.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.870
I can show that to you.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:26.750
As portraits they initially appear
to be intimate and respectful.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.150
I suspect actually that the moment

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.270
of photographic encounter was
far more ambiguous and fraught.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.050
Geelem convinced Swahili
translators, negotiators, traders,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.040
and their families to sit for
the camera, which they had to sit

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.590
for a long time, we'll remember.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.720
And he wrote about those
moments and how they were

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.030
so widely observed by
curious bystanders.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.480
And, you know, as probably
many of you are aware the rules

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.700
of Muslim modesty restricted
Geelem's access

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.890
and his conversations with women.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.090
And so it was their husbands
and in some cases their masters,

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:07.340
the people who owned them who
compels some of the depicted women

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.630
and servants to sit for Geelem.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.390
So we see all the complexities of
status and the senses of looking

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.760
at that are sort of going on here.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.560
So in this case we have these
portraits of the small girl

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.810
on the left - sorry, on the
bottom center is actually niece

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.110
of the governor.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.230
Her name is or was Aziza
and she's completely ducked

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.500
out for her portrait to,
you know, all of the jewels,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.010
everything has been
sort of laid upon her.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.010
She's been completely adorned
for this photographic moment

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.190
and it was watching that process
of the creation of her portrait

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.090
that convinced the governor
eventually to sit for Geelem.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.060
So we have these little moments
of, you know, really interesting

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.880
and provocative interaction

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.060
that this is really only
the tip of the iceberg for.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.030
I'll just briefly note
Zavia Korvubla's research,

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.130
because the text is in French
and we really have, you know,

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.720
as we know a lot of them
difficulty addressing those text,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.560
especially as Americans and really
getting them to be accessible

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.310
in a variety of languages.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.330
So he put them up the
bit that he studied

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.810
and they're really
intriguing accounts

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.610
and I highly recommend you go
to them on the unbound Web site,

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.300
the library and Smithsonian
website there.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.810
And we see the variety
of people that are there.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.160
There are people who are slaves,
people who have been, you know,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.340
compelled to sit, and then we have
people of course who, you know,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.030
look modern and we imagine
there's a big difference

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.380
and a big cultural
divide between them.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.880
But of course these interactions
were happening all of the time

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.060
and exchanges were happening all
of the time and he was just sort

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:55.050 position:56%
of there to make it happen in some
ways, but also witnessing, you know,

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.710
what was in front of him.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.530 position:56%
I had a student recently, a Somalian
American student who's really

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.270
concerned about these images
and she had a lot of questions

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.900
about the anionic mandate and the
questions of modesty and propriety.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.130
And it generated a lot of
conversation about the role

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.940
of photography and who
were taking these pictures.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.280
And I pointed her, you know,
eventually - let me look -

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.990
we can look at this
one really quickly.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.340
We see a really a sort
of probably a noblewoman

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.810
or somebody who was very wealthy.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:31.610
She's wearing this sort of partial
mask called a [inaudible] related

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.670
linguistically to the word for
burka, you know, the cover.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.560
And we see this come
up in photographs.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.240
It's something that was in favor
for a time in fashion and they kind

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.330
of fell out of favor and a lot
of people have commented too

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.140
on we don't see anything
like this anymore.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.580
But it is a very elaborate
sort of mask.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.930
But circling back,
I pointed my student

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:54.740
to the great photography story of
Siddique Bay of Egypt, the guy who,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.900
you know, was an Egyptian
military officer

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.950 position:56%
and who helped escort the huge
tapestry that was created every year

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.280
in Cairo and then with a big
military possession every year took

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.080
it over at the covering
for the kava in Mecca

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.970
and there was an extraordinary
sort of pilgrimage that happened.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.280
He was the one to take, from what
we know, the first photographs

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.370 position:56%
of the kava and he didn't only do
that, but of course he took pictures

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.360
of the pilgrimage sites, of
the people who were responsible

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.420
for the [inaudible] and
different places there.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.440
So the question of how Muslim
photographers were negotiating all

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.690 position:56%
of that is really, you know, kind of
fraught in an individualistic sort

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.880
of question with lots of
different grains to that history.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.070
He published and released
seven volumes.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.160
He won prizes in Venice for his
photography, so there's a lot

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.730
of stuff that I feel like should
be household names we should know

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.690
about this and we don't.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.280
So it's just kind of peeling
back the history that, you know,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.140
or just seem inaccessible to us.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.070
This is shifting to
sort of another page.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:08.890
The page about Oman [phonic]
the cultural center of caboose

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.010
who is [inaudible] funded at this
project on a lot of terrific work

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.390
at the National Museum
of African Art.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:21.170 position:56%
Very early imagery from Oman in
this case was taken by a German sort

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.050
of traveler itinerant photographer
named Herman Burchart [phonic]

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.550
and his work is in Berlin.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.070
They kindly loaned us some images

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.590
so that we can see a
little bit of the sense.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.200
And his approach has
been explored and written

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.590
about sort of in great detail.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:40.670
He just won a [inaudible], but, you
know, I highly recommend you look

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.490
at them the few images
that are there.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.300
In Muscat and also
another city called Matra,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.650
which was actually bigger than
Muscat, another port city.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:56.630
You know, we have the fish market
here and the harbor in the city.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:02.350
This was taken around
what do we think?

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:04.100
1904, right.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.270
And when you're looking at
this and then you go back

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:12.090
to the Zanzibar images you see
the huge similarities, right,

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.730
in between the fish market
and how it looked in Zanzibar

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.030
and how it's looking there.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.150
Swahili, all of these different
languages were being spoken

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.240
in very different places again
reminding us of the migration

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.230
of people and the very cosmopolitan
sense of a lot of these, you know,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.810
very small cities where people were
going back and forth all the time.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:36.690 position:56%
And it wasn't just a sort of a
one-way direction, so we get a sense

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.500
of the difficulties in his
photographing out on the streets,

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.200
but also the fact that
he managed to do it

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.800
and that they were kept is amazing.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:50.040
Another great series of work,
which I only could gesture to here

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.390
on the Web site, are the works
that are coming from Persia

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:00.050
of the famous photographer Antoine
Sevregene [phonic] who terrific

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:05.470
and wonderful collections are
there at Sackler Freer of his work.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.320
He went around and took
a lot of photographs,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.900
including royal commissions
photographs of big royal events

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.670
and sorry, holidays and things like
that by royal and noble families

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:24.280
who of course had people
from East Africa working

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.650
within their families.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.490
In this instance there
really was no word for slave.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.750
People will not say, "Oh,
those people were our slaves."

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.730
They will say, "They were servants.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.170
They became part of our family."

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.330
And indeed I also recommend
the New Your Public Library

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:45.220
who did a larger exhibition, which
was sort of more encompassing

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.670
than this and didn't focus
on photography solely,

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.650
but really explores the different
aspects of East African migration

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.450
and North African migration to
India to Persia to the Middle East

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.600
and sort of social
mobility that was allowed.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.550
You know, people became
Generals, they became, you know,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.620
associated with royalty
and all the rest of it.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.770
So it wasn't - it's an interesting
series of stories that emerge.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.720
What's happening and this image is

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.430
from what we can tell it's
possibly a celebration

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.160
of Rosa Karney [phonic] which
is a private performance

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.280
of reciting from the Koran.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.740
Antoine Sevregene probably
took this picture in the 1890's

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.870
and we see the terrific
thing about this

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.570 position:56%
that we had designed on the website.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:35.040
It allows you to really, really
zoom in and you can see just

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.760
in the middle of the photograph
really towards the center

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.610
in between the men, is one guy

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.410
who is almost certainly
from East Africa there.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:51.210
Really center in the middle of the
photograph and just really brings

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.860
up all sorts of questions for me.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.600
More questions than answers
that we have at this point,

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.460
but it's a really interesting
and growing field of scholarship

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.740
of Afro Persian, Afro Iranians
and the presence of, you know,

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.130
as being described in terms

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.620
of performance songs
and all sorts of things.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.060
With this image it's an
incredible story and I did write

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.300
about it a little bit
on the website.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.630
This is Nasser Al Dean
Shah and his Unix

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.420
and what we have are several men.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.770
If you look closely
you can see them.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.090
I don't have a pointer,
but if you look closely

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.240
at their faces you can see people
who clearly come from East Africa

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.690
and were part of the cohort on
sort of interior kind of, you know,

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.310
group of advisers that
advised this particular Shah

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.010
who was raised far away from
the court and was surrounded

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.320
by this group of gentlemen.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.010 position:56%
And then when he rose to power
these were his closest advisers were

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.630
people who had come
from East Africa.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.280
They became wealthy
landowners and they, you know,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.960
ascended to power in
their own right.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.960 position:56%
So, again,, a lot of biography that
is just, you know, touched upon sort

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.940
of just or two in photographs
like this, but for, you know,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.500
a lot more work sort of needs to
be done for these kinds of things.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.200 position:56%
One thing that is really surprised
me the reception the interest dhows.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.370
I mean dhows of course are the huge
anything from a small fishing boat

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:25.060
to huge, huge trans ocean going
vessels often comprised of wood

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.360
that has been sewn together.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.870
So these are boats
that have been sewn on

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.430
and that's how they're
sort of constructed.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.680
They go across the ocean and
of course they have, you know,

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.950 position:56%
they're the sort of mode of mobility
connecting Asia, the Middle East

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.600
and the east coast of Africa.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.990
These are from North
Western's collection.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.490
We don't have a lot of
documentation about why photographs

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.520
of these dhows were even created.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.390
Abdul Sharif there in well,
he's sort of all over the place,

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:00.070
but he's beautifully put together
number of books that make the case

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.760
for the complexity of these images.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.170
You know, and then even the
construction of the dhows,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:13.730
the science this science,
technology, astronomy position

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.890
of where people are, sailors
are in relation to the heavens.

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:21.730
All of this was really sort
of developed and investigated

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:27.470
by Sharif in his book on dhows.

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:31.570
The monsoon seasons, if we
remember the map, you know,

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.120
there's a seasonality to the
monsoon, so people were forced

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.030
to migrate on one of these boats.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.480
So say you landed from West
India and then you landed there

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.810 position:56%
in Zanzibar, because of the
prevailing winds you would be forced

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.650
to stay there for three
or four months.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.440 position:56%
And this has been a factor that, you
know, has been attributed to a lot

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.440
of the intercultural sort of
questions about or, you know,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.960
sort of premises of cultural mixing
and the cosmopolitanism that we see

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.530
in East Africa and a lot of these
cities that people were there,

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.500
they took wives, they
learned the language.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.230
You know, they stayed there for a
long time and then they migrated,

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.390
you know, onto the next port.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:20.380
And so that sort of geography that
determined and created and sort

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:26.450 position:56%
of fostered those cultural exchanges
has really, you know, been something

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.090
that is interested and
surprises a lot of people.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.660
I just briefly wanted to
show you a couple of images.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.250
This went completely
viral in a lot of ways.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:41.140
It was picked up these photographs
were taken and, you know,

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.290
sort of republished on
so many different sites

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.490
and it was really fascinating
to see this interest for people.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:51.850
I'm going to kind of
speed it up a little bit.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.800
Indian Ocean portraits
was another section

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.150
that I tried to put together.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.570
This centers around the ethical
stakes of photography on one hand

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.660 position:56%
and also for what is for most
Americans a really unknown situation

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.340
of the so-called liberated
slaves in the Seychelles

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.110
and other Indian Ocean islands.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.650
So these portraits
are extraordinary.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.210
They're coming from the British
records of the Seychelles,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.740
so there were times when it
was under British control.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.980
Times when it was under French
control and these are photographs

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.460 position:56%
of the so-called liberated Africans.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.110
And so what we need to know is

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:33.740
from the 1860's the British Navy
was pursuing these slave ships

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.490
that were going off the keys
coast of East Africa and running

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.430
around over to Brazil going
to India to try and keep carry

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.040
on the slave trade, right.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.250
So the British Navy was
pursuing these ships,

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.920
would recapture the people
that they found on their ships

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.310
and then they would
put them somewhere.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.020
They would put them somewhere else

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.320
and in this case it
was the Seychelles.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.620
These guys had been headed either
to Asia or to the middle east

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.800
and they took these people
who ended up in Port Victoria,

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.400
the Seychelles and they were freed.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.950
But what freedom meant in
this case was installing them

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.690
as indentured servants on the
plantations that were owned

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.980
by British people, by French
people, by Creole people,

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.690
the plantation owners
on the islands.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:22.490 position:56%
So when those people are passed over
that, you know, money was exchanged

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.690
that was funding the
activities of the British Navy

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:30.420
and so really putting people from
frying pan really into the fire

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.690
and calling it liberation.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.840
The interesting thing to me is
1860's these photographs are taken

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.510
of these people and what they
took down as part of this sort

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.210
of documentation of them
is the name of the person,

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.460
sometimes it's Anglicized
or put into a kind

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.510
of comprehensible French name,
including the age of them

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.980
and the person who, you
know, some translation

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.540
of who their father might've been.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.290
So Galloway, nine years
old, the son of [inaudible].

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:08.450
You know, and the fact that that
was sort of recorded momentarily.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.270
There's not a lot of
these but that the aspect

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:17.550
of that photographic moment
during the transition from capture

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.470
to another kind of
capture is really,

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.920
really fascinating
and troubling, right.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.870 position:56%
A lot of people writing about these.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.520
You know, when they found
this website where, you know,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.980
they put it on their
blog, they put it

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.150
on their Pinterest
site, whatever happened.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.000
All the people who were really
taken by the story were interested

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.050
in the pain that they felt and
they read on people's faces.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.970
You know, there is an
individual aspect to that record

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.610
and there is a moment of oppression

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.190
that happens at the
same time, right.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.010
So if we have a portrait, but
it's taken against a person's will

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.200
at a moment after rescue, we
call it a portrait, right.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.710
So people continue to debate
a lot of these questions.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.140
You know, what do we
see in people's faces?

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.810
And what if that surpasses
the conditions

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:09.790
in which the photograph was taken,
so their fragments have this,

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.510
you know, central narrative that
we have about migration and I think

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.970
that really speaks to a lot
of people here in the US

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.640
who don't have anything like that.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.190
For me these portraits defy
and alter our expectations

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:28.080
of what constitutes a portrait,
I will end with some images

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.200
that really kind of went
viral more than anything else

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.260
and that is the beautiful portraits

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:41.060
of Swahili [inaudible] daughters
is the section that I put it under.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.360
Its full of surprises.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.650
There are so many things
happening in these photographs.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:50.100
Some of them are clearly composed
portraits that were commissioned,

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.350
right, either by a man in the
family or possibly by a woman.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.280
We don't really know
in a lot of cases.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.750
A lot of times those
portraits were taken as part

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.050
of a touristic enterprise

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.170
or a commercial enterprise
and we don't know.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.640
And then they end up
circulating on a postcard.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.260
They end up circulating on a
souvenir image, in an album.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.130
And we have to remember that there
was a lot of trade with the US

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.020
and with Europe and with India
and there was a big trade

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.930
and photographs as part of
that circulation that was going

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:23.580
on in the 1890 - really
rising from the 1890's.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.550
We also know that Zanzibar royalty

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.650
and the elite were really
proponents of photography.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.630
They had lots and lots of
photographs in [inaudible],

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.710
including many of the
European royalty and visitors.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:43.090 position:56%
Pardon. In 1883 the Sultan Vergosh
[phonic] Sayed, the great modernizer

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.800
that I mentioned earlier created
a camera obscura room in the tower

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.910
of one of his new palaces,
The House of Wonders.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.600
So he was really, really interested

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.410
in that technology
that was happening.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:59.660
And turn-of-the-century Zanzibar
studios created photographs

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.970
of royals and elites and they
also did the screening business

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.760
and portraits of, you
know, that were sold

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.030
to temporary residents
and to visitors.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.780
So we don't know -
we know very little

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.220
about a lot of these portraits.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.240
You know, lots of people ask
questions about the clothes

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.720
and what you see here
with the adornment

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.760
of these young women in this case.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:27.660
And, you know, honestly it's
just one of those things

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.150 position:56%
where we have so little information.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.960
We know that this was
taken by AC Gomez and Son,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.440
one of the big Zanzibar studios.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.160
We have people like this, you
know, a little bit further away

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.450
from the camera also
clearly taken as a portrait.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.190
We don't know if she
commissioned it.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.260
The Sultan established the Amani
Sultanate [phonic] on Zanzibar

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.700
in the 1830's and they
kind of, you know,

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.990
mixed with the local
hereditary rulers.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:06.760
When women started coming to
join the harem of the Sultan,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.660
they were coming from Central
Africa and East Africa.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.900 position:56%
They were also coming from the horn
of Africa, the Indian Ocean islands,

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.080
Oman, Persia, Circassia [phonic],
which is now Georgia, right.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.260
And India and they
were brought from all

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.610 position:56%
of these places to marry the Sultan.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:26.010
Some of them as freeborn wives
and some of them as concubines.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.280
So upon their arrival
they were renamed

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.720
and they were given three
days to adopt Amani dress.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.960 position:56%
And so real wardrobes really brought
together all of these influences

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.870
of the women who had sort of
shown up to be part of the harem.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.330
So we have in this case we can see
this woman's kind of tight trousers

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.570
with the flare at the
bottom, Miranda trousers

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.780
and with these flared
ankles were thought

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.340
to be an introduction
from Circassia.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.070
Then we see these long
chemises that they're worn with.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:58.040
We see congas, a lot of
dress who know, you know,

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.490
will recognize them
from East Africa now.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:06.630 position:56%
We also see this intricately wrapped
calumba [phonic], the headscarf,

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:12.880
which was the prerogative of Muslim
women who were free at the time

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.380
and then that really all
changed in the 1890's.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.010
We also see a lot of silver jewelry
and that was imported from India.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.980
There is some debate about this
and I put forward the possibility

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:31.820
that these photographs are this is
a photograph of two [inaudible],

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:38.680 position:56%
which are women who may have - sorry
- may have represented their Armani,

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.830
the women who owned them
and they were people

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.630
that could dance can
be seen in public

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.250
and sort of represent the family.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.080
So they were dressed, as you
can see here in lots of jewelry

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.190
and were known for their
extraordinary beauty,

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.200
but they could be seen
whereas the women

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.760
who they were representing needed
to be behind the walls and needed

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.840 position:56%
to be sort of out of the public eye.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:06.140
So the whole purpose of this
paragraph may have been part

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.820
of that display, the sense of
display of family at prestige

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:16.440 position:56%
and money and the ability to have
women that sort of represent or sort

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.610
of stand in for the freeborn
women that cannot be seen.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.170
People love images like this too.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.470
We see the congas here.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:28.430
We have this really authoritative
looking stance in some cases

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.940
and we see this with a lot
of portraits studios here.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.520
It may have been something
that people picked up.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.340
It may have been directed
by the photographer.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.640
Unfortunately we don't know.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.400
This is another photograph
by AC Gomez.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.780
You know we have photographs
of Zanzibar and Mombasa,

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.130
lots of different places
and again here

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.070
from the Cateno [phonic]
brothers different engagements

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.310
with the photographer that are
really, really visible here.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.990
We see, you know, on the left this
woman who's really not certain

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.180
if she wants to be there
and then women, you know,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:05.790
who are taken in groups and then be
get labeled sort of retroactively

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.430
as may be from the [inaudible]
because of the style of dress

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:14.500
or their features or
their skin tone.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.250 position:56%
Again the [inaudible] on the women
here on the left and then, you know,

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.310
women that are posing with books.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.480
And we can't tell if
this again was a portrait

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.940
that would have been commissioned.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.780
You know, again more
questions than answers.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.090
We do know that after abolition and
this has been documented and sort

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:34.720
of written about, regardless
of the class women

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.840
who were Muslim could
choose to cover their heads.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.720
And that had not been
the case before.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.740
If you are a woman who is
working for somebody else,

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.720 position:56%
you needed to show your subservience
by not covering your head.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.180
And so that all changed in
the 1890's and women rushed

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.110
to photographic studios to
have their photographs taken

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.010
with their heads covered.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:59.300
And so we see images like this,
you know, whether they're staged

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.620
or whether they were
privately commissioned.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:07.610
And then I wanted to just end with
a few ways in which, you know,

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.410 position:56%
we see examples of it really,
really getting picked up everywhere.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.670
The nice thing like I said about
the online is you can follow

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:22.140
and see how people were discussing
it and how it appealed to them.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.900
This is a really terrific sort
of moment on a really kind

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.240
of basic Kenya, you
know, community board.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.940
They forget for every black
diamond we had our Stardust.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.920
We had twist and bony
M, we were cool.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.380
But even I or my age
mates didn't invent cool.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.890
Cool had been mankind
since creation.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.570
My proof, just go to this site.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.360
Discover cool and the
age when you were an atom

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.220
and so he's asking
somebody else to try

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.030
and post these photographs
from this website.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:53.840
The images of the women appealed,
you know, to people and fashion,

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.720
to people who are trying to
reclaim or sort of re-inscribe

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.830
or recover images that, you know,
weren't even accessible to them,

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.670
aren't available in Zanzibar

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.070
and some cases aren't
available in Nairobi.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.380
These old photographs and they
do have a complex history.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.430
You know, still appeal
and are so interest

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.430
of such great interest to people.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.220
When it went up on the
Washington Post there were a lot

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.250
of people contesting like this
woman is wearing the wrong kinds

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.550
of clothing.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.910
You know, we never would've
seen this in Zanzibar, you know,

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:29.560
if she wasn't covering herself
in the way that we see happen or,

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.120
you know, we have photographs
taken from the '40s and '50s.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.230
People before mentioning wedding
albums and the Sultan showing

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.530
up at their wedding -

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.830
their grandparents weddings
and things like that.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:42.460
So it really evoked a lot of
personal stories for people

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.870
that we didn't expect and is really
something that you can't capture,

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.320
you can't sort of quantify
it or discuss

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.620
when you're in a gallery setting.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.360
And so I guess I would just
like to end with, you know,

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.100
the sense is that when it was
transmitted virtually the images

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.820
and sort of discussion about
them were transmitted virtually

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.280
and then picked up by scholars
and picked up by people who care

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.290
about this for lots of
different other reasons.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:14.090
And I hope that what this sparks
in the end is a larger conversation

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.470 position:56%
and more scholarship and more sort
of interest in the fact that we know

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.790
that a lot of these
photographs are here and

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:25.030 position:56%
yet so much more remains to be told.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.350
And we hope that as people from
all over these places that can help

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.200
to tell that tale and
bring it out to all of us.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.510
So thank you so much.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:41.450
[ Applause ]

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:45.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. We would like to invite
questions from the audience.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.030
I know that I'm was
absolutely fascinated

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:54.220 position:56%
to see how broad this online exhibit
is and I hope you all will go

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:59.360
and visit it on line, but at this
point if anybody has any questions.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.410
First of all, know that you
are being webcast and that

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:09.410 position:56%
by asking questions you are agreeing
to be a part of that webcast.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:13.110
So do you have any questions?

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:24.060
&gt;&gt; So you talk about [inaudible]
interactions [inaudible].

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:31.840
I'll give you a couple of examples.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.990
Input [inaudible] was unexpected.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:41.780
I was just curious if you had
any other kind of [inaudible].

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.160
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.460
Right. Right.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:51.390
&gt;&gt; It's so good to
see how [inaudible] --

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.630
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.310
&gt;&gt; Right. It's an interesting
question

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.850
and I think I'm probably the
wrong person to ask about this

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.150
because well, for a couple reasons.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:07.990
I'm not within the Smithsonian,
so I don't get to handle the sort

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.650
of central knowledge base
that figures out where all

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.110
of these things have
gone and the kinds

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.260
of conversations that it's led to.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:19.630
It was also for me a lesson in
the power of publicity and the way

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.120
that you have to pay
for things in order

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.380 position:56%
to get them disseminated on the web.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.340
And so what you picked up in the
UK is different than what you pick

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.850
up in the US and it's
different again

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.590
in Kenya and all the rest of it.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:33.380
We did see the way that it shot
out and was sort of disseminated

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.150
and people were excited about it.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.600
At the same time I feel
like the investment -

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.170
there's a very heavy
commercial aspect to it

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:44.530
and that tightly controls
the possibilities

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:46.520
of how it gets disseminated.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.340 position:56%
So there isn't a lot of, you know,
it's not something that ever made it

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.840
on the front page of Reddit.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.150
If it had been paid for, if
that had been invested in,

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:57.650
if that had been a priority
that could have been, you know,

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.630
something that maybe
would've generated,

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.420
you know, a lot more interest.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.270
I feel like there were
people who reached out to me

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:08.640
after the Washington Post and
probably would've been even bigger

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.630
that included scholars and included
people in East Africa who were arty

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:17.290
in the tech world and
had their iPhone

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.790
and have a really good connection.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:21.780
And it's not the people that
are kind of like in, you know,

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.100
rural spaces and, you know,
really don't have time to worry

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.100
about these kinds of things.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.070
I also feel like even my colleagues
that are in South Africa, you know,

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:35.270
who I'm in conversation with
had a hard time finding this.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:39.440
So [laughs] again it's a
matter like the, you know,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.680
the algorithm that determines
what allows us to see things.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:47.340 position:56%
So I think that's a huge point where
museums and institutions like this

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.450 position:56%
that are archived have a
responsibility to try and experiment

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.220
and think through the conceptual
limitations of it and the way

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.550
in which you can invite
conversation.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.760
The other tricky thing about it is
[inaudible] needs to be a person

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.230
who is dedicated to
managing that conversation

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.660
because it gets crazy very quickly.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.490
And once you're on that other side
of the comments and they're kind

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:07.650
of racist comments
that I didn't see.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.710
And, you know, but even putting

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:13.410
up a comment page here would
have been totally forbidden,

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.580
because as a, you know, a federal
institution they can't manage,

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.750
you know, like sort of
hosting the kind of speech

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.990
that could be really
difficult, you know, potentially,

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.550
which happens all the time,
right, democratically.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.230
So really good question.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.530
Yeah, it's huge.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.230
It needs to go further, so.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.030
Yes, yes.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:38.600
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.450
&gt;&gt; Yes. Very good question.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:47.600 position:56%
So I was trying to focus on
gendered component of it that I felt

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.850
like was people would imagine

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.890
that there wouldn't be
images of women, right.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.850 position:56%
That they were kind of hidden behind
the walls that they, you know,

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.160
they wouldn't choose to
have their photograph taken.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.910
And I wanted to just kind of turn
that on its head a little bit.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.740
I also felt like even, you
know, we often heard, you know,

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.480
I don't know, they're many writers.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.010
I'm a tough [inaudible] all sorts
of people describing the migration

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:13.060
from India to East Africa and the
sense of unknown that were there.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.650
And also the fact that they were
people who were going who are men

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.610
and women, but we don't really
have so many stories of course

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:24.380
of the people who did that and
who crossed or who were migrating.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.010
We do know that there
were a lot of sailors.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.990
It was primarily men who
were working and going across

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:33.270
and it would have been a very
inhospitable place to be on a Dhow

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.010
if you're women unless you're
kind of segregated, and, you know,

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:40.170
and part of this, you know, sort of
section of the boat that, you know,

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.400
maybe was coming from
India and, you know,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.860
you were starting your new life
as an indentured servant there.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:51.490
So I wanted to get the sense of
vulnerability, but also of presence

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:55.130
and it's something that I try
and discuss within the writing

00:53:55.130 --> 00:54:01.110
on the exhibition, but it's really
more just like an entry point.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.710
I think everybody's a daughter
before they're a wife [laughs].

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:08.670
And maybe some people are never
wives, but, yeah, I wanted to try

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.150 position:56%
and get at that as flawed as it was.

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:11.450
So.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:12.750
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I have a question.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.040
&gt;&gt; And that is have
you gotten an idea

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:25.260
of how this is received among the
people who were the photographs,

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.440 position:56%
people from [inaudible], Seychelles.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:34.870
Did it invoke any kind of dialogue
directly with you or indirectly?

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.910
And what did the people
feel about --

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:38.210
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:39.510
&gt;&gt; -- seeing their history,

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.240
because I can imagine
they would not have privy

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.540
to a lot of those [inaudible].

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, right.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.970
I can't speak to the
[inaudible] in particular.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:51.360
Sadly we did have images that are
there from the Seychelles and are

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.510
from Seychelles and
[inaudible] archives.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:57.580
I feel like that is not - I have
very little sense of the way

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:01.640
in which citizens are
using that archive

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.030
or those photographs
in any particular way.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:06.200
I feel like it's more of
a scholarly enterprise.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.040
We didn't have that I know
of and I need to go down

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.520
and at the Smithsonian
again to see, you know,

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.570
if there was any conversation
that came

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.350
from the Indian Ocean
islands in particular.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.460
I feel like the early
work that I did

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.160
in West Africa this
happens all the time,

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.180
you constantly hear
this conversation.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.500
"Oh, all of our photographic
history has been removed

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.350
to France during decolonization."

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:30.460
It's in Aix-en-Provence, it's
not in Bamako for example.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.610
I think it's a conversation
which is just starting in a lot

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:37.470
of these places and the French
were, you know, great archivist

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.890 position:56%
as were the Brits and the South
African apartheid government, right.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:46.890
So we have a lot of records and
the question of curetting them

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.560
and bringing them out, not
just in a scholarly ways,

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.300
but in public ways I think is,
you know, a huge imperative.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:57.100
And unfortunately I don't have
direct conversation or sense

00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:02.270
of the reception there and it's
- do you have any friends there?

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.570
You should send it.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.100
[ Laughs ]

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.650
&gt;&gt; Anybody, just send it out.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:07.950
Send it.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:10.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:11.850
Yeah, I know.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.150
I mean even the diaspora
communities, you know,

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.660
it's like it gets - what I have
noticed is the ephemerality

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.940
of the web means you don't get a
lot of deep conversation about it.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.330
It's like look we were cool,

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.220
check out how cool we were I mean
it doesn't even need to relate

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.850
to your own family
members or those senses.

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.550
People do it and it's a quick
grab and then they put it on

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:32.040
and it beautifies their
website and you want it

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.910 position:56%
to go deeper and it kind of doesn't.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.660
It's the nerds and the scholars
like us who really want to sort

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.750
of have the deeper, you know,
conversational engagement.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.890
And so that [inaudible] satirical
website is one of many who,

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:48.210
you know, it's like the scholars
who are trying to put the visual

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:52.770
out there online and may be the
algorithm allows them to sort

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:56.220
of see this and allows other people
to see it, but it's just like, oh,

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.520
isn't this beautiful
and then it keeps going.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.390
So I don't know, maybe there
will be different reactions.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:02.690
You never know.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:06.480
Unintended consequences I think are
the best thing about this maybe.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.640
&gt;&gt; Ann does this exhibition have an
expiration date or will it just --

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.640
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's a very good question.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.160
So the dead links,
like this is the thing

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.130
that if you are a webmaster I guess
you know about and I didn't know.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:22.400
We got rights for these images
for five years, so it's short.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.100
There is no book sadly.

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.830
It's always difficult
to make a book and even

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:30.340
to put this website together
was a huge investment

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:34.710
and an experimental
investment for the Smithsonian.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:39.430
I feel like it needs to happen
and it's also very uneven set

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:43.150
of platforms to respond to
people that I care about,

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.080 position:56%
the audiences that I care about
and, you know, who are my colleagues

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.190 position:56%
in different parts of the continent.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:50.480
You know, don't have access
to it in the same ways, right,

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.470
when powers that concern
and all the rest of it.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:57.230
So we're very lucky to be
here [laughs] and to be able

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:59.840
to see these things and how do
we make that more democratic

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.400
and more accessible globally
is still under construction.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.490
&gt;&gt; And then my last question would
be you talked a little bit working

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:13.870
with somebody who's in our
audience today on something on --

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.170
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.070
Manas Rizzi [phonic].

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.080
They're in the audience.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.490
No, so Grace Ali [inaudible]
magazine and New York,

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.100
a magazine about art and
activism invited artists

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.070
and writers to contribute.

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:36.210
And Manas was the digital artistic
curator of the o whole issue.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.210
She brought together the artists.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:44.250
Grace I think chose writer's to
write about that and it was all

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:47.040
about the burka and different
sort of incarnations and artists

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.340
that are dealing with that.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.800
So, yeah, I don't - I'm
really glad that she's here.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.100
Go check out her work.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.400
She's going to be at the
Library of Congress later.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.710
She's a GW.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.240
You're toiling away at GW, right?

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.780
Yeah.

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.010
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:04.310
&gt;&gt; Oh, you are?

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.610
Congratulations.

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:06.910
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.510
So anyway, yeah, terrific.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:10.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:12.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:13.410
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
