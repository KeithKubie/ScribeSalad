00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
many a culture is home to a mythical

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.830
beast an elusive creature that thrives

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.290
in the imagination if not verifiable

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.840
reality the Scots have Nessie

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.470
monstrously hiding in its highland lock

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.990
Nepal has the abominably unverified Yeti

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
even New Jersey has its own devil

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.820
roaming the Pine Barrens hell-bent on

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.970
scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.970
campers and here in majestic Iceland

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.040
there aren't the elves who you really

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.530
don't want to cross especially if you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
happen to be into sub-arctic tunnel

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.450
construction why are you saying that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.450
this project is running two years late

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.789
possibly absolutely because of owls hmm

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.730
the look of a journalist trying to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.129
remain open-minded surely the government

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.260
body overseeing Iceland's infrastructure

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.149
projects can't take all of this elf

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.940
Roberge seriously as a government policy

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.090
or possibly government custom to take

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.670
into account potential elf habitation

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.460
when putting in roads and that sort of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.560
thing we are not going to look at a line

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
for a road don't think maybe their heirs

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.259
there or they were there it's it's more

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.170
like if something comes up and come up

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.500
it has in 2013 the government allowed a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.409
new road to be delayed by apparently

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
invisible elves inside one giant rock

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.380
Alice's after the Earl's gave permission

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.869
yeah i mean our lady who told us that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420
this was probably a chapel and there

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.700
were alps living there she said belief

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
in unseen rock dwelling elves has been

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.360
around since the Vikings arrived in this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
country over a thousand years ago

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.180
apparently Norse beliefs die hard

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.119
because an elf lady and taxpayer kronor

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.430
to move a 70 ton Boulder is no big deal

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.360
in this Icelandic government department

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.369
it's nice to sort of think about hidden

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.140
people covering in the rocks and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.930
everywhere

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.560
I mean it would be really really nice if

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.560
they were there
