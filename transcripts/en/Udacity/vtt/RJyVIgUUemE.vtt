For some analysis tasks, it's not easy to get the

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.140
data we need. The data's there somewhere, but not in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.790
a form that we can simply download. In these situations,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.120
the data is usually found in bits and pieces that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.760
you need to wrangle together. Sometimes all the pieces are

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.170
on a single website, and sometimes you need to bring

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.250
them together from multiple sources. As data wranglers, we need

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.470
to be nimble and creative in gathering the data we need.
