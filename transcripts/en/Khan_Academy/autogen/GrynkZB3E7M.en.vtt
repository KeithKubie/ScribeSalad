00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.400
let's say I've got a set of numbers

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.410
let's say I've got a set of numbers
 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.039
let's say I've got a set of numbers
two-fifths got three threes I've got a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
two-fifths got three threes I've got a
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.070
two-fifths got three threes I've got a
couple of fours and I've got a 10 there

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
couple of fours and I've got a 10 there
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.129
couple of fours and I've got a 10 there
and what we want to do is find the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
and what we want to do is find the
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629
and what we want to do is find the
middle of these numbers we want to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
middle of these numbers we want to
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.480
middle of these numbers we want to
represent these numbers with the center

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
represent these numbers with the center
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.950
represent these numbers with the center
of the numbers or the middle of the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
of the numbers or the middle of the
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230
of the numbers or the middle of the
numbers just so we have a sense of where

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
numbers just so we have a sense of where
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.019
numbers just so we have a sense of where
these numbers are where they roughly are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
these numbers are where they roughly are
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359
these numbers are where they roughly are
and this central tendency that we're

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
and this central tendency that we're
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980
and this central tendency that we're
going to try to get out of these numbers

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
going to try to get out of these numbers
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.720
going to try to get out of these numbers
we're going to call the average the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730
we're going to call the average the
 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.270
we're going to call the average the
average of this set of numbers and you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
average of this set of numbers and you
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729
average of this set of numbers and you
I'm sure heard the Nate the word average

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
I'm sure heard the Nate the word average
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440
I'm sure heard the Nate the word average
before but we're gonna get a little bit

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
before but we're gonna get a little bit
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260
before but we're gonna get a little bit
more detailed on the different types of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
more detailed on the different types of
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720
more detailed on the different types of
averages in this video the one you're

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
averages in this video the one you're
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910
averages in this video the one you're
probably most familiar with although you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
probably most familiar with although you
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650
probably most familiar with although you
might have not seen it referred to in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
might have not seen it referred to in
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.660
might have not seen it referred to in
this way is the arithmetic mean

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
this way is the arithmetic mean
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.020
this way is the arithmetic mean
arithmetic mean which literally says

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
arithmetic mean which literally says
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450
arithmetic mean which literally says
look I the arithmetic mean of this set

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
look I the arithmetic mean of this set
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490
look I the arithmetic mean of this set
of numbers is literally the sum of all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
of numbers is literally the sum of all
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200
of numbers is literally the sum of all
of these numbers divided by the number

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
of these numbers divided by the number
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939
of these numbers divided by the number
of numbers there are so the arithmetic

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
of numbers there are so the arithmetic
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490
of numbers there are so the arithmetic
mean for this set right here is going to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
mean for this set right here is going to
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.270
mean for this set right here is going to
be 2 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 4 plus 4

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
be 2 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 4 plus 4
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.080
be 2 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 4 plus 4
plus 10 all of that over how many

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
plus 10 all of that over how many
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.390
plus 10 all of that over how many
numbers do I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
numbers do I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all of
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550
numbers do I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all of
that over 7 and what is this equal to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
that over 7 and what is this equal to
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.190
that over 7 and what is this equal to
this is 2 plus 9 which is 11 Plus 8

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
this is 2 plus 9 which is 11 Plus 8
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.780
this is 2 plus 9 which is 11 Plus 8
which is 19 plus 10 which is 29 so this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
which is 19 plus 10 which is 29 so this
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.880
which is 19 plus 10 which is 29 so this
is going to be equal to 29 over 7 or you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
is going to be equal to 29 over 7 or you
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.700
is going to be equal to 29 over 7 or you
could say it's equal to 4 and 1/7 if I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
could say it's equal to 4 and 1/7 if I
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020
could say it's equal to 4 and 1/7 if I
got my calculator out we could figure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
got my calculator out we could figure
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999
got my calculator out we could figure
out the decimal of this but this is a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
out the decimal of this but this is a
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.940
out the decimal of this but this is a
representation of the central tendency

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
representation of the central tendency
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.639
representation of the central tendency
or the middle of these numbers and it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
or the middle of these numbers and it
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.719
or the middle of these numbers and it
kind of makes sense

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
kind of makes sense
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.179
kind of makes sense
four and 1/7 it's a little bit higher

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
four and 1/7 it's a little bit higher
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.060
four and 1/7 it's a little bit higher
than 4 if we're kind of close to the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
than 4 if we're kind of close to the
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310
than 4 if we're kind of close to the
middle of our number range right there

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
middle of our number range right there
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.780
middle of our number range right there
and you might say well it's a little

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
and you might say well it's a little
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580
and you might say well it's a little
skewed to the right and what caused that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
skewed to the right and what caused that
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.499
skewed to the right and what caused that
in well Jesus 10 is a little bit larger

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
in well Jesus 10 is a little bit larger
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240
in well Jesus 10 is a little bit larger
than all of the other numbers it's kind

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
than all of the other numbers it's kind
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.229
than all of the other numbers it's kind
of an outlier

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
of an outlier
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.720
of an outlier
maybe that's skewed this average up the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
maybe that's skewed this average up the
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.370
maybe that's skewed this average up the
arithmetic mean

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
arithmetic mean
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.710
arithmetic mean
so there are other types of averages

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
so there are other types of averages
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810
so there are other types of averages
although this is the one that if people

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820
although this is the one that if people
 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.220
although this is the one that if people
just say hey let's take the average of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
just say hey let's take the average of
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.870
just say hey let's take the average of
these numbers and they don't really tell

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
these numbers and they don't really tell
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.700
these numbers and they don't really tell
you more they're probably talking about

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
you more they're probably talking about
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.280
you more they're probably talking about
the arithmetic mean the other forms of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
the arithmetic mean the other forms of
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.480
the arithmetic mean the other forms of
average though are the median the median

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
average though are the median the median
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.440
average though are the median the median
and this literally is the middle number

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
and this literally is the middle number
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.590
and this literally is the middle number
the middle number and if there are two

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
the middle number and if there are two
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.060
the middle number and if there are two
middle numbers you actually take the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
middle numbers you actually take the
 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.370
middle numbers you actually take the
arithmetic mean of those two middle

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
arithmetic mean of those two middle
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.840
arithmetic mean of those two middle
numbers you actually find the number

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
numbers you actually find the number
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.580
numbers you actually find the number
halfway in between those two middle

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
halfway in between those two middle
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890
halfway in between those two middle
numbers so the median of this set right

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
numbers so the median of this set right
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.860
numbers so the median of this set right
here let me just rewrite them so I have

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
here let me just rewrite them so I have
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.200
here let me just rewrite them so I have
a two three three three four four ten so

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210
a two three three three four four ten so
 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.240
a two three three three four four ten so
let's see we have seven numbers right

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
let's see we have seven numbers right
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.340
let's see we have seven numbers right
here the middle number if I go one two

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
here the middle number if I go one two
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.370
here the middle number if I go one two
three to the right we're there if we go

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
three to the right we're there if we go
 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.590
three to the right we're there if we go
one two three to the left were there the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
one two three to the left were there the
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560
one two three to the left were there the
middle number is that three right there

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570
middle number is that three right there
 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.870
middle number is that three right there
I just listed them in order and I said

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
I just listed them in order and I said
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880
I just listed them in order and I said
well like three is you could think of it

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
well like three is you could think of it
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.700
well like three is you could think of it
as the fourth number from the right and

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710
as the fourth number from the right and
 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.890
as the fourth number from the right and
it's also the fourth number from the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
it's also the fourth number from the
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.740
it's also the fourth number from the
left three is the middle number in this

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
left three is the middle number in this
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650
left three is the middle number in this
case it is the median so in this case

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
case it is the median so in this case
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.070
case it is the median so in this case
three if you use the median is our

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080
three if you use the median is our
 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.530
three if you use the median is our
average and that also makes sense I mean

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540
average and that also makes sense I mean
 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.790
average and that also makes sense I mean
it's literally the middle number and if

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800
it's literally the middle number and if
 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.100
it's literally the middle number and if
you look at this set of numbers it kind

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110
you look at this set of numbers it kind
 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.680
you look at this set of numbers it kind
of does represent the central tendency

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690
of does represent the central tendency
 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.770
of does represent the central tendency
of this set now just to be clear it was

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780
of this set now just to be clear it was
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.420
of this set now just to be clear it was
very clear what the middle number was

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
very clear what the middle number was
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.720
very clear what the middle number was
because I had an odd number of numbers

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730
because I had an odd number of numbers
 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.250
because I had an odd number of numbers
it was you know I have three on each

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
it was you know I have three on each
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.680
it was you know I have three on each
side of the three so it was very easy to

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
side of the three so it was very easy to
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.270
side of the three so it was very easy to
figure out the median the middle number

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
figure out the median the middle number
 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.790
figure out the median the middle number
but if I had a situation let's say I

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800
but if I had a situation let's say I
 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.070
but if I had a situation let's say I
have the situation where I have two

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
have the situation where I have two
 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.790
have the situation where I have two
three four and five let's say that's my

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
three four and five let's say that's my
 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.140
three four and five let's say that's my
set of numbers well here there is no one

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
set of numbers well here there is no one
 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.870
set of numbers well here there is no one
middle number the three is closer to the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
middle number the three is closer to the
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.120
middle number the three is closer to the
left than it is to the right the four is

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130
left than it is to the right the four is
 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.560
left than it is to the right the four is
closer to the right than it is to the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570
closer to the right than it is to the
 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.270
closer to the right than it is to the
left there's actually two middle numbers

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280
left there's actually two middle numbers
 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.970
left there's actually two middle numbers
here the two middle numbers here are the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980
here the two middle numbers here are the
 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.890
here the two middle numbers here are the
three and the four and here when you

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900
three and the four and here when you
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.539
three and the four and here when you
have two middle numbers which occurs

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
have two middle numbers which occurs
 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.909
have two middle numbers which occurs
when you have an even number in your

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919
when you have an even number in your
 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.850
when you have an even number in your
data set there the median is the halfway

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860
data set there the median is the halfway
 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.840
data set there the median is the halfway
in between

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
in between
 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.460
in between
these two numbers so in this situation

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470
these two numbers so in this situation
 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.770
these two numbers so in this situation
the median is going to be 3 plus 4 over

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780
the median is going to be 3 plus 4 over
 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.140
the median is going to be 3 plus 4 over
2 which is equal to 3.5 and if you look

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150
2 which is equal to 3.5 and if you look
 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.580
2 which is equal to 3.5 and if you look
at this data set that's not what our

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
at this data set that's not what our
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.660
at this data set that's not what our
original problem was but if you look at

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670
original problem was but if you look at
 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.100
original problem was but if you look at
this data set right there you're

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110
this data set right there you're
 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.470
this data set right there you're
actually going to find that the

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480
actually going to find that the
 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.600
actually going to find that the
arithmetic mean and the median here is

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
arithmetic mean and the median here is
 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.460
arithmetic mean and the median here is
the exact same thing let's let's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470
the exact same thing let's let's
 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.150
the exact same thing let's let's
calculate it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160
calculate it
 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.920
calculate it
what's the arithmetic mean over here

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930
what's the arithmetic mean over here
 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.360
what's the arithmetic mean over here
it's going to be 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370
it's going to be 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5
 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.040
it's going to be 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5
which is what 5 plus 9 which is equal to

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050
which is what 5 plus 9 which is equal to
 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.320
which is what 5 plus 9 which is equal to
14 which is equal to 14 over 4 over 4

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330
14 which is equal to 14 over 4 over 4
 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.800
14 which is equal to 14 over 4 over 4
and what's this equal to 14 over 4 is 3

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
and what's this equal to 14 over 4 is 3
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.370
and what's this equal to 14 over 4 is 3
and 2 4 or 3 and a half the exact same

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380
and 2 4 or 3 and a half the exact same
 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.500
and 2 4 or 3 and a half the exact same
thing so for this data set they were the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510
thing so for this data set they were the
 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.200
thing so for this data set they were the
same thing for this data set our median

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
same thing for this data set our median
 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.540
same thing for this data set our median
is a little bit lower our median is a

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550
is a little bit lower our median is a
 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.220
is a little bit lower our median is a
little bit lower it's 3 while our

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230
little bit lower it's 3 while our
 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.310
little bit lower it's 3 while our
arithmetic mean is 4 and 1/7 and I

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320
arithmetic mean is 4 and 1/7 and I
 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.750
arithmetic mean is 4 and 1/7 and I
really want you to think about why that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760
really want you to think about why that
 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.640
really want you to think about why that
is and it has a lot to do with this 10

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650
is and it has a lot to do with this 10
 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.590
is and it has a lot to do with this 10
that sits out there all of these other

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600
that sits out there all of these other
 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.820
that sits out there all of these other
numbers are pretty close to whichever

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830
numbers are pretty close to whichever
 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.900
numbers are pretty close to whichever
average you want to pick whether it's

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910
average you want to pick whether it's
 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.230
average you want to pick whether it's
the arithmetic mean or it's the median

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240
the arithmetic mean or it's the median
 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.560
the arithmetic mean or it's the median
but this 10 is kind of an outlier it's

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570
but this 10 is kind of an outlier it's
 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.890
but this 10 is kind of an outlier it's
kind of an outlier it's it skews the

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
kind of an outlier it's it skews the
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.130
kind of an outlier it's it skews the
data set maybe it you know it's it's so

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140
data set maybe it you know it's it's so
 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.690
data set maybe it you know it's it's so
much larger than the other numbers that

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700
much larger than the other numbers that
 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.750
much larger than the other numbers that
it makes the arithmetic mean seem larger

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760
it makes the arithmetic mean seem larger
 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.000
it makes the arithmetic mean seem larger
than maybe is representative of this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010
than maybe is representative of this
 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.800
than maybe is representative of this
data set and that's something important

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810
data set and that's something important
 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.480
data set and that's something important
to think about when you're looking when

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490
to think about when you're looking when
 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.980
to think about when you're looking when
you're when you're finding the average

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990
you're when you're finding the average
 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.940
you're when you're finding the average
for something the the most people will

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950
for something the the most people will
 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.380
for something the the most people will
immediately go to the arithmetic mean

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390
immediately go to the arithmetic mean
 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.290
immediately go to the arithmetic mean
but in a lot of cases median will make a

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300
but in a lot of cases median will make a
 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.540
but in a lot of cases median will make a
lot more sense if you have these really

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550
lot more sense if you have these really
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.090
lot more sense if you have these really
large or really small numbers that could

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100
large or really small numbers that could
 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.920
large or really small numbers that could
skew the data set I mean you could

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
skew the data set I mean you could
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.260
skew the data set I mean you could
imagine if this wasn't a 10 or let's

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270
imagine if this wasn't a 10 or let's
 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.790
imagine if this wasn't a 10 or let's
Adam imagine adding another number here

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
Adam imagine adding another number here
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.840
Adam imagine adding another number here
if I added the number 1 million if I

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
if I added the number 1 million if I
 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.730
if I added the number 1 million if I
added 1 million to this data set if that

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740
added 1 million to this data set if that
 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.830
added 1 million to this data set if that
was the 8th number the arithmetic mean

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
was the 8th number the arithmetic mean
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.540
was the 8th number the arithmetic mean
is going to be this huge number it's

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550
is going to be this huge number it's
 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.640
is going to be this huge number it's
going to be it's going to be much larger

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650
going to be it's going to be much larger
 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.980
going to be it's going to be much larger
than what is representative of most of

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990
than what is representative of most of
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.750
than what is representative of most of
the numbers in this data set but the

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760
the numbers in this data set but the
 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.730
the numbers in this data set but the
median is still going to work the median

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740
median is still going to work the median
 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.860
median is still going to work the median
is still going to be about 3 and a half

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870
is still going to be about 3 and a half
 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.780
is still going to be about 3 and a half
right if you had a million here it'd be

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790
right if you had a million here it'd be
 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.320
right if you had a million here it'd be
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 the middle two numbers

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 the middle two numbers
 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.719
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 the middle two numbers
would be that it would be 3 and 1/2 so

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729
would be that it would be 3 and 1/2 so
 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.630
would be that it would be 3 and 1/2 so
the median is less sensitive to one or

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640
the median is less sensitive to one or
 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.760
the median is less sensitive to one or
two numbers at the extremes that

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770
two numbers at the extremes that
 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.640
two numbers at the extremes that
otherwise would skew the mean now the

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650
otherwise would skew the mean now the
 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.070
otherwise would skew the mean now the
last form of average I want to talk

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080
last form of average I want to talk
 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.350
last form of average I want to talk
about is the mode the mode has nothing

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360
about is the mode the mode has nothing
 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.700
about is the mode the mode has nothing
to do with icecream

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710
to do with icecream
 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.400
to do with icecream
the mode is literally the most frequent

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410
the mode is literally the most frequent
 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.650
the mode is literally the most frequent
number most frequent most frequent

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660
number most frequent most frequent
 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.920
number most frequent most frequent
number and in this data set it's pretty

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930
number and in this data set it's pretty
 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.990
number and in this data set it's pretty
clear what the most frequent number is I

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000
clear what the most frequent number is I
 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.050
clear what the most frequent number is I
only have one - I have three threes I

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060
only have one - I have three threes I
 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.870
only have one - I have three threes I
have two fours I have one 10 and if you

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880
have two fours I have one 10 and if you
 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.000
have two fours I have one 10 and if you
want to include the million I me have 1

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010
want to include the million I me have 1
 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.980
want to include the million I me have 1
million there so here are the number

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990
million there so here are the number
 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.600
million there so here are the number
that occurs most frequently is the 3 so

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610
that occurs most frequently is the 3 so
 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.640
that occurs most frequently is the 3 so
once again the mode seems like a pretty

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650
once again the mode seems like a pretty
 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.740
once again the mode seems like a pretty
good measure of central tendency or a

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750
good measure of central tendency or a
 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.890
good measure of central tendency or a
pretty good average for this data set

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900
pretty good average for this data set
 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.050
pretty good average for this data set
now the mode it's a little tricky to

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.060
now the mode it's a little tricky to
 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.300
now the mode it's a little tricky to
deal with and you won't see it used that

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.310
deal with and you won't see it used that
 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.100
deal with and you won't see it used that
often because it becomes a little

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.110
often because it becomes a little
 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.100
often because it becomes a little
ambiguous when you know it I mean look

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110
ambiguous when you know it I mean look
 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.790
ambiguous when you know it I mean look
at this data set 2 3 4 and 5 what is the

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800
at this data set 2 3 4 and 5 what is the
 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.290
at this data set 2 3 4 and 5 what is the
mode there all of these numbers are

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300
mode there all of these numbers are
 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.659
mode there all of these numbers are
equally frequent so if you have a

00:07:59.659 --> 00:07:59.669
equally frequent so if you have a
 

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:01.340
equally frequent so if you have a
situation like this then you might just

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.350
situation like this then you might just
 

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.800
situation like this then you might just
you know the mode really loses meaning

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.810
you know the mode really loses meaning
 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.450
you know the mode really loses meaning
it'll might force you anyway to take the

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460
it'll might force you anyway to take the
 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.760
it'll might force you anyway to take the
median or the mean in some form but if

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:07.770
median or the mean in some form but if
 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.530
median or the mean in some form but if
you really do have numbers that kind of

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:09.540
you really do have numbers that kind of
 

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.300
you really do have numbers that kind of
you know one shows up a lot more than

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:11.310
you know one shows up a lot more than
 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.030
you know one shows up a lot more than
the other then the mode starts to make

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.040
the other then the mode starts to make
 

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.400
the other then the mode starts to make
sense so hopefully this has given you a

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.410
sense so hopefully this has given you a
 

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.680
sense so hopefully this has given you a
pretty good overview of how to represent

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:18.690
pretty good overview of how to represent
 

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.710
pretty good overview of how to represent
the central tendency the central

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720
the central tendency the central
 

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.390
the central tendency the central
tendency of a data set very fancy word

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400
tendency of a data set very fancy word
 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.230
tendency of a data set very fancy word
but it's just saying look we're trying

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
but it's just saying look we're trying
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.810
but it's just saying look we're trying
to represent with one number all of this

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:29.820
to represent with one number all of this
 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.010
to represent with one number all of this
data and you might say hey why do we

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020
data and you might say hey why do we
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.779
data and you might say hey why do we
even worry about that only has 7 numbers

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:32.789
even worry about that only has 7 numbers
 

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.339
even worry about that only has 7 numbers
here are 8 numbers here but you can

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:34.349
here are 8 numbers here but you can
 

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:35.329
here are 8 numbers here but you can
imagine if you had several million

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339
imagine if you had several million
 

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:37.640
imagine if you had several million
numbers or 7 billion numbers and you

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:37.650
numbers or 7 billion numbers and you
 

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.110
numbers or 7 billion numbers and you
don't want to show someone all of that

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120
don't want to show someone all of that
 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.250
don't want to show someone all of that
data you just want to give someone a

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260
data you just want to give someone a
 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.829
data you just want to give someone a
sense of what that numbers are on

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839
sense of what that numbers are on
 

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:46.670
sense of what that numbers are on
average on average and as we said the

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680
average on average and as we said the
 

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.310
average on average and as we said the
arithmetic mean is what I see being used

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320
arithmetic mean is what I see being used
 

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.160
arithmetic mean is what I see being used
the most but in situations where you

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.170
the most but in situations where you
 

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.790
the most but in situations where you
might have

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800
might have
 

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.560
might have
numbers that would skew the arithmetic

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.570
numbers that would skew the arithmetic
 

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.180
numbers that would skew the arithmetic
mean because they're so large or they're

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.190
mean because they're so large or they're
 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.269
mean because they're so large or they're
so small the median might make a lot of

00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279
so small the median might make a lot of
 

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.519
so small the median might make a lot of
sense
