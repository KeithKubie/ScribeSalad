Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from W N Y s t e n n p. R on file. Could you, uh, could you introduce yourself, who you are? Uh, uh, my name is Paul Auster. And what do you do? What do I do? I sit here and talk to people like you and Nissa. He's Paul Auster is one of the most prolific writers we have. I do the best I can, but I went to see him because anytime you open a Paul Auster book, you notice that he is noticing that in the world. There are lots of strange repeats. He calls them rhymes, rhyming events. What is it? A rhyming event? Well, arriving event would be something. For example, uh, the girlfriend I had when I was very young, college, freshman, sophomores had a piano in her apartment and the f above middle seat was broken, was the only note that didn't work on the piano.

Speaker 1:          01:06          That summer we got together and we went out to Maine Way, way out, uh, in the wilds of Maine there Eastport. And we were walking through a pretty much an abandoned town and we walked into what looked like an old elks lodge or Moose Lodge. And we walked up to the piano that was sitting in the room and my girlfriend could play very well. And she tested out two piano. One key was broken f above middle c. So that to me is a rhyming events. The F's always break. But if that doesn't impress you and I, you know, I'm going to give you another one. This is a no, this is a true story by the way. The one you're about to hear and it's a lopper. This is too weird. Well, it is, um, the room. Um, so just, uh, five pages in during the war, m's father and hidden out from the Nazis for several months in a Paris Shambo the bun. Eventually he managed to escape. Let's say Shambu did button a maid's room. It's a small room on the top floor of a Paris apartment building. Shamba Dibon eventually he managed to escape, made his way to America and began a new life. Years past more than 20 years, m had been born. I'd grown up and was now going off to study in Paris.

Speaker 2:          02:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:33          once there, he spent several difficult weeks looking for a place to live. Just when he was about to give up in despair, he found a small Shambo to bun. Immediately upon moving in, he wrote a letter to his father to tell them the good news, but we could still later he received a reply. Your address wrote Emma's father. That is the same building I hid out in during the war

Speaker 3:          03:00          and then went on to describe the details of the room. It turned out to be the same room his son had rented. Wait a second. So then father flees. The Nazis stays in this room in Paris, leaves 20 years go by. The Sun happens to be in Paris, needs a room. He finds a little vines. So you're saying the same room, the same exact same room. Yes. Where his [inaudible] really happened. You're not sorry. It didn't happen, Paul. It happened to a friend of Paul's. Wow. That is weird. Yeah. And what do you make of that? Well, hi, I'm not sure what to make of it except that it gives you a funny sense that sometimes in your life when something happens and then weirdly it happens again, that maybe that's intentional and maybe like descriptives already been written somehow. Exactly right. But you know, it's interesting you see people, um, there are people, it seems to me who attract bad luck.

Speaker 3:          03:57          We know these people, we've all known them. Absolutely. And there are people who are accident prone also. Yeah. They're always breaking their toe or breaking their leg. Yeah. Well speaking of which, let me get, uh, our producer Pat Walters in here. Maybe before you do that you should do, she just mentioned that this, this is the, it's a radio lab. The pod. We haven't done that yet. Oh, right. This is radio lab. The podcast. Right. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich and uh, our subject is fate. Really? Yes. We always seem to talk about the, it's funny, I mean like we, we, we'll have sometimes scientists on the show when we talked to them about whatever it is that they study, but it always ends up being the case of the real topic of conversation is destiny. Like is it there? Yeah, if it is, can you beat it? [inaudible] we could be talking about flowers and somehow this would come up and said, we thought, uh, today we would, uh, attack it a little more playfully and pat, our producer got kind of obsessed with something to do with fate and bad luck and I don't really know about pat. Do you want to just roll the tape? Yeah. Just one second here. You live in Arkansas, is that right?

Speaker 4:          05:01          That's correct. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 3:          05:02          I don't think you ever rode renders down there, do you?

Speaker 4:          05:04          No, they're were, I think, I don't think they've maybe gotten into the far western part of the state.

Speaker 5:          05:09          Do you need me?

Speaker 3:          05:12          No. What that is jad hate that freaking bird. Exactly. The road runner. And who is this? This dude. This is Mike Barrier, right?

Speaker 4:          05:20          I'm the author of a book called Hollywood cartoons, American animation in its golden age.

Speaker 3:          05:24          He's basically the guy you call if you have like a big profound question about looney tunes. Looney tunes. Yeah. A few months ago, Lulu and I started wondering like in the Miller, our former producer, why is road runner so good? Because I am at least in the camp. To answer your question, yeah. But before we get to the answer, I just want to give you a little background on the cartoon. All right. Go for it. It's 1949 when you're at the movies with your wife, you go in and you take a seat and when the movie starts, one of the very first things you see is the cartoon. And in the forties and 50s, most of these cartoons

Speaker 4:          06:02          chase cartoons. Tom and Jerry [inaudible] Bank lady was a prime example.

Speaker 3:          06:07          [inaudible] problem was this chase thing was a formula. It was rigid and uh, it got a lot of cartoonists kind of bored. Yeah. So one day this kind of famous cartoonist named Chuck Jones, sitting around with his buddy, Mike Martinez,

Speaker 4:          06:20          just talking about what the oddball combinations of characters that could be chasing each other. Are they all to youth ball about having an aardvark chasing a good new or something like that.

Speaker 3:          06:29          But once again, you don't even know what I can do is, but just cut to the chase. Eventually they decided let's make a cartoon about

Speaker 4:          06:36          coyote chasing a roadrunner

Speaker 3:          06:37          and when this cartoon came out it was huge. It was a hit. What does it mean for a cartoon to be a hit? Like in those days, cartoons usually only ran one time, but this one was different.

Speaker 4:          06:46          Six months after it came out, they started making another one,

Speaker 3:          06:48          which was almost completely unheard of. Which brings us back to Lula's question. Why is road runner so good? Because I am at least in the camp that it's way better than Tom and Jerry and Mike says it's actually all about

Speaker 4:          07:01          the coyote. He's an extraordinarily human animal

Speaker 3:          07:06          and not just like in the facial expressions that he made and the ways they look at the camera. A lot, but actually it kind of was about the predicaments that he found himself in. Meaning take for example, this one really famous cartoon, like always coyote has got a plan. He has made a painting of the road

Speaker 4:          07:26          showing the road, continuing over a casual,

Speaker 3:          07:27          put this painting right at the edge of the cliff.

Speaker 4:          07:30          [inaudible] the roadrunner would run through the painting, right? He would take hold of him and he was plunged into the chasm.

Speaker 3:          07:36          Roadrunner comes flying down the highway and gets the painting, but it doesn't fall. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          07:45          instead of the road, water runs into the painting as if it were the road. We're actually continuing, but then when the Coyote Trust [inaudible] follow the road runner into the painting, he runs through the painting

Speaker 3:          07:58          [inaudible] he looks up at the camera and he shrugged and he's like, why did the bird gets run into the painting and not me?

Speaker 4:          08:08          Gravity. Isn't this a uniform in different force? It's a malignant force that actually comes in in an adult play is according to how inconvenient it can be for the coyote.

Speaker 3:          08:18          That's interesting thing that the road runner isn't his real opponent at all. It's, it's the universe,

Speaker 4:          08:23          right? Oh yeah. No, he's chasing the road and about the universes as opponent. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          08:27          And that's kind of what makes the KOD seems so human. He's in that situation that all of us feel like we're in some times, like the very laws of physics are against us.

Speaker 4:          08:36          Yeah. Yeah. It's almost almost a primitive way of thinking, but [inaudible] I think all of us lapsed endo does. You know that. How can this happen?

Speaker 3:          08:43          The Universe is out to get me, like

Speaker 4:          08:45          you can't be human and not feel that way.

Speaker 3:          08:47          On the other hand, even though the universe is screwing you, at least it's noticing you.

Speaker 4:          08:51          It's got a flatter and get away.

Speaker 3:          08:53          It's totally flattering. Yeah, and this

Speaker 5:          08:56          makes sense. It's why the cartoon works. Like on the one hand it confirms our paranoia's and then the other kind of plays to our vanity

Speaker 3:          09:05          flattering. Is that really, I mean when you said fluttering a second ago, is that, is that really what it is? You don't see it that way? I don't know. I've never liked this cartoon because he never wins. It's like what's more flattering to live in a world that actively screws you at every turn or one that just doesn't care about you like a Nietzschean void? Um, I don't really know.

Speaker 5:          09:30          That's Kinda tough. I go with the void. No. What do you mean no really ignored by the university? Yes. The worst as opposed to being actively, actively screwed by Russ. Yeah, sure. Ignore me. You don't know what you don't know. I, I'll let me tell you this story. I went to ABC News and I did a story that went very well. And then the next week I did a story which went very badly and the head of the place Roone Arledge called me into his office. I think there's a Roone Arledge, a legend in broadcasting. And then he put his face right in front of my face, his nose almost touching my nose and said to me, I hated this. I hated that. What's wrong with you? And I'll say, and instead of being sad and upset inside my head, like Wiley, coyote himself, I said, wow, he knows my name. He watched my story. But if rune had said that to you every single day, he didn't do it. Every single I know in cartoon form, that's essentially what's happening. Yes. [inaudible] yelling. But I, the reason I like Wiley Coyote is because I, I admire the guy. He has no evidence at all that anything good will ever happen to him.

Speaker 1:          10:37          And yet he wakes up every day with hope.

Speaker 3:          10:40          Hmm.

Speaker 6:          10:41          D

Speaker 1:          10:43          but some people really are what we call losers. And uh, and it's, it's fascinating to try to understand why that person's always getting fired from his job or, or is unlucky in love all the time or just can't seem to make it go of it, but not now. Let's suppose that unlike Mr Coyote, you can't really be sure whether the script that's been written for you, if indeed there is one, is, um, is going to get you deeper and deeper into Doodoo or whether it's going to make you a star or what.

Speaker 3:          11:14          Yeah. And when those moments come along, you know, when you feel like you're getting a peak at the script maybe and then you think, well we'll a is this real? And if it is, what do you do? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:27          In fact, ah, Paul got to one more story, which uh, do you want to read it? Yeah, why don't I read it cause I know I know where it is. Okay. Yeah, it's the last one in um, the red notebook. It is a very strange story. Um, my first novel was inspired by a wrong number. I was alone in my apartment in Brooklyn one afternoon at my desk and trying to work when the telephone rang, if I'm not mistaken. It was the spring of 1980. I picked up the receiver and the man on the other end as to if he was talking to the Pinkerton Agency, I told him no, he had dialed the wrong number and hung up. Then I went back to work and promptly forgot about the call. The next afternoon the telephone rang again. It turned out to be the same person asking the same question I had been asked the day before, is this the Pinkerton Agency again?

Speaker 1:          12:22          I said, no, and again, I hung up this time. However, I started thinking about what would have happened if I had said yes. What if I had pretended to be a detective from the Pinkerton Agency? I wondered what if I had actually taken on the case to tell the truth. I felt that I had squandered a rare opportunity, but the men ever called again. I told myself I would at least talk to them a little bit and try to find out what was going on. I waited for the telephone to ring again, but the third call never came. After that wheels started turning in my head, and little by little, an entire world of possibilities opened up to me. When I sat down to write city of glass a year later, the wrong number had been transformed into the crucial events of the book. The mistake that sets the whole story in motion.

Speaker 1:          13:07          A man named Quinn receives a phone call from someone who wants to talk to Paul Auster, the private detective just as I did. Quinn tells the caller is dialed the wrong number. That happens again on the next night and again, Quinn hangs up unlike me. However, Quinn has given another chance when the phone rings again on the third night, he plays along with the caller and takes on the case. Yes, he says, I'm Paul Year, and at that moment the madness begins and not just for the character in the story, but for Paul Auster himself because when he wrote this book, the city of glass, it became a normal success and this is now I'm writing in 1992 here. I finished the book 10 years ago and since then I've gone on to occupy myself with other projects, other ideas, other books, less than two months ago. However, I learned that books are never finished, that it is possible for stories to go on writing themselves without an author.

Speaker 1:          14:02          I was alone in my apartment in Brooklyn. Then afternoon, sitting at my desk and trying to work when the telephone rang. This was a different department from the one I had in 1980 a different department with a different telephone number. I picked up the receiver and the man on the other end asked if he could speak to Mr. Quinn clean. Remember is the name of the man in the story who got the call. You had a Spanish accent and I did not recognize the voice for a moment. I thought it might be one of my friends trying to pull my leg. Mr. Quinn. I said, is this some kind of joke or what? No, it wasn't a joke. The man wasn't dead earnest. He had to talk to Mr. Quinn. Would I please put him on the line just to make sure. Asked him to spell out the name.

Speaker 1:          14:44          The color's accent was quite thick and I was hoping that he wanted to talk to Mr Queen, but no such luck. Q. U. I. N. N. The man answered. I suddenly grew scared and for a moment or two I couldn't get any words out of my mouth. I'm sorry. I said it last. There's no Mr. Quinn here. You've dialed the wrong number. The man apologize for disturbing me. And then we both hung up. This really happens like everything else. I have sat down in this red notebook. It is a true story. So it really did it really. Then I can get into you. Did you, did you at the moment when he said, uh, when you could have said, well, this is Mr. Quinn. You could have said that I was shaking. I have to say I wasn't in F I was not in full possession of myself. It really disturbed me. And to take a while to settle down and you have this cause it's such a weird, yes, it's inexplicable.

Speaker 5:          15:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:44          but interesting because of them.

Speaker 5:          15:51          [inaudible] Paul Auster is the author of the Red Notebook, which these meetings are from the New York trilogy, of course, which is the, contains the city of glass, also man in the dark, invisible sunset park. He writes book after book after book fourth. We should be off. Thanks for listening. [inaudible] I remembered Krulwich we'll see you later. [inaudible].
