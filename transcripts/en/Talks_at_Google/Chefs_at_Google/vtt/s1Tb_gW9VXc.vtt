BILL BILLENSTEIN: Thank you
all very much for joining us

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.460
in the Big Lebowski today for
another guest chef's Google

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.600
LAX.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.450
I'm Chef Bill Billenstein.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.386
Today we are very excited
to have Chef Yuichi

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:12.850
Natori from CHAYA Venice.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.160
Chef Natori-san started his
career many years ago in Japan,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.900
at the Tsuji Culinary
Institute in Osaka,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.657
traveled all around
the globe learning

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:24.092
many, many different
tricks and techniques.

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:26.890
He has been the chef at CHAYA
Venice for approximately

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.856
the last 23 years.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:30.965
So today, he's going to make
some great favorites of his.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:33.050
We've got the
lobster enchiladas.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.978
We've got the croissant
bread pudding.

00:00:34.978 --> 00:00:37.825
And a little bit of codfish
that--I don't know if you guys

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.075
can smell that, but I'm very,
very excited about that.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.248
So please welcome
Chef Natori-san.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.180
YUICHI NATORI: All
right, nice to meet you.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.370
Thank you so much.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.520
Yeah, I've been here 20 years.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.410
So my cooking's getting better,
but my English is not so good.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.960
A little bit, so--

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.910
SARA BALDONI: But the language
of love is food, right?

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.450
I'm Sara.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.370
I do marketing for
CHAYA restaurant.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.901
So I'm not really, you know,
in the kitchen nearly as much

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.650
as I'd like to be.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890
But I can talk about
everything else.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.577
So you want to start with
the lobster enchiladas?

00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:16.410
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.270
We starting the
lobster enchiladas.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.870
So this is a lobster tail.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.570
And its cut in like
a one-inch square.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.320
And with tomato and cilantro,
jalapeno, and onion.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.730
Cut in like so pico
de gallo salsa.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.900
But not mix it up.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.060
So onion and tomato.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.387
And the tortilla, so.

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:44.220
SARA BALDONI: Are they
corn tortillas, Chef?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710
YUICHI NATORI:
No, this is flour.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.522
SARA BALDONI: Oh.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:46.930
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.077
This good for flour.

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:49.450
Not corn.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.030
Much better.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.430
SARA BALDONI: Corn's not good?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.263
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:54.640
Because corn kill the
flavor of the lobster.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.470
So yeah, flower is much better.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.600
So we're going to start cooking.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.600
OK.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.100
SARA BALDONI: The
lobster enchiladas

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.943
are a huge favorite
at CHAYA Venice.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.994
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, it's
ten years more in the--

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:12.160
SARA BALDONI: Maine lobster?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.260
It is Maine lobster, correct?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.186
YUICHI NATORI: This one
is a Pacific lobster.

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:21.116
But we using a
Maine lobster, so.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.382
So oil, put in the pan.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:33.740
SARA BALDONI: During the summer,
we actually did a fun lobster

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.690
promotion on Sundays, where
it was a half-priced lobster

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.680
every Sunday.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.950
That was all fresh
Maine lobster, flown in.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.250
YUICHI NATORI: I'm putting
the salt and pepper

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.780
on the lobster-- just lobster.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.490
SARA BALDONI: Little
olive oil, Chef?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.323
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:55.094
Little olive oil in the pan.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.256
And we cook the lobster
first, so cook it through.

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:10.529
SARA BALDONI: How do
you know when it's done?

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.070
YUICHI NATORI: Color
change to white.

00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:31.592
OK.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.042
SARA BALDONI: Can
you guys smell that?

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:45.034
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:46.034
SARA BALDONI: Delicious.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.100
YUICHI NATORI: So lobster--
yeah, it's cooked through.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.510
So put in the onion
and the tomato.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.510
But onion and tomato, put
in here so not cook more.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.645
Just a little bit.

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:24.250
SARA BALDONI: Just a little.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.260
Just to incorporate the flavors.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.093
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.512
Yeah, it's this way.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.100
Then going to make a sauce.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.506
It's cream, butter,
mixed up, soak.

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:47.005
SARA BALDONI: It's
cream and butter?

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.993
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:54.390
And salt and pepper,
it's already inside, so.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.320
This is a cilantro pesto.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.210
So this already make
it so my restaurant.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.770
But it's shallots, garlic,
cilantro, Italian parsley,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.480
and olive oil, salt and
pepper, and mix a blender.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.862
SARA BALDONI: That's so easy.

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.070
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, so easy.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.600
SARA BALDONI: Cilantro,
olive oil, salt and pepper--

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.260
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, it's
on the recipe, right?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.822
So just put it in a
blender and mix it.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:23.780
SARA BALDONI: Emulsify.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.613
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.608
And wait now, heat it up.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.830
And the way heat it up,
so put in there and mix.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.468
It's a cilantro cream sauce.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.764
SARA BALDONI: That green color
just shines through, too.

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:11.180
YUICHI NATORI: And
heat it up pan.

00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:15.680
SARA BALDONI: Has anyone
tried the lobster enchiladas

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.994
at CHAYA Venice?

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:18.660
They're definitely
one of the favorites.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.900
And what I was saying
earlier, so there's

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.050
three different CHAYAs in
LA and one in San Francisco.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.740
And each one kind of has
its own signature items.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.560
This is one of the signature
items at Venice, definitely.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.830
I think even if we tried
to take it off the menu,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.330
there might be
pitchforks outside.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.890
YUICHI NATORI:
Everybody upset, no?

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.223
SARA BALDONI: Everyone loves it.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.170
So just heat up the
tortilla just a little?

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.740
YUICHI NATORI: Tortilla, yeah.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.500
No oil, it's fine.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.308
OK.

00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:01.292
It's done.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:21.150
So the lobster, the
center of the tortilla.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.915
And rolled up.

00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:53.419
Then sauce on top.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.900
SARA BALDONI: You make
it look so easy, Chef.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.357
You make it look so simple.

00:08:08.357 --> 00:08:09.190
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:09.856
We put in there.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:14.810
So tomato-- usually,
tomato on the top.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.490
And so micro cilantro.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.520
SARA BALDONI: Little micro
cilantro for garnish.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.394
YUICHI NATORI: Garnish
on top of [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.430
SARA BALDONI: Beautiful.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.717
That took three minutes.

00:08:33.056 --> 00:08:34.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.964
SARA BALDONI: So easy.

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:38.320
YUICHI NATORI: Thank you.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.914
And the next, so.

00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:47.090
SARA BALDONI: You guys are
going to get to taste everything

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.660
that we make as well.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.112
So get excited.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.130
YUICHI NATORI: This is
the black cod from Alaska.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.630
Yeah.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.460
SARA BALDONI: It's
an Alaskan black cod.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.350
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.320
We marinate it in a
sake, soy sauce, mirin.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.540
And so--

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.760
SARA BALDONI: Just a mixture
of sake, soy, and mirin.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.810
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.492
And marinate it in one night.

00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:17.700
SARA BALDONI: Just one night?

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.280
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, one night.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.952
So more than one day, it's a
little bit salty, the fish.

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:24.910
SARA BALDONI: What's your
favorite kind of sake

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.965
to cook with?

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.450
YUICHI NATORI: Huh?

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.440
The cheapest.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.735
SARA BALDONI: The cheapest one?

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.110
YUICHI NATORI:
Yeah, for cooking.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.450
Drinking is a good one.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.010
But using to cook
is the cheapest.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.010
Not different flavor.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.150
SARA BALDONI: Good to know.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.983
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:41.480
Good one, sake,
you have to drink.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.710
SARA BALDONI: You have
to drink that one.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:50.230
YUICHI NATORI: So is one night,
so marinate the black cod.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.470
So it's put in the
oven, 400 degrees oven.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.490
Yeah.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.890
About ten minutes.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.890
SARA BALDONI: That's it?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.850
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.445
It'll make the color,
it's a little bit--

00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:04.020
SARA BALDONI: It
browns a little bit?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.853
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
it browns a little bit.

00:10:05.853 --> 00:10:06.845
It's done, so you--

00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:08.595
SARA BALDONI: Oh, so
that's how you know.

00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:10.469
When the outside kind
of browns a little bit.

00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:11.790
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.665
SARA BALDONI: So you
just put it in the oven.

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:16.180
Do you put it in the oven
in the pan-- in the skillet?

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.096
YUICHI NATORI: No, no.

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:19.570
Just the oven's fine.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.250
But no oven here, so that's
why it's already cooking.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.720
SARA BALDONI: So
imagine that part.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.075
That was already pre-done.

00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:27.200
YUICHI NATORI: It's a fish.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.910
AUDIENCE: So it's 400?

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.600
That's

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:28.930
YUICHI NATORI:
Yeah, 400 degrees.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.560
SARA BALDONI: It's 400
degrees for about ten minutes.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.976
YUICHI NATORI: About ten minutes
to fifteen minutes, yeah.

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:35.730
And this is hijiki.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.710
You know hijiki?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.440
SARA BALDONI: Hijiki seaweed?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.398
YUICHI NATORI: Seaweed.

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:42.142
Yeah, you can get from
a Japanese market.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.350
SARA BALDONI: Like a Mitsuwa?

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.640
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, Mitsuwa
on Venice and Centinela.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.292
Or I think that
Whole Foods has it.

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:53.190
SARA BALDONI: I think there's--
you know that section of Whole

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.880
Foods where there's all the--

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.129
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, it's dry.

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.590
But it's in the dry.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.440
SARA BALDONI: So it's
already prepared like this?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.023
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
already prepared.

00:10:59.023 --> 00:11:00.090
But it's in the dry.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.394
So dry hijiki, put in
warm water is 15 minutes.

00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:06.310
SARA BALDONI: And it
absorbs all of the water.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.850
And then it's ready to eat.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.370
YUICHI NATORI: So is clean
up the water and add them.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:21.930
So cook it with the
carrots and onion.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.510
And the sake, soy sauce, mirin.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.240
Yeah.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.490
The recipe says that, so.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.610
Until to no watery, so that--

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.220
SARA BALDONI: So you kind
of saute it together?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.930
Yeah?

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.150
And evaporate all
the water and then it

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.865
absorbs all the
onion and the carrot?

00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:42.900
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.552
SARA BALDONI: I'm learning
with you guys, this is great.

00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:46.093
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
I put it in here

00:11:46.093 --> 00:11:49.770
so if you want to taste
it, so you can taste it.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:55.740
And it's put in there,
so mix up brown rice.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.622
And cook the brown
rice so it's good.

00:11:58.622 --> 00:11:59.830
SARA BALDONI: It's delicious.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.490
The hijiki brown
rice is wonderful.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.470
This dish is one of
my ultimate favorites.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.320
This is really a CHAYA staple.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.110
So all four CHAYA locations
actually offer this.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.920
There's a couple items that will
be offered at every location,

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.480
like the miso glazed back
cod, our chicken Dijon which

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.320
is in a mustard Dijon sauce.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.440
Our tuna tartar--
actually, Chef Tachibe, who

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.850
was going to be here--
little side note,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.050
we are opening up
our next location

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.280
in the international
terminal, actually, at LAX.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.370
They've done a huge project
over there and it's beautiful.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.180
So we're opening up a little
CHAYA sushi over there.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.410
It's a sushi concept.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.465
And so they're doing
some opening stuff.

00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:52.506
It's going to be opening
in the next couple weeks

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:53.950
here, which is very exciting.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.670
But Chef Tachibe, who is
our corporate executive chef

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.090
for all of the
CHAYA restaurants,

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.290
his knife and chef
coat are actually

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.070
in the Smithsonian
Museum in New York

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.440
City for inventing tuna tartar.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.039
Little known fact, but
a very, very big one.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.830
So it's something we're
very excited about.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.840
Then I make a fried rice.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.360
Hijiki brown rice fried rice.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.810
I saw at Trader Joe's.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.750
It's the same thing.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.958
SARA BALDONI: They have the
same one at Trader Joe's.

00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.479
So you guys can skip
all of these steps.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.770
YUICHI NATORI: If you want to--

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.955
SARA BALDONI: It won't
taste nearly as good.

00:13:37.955 --> 00:13:38.497
They do.

00:13:38.497 --> 00:13:40.330
I have seen that,
actually, at Trader Joe's.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.288
YUICHI NATORI: Maybe I
think they stole it, so.

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.080
SARA BALDONI: They
stole it from CHAYA.

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.360
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
ingredients, I saw, the same.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.490
SARA BALDONI: It's
pretty much the same.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.420
Skip a step.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.550
Don't even have
to go to Mitsuwa.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.868
Yeah.

00:14:00.868 --> 00:14:03.348
Do you guys have any
questions so far?

00:14:03.348 --> 00:14:05.884
AUDIENCE: Is black
cod easy to find?

00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:07.550
SARA BALDONI: Is black
cod easy to find?

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.490
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
a little bit harder.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.240
But maybe you can go
to Santa Monica fish.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.370
They have it, yeah.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.030
SARA BALDONI: It's one
of my favorite fishes.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.965
It just absorbs all of the
flavor of the marinade.

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.530
And it's just so
flaky and delicious.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.704
I hope you guys enjoy it.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.945
YUICHI NATORI: And
this is eel sauce.

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.110
SARA BALDONI: Eel sauce?

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.110
So it's unagi sauce, that
comes on a lot of the sushis.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.480
A little sweet?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.771
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, you can
get it from-- yeah, sweet.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.610
Also, you can get at
Japanese market, yeah.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.740
It's already fried, so--

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.740
SARA BALDONI: That's it?

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.142
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, it's fried.

00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:15.350
SARA BALDONI: Slightly fried.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.310
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.200
Fried rice.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.330
Then the fish.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.932
And the sauteed
shiitake mushroom.

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:34.262
Put it in the garnish.

00:15:34.262 --> 00:15:38.155
And the asparagus, steamed.

00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:42.600
SARA BALDONI: So was there
any sauteing or anything

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.170
to be done to the fish, or
is it all baked previously?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.530
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, baked.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:54.090
So now put in the sauce and
then just a little bit chives.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.855
And then--

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:55.420
SARA BALDONI: Oh, chives.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.545
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, micro
[INAUDIBLE], that's all.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.762
This is a black--

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:03.086
SARA BALDONI: It's so pretty.

00:16:06.397 --> 00:16:09.350
YUICHI NATORI: Thank you.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.370
SARA BALDONI: So
Chef Natori-san, you

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.801
have been at CHAYA
Venice for 23 years now?

00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.550
YUICHI NATORI: 20.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.102
20 years.

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.060
SARA BALDONI: 20 years.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.220
SARA BALDONI: Very nice.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.030
CHAYA Venice opened
23 years ago.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.660
The original CHAYA actually
opened in Beverly Hills.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.701
I don't know if-- have
you guys been to that one,

00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:27.730
right off Robertson?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.740
Yeah?

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.560
That one just celebrated
30 years in Los Angeles.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.940
So we had a huge party.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.935
We had a huge
festival, nonetheless.

00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:38.135
It was really exciting.

00:16:38.135 --> 00:16:39.230
You went.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.840
You brought your family.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.855
YUICHI NATORI: Because
I already make it there.

00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:45.096
No over here, so that's why.

00:16:45.096 --> 00:16:47.290
This is very easy.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.940
So just recipe.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.650
Just cut with the
finger in the croissant

00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:01.150
and then make a-- mix in cream.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.150
SARA BALDONI: That's it?

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.441
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, that's it.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.430
Doing this one.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.637
So becoming this.

00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:10.470
SARA BALDONI: So you
just kind of break up--

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.309
tear up the croissant,
you add your chocolate,

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:15.900
your pudding cream--
now, is pudding cream--

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.470
what makes pudding
cream different from--

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.940
YUICHI NATORI: So
make a pudding cream.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.354
Yeah, pudding cream.

00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:24.520
SARA BALDONI: So pudding
cream is just the egg yolk,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.510
the granulated sugar, and the
manufactured cream all mixed

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.010
together.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.843
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:32.899
And so put in the pan with--

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:34.190
SARA BALDONI: With the vanilla?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.114
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
croissant and pudding cream.

00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:39.780
SARA BALDONI: And
then you just bake it?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.710
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.840
Just put in the oven.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.044
Bake in this minutes.

00:17:43.044 --> 00:17:44.710
SARA BALDONI: 35
minutes at 340 degrees.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.360
YUICHI NATORI: 35
minutes at 340 degrees.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.151
SARA BALDONI: Now,
there's actually a face.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:51.230
There's something that we like
to call the CHAYA chocolate

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.950
croissant bread pudding face,
because-- have any of you

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.930
had it, the bread
pudding at CHAYA?

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.960
Yeah?

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.035
Is it good?

00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:01.055
Right?

00:18:01.055 --> 00:18:02.930
I'm thinking about
starting a hashtag for it,

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.346
because every time
I've introduced

00:18:04.346 --> 00:18:07.670
any of my friends or family
members to this bread pudding,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.985
they all make the same face.

00:18:08.985 --> 00:18:15.200
It's something similar to, oh
my God, which is a good thing.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.910
It really has become a staple
over the past 30 years, nearly.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.870
And it's a lot of fun.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.977
And apparently, it's
super simple to make.

00:18:24.977 --> 00:18:25.810
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:26.130
Don't forget--

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.130
SARA BALDONI: So I'm
a little bit worried.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.085
YUICHI NATORI: --chocolate is--

00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:29.650
SARA BALDONI: The
chocolate is essential.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.130
YUICHI NATORI: --last one.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.260
SARA BALDONI: It's
the secret ingredient?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.340
And that goes last?

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:32.880
YUICHI NATORI: No,
not put it in yet.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.299
So before oven, so chocolate.

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:35.340
SARA BALDONI: OK, before.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.631
And then it all bakes together?

00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:38.490
YUICHI NATORI: After
bake together, then

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.310
chocolate put on
the top and the--

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.410
SARA BALDONI: On top?

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.219
YUICHI NATORI: So
melting like this.

00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:44.760
SARA BALDONI: Oh,
so you add it right

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.450
when you take it out of
the oven, when it's warm.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.450
We have a question?

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.450
AUDIENCE: How do you
create [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:54.940
SARA BALDONI: Yeah,
is manufactured cream

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.427
the same as kind
of a heavy cream,

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:57.510
or a heavy whipping cream?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.884
YUICHI NATORI:
Yeah, heavy cream.

00:18:58.884 --> 00:18:59.800
SARA BALDONI: Exactly.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.610
Good question.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.690
So then?

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.690
YUICHI NATORI: You can put
in some ice cream on top.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.190
YUICHI NATORI:
And it melts down.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.690
You know.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.690
I'm going to start using
that dulce de leche ice

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:15.565
cream on top of that.

00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:16.906
SARA BALDONI: Dulce de leche?

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:17.790
YUICHI NATORI: Mm.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.873
SARA BALDONI: Really good.

00:19:18.873 --> 00:19:22.000
So you kind of just put it in
a ramekin or a little skillet,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.805
depending on what
you want to do.

00:19:23.805 --> 00:19:25.552
YUICHI NATORI: Anything, yeah.

00:19:25.552 --> 00:19:27.350
SARA BALDONI: It's so simple.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.822
I don't think I
could do it, though.

00:19:30.822 --> 00:19:32.530
YUICHI NATORI: Well,
come our restaurant.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.500
SARA BALDONI: Top it with
a little powdered sugar.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.439
And that's it.

00:19:36.439 --> 00:19:37.480
YUICHI NATORI: That's it.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480
SARA BALDONI: And
that's everything.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.110
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.062
SARA BALDONI: Wow.

00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:44.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:44.822 --> 00:19:46.194
That's so fun.

00:19:46.194 --> 00:19:47.485
Does anyone have any questions?

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:48.764
Ooh, another question.

00:19:48.764 --> 00:19:50.978
AUDIENCE: If we don't
have a convection oven,

00:19:50.978 --> 00:19:54.630
does that change the time
that it takes to bake?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.880
SARA BALDONI: Like a convection
versus a regular oven?

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.977
YUICHI NATORI: Regular
oven is fine, yeah.

00:19:58.977 --> 00:20:00.560
SARA BALDONI: Will
it affect the time?

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.530
Do you have to do it a little
longer without a convection?

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.113
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah,
just check it up,

00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:06.860
you know, after 30 minutes.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.470
Check it up so it's
down or not down.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.361
In the enchiladas,
[INAUDIBLE] Parmesan cheese?

00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:21.360
SARA BALDONI: Well, there
was no Parmesan cheese

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.930
in the enchilada, no.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.555
The only cheese was
in the cream sauce.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.880
YUICHI NATORI: Oh, sorry.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.810
Put in the-- so, yeah, cream.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.560
I forget, so, yeah.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.005
Put Parmesan cheese in there.

00:20:31.005 --> 00:20:32.130
SARA BALDONI: In the sauce.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.598
YUICHI NATORI: In the sauce.

00:20:33.598 --> 00:20:36.846
AUDIENCE: If we can't find
black cod, is there another fish

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:37.780
that--

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.130
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, using cod.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.310
Cod.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.190
SARA BALDONI: So cod will
have the same texture and--

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.320
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.660
Put in and marinate it.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.640
So it tastes like same, so.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.880
Or try salmon.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.799
Yeah, salmon is
also so tastes good.

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.340
SARA BALDONI: With
the same marinade?

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.310
YUICHI NATORI:
Yeah, same marinade.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.601
SARA BALDONI: Good replacement.

00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:02.080
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.750
In Japan, so salmon
use in there.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.560
So just marinate it, yeah.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.381
SARA BALDONI: Cool.

00:21:09.381 --> 00:21:10.380
YUICHI NATORI: Now, so--

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.560
SARA BALDONI: Yeah, so
now we'll go get you guys

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.520
some food, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.705
Tachibe is the original
corporate chef as well,

00:21:19.705 --> 00:21:24.214
so he's been with us for 30
years, since brasserie opened.

00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:24.714
Yeah.

00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:26.678
It's a big family.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.043
Enchiladas.

00:21:39.935 --> 00:21:43.154
AUDIENCE: So I guess you
guys aren't open for lunch?

00:21:43.154 --> 00:21:45.070
SARA BALDONI: We are
open for lunch, actually.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.820
CHAYA Venice is
definitely open for lunch.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.940
We've got some help back there.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.460
So we figured we could stop
by for a couple minutes.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.085
Yeah, you think the kitchen will
be OK without you, Natori-san?

00:21:57.085 --> 00:21:59.376
YUICHI NATORI: I think so.

00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:00.625
SARA BALDONI: Fingers crossed.

00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:01.833
YUICHI NATORI: Yeah, it's OK.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.250
So just opened up an hour or so.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.759
SARA BALDONI: It just opened
up, yeah-- oh yeah, at 11:30.

00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:12.138
YUICHI NATORI: Sauce pan.

00:22:12.138 --> 00:22:13.116
SARA BALDONI: Oh, yeah.

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:17.950
One thing that's really
exciting that we're doing,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.659
actually, at Brasserie,
is in celebration

00:22:19.659 --> 00:22:21.783
of our 30th anniversary,
I said we had a big party.

00:22:21.783 --> 00:22:22.930
We had a huge festival.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.310
We had fire dancers.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.120
We had taiko drummers.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.150
We had two live bands.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.250
It was ridiculous.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.848
All you can eat,
all you can drink.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.940
It was a lot of fun.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.630
But we're also bringing
over our original CHAYA.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:40.790
Now, CHAYA is a family owned,
operated, run business.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.280
And it goes back
nearly 400 years.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.050
It started in Japan,
the first one.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.350
Hikage-chaya is
still in operation.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.960
And our chef from that
location is actually

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.580
going to be joining us.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.020
We're flying him out for a
special chef collaboration

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.680
dinner, which is
really, really cool.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.660
He's a Michelin star chef for
the Hikage-chaya in Japan.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.430
And he's coming over
for two nights only,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.730
on October 18th and 19th,
which is really cool.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.020
It's a kaiseki style.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.780
I don't know if--is anyone
familiar with kaiseki style?

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.430
It's very traditional kind
of Japanese small plates--

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.170
really, really kind
of hyper seasonal.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.995
It was really
difficult, because we

00:23:24.995 --> 00:23:28.420
kept trying to get a menu for
what we were going to serve.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.580
And he was like, you
know, it's two months away

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.770
and we don't know
what's seasonal.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.336
Everything is so local,
so seasonal over in Japan.

00:23:36.336 --> 00:23:37.710
We talk about farm
to table here,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.550
but it's a whole different
spectrum over there.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.080
So it's like a multi-course,
very kind of small plates,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.560
everything-- there's so
much care that goes into it.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.550
So it's a lot of fun.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.438
Look at this.

00:23:50.438 --> 00:23:51.854
Oh my god.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.970
So yeah, we're
going to be having

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.900
a chef collaboration
with Chef Tachibe

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.180
and Chef Kazuka-san from
Japan October 18 and 19,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.390
which is incredible.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.700
It's very limited.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.900
So I believe it's going
to be seven courses.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.480
Wine and sake pairings
are also available.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.460
Only 20 seatings per timeframe.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.101
So it's only about 160 people
total throughout the two

00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:22.600
nights.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.646
It's going to be an
incredible evening.

00:24:25.646 --> 00:24:28.150
There is enough
food for everyone.

00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:38.968
Wow.
