00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.662
- [Voiceover] We spent some time talking about hydrocarbons

00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:03.985
and hydrocarbons are interesting

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:06.087
especially if you want to combust things,

00:00:06.087 --> 00:00:08.408
if you want some fuel, but now we're going to

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.883
make things a little bit more interesting

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.432
by adding things to the hydrocarbons

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:15.479
and the things we're gonna add we call functional groups.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.928
Functional groups.

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:19.368
And my goal in my video is to give you

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:21.225
an overview of the major functional groups

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.628
that you might see attached to carbon backbones

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:26.717
that make the molecules interesting biologically.

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:28.517
Now, the first one I will focus on

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.397
is an OH group.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.538
So, we have an OH attached to a carbon backbone over here.

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:35.140
It doesn't have to be attached to a carbon backbone

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.657
but the OH right over here, this is called a hydroxyl group.

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:42.031
Hy, hydroxyl group,

00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.935
and when it is attached to a

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:45.815
carbon backbone like this one is

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:49.333
then it turns the entire molecule into an alcohol.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.351
Alcohol. This an alcohol.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.034
And this one in particular if you want the name

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:56.751
we have two carbons on the longest, longest chain

00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.388
and it is an alcohol so we use the

00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:00.456
prefix Eth for the two carbons.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.005
So, let me write that down.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:03.921
We're going to use the prefix Eth

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.499
because we have two carbons here.

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.485
And we're gonna say Ethanol.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:09.400
Now, what are the properties here?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.059
Well, you have oxygen which is very electronegative

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.845
bonded to a hydrogen and to a carbon

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:16.319
but the oxygen is a lot more

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.979
electronegative than the hydrogen

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.220
so you're going to have a partially negative charge

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.147
at this end away from the hydrogen.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.457
A partial positive charge at the hydrogen

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.605
and to a lesser degree the carbon end too

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:27.766
but hydrogen is even less,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.513
is a less electronegative than even carbon.

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:34.369
And this one, so, a hydroxyl group

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.737
they are polar, they are polar,

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:40.394
and because they are polar you can dissolve them into water.

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:41.973
They are hydrophilic.

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:46.152
They can form hydrogen bonds so that you can dissolve this.

00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:49.751
Now, similar, a similar functional group

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.477
or one that has somewhat similar properties

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.425
is right over here.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.565
And you might say, "Wait, why is this one similar?

00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:58.806
"I have sulfur here instead of oxygen."

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:00.106
But if you look at the periodic table

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.731
you will see that sulfur and oxygen

00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:03.728
both have six valence electrons.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:06.270
They both would love nothing more than to grab

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.441
or pretend to grab two other electrons

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.625
and this is why they form,

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.448
they tend to form two covalent bonds.

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:13.004
And so, this group right over here,

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:14.861
which is called a sulfhydryl group.

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:19.148
This is a sulf....

00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:21.284
Sulfhydryl.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:23.385
Sulfhydryl group.

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.893
It's kind of similar to a hydroxyl group

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:27.588
with the one difference,

00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:29.713
with the one difference that sulfur is electronegative

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:32.127
but it is less electronegative than oxygen.

00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:33.950
So, you're still gonna have a partially negative charge

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.993
and a partially positive charge,

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:37.711
but it's going to be less polar.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:41.229
So, it's not quite as polar as if you had a hydroxyl group.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.551
Now, when you have this sulfhydryl group

00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.791
it's attached to, say, a carbon chain

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:49.448
and when I use this R right over here, when I have this R.

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:51.503
This is just shorthand for carbon

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:52.583
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:54.405
I could've, if I wanted to generalize

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:55.647
an alcohol right over here

00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:57.342
I could've written R and then

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:59.908
I could've written the hydroxyl group.

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:04.308
O and then bond that, bond that to an H.

00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:07.742
So, over here the shorthand R would have been the shorthand

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.101
for all of...

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.401
The R would've been the shorthand

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.214
for all of this business.

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.927
All of this business right over here.

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:16.011
And so that's what we're doing over there.

00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:17.450
I'm not saying that this R is exactly this.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.074
It means that some carbon backbone

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:23.278
and some carbons, hydrogens, and maybe other stuff,

00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:24.949
maybe even some other functional groups,

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.177
but we're just focused on the sulfhydryl right over here.

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:29.570
And so if you see something like this, you'd say

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.917
"Okay, yeah, this is still going to be polar,

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:33.087
"but not quite as polar as if I were dealing

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:35.432
"with a hydroxyl group."

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:38.288
Now over here we have a more complex molecule,

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:39.855
but this is a molecule that you run into

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:41.945
probably on a daily basis.

00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:45.612
This is the sugar fructose.

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:47.889
This is the sugar fructose.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.571
And this is when it is not in a ring.

00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:51.944
If you were to throw this into--

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.244
If you were to throw this into water,

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:56.065
it'll readily form a ring, but when it is not in a ring form

00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:58.689
you can recognize already the hydroxyl groups.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.569
You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.427
You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon.

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:04.435
Hydroxyl group on this carbon.

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:06.606
You have a hydroxyl group on that carbon.

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:09.148
You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:14.037
And then, on this carbon, it's double bonded to an oxygen.

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.818
We call this a carbonyl group.

00:04:16.818 --> 00:04:20.660
So this is a carbonyl.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.483
Carbonyl.

00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:24.236
Carbonyl group.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:25.663
Now this is actually how you would tell a sugar,

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.462
it's like, look, especially when it's in a straight chain,

00:04:27.462 --> 00:04:30.923
all my carbons have one hydroxyl on them

00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:34.161
except for this one, it has a carbonyl group.

00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:36.483
And one of the take aways for a carbonyl group,

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:37.435
we've already talked about

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:39.223
oxygen being very electronegative,

00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:41.800
even more electronegative than carbon, it's double bonds,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.629
it's going to hog the electrons on the oxygen end,

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.657
so you're going to have a partially negative charge.

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:50.955
Partially negative charge over here,

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:53.313
partially positive charge over here,

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:56.586
and so this, this one is also going to be polar.

00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:58.734
And then, in fact, the entire molecule is very polar

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:00.928
because it has all these hydroxyl groups on it as well,

00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:03.575
but this is also going to give it polarity here

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:07.093
and, because this carbon has a slightly positive charge,

00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:09.752
it is susceptible to nucleophilic attack,

00:05:09.752 --> 00:05:10.921
and when you take organic chemistry,

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.274
you'll see that things that want to share--

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:17.514
That have a predisposition to share their electrons

00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:19.999
in a bond might want to come and form a bond

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.040
with this carbon and maybe one of these electron pairs

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.476
go back to this oxygen and maybe bond with something else,

00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:27.719
but we'll talk about it in the future

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.331
when we study some organic chemistry mechanisms.

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.701
The important thing here is just recognize,

00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:33.175
"Okay, I've got some hydroxyl groups?

00:05:33.175 --> 00:05:37.691
"Okay, I've got a carbonyl group right over here as well."

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:41.245
Now this molecule, this is an amino acid,

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:44.959
and you will see amino acids a lot when you study biology.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.756
And this has actually a couple of interesting groups on it.

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:53.734
The first group of note is this stuff

00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:57.412
that I am circling in orange because you have a carbon that,

00:05:57.412 --> 00:05:59.792
you could say it's part of a carbonyl group,

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:04.087
but it is also bound to a hydroxyl group.

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:07.430
It is also bound to a hydroxyl group right over there.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.381
And when you have this configuration where you have

00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.865
a carbon bond double-bonded to an oxygen

00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:13.850
and then single-bonded to a hydroxyl group,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.170
we call this a carboxyl group.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.655
This is a carboxyl.

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:25.051
Carboxyl, carboxyl group.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.843
And one of the take aways from this is that it is acidic

00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:31.862
because this can readily give up the hydrogen proton.

00:06:31.862 --> 00:06:34.543
This oxygen, we already know oxygen likes to hog electrons,

00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:37.759
it can take up both of these electrons and become negative,

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.442
and actually, there's actually resonance here

00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:42.043
because those electrons get shared throughout the group

00:06:42.043 --> 00:06:43.924
and actually even potentially even beyond the group

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:46.002
but especially inside of the group,

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:47.940
then leaving the hydrogen proton.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.202
So this can readily donate a hydrogen proton...

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:54.142
This can readily donate a hydrogen proton,

00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:57.982
so this is generally viewed as acidic.

00:06:57.982 --> 00:06:59.489
Acidic.

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:03.204
Now, this amino acid over here,

00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:05.468
it also, and this is where this name comes from,

00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:07.933
actually the acid comes from this carboxyl group,

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:12.219
this is the acidic part, and then you have an animo group.

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.477
You have an amino group right,

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.252
right over here.

00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:20.748
And because it's involving a nitrogen,

00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:22.036
this is the amino group.

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:25.368
This is what gives the amino part of the name amino acid.

00:07:25.368 --> 00:07:26.912
Amino acid.

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.839
And this actually is generally basic.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.511
Because nitogen could--

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:31.997
It has a lone pair.

00:07:31.997 --> 00:07:35.398
It has a lone pair of electrons right over here.

00:07:35.398 --> 00:07:38.138
And so it could use that lone pair to pick up,

00:07:38.138 --> 00:07:41.156
to form a bond with a hydrogen ion,

00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:42.596
to pick up a hydrogen ion.

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:45.939
So, under the right circumstances, it can form a bond

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:49.201
with a hydrogen ion, which, we know, a positive ion,

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:50.478
which would just be a proton,

00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.243
and so it would have a positive charge.

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:55.180
And so since it can sop up hydrogen ions,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.139
we can view this, the amino group, as being basic.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.054
But this right over here is leucine,

00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:03.759
it's an amino acid super important for muscle growth,

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.315
but there you can appreciate.

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:08.182
You have essentially a hydrocarbon chain,

00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:09.856
but it has a carboxyl group at this end

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.783
and an animo group right over here.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.583
And another thing that you'll sometimes people talk about

00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:15.220
is even hydrocarbon groups.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.866
For example, if you consider the main chain of this,

00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:18.958
and we could consider to

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.606
either using this carbon or this carbon,

00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:24.795
but if we consider this to be the main chain of carbons,

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.384
if we consider that to be the main chain of carbons,

00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:30.344
then we would consider this right over here

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:31.784
to be a methyl group.

00:08:31.784 --> 00:08:34.628
Remember, the prefix "meth" refers to one carbon,

00:08:34.628 --> 00:08:37.159
so it's one carbon bonded to a bunch of hydrogens,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.343
to three hydrogens here,

00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:40.339
and so we would call this a methyl group.

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:42.824
And in general, if you have a hydrocarbon

00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:45.041
bonded to other hydrocarbon groups,

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.084
these things are hydrophobic.

00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:49.139
So these things, there's nothing polar about them,

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:50.776
and so they're not going to want to,

00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:53.028
at least these parts of the molecule

00:08:53.028 --> 00:08:56.755
are not going to naturally dissolve inside of water.

00:08:56.755 --> 00:08:58.449
Now the last group we're going to focus on,

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:00.539
and you're going to see a lot of these, and especially

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:02.803
in biology, you're going to see this as a part of ATP,

00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:05.426
you're going to see it's the backbone of DNA,

00:09:05.426 --> 00:09:07.469
and that's phosphate groups.

00:09:07.469 --> 00:09:09.953
And this right over here,

00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:13.332
this right over here is the phosphate group.

00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:16.234
I've drawn it bonded to a bunch of,

00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:18.974
kind of a group over here, who knows what it is,

00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:20.634
bunch of carbons, a bunch of other things,

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:22.433
and then I've bonded it to two hydrogens,

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.488
but it doesn't always have to be bound to hydrogens.

00:09:24.488 --> 00:09:26.310
But when it is bound to hydrogens like this,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.806
it's considered to be protonated,

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:31.012
and so it can actually take up, it can actually

00:09:31.012 --> 00:09:33.566
hog these electrons and dump these hydrogens,

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:35.911
and dump these hydrogens into a solution.

00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.696
So a phosphate group is considered to be acidic.

00:09:39.696 --> 00:09:42.807
It is considered as well, especially when it is protonated

00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:44.769
like this, it is considered to be acidic

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:46.533
because it can donate protons.

00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:47.509
So this is just an overview

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.519
of a lot of the functional groups you will see throughout

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.346
biology and a lot of big, hairy complex molecules,

00:09:52.346 --> 00:09:53.658
when you actually break it down, you say,

00:09:53.658 --> 00:09:55.120
"Okay, there's a hydrocarbon chain there.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.200
"Oh, I see a sugar there!

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.917
"I see a bunch of hydroxyls, and I have a carbonyl group.

00:09:58.917 --> 00:10:00.797
"Oh, I see an amine group, I see--

00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:01.621
"Or, amino group.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:03.583
"I see a carboxyl group."

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:04.837
You can think about this going to be acidic?

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:05.917
Is it going to be polar?

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:07.298
Or do different parts of the molecule

00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:09.266
have different functions?
