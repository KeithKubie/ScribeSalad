00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
from each other and so what happened
 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.659 align:start position:0%
from each other and so what happened
yeah<00:06:11.310><c> so</c><00:06:11.850><c> then</c><00:06:12.060><c> they</c><00:06:12.270><c> made</c><00:06:12.570><c> mini</c><00:06:13.050><c> chromosomes</c>

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 align:start position:0%
yeah so then they made mini chromosomes
 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so then they made mini chromosomes

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 align:start position:0%
introduced these mini chromosomes now
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
introduced these mini chromosomes now
into<00:06:24.650><c> yeast</c><00:06:24.860><c> cells</c><00:06:25.069><c> now</c><00:06:25.520><c> they</c><00:06:25.759><c> could</c><00:06:25.969><c> be</c>

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 align:start position:0%

well since there was early observations
that<00:09:01.260><c> also</c><00:09:01.650><c> said</c><00:09:01.890><c> that</c><00:09:02.220><c> if</c><00:09:02.870><c> telomerase</c>

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:03.870 align:start position:0%
that also said that if telomerase
 

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.620 align:start position:0%
that also said that if telomerase

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
activity was compromised then cells
 

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.710 align:start position:0%
activity was compromised then cells
would<00:09:07.170><c> actually</c><00:09:07.740><c> age</c><00:09:08.040><c> or</c><00:09:08.610><c> senesce</c><00:09:09.000><c> in</c><00:09:09.270><c> culture</c>

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
would actually age or senesce in culture
 

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
would actually age or senesce in culture

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.090 align:start position:0%
so it was thought that maybe this is a
