00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.980 align:start position:0%
funny as I thought it was is the fact
that<00:16:07.380><c> they</c><00:16:07.529><c> went</c><00:16:07.740><c> with</c><00:16:07.829><c> the</c><00:16:07.920><c> ten</c><00:16:08.130><c> rings</c><00:16:08.990><c> that</c>

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
that they went with the ten rings that
 

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.780 align:start position:0%
that they went with the ten rings that
was<00:16:10.199><c> the</c><00:16:10.350><c> terrorist</c><00:16:10.649><c> group</c><00:16:10.920><c> in</c><00:16:11.040><c> the</c><00:16:11.130><c> first</c><00:16:11.519><c> one</c>

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:11.790 align:start position:0%
was the terrorist group in the first one
 

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
was the terrorist group in the first one
so<00:16:12.320><c> it's</c><00:16:13.320><c> just</c><00:16:13.500><c> weird</c><00:16:13.769><c> it</c><00:16:14.010><c> doesn't</c><00:16:14.160><c> seem</c><00:16:14.550><c> to</c>

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:14.730 align:start position:0%
so it's just weird it doesn't seem to
 

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.730 align:start position:0%
so it's just weird it doesn't seem to
have<00:16:14.820><c> a</c><00:16:14.850><c> connection</c><00:16:15.029><c> with</c><00:16:15.360><c> that</c><00:16:15.720><c> group</c><00:16:16.050><c> it's</c>

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
have a connection with that group it's
 

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the League of Shadows again the
dark<00:16:18.449><c> yeah</c><00:16:18.690><c> it</c><00:16:19.199><c> was</c><00:16:19.410><c> just</c><00:16:19.709><c> I</c><00:16:19.829><c> thought</c><00:16:20.100><c> that</c><00:16:20.250><c> was</c>

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:20.370 align:start position:0%
dark yeah it was just I thought that was
 

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
dark yeah it was just I thought that was
just<00:16:20.399><c> really</c><00:16:20.760><c> strange</c><00:16:21.360><c> is</c><00:16:21.570><c> like</c><00:16:21.690><c> okay</c><00:16:21.990><c> so</c>

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.050 align:start position:0%
just really strange is like okay so
 

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.540 align:start position:0%
just really strange is like okay so
we're<00:16:22.230><c> gonna</c><00:16:22.320><c> bring</c><00:16:22.529><c> the</c><00:16:22.680><c> ten</c><00:16:22.889><c> rings</c><00:16:23.160><c> up</c><00:16:23.339><c> again</c>

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:23.550 align:start position:0%
we're gonna bring the ten rings up again
 

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.980 align:start position:0%
we're gonna bring the ten rings up again
I<00:16:23.579><c> mean</c><00:16:23.730><c> it's</c><00:16:23.880><c> obvious</c><00:16:24.360><c> when</c><00:16:24.540><c> they</c><00:16:24.600><c> wrote</c><00:16:24.779><c> Iron</c>

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:24.990 align:start position:0%
I mean it's obvious when they wrote Iron
 

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
I mean it's obvious when they wrote Iron
Man<00:16:25.139><c> 1</c><00:16:25.350><c> they</c><00:16:25.560><c> did</c><00:16:25.800><c> not</c><00:16:25.949><c> think</c><00:16:26.250><c> the</c><00:16:26.370><c> plot</c><00:16:26.550><c> was</c>

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:26.730 align:start position:0%
Man 1 they did not think the plot was
 

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.269 align:start position:0%
Man 1 they did not think the plot was
gonna<00:16:26.850><c> go</c><00:16:27.029><c> in</c><00:16:27.149><c> the</c><00:16:27.209><c> direction</c><00:16:27.360><c> that</c><00:16:27.630><c> 3</c><00:16:28.079><c> did</c><00:16:28.290><c> but</c>

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
gonna go in the direction that 3 did but
 

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
gonna go in the direction that 3 did but
by<00:16:29.459><c> using</c><00:16:29.670><c> the</c><00:16:29.910><c> Tim</c><00:16:30.089><c> rings</c><00:16:30.269><c> again</c><00:16:30.480><c> I</c><00:16:30.570><c> was</c><00:16:30.690><c> like</c>

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:30.810 align:start position:0%
by using the Tim rings again I was like
 

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.329 align:start position:0%
by using the Tim rings again I was like
yeah<00:16:30.959><c> this</c><00:16:31.079><c> just</c><00:16:31.290><c> seems</c><00:16:31.529><c> kind</c><00:16:31.740><c> of</c><00:16:31.800><c> lazy</c><00:16:32.010><c> to</c><00:16:32.250><c> me</c>

00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
