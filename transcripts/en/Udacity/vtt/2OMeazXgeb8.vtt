SEBASTIAN: I am firmly convinced that in the future the majority of urban transportation

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740
will take place in the air.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.460
NICHOLAS: It's something that we as society have
wanted for over a hundred years.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.960
Little kids grow up drawing pictures of
flying cars, building them out of Lego,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.980
and dream of having their own one day

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.890
SEBASTIAN: We called it flying cars because it's
our aspiration; we really want to change

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
the world with flight. It might start with
your Amazon and Google package delivery

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.600
but it's going to go to people.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.040
NICHOLAS: We're already seeing it happen with
self-driving cars.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.240
We're already seeing it happen with little drones.
These different kinds of technology

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.540
are enabling new kinds of transportation. We are going to cover drone technology

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.420
at a variety levels we're going to spend some time
talking, obviously, about the higher level

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.500
autonomy and the mission planning. Really
what this course is about is giving students

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.800
the chance to implement algorithms and ideas
and technical concepts on aircraft.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.070
What we want to do is we're gonna try and make that future happen sooner by training future

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.260
engineers in the technologies needed to
make that vision happen. Udacity is a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.150
great starting point for anybody who
wants to learn more about these

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.440
technologies more about this application
domain and more about flying vehicles.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.780
SEBASTIAN: This is something that no one talks
about, but I promise, in a few years time,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.860
this'll be one of the hottest topics on the planet.
So come to the skies with us by applying

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.830
to the world's first flying car
Nanodegree program.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.280
