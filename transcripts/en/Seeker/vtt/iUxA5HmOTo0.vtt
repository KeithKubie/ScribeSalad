00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.350
What happens to satellites when they're no
longer useful?

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:12.430
We can't shoot them down, so we've got to
crash them SOMEWHERE!

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.130
Greetings programs, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.130
Did you see that lunar eclipse couple weeks
ago?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.130
Real pretty, right?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.089
What you probably DIDN'T know, was during
the eclipse a there was a plan to crash a

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.779
dying satellite.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.409
NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment
Explorer, or LADEE, was launched eight months

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.679
ago with a hundred-day lifespan.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.230
It's the size of a large refrigerator, and
was sampling the thin atmosphere of our moon.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.980
But once its mission ended, then what?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
NASA scientists decided the best thing to
do was CRASH IT INTO THE MOON.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.170
They set up the orbit before the lunar eclipse,
in case LADEE didn't survive the lack of sunlight

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.440
and extreme cold in the Earth's shadow.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.310
This is not the first moon crash we've had.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.580
LADEE is the newest, to join the growing space
scrapyard on the far side of the moon.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.120
When the Ranger 4 lunar probe crashed due
to computer failure, it became the first satellite

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.490
to spend the rest of time on the far side
of the moon.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.260
We've never landed anything over there, so
it's just dead stuff.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.890
According to Space.com, there are six confirmed
crashes on the far side of the moon.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.259
Five American sats and one 'lil fella from
Japan; but there could be more! India, Japan,

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.880
the Soviet Union and the United States all
lost or left bits of space junk orbiting our

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.539
moon from past missions -- all of which could
have crashed on the far side.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.899
If you include the FACING side of the moon,
there's 71 different sites with leftover bits

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.619
of equipment from us, the Soviets, Japan,
India, China, and the European Space Agency

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.249
spanning the late 50s to this decade.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.750
We're not HURTING the moon, the far side has
been pummelled with things far larger than

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.049
LADEE, but is it wise to start a lunar landfill?

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.619
What else could we have done with old equipment?

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.049
It's not as if satellites biodegrade in space,
so the most common plan with orbiters is to

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.700
decay their orbit until they burn up in the
atmosphere, or crash.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.920
Sometimes, like with most satellites around
Earth, it works perfectly.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.620
But other times, like with Skylab in 1979,
giant chunks make it through the atmosphere

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.860
and crash on the surface -- in Skylab's case
parts were recovered in the Australian Outback.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.170
Earth and the Moon aren't the only planets
under attack from human space junk.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.600
Mariner 10 has been orbiting the sun since
it's mission ended in 1975.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.060
Messenger is planned to crash into Mercury
when it's mission is completed.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.460
Venus has Soviet Venera probes all over it's
surface.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.990
Mars is super popular, and tends to eats satellites
as snacks...

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.940
More missions have been attempted to Mars
than anywhere else, with more failures.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.060
25 missions from Earth to Mars have ended
in failure, yikes.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.310
And that's just the inner planets.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.090
We've sent probes to every planet and many
of their moons, with each of them crashing,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090
continuing to orbit their targets, or, like
Voyager heading out into deep space.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.090
Though low-flying satellites like GPS or surveillance
satellites burn up, DirecTV and other communications

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.090
sats fly MUCH higher.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.090
It's not feasible for them to get burned up,
so instead the FCC requires those satellites

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.090
be put into a graveyard orbit.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.090
It's basically an orbiting junkyard, high
enough to be out of the way of newer satellites.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.090
They just... sort of... hang out there.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.090
Unless they explode of course... but that's
another story.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.090
What SHOULD we be doing with these old satellites?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.090
Are you worried about being smacked with one?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.090
Share your fears with us down in the comments,
guys and if you and your fellow humans have

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.400
a great idea for how to safely recycle old
satellites, tell us on Twitter at-DNews or

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
at-TraceDominguez.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.810
When I think of what some of these satellites
have done for mankind, taking pictures of

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
the surface of venus, and getting up-close
and personal with Saturn and Neptune -- I

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.000
feel this amazing sense of wonder.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.850
Similar to how I feel with watching Jason
Silva in Shots of Awe, this guy is a deep

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:48.390
thinker check it out.
